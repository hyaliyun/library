He has performed for over 30 years with many well-known Australian and New Zealand artists, principally as a guitarist, and has contributed music for several Australian movie soundtracks. Early career Den Elzen spent his early life in Boort and Mansfield (Victoria) and started playing guitar at about 10 years of age. At the age of 15, he was performing in Melbourne with the band Expresso Bongo, who made it to the finals of the Channel 9 TV talent competition \\"Safeway New Faces\\". He co-founded local bands Notorious Gentlemen and The U-Boats, and did recording studio session work. At age 19, he joined Broderick Smith for his first solo album and toured in his band for about three years. He went on to perform with Venetta Fields; with Tim Finn as a guitarist on his 1985 Big Canoe tour; and with Stephen Cummings on his \\"This Wonderful Life\\" album, and Australian and US tours. In the mid 80s, den Elzen formed Melbourne band Schnell Fenster with ex-Split Enz members Phil Judd, Nigel Griggs and Noel Crombie. They released two albums, \\"The Sound of Trees\\" and \\"OK Alright A Huh Oh Yeah\\" and toured in Australia and New Zealand. 1990s After the breakup of Schnell Fenster, den Elzen played on and co-produced Deborah Conway's 1991 successful String of Pearls album. He went to America to perform for Peter Case on Six-Pack of Love (The band on the album includes producer and keyboardist Mitchell Froom, bassist Bruce Thomas (Elvis Costello and The Attractions) and drummer Gary Mallaber (Van Morrison, Steve Miller Band). He recorded and toured as bass player and musical director with Tim Finn on Finn's 1993 album Before and After; and toured and recorded with Richard Pleasance; and then toured and recorded with Melbourne band Rebecca's Empire for their Way of All Things album. At the end of the 1990s, he joined Australian rock outfit Deadstar co-producing their final album Somewhere Over The Radio. Soundtracks Den Elzen started doing music for films in the 80s, the first being As The Mirror Burns (1990 release date). He worked with Phil Judd and Schnell Fenster on the soundtrack for the movie Rikky and Pete (1988), and was also involved with Phil Judd on the soundtrack for The Big Steal (1990) and Mr. Reliable (1996). Three Schnell Fenster songs feature in the Jane Campion film Sweetie (1989). He did the soundtrack to David Batty's Rodeo Road (1999) which led to producing, recording, and co- writing the music for the TV series Bush Mechanics (2001) in Yuendumu about 300 km north-west of Alice Springs, and the soundtracks to other David Batty films, Sisters, Pearls and Mission Girls (2003) and Taylor Made (2003), as well as the TV series Inventions From The Shed (2005), all aired on the ABC. Den Elzen also worked on a project with painter and artist David Munro called Birdbrain, whose music was used in the TV series The Secret Life of Us and in the film Ghosts of the Civil Dead (1988).

He served as the Principal Conductor of the Royal Ballet from 1959 to 1972, Principal Conductor of the Australian Ballet from 1972 to 1977, and Musical Director of the American Ballet Theatre from 1978 to 1980. Although he resigned from the position of Principal Conductor of the Royal Ballet in 1972, he continued to conduct regularly for the Company until 2001. Lanchbery worked with Sir Frederick Ashton, Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev in addition to his lifelong friends Peter Stanley Lyons and Kenneth Spring. Lanchbery was widely considered (including by Nureyev) to be the greatest ballet conductor of his time, and to be ‚Äòa conductor and music director of unmatched experience‚Äô who was ‚Äòdirectly responsible for raising the status and the standards of musical performance'. Maina Gielgud, Artistic Director of Australian Ballet, stated that \\"He [Lanchbery] is not only the finest conductor for dance of his generation and probably well beyond\\". One critic wrote that ‚Äòthe music was always on its best behaviour‚Äô when Lanchbery was conducting. He was also famous for his re- adaptation of canonical works. Early life Born in London on 15 May 1923, Lanchbery began violin lessons when eight years of age, and at the same age he started composing. He was educated at Alleyn's School, where he formed a lifetime friendship and collaborative partnership with Peter Stanley Lyons,Obituary of Peter Stanley Lyons, Rutland and Stamford Mercury, Friday, 20 April 2007 later a famous chorister and choral conductor, and Kenneth Spring, founder of the National Youth Theatre, whose mother was a composer and encouraged Lanchbery's musical talent.John Lanchbery, 'Ken Spring obituary', Edward Alleyn Club Magazine (Spring 1998). In 1942 he was awarded the Henry Smart Composition Scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied under Sir Henry Wood until his studies were interrupted by the war, during which he served in the Royal Armoured Corps. After the war, Lanchbery spent two more years at the RAM. He then returned to Alleyn's School as the second music master, hoping to be offered the position of Director of Music: when the job failed to materialise, he left to work for a music publisher. Musical career =Conductor of London Metropolitan Ballet and Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet: 1948 - 1959= While Lanchbery working in the music press, he was recommended to apply for the post of Conductor of the Metropolitan Ballet. He obtained the position and made his debut with them at Edinburgh in 1948. Two years later the orchestra collapsed for lack of funds. However, working with choreographer Celia Franca, Lanchbery wrote The Eve of St Agnes (the story was based on John Keats' poem of the same name), one of the first commissioned ballets to be shown on BBC television. He composed film scores for Eric Robinson before joining the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet (later the Royal Ballet touring company) in 1951, with whom he proceeded to orchestrate, in 1953, the first professional ballet choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan: Somnambulism whose music was composed with music by Stan Kenton. Lanchbery also orchestrated The House of Birds (La Casa de los P√°jaros) in 1955, with original music by Federico Mompou. =Principal Conductor of Royal Ballet: 1959 - 1972= He served as Principal Conductor of the Royal Bellet from 1959 from 1972. He arranged La fille mal gard√©e (original music by Ferdinand H√©rold and others), to choreography by Frederick Ashton, for the Royal Ballet in 1960. Lanchbery's delightful re-working also included some Donizetti and much of his own invention. This work includes the famous Clog Dance used for many years as a theme tune for Home This Afternoon on BBC radio. In addition to the revenue from his recordings, Lanchbery had his income supplemented by the copyright he earned from his orchestral arrangements, which were used by ballet companies all over the world. With Aston, he composed The Two Pigeons; A Month in the Country; and The Dream, one of the most critically acclaimed ballet versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream. In 1966 Rudolf Nureyev asked Lanchbery to re-write Ludwig Minkus's Don Quixote. Although he resigned from the position of Director of the Royal Ballet in 1972, he continued to conduct regularly for the Company until 2001. =Principal Conductor of Australian Ballet: 1972 - 1977= Notable successes for Lanchbery included the arrangement of the Liszt music for Kenneth MacMillan's stormy multi-act Mayerling, which premiered at Covent Garden in 1978, and the arrangement of the Franz Leh√°r score for the first full-length ballet production of The Merry Widow for the Australian Ballet in 1976. In 1970 he arranged the score for the ballet film The Tales of Beatrix Potter. His sources were many and varied, including the operas of Michael William Balfe and Arthur Sullivan.Sullivan's contribution included \\"O turn thine eyes away\\" from The Beauty Stone. He also arranged the music and conducted the orchestra for Nijinsky in 1980. Lanchbery was the first to convert operas into ballets (The Tales of Hoffmann, The Merry Widow, Die Fledermaus), and he also wrote music for some British films of the 1960s, including Deadly Nightshade (1953) and Colonel March Investigates (1955). He was involved in The Turning Point (1977), starring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne, and his score for Evil Under the Sun (1982) was based on songs by Cole Porter, a memorable rendition of \\"You're The Top\\" by Diana Rigg. He also wrote scores for two silent film classics: D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation and John Ford's The Iron Horse. =Director of American Ballet Theatre: 1978 - 1980= The American Ballet Theatre used 14 Lanchbery arrangements between 1962 and 2002: he was the Musical Director of the Company between 1978 and 2002. Their productions included his arrangement, for Natalia Makarova, Minkus's La Bayad√®re in 1980. Lanchbery arranged more than 30 pieces by Franz Liszt for Macmillan's Mayerling, which premiered at Covent Garden in 1978, and arranged another successful re-working of Minkus for Nureyev's production of La Bayad√®re in 1991. Nureyev considered Lanchbery to be the greatest conductor of his time, but critics who disliked innovation disliked Lanchbery's tampering with original scores.Rodney Stenning Edgecombe: \\"It had been [Frederick] Ashton's good fortune to have Constant Lambert as his mentor in his early career, but his later years were dominated by a musical butcher called John Lanchbery.\\" The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts edited by Mark Thornton Burnett, Adrian Streete, Ramona Wray. Edinburgh University Press, 2011: page 211 Visiting conductor In addition to London, Australia, and Sweden, Lanchbery was a guest conductor at many of the world's leading opera houses, including Paris, Stockholm, Rio de Janeiro, New York and Houston. He also toured Japan, Russia and China. He received honours from Russia and Sweden. Honours Lanchbery was the first non-Soviet conductor to receive the Bolshoi Medal. He also received the Carina Ari Medal and the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award, Britain's highest professional award. In 1990 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Personal life Lanchbery married a Sadler's Wells principal Elaine Fifield in 1951. They had a daughter, Margaret Lanchbery, and divorced in 1960: Elaine died in 1999. Lanchbery became an Australian citizen in 2002, making his home in Melbourne, where he died on 27 February 2003. He was survived by his daughter, Margaret, of Melbourne, and his companion, Thomas Han. He was a member of the Garrick Club.Garrick Club, London, Official Newsletter, 2011 Works Some of the most popular ballets are arrangements of works written for a different purpose. Perhaps the best-known is Alexander Glazunov's arrangement of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's piano music into the ballet Les Sylphides. Another famous example is La Boutique fantasque, an arrangement of Gioachino Rossini's music by Ottorino Respighi in 1919. However, Lanchbery was the most successful and prolific arranger of music for ballet. * Title ‚Äì original composer * Tales of Beatrix Potter ‚Äì Michael William Balfe and others, but also included much original music by Lanchbery * The Hunchback of Notre Dame ‚Äì Hector Berlioz * A Month in the Country ‚Äì Fr√©d√©ric Chopin * Peer Gynt ‚Äì Edvard Grieg (based on his Peer Gynt incidental music) * La fille mal gard√©e ‚Äì Ferdinand H√©rold * Somnambulism ‚Äì Stan Kenton * The Merry Widow ‚Äì Franz Leh√°r * Mayerling ‚Äì Franz Liszt * Dracula ‚Äì Liszt * The Dream ‚Äì Felix Mendelssohn * Don Quixote ‚Äì Ludwig Minkus * La Bayad√®re ‚Äì Minkus * Grand Pas Classique from Paquita ‚Äì Minkus * House of Birds ‚Äì Federico Mompou * The Tales of Hoffmann ‚Äì Jacques Offenbach * Le Papillon ‚Äì Offenbach * Cleopatra ‚Äì Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov * Monotones ‚Äì Erik Satie * Rosalinda ‚Äì Johann Strauss II (based on Die Fledermaus) * Designs with Strings ‚Äì Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (based on his Piano Trio in A minor) * The Snow Maiden ‚Äì Tchaikovsky Lanchbery's works included supporting tertiary students: during a 1976 visit to Australia, Lanchbery conducted the 27th Intervarsity Choral Festival choir performing Rossini's Petite messe solennelle and Gaudeamus igitur in Hobart.

Its first instance, the original LPMud game driver, was developed in 1989 by Lars Pensj√∂ (hence the LP in LPMud). LPMud was innovative in its separation of the MUD infrastructure into a virtual machine (known as the driver) and a development framework written in the LPC programming language (known as the mudlib). Motivation Pensj√∂ had been an avid player of TinyMUD and AberMUD. He wanted to create a world with the flexibility of TinyMUD and the style of AberMUD. Furthermore, he did not want to have sole responsibility for creating and maintaining the game world. He once said, \\"I didn't think I would be able to design a good adventure. By allowing wizards coding rights, I thought others could help me with this.\\" The result was the creation of a new, C-based, object-oriented programming language, LPC, that made it simple for people with minimal programming skills to add elements like rooms, weapons, and monsters to a virtual world. To accomplish his goal, Lennart Augustsson convinced Pensj√∂ to write what today would be called a virtual machine, the LPMud driver. The driver managed the interpretation of LPC code as well as providing basic operating system services to the LPC code. By virtue of this design, Pensj√∂ made it more difficult for common programming errors like infinite loops and infinite recursion made by content builders to harm the overall stability of the server. His choice of an OO approach made it easy for new programmers to concentrate on the task of \\"building a room\\" rather than programming logic. Evolution of LPMuds Pensj√∂'s interest in LPMuds eventually waned in the early 1990s, but by that time LPMud had become one of the most popular forms of MUD. His work has been extended or reverse engineered in a number of projects: * LPMud 2.4.5 * CD LPMud driver * LPMud 3.1.2 * LPMud 3.2, better known as the Amylaar driver, after its lead developer, J√∂rn \\"Amylaar\\" Rennecke * MudOS * DGD, Dworkin's Game Driver, a conceptual rather than code derivative of LPMud developed by Felix \\"Dworkin\\" Croes * LDMud, a fork of LPMud 3.2 by Lars D√ºning * UriMUD, a derivative of LPMud 2.4.5 * FluffOS, Discworld MUD's fork of MudOS * SWLPC, Shattered World's fork of LPMud 2.4.5 * Psyclpc, a fork of LDMud * The Pike programming language, written by Fredrik \\"Profezzorn\\" H√ºbinette, along with its predecessors LPC4 and ¬µLPC The LPMud approach also enabled the development of gaming frameworks built in LPC that game builders could use as the foundation for their worlds. The original mudlib was the Genesis Mudlib that came with LPMud drivers up to LPMud 2.4.5. As LPMud matured, the separation between driver and mudlib grew to the point that the developers of MudOS and DGD did not ship their drivers with fully functional mudlibs. Popular LPMud mudlibs include: * Discworld Mudlib from the Discworld MUD * CDlib from Genesis LPMud * Nightmare Mudlib from Nightmare LPMud * TMI Mudlib from The Mud Institute * Lima Mudlib from Lima Bean * Dead Souls Mudlib * Sapidlib, known at one time as the LPUniversity Mudlib Though an LPMud server can be used to implement nearly any style of game, LPMuds are often thought of as having certain common characteristics as a genre, such as a mixture of hack and slash with role- playing, quests as an element of advancement, and \\"guilds\\" as an alternative to character classes. Notable early LPMud games still in operation as of 2010 include Pensj√∂'s original Genesis LPMud as well as 3Kingdoms, Ancient Anguish, BatMUD, Darker Realms, DartMUD, Genocide, Lost Souls, NannyMUD, Nanvaent, ZombieMUD, Shattered World and Xyllomer. LPMud talkers LPMud was used as the basis for the first Internet talker, Cat Chat, which opened in 1990. TMI Mudlib The TMI Mudlib from The Mud Institute was an attempt to create a framework driven mudlib for the MudOS LPMud driver. It consisted of many contributors to MudOS as well as people who became influential in the LPMud community. When TMI began work in 1992, a mudlib was generally packaged with both an LPMud driver and a complete world built on top of the mudlib. As a framework-driven mudlib, the goal of the TMI mudlib was to provide only examples for world objects and place the burden of building a working world on the game developers using TMI. TMI implemented the first InterMUD communications network, when MudOS added network socket support in 1992. TMI never realized its vision and shut down. It was quickly followed, however, by TMI-2. Unlike TMI, TMI-2 was somewhat independent of the driver team. It leveraged elements of the original TMI mudlib and eventually released a somewhat workable product. Though it never achieved the success of its sibling the Nightmare Mudlib (also based on the original TMI mudlib), it did influence many developers, and the lessons learned with TMI-2 led to the successes of the Lima Mudlib. In 1992, MIRE, a multi-user information system producing customised newspapersElectronic Publishing Group at the MIT Media Lab. 25+ Years of the Electronic Publishing Group \\"MIRE--news in a MUD\\" was built based on a modified TMI driver. In 1993, the TMI-2 mudlib was used to create PangaeaMud, an academic research project designed as an interactive geologic database tool. Though Lima took lessons from TMI-2, Lima is a completely independent codebase. TMI-2 is still available, and often used as a learning tool, but not typically used today for new LPMud development. Notable MUDs based on TMI-derived mudlibs include The Two Towers set in Tolkien‚Äôs universe and Threshold.

As a member of Congress, Owen successfully pushed through the bill that established Smithsonian Institution and served on the Institution's first Board of Regents. Owen also served as a delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850 and was appointed as U.S. charg√© d'affaires (1853‚Äì58) to Naples. Owen was a knowledgeable exponent of the socialist doctrines of his father, Robert Owen, and managed the day-to-day operation of New Harmony, Indiana, the socialistic utopian community he helped establish with his father in 1825. Throughout his adult life, Robert Dale Owen wrote and published numerous pamphlets, speeches, books, and articles that described his personal and political views, including his belief in spiritualism. Owen co-edited the New-Harmony Gazette with Frances Wright in the late 1820s in Indiana and the Free Enquirer in the 1830s in New York City. Owen was an advocate of married women's property and divorce rights, secured inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided tax-supported funding for a uniform system of free public schools, and established the position of Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. Owen is also noted for a series of open letters he wrote in 1862 that favored the abolition of slavery and supported general emancipation, as well as a suggestion that the federal government should provide assistance to freedmen. Early life and education Robert Dale Owen was born on November 7, 1801, in Glasgow, Scotland, to Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale and Robert Owen. His mother was the daughter of David Dale, a Scottish textile manufacturer; his Welsh-born father became part-owner and manager of the New Lanark Mills, his father-in-law's textile mill at New Lanark, Scotland. See also: See also: Robert Dale was the eldest surviving son of eight children; his younger siblings (three brothers and three sister) were William, Ann (or Anne) Caroline, Jane Dale, David Dale, Richard Dale, and Mary.Estabrook, pp. 72, 80, 83. Owen grew up in Braxfield, Scotland, and was privately tutored before he was sent at the age of sixteen to Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg's school at Hofwyl, Switzerland. The Swiss school exposed Owen to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi's method of education. After completing his formal education, Owen returned to Scotland to join his father in the textile business at New Lanark.Estabrook, p. 72. See also: Owen's father, a successful textile manufacturer and philanthropist, became a noted socialist reformer whose vision of social equality included, among other projects, the establishment of experimental utopian communities in the United States and the United Kingdom.Estabrook, p. 68. Robert Dale Owen, who shared many of his father's views on social issues immigrated to the United States in 1825, became a U.S. citizen, and helped his father manage the socialistic community at New Harmony, Indiana. Owen's three surviving brothers (William, David, and Richard) and his sister, Jane, also immigrated to the United States and became residents of New Harmony.Estabrook, pp. 72‚Äì73. Early career Between 1825 and 1828, Owen managed the day-to-day operations of the socialistic community at New Harmony, Indiana, while his father returned to Britain to resume his social reform and philanthropic work in Europe.Estabrook, p. 72. In addition to his other work, Owen and Frances Wright, a wealthy, Scottish philanthropist and radical reformer, published articles in the New-Harmony Gazette, the town's liberal weekly newspaper, and served as its co-editors. Established in 1825, the Gazette was one of Indiana's earliest newspapers; however, it ceased publications in February 1829.Pitzer, \\"Why New Harmony is World Famous,\\" p. 13.Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 11. After the New Harmony utopian community dissolved in 1827, Owen traveled in Europe before returning to the United States in 1829. During this period Owen wrote Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question (1830), a controversial pamphlet on the topic of population control.Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 145. It was the first book in the United States to advocate birth control.Pitzer, \\"Why New Harmony is World Famous,\\" p. 12.Pancoast and Lincoln, pp. 19‚Äì20. Owen moved to New York City, where he and Wright co-edited the weekly Free Enquirer until 1831‚Äì32. As they had done in the New Harmony Gazette, the Free Enquirer continued to express their radical views on a variety of subjects, including abolition of slavery, women's rights, universal suffrage, free public education, birth control, and religion. Owen returned to New Harmony, Indiana, in 1833, after he and Wright discontinued their editorship of the New York newspaper. Marriage and family Owen and Mary Jane Robinson were married before a justice of the peace on April 12, 1832, in New York City. After an extended trip to Europe, they relocated to New Harmony, Indiana. The couple had six children, two of whom died at an early age. Their surviving children were Florence (b. 1836), Julian Dale (b. 1837), Ernest (b. 1838), and Rosamond (b. 1843).Estabrook, pp. 73‚Äì78.Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 23. On June 23, 1876, five years after the death of his first wife, Owen married Lottie Walton Kellogg at Caldwell, New York; he died a year later. Politician and statesman =Working Men's Party leader= During 1829‚Äì30, Owen became an active leader in the Working Men's Party in New York City. In contrast to other Democrats of the era, Owen was opposed to slavery, although his radical partisanship distanced him from the leading abolitionists of the era. =Indiana legislator= After Owen's return to New Harmony, Indiana, in 1833, he became active in state politics. Owen served in the Indiana House of Representatives (1835‚Äì38; 1851‚Äì53). He distinguished himself as an influential member of the Indiana General Assembly during his first term by securing appropriations for the state's tax-supported public school system. In addition, Owen was instrumental in introducing legislation and argued in support of widows and married women's property rights, but the bill was defeated. He also proposed laws granting women greater freedom of divorce. In addition to serving in the state legislature, Owen was elected as a delegate from Posey County, Indiana, to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850.Estabrook, pp. 72‚Äì74. At the convention, Owen initiated a proposal to include provisions for women's property rights in the state constitution. Although it was not approved, this early effort to protect women's rights led to later laws that were passed to secure women's property, divorce, and voting rights.Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 22. One of Owen's lasting legacies was his authorship and efforts to secure the inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided state funding for a uniform system of common schools that are free and open to all and established the office of the state's superintendent of public instruction.Pancoast and Lincoln, pp. 56‚Äì57. =U.S. Congressman= After his first term in the Indiana legislature and two unsuccessful campaigns for election to the U.S. Congress in 1838 and in 1840, Owen was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1842. He served from 1843 to 1847 in the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses. Owen was chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals during the Twenty- eighth Congress. He was also involved in the debates about the annexation of Texas and an Oregon boundary dispute in 1844 that led to the establishment of the U.S-British boundary at the 49th parallel north, the result of the Oregon Treaty (1846).Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 40‚Äì41. While serving as a member of Congress, Owen introduced and helped to secure passage of the bill that founded the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. Owen was appointed to the Smithsonian Institution's first Board of Regents and chaired its Building Committee, which oversaw the construction of the Smithsonian Institution Building in Washington, D.C., and recommended James Renwick, Jr. as architect, James Dixson and Gilbert Cameron as the contractors, and the Seneca Quarry for its distinct, dark-red sandstone.Hafertepe, pp. 17, 27, 37 Robert Dale Owen as he appeared in his later years. Owen, his brother David Dale Owen, and architect Robert Mills, were involved in developing preliminary plans for the Smithsonian Building. These early plans influenced Renwick's choice of the Romanesque Revival architectural style (sometimes referred to as Norman-style architecture) and his three-story design for the building, which was finally selected, although not without controversy.Hafertepe, p. 47, 60‚Äì61. Owen's book Hints on Public Architecture (1849) argued the case for the suitability of Renwick's Romanesque Revival (Norman) architectural style for public buildings such as the Smithsonian \\"Castle,\\" which he discussed in detail. Seven full-page illustrations and details of the building's architectural elements were prominently featured in the book, leading some to criticize Owen for his bias toward Renwick and his preference for Norman-style architecture over other popular styles.Hafertepe, pp. 83‚Äì84. =U.S. diplomat= Owen was defeated in his bid for re-election to Congress in 1846; however, he remained active in public service and was once again elected to serve in the Indiana General Assembly. On May 24, 1853, while Owen was serving as a state legislator in Indiana, President Franklin Pierce appointed him as U.S. minister (Charg√© d'Affaires and Minister Resident) to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at Naples. Owen served in the diplomatic post until September 20, 1858, and then retired from political life, although he remained actively interested in public affairs and social reform issues. =Other political activities= During the American Civil War, Owen served in the Ordnance Commission to supply the Union army; on March 16, 1863, he was appointed to the Freedman's Inquiry Commission. The commission was a predecessor to the Freedmen's Bureau.Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 91. In 1862 Owen wrote a series of open letters to U.S. government officials, including President Abraham Lincoln and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, to encourage them to support general emancipation. Owen's letter of July 23, 1862, was published in the New York Evening Post on August 8, 1862, and his letter of September 12, 1862, was published in the same newspaper on September 22, 1862. In another open letter that Owen wrote to President Lincoln on September 17, 1862, he urged the president to abolish slavery on moral grounds. Owen also believed that emancipation would weaken the Confederate forces and help the Union army win the war. On September 23, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary version of the Emancipation ProclamationPancoast and Lincoln, pp. 87‚Äì89, and note 15, p. 135. (as he had first resolved to do in mid-July). In Emancipation is Peace, a pamphlet that Owen wrote in 1863, he confirmed his view that general emancipation was a means to end the war. In The Wrong of Slavery, the Right of Emancipation, and the Future of the African Race in the United States, a report that Owen wrote in 1864, he also suggested that the Union should provide assistance to freedmen. Toward the end of his political career, Owen continued his effort to obtain federal voting rights for women. In 1865 he submitted an initial draft for a proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would not restrict voting rights to males. However, Article XIV, Section 2, in the final version of the Amendment, which became part of the U.S. Constitution in 1868, was modified to limit suffrage to males who were U.S. citizens over the age of twenty-one. Spiritualism In The authenticity of the Bible (1833), Owen remarked : > For a century and a half, then, after Jesus' death, we have no means > whatever of substantiating even the existence of the Gospels, as now bound > up in the New Testament. There is a perfect blank of 140 years; and a most > serious one it is. Like his father, Owen converted to Spiritualism and was the author of two books on the subject: Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World (1859) and The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next (1872).Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 100. Later years Although he retired from active public service at the conclusion of his work as a member of the Freedman's commission on May 15, 1864, Owen continued his writing career.Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 98‚Äì99. Major writing projects in retirement included Beyond the Breakers (1870), a novel;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 149. The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next (1871), one of his two books on spiritualism; and Threading My Way (1874), his autobiography. Owen also wrote several articles that were published in the Atlantic Monthly and Scribner's Monthly.Pancoast and Lincoln, pp. 149‚Äì50. In 1875 Owen suffered a mental breakdown that was severe enough for him to be hospitalized at the Indiana Hospital for the Insane in Indianapolis, where he underwent three months of treatment. Owen recovered from the illness, was released from the hospital, and resumed writing.Pancoast and Lincoln, pp. 104‚Äì5. On June 23, 1876, a year before his death, Owen married Lottie Walton Kellogg at Caldwell, New York. Death and legacy On June 24, 1877, Owen died at his summer home at Crosbyville on Lake George, New York. Initially he was buried in the town of Lake George in Warren County, New York. Later, his remains were exhumed and interred at New Harmony, Indiana, beside his first wife, Mary Jane Owen. One of Owen's most significant legacies in Indiana was to secure the inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided tax-supported funding for a uniform system of free public schools and established the position of Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. His early efforts to protect women's rights were another of his political legacies. Although he was unsuccessful in adding provisions to protect women's rights to Indiana's state constitution of 1851, his efforts paved the way for others to follow. Eventually, Indiana laws granted women's property and voting rights, as well as greater freedom in divorce. As a U.S. Congressman, Owen introduced federal legislation that founded the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. He was also a member of the Smithsonian Institution's first Board of Regents and its Building Committee. His vision for the Smithsonian Institution Building, along with the preliminary plans and suggestions made by his brother, David Dale Owen, and architect Robert Mills, influenced architect James Renwick Jr.'s design for the Romanesque Revival-style building in Washington, D.C. Owen's impact on the issues of slavery and emancipation is less direct. In a series of open letters he wrote in 1862 and in publications that followed, Owen encouraged the abolition of slavery on moral grounds, supported general emancipation, and suggested that the federal government should provide assistance to freedmen. Some historians have concluded that these open letters and Civil War-era pamphlets \\"helped immeasurably to solidify public opinion\\" in favor of emancipation.Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 109. Honors and tributes The town of Dale, Indiana, was named in Owen's honor. In 1911, the women of Indiana dedicated a memorial to Owen on the grounds of the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis that included a bronze bust of the statesman created by New Castle, Indiana native Frances Goodwin. The bust of Owen disappeared in the early 1970s; only its pedestal remains.

She is best known for her collaborative work with Indo-Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta: Sidhwa wrote both the 1991 novel Ice Candy Man which served as the basis for Mehta's 1998 film Earth as well as the 2006 novel Water: A Novel on which is based Mehta's 2005 film Water. A documentary about Sidhwa's life called \\"Bapsi: Silences of My Life\\" is currently in production and is expected to release 2021. Background Sidhwa was born to Gujarati Parsi Zoroastrian parents Peshotan and Tehmina Bhandara in Karachi and later moved with her family to Lahore. She was two when she contracted polio (which has affected her throughout her life) and nine in 1947 at the time of Partition (facts which would shape the character Lenny in her novel Cracking India as well as the background for her novel). She received her BA from Kinnaird College for Women in Lahore in 1957. She married at the age of 19 and moved to Bombay for five years before she divorced and remarried in Lahore with her present husband Noshir who is also Zoroastrian. She had three children in Pakistan before beginning her career as an author. One of her children is Mohur Sidhwa, who is a candidate for state representative in Arizona. She currently resides in Houston, US. She describes herself as a \\"Punjabi-Parsi-Pakistani\\". Her first language is Gujarati, her second language is Urdu, and her third language is English. She can read and write best in English, but she is more comfortable talking in Gujarati or Urdu, and often translates literally from Gujarati or Urdu to English. In an online interview to her Pakistani friend, Sadia Rehman, in August 2012 she said, \\"Feroza is closest to me and my views\\" about the identity issues of Pakistani Parsi immigrants to the US, their life-styles and their culture.

It was used as a rehabilitation centre for injured members of the British Armed Forces between 1985 and 2018. History and overview Headley Court was an Elizabethan farm house bought by the Cunliffe family, from Tyrrell's Wood, Leatherhead. They later sold this farm house and built in 1899 the imposing mansion at the centre of Headley Court to the north, namely under Lord Cunliffe, who was Chairman of the Bank of England.Headley Court - Grade II - Its architect was Edward Warren. During World War II, it was used as the Headquarters for the VII Corps and then for the Canadian Corps. Since the war, it has been used as a Royal Air Force and Joint Services medical rehabilitation centre.Walk in Tadworth During the war, nearby Headley Heath was used as a training ground for engineers building airstrips and trench systems then demolishing them again. Purchased after that war with money from the Royal Air Force Pilots and Crews Fund, a public collection as a tribute to the deeds, including the Battle of Britain efforts of the RAF, Headley Court lost its social club focus to expand its medical and rehabilitation credentials and become the Defence Services Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC), which aims to return all those service personnel injured or seriously ill to full fitness. During the 2002 UK Firefighter strike, two Green Goddess fire engines were based at RAF Headley Court. If called upon, the crews would have had to wait for Surrey Police to escort them to a fire. In November 2005, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited the centre. They met Major David Bradley of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment who had been given a five per cent chance of survival, after coming under fire from a Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher (RPG) in Basra, southern Iraq in 2004.Prince of Wales news Other notable patients in 2006/2007 include Sgt Mark Sutcliffe, The Royal Anglian Regiment, Sgt Stuart Pearson, 3 PARA and many others. In July 2014, the Minister of Defence, Philip Hammond, announced that the services provided by Headley Court would be transferred to a new centre to be developed at Stanford Hall. The opening of the new Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre by the Duke of Cambridge took place in June 2018. The centre at Headley Court ceased operations in September 2018 and the site was bought by Angle Property in May 2019. The plan was to redevelop the site including substantial new housing replacing many of the existing ancillary buildings. In April 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the site was offered to the National Health Service and on 4 May 2020 it was re-opened as the NHS Seacole Centre (in tribute to Mary Seacole and the BAME contribution to the NHS), aimed at treatment of non-critical Covid-19 patients and rehabilitation of Covid-19 patients. Facilities Headley Court Rehabilitation staff averaged around 200 per year from all three services' medical and nursing branches, the longest established here being Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service. These comprise specialist medical officers, nurses, remedial instructors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, a cognitive therapist, social workers, engineers, and administration support staff. Not only did the centre deal with patients with new physical disabilities but it also dealt with patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The rehabilitation areas of the unit consisted of hydrotherapy pools, gymnasiums, and workshops for prosthetics. The high, wooded countryside setting and grounds of the unit were welcomed by staff and those recovering; Headley Heath and the North Downs Way share the escarpment and there is a high concentration of woodland wildlife. The 28 bed Peter Long Ward had single showers and nursing staff on call 24 hours a day, internet access and a kitchen area with washing and drying facilities for clothing. A further large ward opened in September 2010 of 30 beds, rest areas and equipment. Headley Court was in need of further facilities, particularly a full size swimming pool, as patients had to share a leisure centre in Leatherhead.Disabled veterans jeered at swimming pool - Telegraph The charity Help for Heroes was set up in late 2007, with a first objective of raising money to build these facilities. A new gym, swimming pool and lower limbs treatment area opened within two years. With these new facilities, Headley Court enhanced its reputation as a world-leading centre of excellence for military rehabilitation until it ceased operations in late 2018.

Its roots go back to the original LPMud, Genesis LPMud, when Forelock of Genesis along with some students at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine founded Orlith in 1991. This MUD lasted only a year before forking into two rival MUDs, Nightmare and Phoenix. The final incarnation of Nightmare (meaning support for full player continuity) opened October 31, 1992, run by George \\"Descartes\\" Reese. It was hosted at \`nightmare.imaginary.com\`. There was one major revision in 1996 that required a conversion of players into Nightmare Mudlib's Nightmare IV format. Nightmare never charged players to play. The Nightmare world included multiple player administered city-states. The core city-state, Praxis, was destroyed in a recent clash among deities worshipped by various Nightmare religions. Each city-state was the home of one or more player races such as elves, humans, apskara, halflings, gnomes, ogres, artrell, fairies, and so on. In some cities, the races got along well; in others there was continuous strife. Player-killing was allowed, but with certain restrictions. Players on Nightmare elected to learn a specific profession that dictated the way they play the game. Professions like fighters were the traditional \\"hack-n-slash\\" while professions like fishers were not intended for combat. The base classes available were: fighter, rogue, cleric, mage, kataan, monk, bard, and fisher. Each class had a set of primary skills, which were used to increase the player's level, and secondary skills, which were not required but could still be beneficial to the player as they progressed. Additional character customization was available through joining a \\"guild\\"; available guilds included philosophers, witches, and druids, with secret guilds rumored to exist. When players attained higher levels, they could \\"double-class\\" and combine the skills and attributes of two classes. The MUD had an innovative biography feature that tracked the milestones of a character's life, providing each player with an individualized personal history. Influence on MUD development Nightmare LPMud was the development mud for the initial releases of the Nightmare Mudlib. From about 1992 until 1996, the Nightmare Mudlib was the most common base used in LPMud development. As a result of this influence, a number of later muds reflect elements of the Nightmare play style. Features and innovations included: * Limb-based combat (as opposed to pure hit-point based health) * Object permanence (when you logged out, you would return to the game in exactly the same state you left it) * In-game calendaring system * City-states Cessation of operations The server on which Nightmare ran had a catastrophic failure, and efforts to restore the MUD to operational mode failed, resulting in the MUD's demise.

The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc in which a mouth is fringed with tentacles. Although some species are solitary, most are colonial. The founding polyp settles and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body. Solitary corals can be as much as across but in colonial species the polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter. These polyps reproduce asexually by budding, but remain attached to each other, forming a multi-polyp colony of clones with a common skeleton, which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species. The shape and appearance of each coral colony depends not only on the species, but also on its location, depth, the amount of water movement and other factors. Many shallow-water corals contain symbiont unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues. These give their colour to the coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of symbiont it contains. Stony corals are closely related to sea anemones, and like them are armed with stinging cells known as cnidocytes. Corals reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most species release gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place, and the planula larvae drift as part of the plankton, but a few species brood their eggs. Asexual reproduction is mostly by fragmentation, when part of a colony becomes detached and reattaches elsewhere. Stony corals occur in all the world's oceans. Much of the framework of modern coral reefs is formed by scleractinians. Reef-building or hermatypic corals are mostly colonial; most of these are zooxanthellate and are found in the shallow waters into which sunlight penetrates. Other corals that do not form reefs may be solitary or colonial; some of these occur at abyssal depths where no light reaches. Stony corals first appeared in the Middle Triassic, but their relationship to the tabulate and rugose corals of the Paleozoic is currently unresolved. In modern times stony corals numbers are expected to decline due to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.Reef-Building Corals Lose Out to Softer Cousins Due To Global Warming March 24, 2013 Scientific American  Anatomy  Diagram showing a coral polyp, its corallite, coenosarc and coenosteum Scleractinian corals may be solitary or colonial. Colonies can reach considerable size, consisting of a large number of individual polyps. = Soft parts = Stony corals are members of the class Anthozoa and like other members of the group, do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle. The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles. The base of the polyp secretes the stony material from which the coral skeleton is formed. The body wall of the polyp consists of mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of epidermis. The mouth is at the centre of the oral disc and leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that fills the interior of the body and tentacles. Unlike other cnidarians however, the cavity is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, thin sheets of living tissue, known as mesenteries. The gonads are also located within the cavity walls. The polyp is retractable into the corallite, the stony cup in which it sits, being pulled back by sheet-like retractor muscles. The polyps are connected by horizontal sheets of tissue known as coenosarc extending over the outer surface of the skeleton and completely covering it. These sheets are continuous with the body wall of the polyps, and include extensions of the gastrovascular cavity, so that food and water can circulate between all the different members of the colony. In colonial species, the repeated asexual division of the polyps causes the corallites to be interconnected, thus forming the colonies. Also, cases exist in which the adjacent colonies of the same species form a single colony by fusing. Most colonial species have very small polyps, ranging from in diameter, although some solitary species may be as large as . = Skeleton = Diploria labyrinthiformis, a brain coral The skeleton of an individual scleractinian polyp is known as a corallite. It is secreted by the epidermis of the lower part of the body, and initially forms a cup surrounding this part of the polyp. The interior of the cup contains radially aligned plates, or septa, projecting upwards from the base. Each of these plates is flanked by a pair of mesenteries. The septa are secreted by the mesenteries, and are therefore added in the same order as the mesenteries are. As a result, septa of different ages are adjacent to one another, and the symmetry of the scleractinian skeleton is radial or biradial. This pattern of septal insertion is termed \\"cyclic\\" by paleontologists. By contrast, in some fossil corals, adjacent septa lie in order of increasing age, a pattern termed serial and produces a bilateral symmetry. Scleractinians secrete a stony exoskeleton in which the septa are inserted between the mesenteries in multiples of six. All modern scleractinian skeletons are composed of calcium carbonate in the form of crystals of aragonite, however, a prehistoric scleractinian (Coelosimilia) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite. The structure of both simple and compound scleractinians is light and porous, rather than solid as is the case in the prehistoric order Rugosa. Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion. = Growth = Meandering corallite walls of an intratentacular budding coral Separate corallites of an extratentacular budding species In colonial corals, growth results from the budding of new polyps. There are two types of budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp develops on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, as is the case in the meandroid corallites of brain corals. Extratentacular budding always results in separate polyps, each with its own corallite wall. In the case of bushy corals such as Acropora, lateral budding from axial polyps form the basis of the trunk and branches. The rate at which a stony coral colony lays down calcium carbonate depends on the species, but some of the branching species can increase in height or length by around a year (about the same rate as human hair grows). Other corals, like the dome and plate species, are more bulky and may only grow per year.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. The rate of aragonite deposition varies diurnally and seasonally. Examination of cross sections of coral can show bands of deposition indicating annual growth. Like tree rings, these can be used to estimate the age of the coral. Solitary corals do not bud. They gradually increase in size as they deposit more calcium carbonate and produce new whorls of septa. A large Ctenactis echinata for example normally has a single mouth, may be about long and have more than a thousand septa.  Distribution  Stony corals occur in all the world's oceans. There are two main ecological groups. Hermatypic corals are mostly colonial corals which tend to live in clear, oligotrophic, shallow tropical waters; they are the world's primary reef-builders. Ahermatypic corals are either colonial or solitary and are found in all regions of the ocean and do not build reefs. Some live in tropical waters but some inhabit temperate seas, polar waters, or live at great depths, from the photic zone down to about .  Ecology  Hard coral Favites extends its polyps at night to feed Scleractinians fall into one of two main categories: * Reef-forming or hermatypic corals, which mostly contain zooxanthellae; * Non-reef-forming or ahermatypic corals, which mostly do not contain zooxanthellae In reef-forming corals, the endodermal cells are usually replete with symbiotic unicellular dinoflagellates known as zooxanthellae. There are sometimes as many as five million cells of these per of coral tissue. The symbionts benefit the corals because up to 50% of the organic compounds they produce are used as food by the polyps. The oxygen byproduct of photosynthesis and the additional energy derived from sugars produced by zooxanthallae enable these corals to grow at a rate up to three times faster than similar species without symbionts. These corals typically grow in shallow, well-lit, warm water with moderate to brisk turbulence and abundant oxygen, and prefer firm, non-muddy surfaces on which to settle. Most stony corals extend their tentacles to feed on zooplankton, but those with larger polyps take correspondingly larger prey, including various invertebrates and even small fish. In addition to capturing prey in this way, many stony corals also produce mucus films they can move over their bodies using cilia; these trap small organic particles which are then pulled towards and into the mouth. In a few stony corals, this is the primary method of feeding, and the tentacles are reduced or absent, an example being Acropora acuminata. Caribbean stony corals are generally nocturnal, with the polyps retracting into their skeletons during the day, thus maximising the exposure of the zooxanthallae to the light, but in the Indo-Pacific region, many species feed by day and night. Non-zooxanthellate corals are usually not reef- formers; they can be found most abundantly beneath about of water. They thrive at much colder temperatures and can live in total darkness, deriving their energy from the capture of plankton and suspended organic particles. The growth rates of most species of non-zooxanthellate corals are significantly slower than those of their counterparts, and the typical structure for these corals is less calcified and more susceptible to mechanical damage than that of zooxanthellate corals.

Stony corals have a great range of reproductive strategies and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Many species have separate sexes, the whole colony being either male or female, but others are hermaphroditic, with individual polyps having both male and female gonads. Some species brood their eggs but in most species, sexual reproduction results in the production of a free-swimming planula larva that eventually settles on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a polyp. In colonial species, this initial polyp then repeatedly divides asexually, to give rise to the entire colony. = Asexual reproduction = Montastraea annularis can be fragmented to form new colonies. The most common means of asexual reproduction in colonial stony corals is by fragmentation. Pieces of branching corals may get detached during storms, by strong water movement or by mechanical means, and fragments fall to the sea bed. In suitable conditions, these are capable of adhering to the substrate and starting new colonies. Even such massive corals as Montastraea annularis have been shown to be capable of forming new colonies after fragmentation. This process is used in the reef aquarium hobby to increase stock without the necessity to harvest corals from the wild. Under adverse conditions, certain species of coral resort to another type of asexual reproduction in the form of \\"polyp bail-out\\", which may allow polyps to survive even though the parent colony dies. It involves the growth of the coenosarc to seal off the polyps, detachment of the polyps and their settlement on the seabed to initiate new colonies. In other species, small balls of tissue detach themselves from the coenosarc, differentiate into polyps and start secreting calcium carbonate to form new colonies, and in Pocillopora damicornis, unfertilised eggs can develop into viable larvae. = Sexual reproduction = The overwhelming majority of scleractinian taxa are hermaphroditic in their adult colonies. In temperate regions, the usual pattern is synchronized release of eggs and sperm into the water during brief spawning events, often related to the phases of the moon. In tropical regions, reproduction may occur throughout the year. In many cases, as in the genus Acropora, the eggs and sperm are released in buoyant bundles which rise to the surface. This increases the concentration of sperm and eggs and thus the likelihood of fertilization, and reduces the risk of self-fertilization. Immediately after spawning, the eggs are delayed in their capability for fertilization until after the release of polar bodies. This delay, and possibly some degree of self-incompatibility, likely increases the chance of cross-fertilization. A study of four species of Scleractinia found that cross- fertilization was actually the dominant mating pattern, although three of the species were also capable of self-fertilization to varying extents.  Evolutionary history  Palaeozoic rugose corals with calcite skeletons, like this Grewingkia canadensis, are doubtfully ancestors of the Scleractinia. There is little evidence on which to base a hypothesis about the origin of the scleractinians; plenty is known about modern species but very little about fossil specimens, which first appeared in the record in the Middle Triassic ().Stanley, G. D. The evolution of modern corals and their early history. Earth-Science Rev. 60, 195‚Äì225 (2003). It was not until 25 million years later that they became important reef builders, their success perhaps a result of teaming up with symbotic algae. Nine of the sub-orders were in existence by the end of the Triassic and three more had appeared by the Jurassic (200 million years ago), with a further suborder appearing in the Middle Cretaceous (100 million years ago). Some may have developed from a common ancestor, either an anemone-like coral without a skeleton, or a rugose coral. A rugose coral seems an unlikely common ancestor because these corals had calcite rather than aragonite skeletons, and the septa were arranged serially rather than cyclically. However, it may be that similarities of scleractinians to rugosans are due to a common non-skeletalized ancestor in the early Paleozoic. Alternatively, scleractinians may have developed from a Corallimorpharia-like ancestor. It seems that skeletogenesis may have been associated with the development of symbiosis and reef formation, and may have occurred on more than one occasion. DNA sequencing appears to indicate that scleractinian corals are a monophyletic group. Scleractinian coral from the Matmor Formation (Jurassic) of Makhtesh Gadol The earliest scleractinians were not reef builders, but were small, phaceloid or solitary individuals. Scleractinian corals were probably at their greatest diversity in the Jurassic and all but disappeared in the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous, about 18 out of 67 genera surviving. Recently discovered Paleozoic corals with aragonitic skeletons and cyclic septal insertion ‚Äì two features that characterize Scleractinia ‚Äì have strengthened the hypothesis for an independent origin of the Scleractinia. Whether the early scleractinian corals were zooxanthellate is an open question. The phenomenon seems to have evolved independently on numerous occasions during the Tertiary, and the genera Astrangia, Madracis, Cladocora and Oculina, all in different families, each have both zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate members.  Classification  A deep-sea Madreporaria collected by the Royal Indian Marine Survey ship Investigator, 1898 The taxonomy of Scleractinia is particularly challenging. Many species were described before the advent of scuba diving, with little realisation by the authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats. Collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats, and were unable to observe the changes in morphology that occurred in more turbid, deeper-water conditions. More than 2,000 nominal species were described in this era, and by the rules of nomenclature, the name given to the first described species has precedence over the rest, even when that description is poor, and the environment and even sometimes the country of the type specimen is unknown. Even the concept of \\"the species\\" is suspect, with regard to corals which have large geographical ranges with a number of sub- populations; their geographic boundaries merge with those of other species; their morphological boundaries merge with those of other species; and there are no definite distinctions between species and subspecies. The evolutionary relationships among stony corals were first examined in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The two most advanced 19th century classifications both used complex skeletal characters; The 1857 classification of the French zoologists Henri Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime‚Äôs was based on macroscopic skeletal characters, while Francis Grant Ogilvie's 1897 scheme was developed using observations of skeletal microstructures, with particular attention to the structure and pattern of the septal trabeculae. In 1943, the American zoologists Thomas Wayland Vaughan and John West Wells, and Wells again in 1956, used the patterns of the septal trabeculae to divide the group into five suborders. In addition, they considered polypoid features such as the growth of the tentacles. They also distinguished families by wall type and type of budding. The 1952 classification by French zoologist J. Alloiteau was built on these earlier systems but included more microstructural observations and did not involve the anatomical characters of the polyp. Alloiteau recognized eight suborders. In 1942, W.H. Bryan and D. Hill stressed the importance of microstructural observations by proposing that stony corals begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers, which are genetically derived. Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa. The rise of molecular techniques at the end of the 20th century prompted new evolutionary hypotheses that were different from ones founded on skeletal data. Results of molecular studies explained a variety of aspects of the evolutionary biology of the Scleractinia, including connections between and within extant taxa, and supplied support for hypotheses about extant corals that are founded on the fossil record. The 1996 analysis of mitochondrial RNA undertaken by American zoologists Sandra Romano and Stephen Palumbi found that molecular data supported the assembling of species into the existing families, but not into the traditional suborders. For example, some genera affiliated with different suborders were now located on the same branch of a phylogenetic tree. In addition, there is no distinguishing morphological character that separates clades, only molecular differences. The Australian zoologist John Veron and his co-workers analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again concluding that the traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect. They also established that stony corals are monophyletic, including all the descendants of a common ancestor, but that they are divided into two groups, the robust and complex clades. Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.

However, with help from Lars Levi's older half-brother Carl Erik Laestadius (1775-1817), a pastor at Kvikkjokk, with whom Lars Levi and his younger brother Petrus (1802-1841) lived part of their childhood, the boys were able to pursue educations, first at H√§rn√∂sand and starting in 1820, at Uppsala University. Due to their benefactor half-brother's death in 1817, the boys were constantly short of funds from the outset of their university studies. Nevertheless, Lars Levi proved to be a brilliant student. Because of his interest in botany, he was made assistant in the botany department while pursuing studies in theology. Lars Levi Laestadius was ordained a Lutheran priest in 1825 by the bishop of H√§rn√∂sand, Erik Abraham Almquist. =Marriage and family= In 1827 Laestadius married Brita Katarina Alstadius, a local Sami woman who was a childhood friend of his;L.

Laestadius's Lutheran ministry and revival movement =Parishes where he served= Laestadius's first parish was at Arjeplog in Lapland, where he became the regional missionary for the Pite district. From 1826 to 1849 he was the vicar in Karesuando parish in Lapland. Near the end of his tenure in Karesuando, Laestadius applied for the positions of dean in Pajala parish in Norrbotten County and inspector of the Lapland parishes. After he complemented his exams in H√§rn√∂sand as required, he took over these offices in 1849 and held them until his death in 1861. =Revival movement= At the time of Laestadius's 1826 arrival in Karesuando, the people of Lapland parish suffered from widespread misery and alcoholism. Laestadius's awakening Laestadius met a Sami woman named Milla Clementsdotter of F√∂llinge (also known as Lapp Mary by the Laestadian Lutheran Church) in the municipality of Krokom in J√§mtland during an 1844 inspection tour of √Ösele in Lapland. She belonged to a revival movement marked by pietistic and Moravian influences and led by pastor Pehr Brandell of the parish of Nora in the municipality of Kramfors in √Öngermanland. She told Laestadius about her experiences on her journey to living faith. This was an important meeting for Laestadius because after it, he said he first understood the secret of living faith. He had a religious experience, and he wrote later that he at last saw the path that leads to eternal life. His sermons acquired, in his own words, \\"a new kind of colour\\" to which people began to respond. The movement spread quickly from Sweden to Finland and Norway. Laestadius based his sermons on the Bible. Initial effect on parishioners According to an account from the Sami cultural perspective, :\\"[T]he Sami began to notice that...Laestadius had changed. His sermons were filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the Sami that they could understand. He preached about a God who cared about the lives of the people. He attacked priests and traders who lined their pockets at the expense of others... After twenty years, something new had begun to happen between the pastor and his parishioners. Young and old alike wanted to learn to read. There was also a bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness (within [Finnish] Laestadianism this was known as liikutuksia, a kind of ecstasy). Not everybody liked it, of course... Those who had previously earned a lot of money through the sale of liquor saw their incomes disappear and derided the new morals... Drunkenness and the theft of reindeer diminished, which had a positive influence on the Sami's relationships, finances and family life.\\" Resistance The resistance to Laestadius's radical Christian ethics and morals and to his way of confronting the parishioners about their sins was greater in Pajala where Laestadius moved in 1849; and the bishop decided in 1853 that two separate church services should be held, one for the Laestadians and one for the others. It could be said that Laestadianism, the religious revival named after him, became a movement in its own right at this time, although it remained within and never separated from the Church of Sweden.  Rise of Laestadianism among the Sami  The rapid rise of Laestadianism among the Sami was due to several factors. Laestadius proudly self-identified as Southern Sami through his mother and spoke and preached in two Sami dialects. Further he chose uneducated lay preachers from the Sami reindeer herders to travel year around with them and preach to the unrepented. Additionally, in the early days of the movement, Laestadius, in order to find common ground with his parishioners, borrowed the Samis' own familiar pagan deities and concepts and adapted them to Christianity. Another factor in the rise of Laestadianism among the Sami was that the state-mandated boarding schools soon came to be populated by Laestadian personnel. Next, the strict moral code including strict temperance of Laestadianism appealed to the Sami. Whole communities that had been wrecked by alcoholism went dry virtually overnight. This had the added positive effect of improving the Samis' social standing with the outside world. Finally, Laestadianism was a faith that the Sami could identify as originating from within insofar that Laestadius himself professed to have come to know the true living faith only upon his encounter with the poor abused Sami woman, Milla Clementsdotter. Successor When Laestadius died in 1861, he was succeeded by Johan Raattamaa as the leader of the Laestadian movement. Botanist Laestadius undertook his first botanic trip as a student. Later the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences paid him to travel to Sk√•ne in southern Sweden and to Lapland, to study and make drawings of plants, to be used in Swedish botany scientific work. He was as an internationally recognized botanist and a member of the Edinburgh Botanical Society as well as the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala.Franz√©n, Olle: Naturalhistorikern Lars Levi Laestadius. Lule√•, Tornedalica 1973, nr 15. A number of plant species have been named for Laestadius, e.g.: * Salix laestadiana Hartm. * Carex laestadii Holmb. * Papaver laestadianum Nordh. Laestadius named many plant species: List of plants named by Laestadius in IPNI La Recherche Expedition (1838-1840) While attending to his pastoral duties, Laestadius continued his interest in botany and authored a number of articles on plant life in Lapland. Because of the wide recognition for his knowledge of botany and the Sami, the French Admiralty invited Laestadius to participate in the La Recherche Expedition to Samiland of 1838‚Äì40. As an expedition member, Laestadius served as field guide for the islands and the interior of Northern Norway and Sweden, studying both plant life and the culture of the Sami inhabitants. During the expedition, Laestadius at the request of the organizers began his manuscript. Eventually published for the first time more than 150 years later Fragments of Lappish Mythology provides a snapshot of Sami traditional religious beliefs that by the 1830s were passing into history due to the Church of Sweden's Christianization mandate in full swing at that time.Lars Levi Laestadius, Fragments of Lappish Mythology, Juha Pentik√§inen ed. Aspasia Books (December 1, 2002), p.36-44 However, Laestadius did not finish the manuscript until long afterward. Then the completed work was lost for many years.L. Laestadius, Fragments of Lappish Mythology , Trans. B√∂rje V√§h√§m√§ki, Aspasia Books, Beaverton, Ont. Canada. (2002), p49. Due to these and other reasons, the manuscript was not published until 1997, over 150 years after the expedition. For his participation in the La Recherche Expedition, Laestadius was awarded the Medal of Honor of the Legion of Honor of France after 1841. He was the first Scandinavian to receive this honor.L. Laestadius, Fragments of Lappish Mythology , Trans. B√∂rje V√§h√§m√§ki, Aspasia Books, Beaverton, Ont. Canada. (2002), p45. (Citation on the page also describes \\"Bibl. Nat. 3303) Languages spoken Laestadius's mother tongues were Southern Sami from his mother and Swedish, the language of his childhood home, from his father. Laestadius also spoke Pite Sami. After a year in Karesuando, Laestadius spoke Finnish and Northern Sami as well. He usually held his services in Finnish since it was the most widespread language in the area, but on occasion also preached in the Northern Sami and Swedish languages. Family deaths and personal illnesses After the death of his older half-brother and financial support, Carl Erik, when Lars Levi was only a teenager, Laestadius mourned the deaths of his mother in 1824, his dad in 1832, and his younger brother Petrus in 1841. At least two of Laestadius's own sons predeceased him as well (d.1839, 1861). Around 1833 Laestadius suffered from an ailment which the doctors first thought was pneumonia. He recovered. In the 1840s, Laestadius suffered from severe typhoid fever and later tuberculosis. Towards the end of his life, Laestadius experienced \\"impending blindness\\" and contracted a cholera-like illness.L. Laestadius, Fragments of Lappish Mythology , Trans.

It houses the RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine, the Joint Arms Control Implementation Group (JACIG), the Signals Museum and 616 Volunteer Gliding Squadron. The Ministry of Defence announced on 6 September 2016 that the base is set to be closed following a consultation. History Henlow was chosen as a military aircraft repair depot in 1917 and was built by MacAlpine during 1918. 4 Belfast Hangars were built and are now listed buildings. An additional hangar was added to the inventory in the 1930s and this too is now listed. Originally a repair depot for aircraft from the Western Front, the Station officially opened on 18 May 1918 when Lt Col Robert Francis Stapleton-Cotton arrived with a party of 40 airmen from Farnborough. In May 1920, RAF Henlow became the first parachute testing centre and was later joined by another parachute unit from RAF Northolt. Parachute testing was undertaken with Vimy aircraft and parachutists hanging off the wings and allowing the chute to deploy and enable them to drift back to the ground. The Officers Engineering School moved there in 1924 from Farnborough. After the First World War, Henlow was home to four aircraft squadrons; No. 19 Squadron RAF, No. 23 Squadron RAF, No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 80 Squadron RAF. Between 1932 and 1933, Sir Frank Whittle was a student at the RAF technical College on the base. He later spent some time in charge of aero engine testing on the base before being sent to Cambridge. During the Second World War Henlow was used to assemble the Hawker Hurricanes which had been built at the Hurricane factory operated by Canadian Car and Foundry in Fort William, Ontario, Canada, under the leadership of Elsie MacGill. After test flying in Fort William, they were disassembled and sent to Henlow in shipping containers and reassembled. During Operation Quickforce in 1941, 100 fitters from the base were deployed onto carriers which were shipping Hurricane fighters to Malta. The finished Hurricanes were completed on the decks of the carriers and flown out to Malta. Over 1,000 Hurricanes (about 10% of the total) were built by Canadian Car and Foundry and shipped to Henlow. Henlow was also used as a repair base for many aircraft types under the direction of No. 13 Maintenance Unit. The empty packing crates that the Hurricane aircraft were shipped in were used to make the original control tower (which has now been replaced by a more modern two-storey Portakabin type). The original tower and parts of the airfield were seen in several scenes in the 1969 war film 'The Battle of Britain'. After the war, Henlow became the RAF Signals Engineering Establishment, but was reduced to a Radio Engineering Unit in 1980. A major RAF technical training college was also formed at Henlow in 1947. This was formed from the RAF School of Aeronautical Engineering, formerly at RAF Farnborough, and its purpose was to train cadets and engineering officers. The college was amalgamated with RAF College Cranwell in 1965. The RAF Officer Cadet Training Unit then moved in, but this also moved to Cranwell in 1980. In 1983, the Land Registry took over part of the site. The missile-corporation MBDA has recently test-fired CAMM missiles from a truck at Henlow. Henlow Camp, a civilian settlement, has grown up around RAF Henlow since the station's establishment. In December 2011, RAF Henlow along with 14 other Ministry of Defence sites in the United Kingdom were designated as being dangerously radioactive. The 15 bases were believed to be poisoned as a consequence of undetermined activity during the Second World War.

The Band of The Queen's Division (British Army) are stationed at RAF Henlow. A civilian flying school also operates from the site. No 3 Tactical Provost Squadron was formerly based at RAF Henlow, gradually transitioned over to RAF Honington in 2015. Administratively, RAF Henlow was part of a combined base, RAF Brampton Wyton Henlow but this has been disbanded with RAF Brampton being closed. =Facilities= Henlow facilities include: Officers' Mess, WOs' & SNCOs' Mess, All Ranks Club ‚Äì 'Whittles', Coffee Shop ‚Äì 'Crystals', Welfare housing ‚Äì 'Whittle's Inn', Gymnasium, bowling alley, an 8 runway grass airfield and a 9-hole golf course open to the public.

Exhibits include radio and electronic equipment and memorabilia, a typical RAF Y Station from World War II, and the training of Aircraft Apprentices and boy entrants for Signals and Communications trades. The museum is open on Tuesdays and also by appointment. Because of the Museum's location on a working air base, all visitors must present a photo ID for entry. The Museum is also open on the first Saturday of each month (except in January). Opening times are 10.00 to 16.00 (10 am to 4 pm). No booking is needed on these days, but photo ID has to be presented at the Main Guard Room for Temporary Passes to be issued.  Planned Closure  On 6 September 2016, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon announced the planned closure of RAF Henlow along with 12 other military sites owned by the MoD. The land will be used for housing to help meet the government's target of 160,000 homes by 2020. The closure date was later extended to 2023.

When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood, vomiting black blood, bloody stool, or black stool. Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, shortness of breath, pale skin, or passing out. Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present. Bleeding is typically divided into two main types: upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Causes of upper GI bleeds include: peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis and cancer, among others. Causes of lower GI bleeds include: hemorrhoids, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease among others. Diagnosis typically begins with a medical history and physical examination, along with blood tests. Small amounts of bleeding may be detected by fecal occult blood test. Endoscopy of the lower and upper gastrointestinal tract may locate the area of bleeding. Medical imaging may be useful in cases that are not clear. Initial treatment focuses on resuscitation which may include intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. Often blood transfusions are not recommended unless the hemoglobin is less than 70 or 80 g/L. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, octreotide, and antibiotics may be considered in certain cases. If other measures are not effective, an esophageal balloon may be attempted in those with presumed esophageal varices. Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum or endoscopy of the large bowel are generally recommended within 24 hours and may allow treatment as well as diagnosis. An upper GI bleed is more common than lower GI bleed. An upper GI bleed occurs in 50 to 150 per 100,000 adults per year. A lower GI bleed is estimated to occur in 20 to 30 per 100,000 per year. It results in about 300,000 hospital admissions a year in the United States. Risk of death from a GI bleed is between 5% and 30%. Risk of bleeding is more common in males and increases with age. symptoms upper Gastrointestinal bleeding bright blood in vomit dark blood in stool lower Gastrointestinal bleeding bright blood in stool dark blood in vomit Types Gastrointestinal bleeding can be roughly divided into two clinical syndromes: upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. About 2/3 of all GI bleeds are from upper sources and 1/3 from lower sources. Common causes of gastrointestinal bleeding include infections, cancers, vascular disorders, adverse effects of medications, and blood clotting disorders. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) is when a source is unclear following investigation. =Upper gastrointestinal= Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is from a source between the pharynx and the ligament of Treitz. An upper source is characterised by hematemesis (vomiting up blood) and melena (tarry stool containing altered blood). About half of cases are due to peptic ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal ulcers). Esophageal inflammation and erosive disease are the next most common causes. In those with liver cirrhosis, 50‚Äì60% of bleeding is due to esophageal varices. Approximately half of those with peptic ulcers have an H. pylori infection. Other causes include Mallory-Weiss tears, cancer, and angiodysplasia. A number of medications are found to cause upper GI bleeds. NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk about fourfold. SSRIs, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants may also increase the risk. The risk with dabigatran is 30% greater than that with warfarin. =Lower gastrointestinal= Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is typically from the colon, rectum or anus. Common causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding include hemorrhoids, cancer, angiodysplasia, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and aortoenteric fistula. It may be indicated by the passage of fresh red blood rectally, especially in the absence of bloody vomiting. Isolated melena may originate from anywhere between the stomach and the proximal colon. =Other= A number of foods and medications can turn the stool either red or black. Bismuth found in many antacids may turn stools black as may activated charcoal. Blood from the vagina or urinary tract may also be confused with blood in the stool. Signs and symptoms Gastrointestinal bleeding can range from small non-visible amounts, which are only detected by laboratory testing, to massive bleeding where bright red blood is passed and shock develops. With bleeding that is rapid there may be syncope. Blood that is digested may appear black rather than red, resulting in \\"coffee ground\\" vomit or tar colored stool called melena. Other signs and symptoms include feeling tired, dizziness, and pale skin color. Diagnosis Diagnosis is often based on direct observation of blood in the stool or vomit. Although fecal occult blood testing has been used in an emergency setting, this use is not recommended as the test has only been validated for colon cancer screening. Differentiating between upper and lower bleeding in some cases can be difficult. The severity of an upper GI bleed can be judged based on the Blatchford score or Rockall score. The Rockall score is the more accurate of the two. As of 2008 there is no scoring system useful for lower GI bleeds. =Clinical= Gastric aspiration and or lavage, where a tube is inserted into the stomach via the nose in an attempt to determine if there is blood in the stomach, if negative does not rule out an upper GI bleed but if positive is useful for ruling one in. Clots in the stool indicate a lower GI source while melana stools an upper one. =Laboratory testing= Recommended laboratory blood testing includes: cross-matching blood, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, coagulation time, and electrolytes. If the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine is greater than 30 the source is more likely from the upper GI tract. =Imaging= A CT angiography is useful for determining the exact location of the bleeding within the gastrointestinal tract. Nuclear scintigraphy is a sensitive test for detecting occult gastrointestinal bleeding when direct imaging with upper and lower endoscopies are negative. Direct angiography allows for embolization of a bleeding source, but requires a bleeding rate faster than 1mL/minute. Prevention In those with significant varices or cirrhosis nonselective Œ≤-blockers reduce the risk of future bleeding. With a target heart rate of 55 beats per minute they reduce the absolute risk of bleeding by 10%. Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is also effective at improving outcomes. Either B-blockers or EBL are recommended as initial preventative measures. In those who have had a previous variceal bleed both treatments are recommended. Some evidence supports the addition of isosorbide mononitrate. Testing for and treating those who are positive for H. pylori is recommended. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may be used to prevent bleeding in people who re-bleed despite other measures. Among people admitted to the ICU who are at high risk, a PPI or H2RA if appears useful. Treatment The initial focus is on resuscitation beginning with airway management and fluid resuscitation using either intravenous fluids and or blood. A number of medications may improve outcomes depending on the source of the bleeding. =Peptic ulcers= Based on evidence from people with other health problems crystalloid and colloids are believed to be equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may reduce mortality in those with severe disease as well as the risk of re-bleeding and the need for surgery among this group. Oral and intravenous formulations may be equivalent; however, the evidence to support this is suboptimal. In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance. There is tentative evidence of benefit for tranexamic acid which inhibits clot breakdown. Somatostatin and octreotide, while recommended for varicial bleeding, have not been found to be of general use for non variceal bleeds. After treatment of a high risk bleeding ulcer endoscopically giving a PPI once or a day rather than as an infusion appears to work just as well and is less expensive (the method may be either by mouth or intravenously). =Variceal bleeding= For initial fluid replacement colloids or albumin is preferred in people with cirrhosis. Medications typically include octreotide or, if not available, vasopressin and nitroglycerin to reduce portal venous pressures. Terlipressin appears to be more effective than octreotide, but it is not available in many areas of the world. It is the only medication that has been shown to reduce mortality in acute variceal bleeding. This is in addition to endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy for the varices. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues, balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varices. This may then be followed by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. In those with cirrhosis, antibiotics decrease the chance of bleeding again, shorten the length of time spent in hospital, and decrease mortality. Octreotide reduces the need for blood transfusions and may decrease mortality. No trials of vitamin K have been conducted. =Blood products= The evidence for benefit of blood transfusions in GI bleed is poor with some evidence finding harm. In those in shock O-negative packed red blood cells are recommended. If large amounts of pack red blood cells are used additional platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be administered to prevent coagulopathies. In alcoholics FFP is suggested before confirmation of a coagulopathy due to presumed blood clotting problems. Evidence supports holding off on blood transfusions in those who have a hemoglobin greater than 7 to 8 g/dL and moderate bleeding, including in those with preexisting coronary artery disease. If the INR is greater than 1.5 to 1.8 correction with fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex may decrease mortality. Evidence of a harm or benefit of recombinant activated factor VII in those with liver diseases and gastrointestinal bleeding is not determined. A massive transfusion protocol may be used, but there is a lack of evidence for this indication. =Procedures= The Blakemore esophageal balloon used for stopping esophageal bleeds if other measures have failed The benefits versus risks of placing a nasogastric tube in those with upper GI bleeding are not determined. Endoscopy within 24 hours is recommended, in addition to medical management. A number of endoscopic treatments may be used, including: epinephrine injection, band ligation, sclerotherapy, and fibrin glue depending on what is found. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin before endoscopy can decrease the amount of blood in the stomach and thus improve the operators view. They also decrease the amount of blood transfusions required. Early endoscopy decreases hospital and the amount of blood transfusions needed. A second endoscopy within a day is routinely recommended by some but by others only in specific situations. Proton pump inhibitors, if they have not been started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. High and low dose PPIs appear equivalent at this point. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72 hours. Those at low risk of re- bleeding may begin eating typically 24 hours following endoscopy. If other measures fail or are not available, esophageal balloon tamponade may be attempted. While there is a success rate up to 90%, there are some potentially significant complications including aspiration and esophageal perforation. Colonoscopy is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of lower GI bleeding. A number of techniques may be employed including: clipping, cauterizing, and sclerotherapy. Preparation for colonoscopy takes a minimum of six hours which in those bleeding briskly may limit its applicability. Surgery, while rarely used to treat upper GI bleeds, is still commonly used to manage lower GI bleeds by cutting out the part of the intestines that is causing the problem. Angiographic embolization may be used for both upper and lower GI bleeds. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may also be considered. Prognosis Death in those with a GI bleed is more commonly due to other illnesses (some of which may have contributed to the bleed, such as cancer or cirrhosis) than the bleeding itself. Of those admitted to a hospital because of a GI bleed, death occurs in about 7%. Despite treatment, re- bleeding occurs in about 7‚Äì16% of those with upper GI bleeding. In those with esophageal varices, bleeding occurs in about 5‚Äì15% a year and if they have bled once, there is a higher risk of further bleeding within six weeks. Testing and treating H. pylori if found can prevent re-bleeding in those with peptic ulcers. The benefits versus risks of restarting blood thinners such as aspirin or warfarin and anti-inflammatories such as NSAIDs need to be carefully considered. If aspirin is needed for cardiovascular disease prevention, it is reasonable to restart it within seven days in combination with a PPI for those with nonvariceal upper GI bleeding. Epidemiology Gastrointestinal bleeding from the upper tract occurs in 50 to 150 per 100,000 adults per year. It is more common than lower gastrointestinal bleeding which is estimated to occur at the rate of 20 to 30 per 100,000 per year. Risk of bleeding is more common in males, and increases with age.

Aligned north to south, the northern portion has generally more expensive low-density housing, whereas the southern portion possesses higher-density housing and considerable commercial development. The primary industries include tourism, fishing, and real estate. The only access point to the island by land is a single causeway. The island is home to about 20,000 people on a year-round basis. The population is distributed among six separate municipalities, the largest of which is Long Beach Township. However, the island's population swells significantly during the summer months and reaches about 100,000 people, including part-time residents and tourists, who are often referred to as \\"shoobies\\". The island's close-knit communities are largely affluent and contain vacation homes for wealthy individuals who reside elsewhere, primarily New Jersey as well as New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.

Accessed July 9, 2012. \\"Long Beach Island is long, from the historical Barnegat Light on the north end (in a huge state park), past Surf City and Ship Bottom in the middle to Beach Haven to the south.\\" The island is about a half-mile wide (800 m) at its widest point in Ship Bottom, and spans a fifth of a mile (300 m) at its narrowest point in Harvey Cedars. Long Beach Island is bisected by State Route 72, formerly \\"South 40\\", which connects the mainland to the island at Ship Bottom. It is the sole access point for road vehicles to the mainland over Manahawkin Bay. This results in the division of the island into a northern portion and a southern portion. From the bridge northward, the island includes the communities of Ship Bottom, Surf City, North Beach (a section of Long Beach Township), Harvey Cedars, Loveladies (a section of Long Beach Township), High Bar Harbor (the northernmost section of Long Beach Township), and Barnegat Light. From the bridge southward, the island includes the communities of Ship Bottom, Long Beach Township (including the census-designated place of North Beach Haven) and Beach Haven, with the Holgate section of Long Beach Township at the southernmost tip of the island. History Engleside Avenue in Beach Haven The island has been continuously settled since 1690, initially being a destination for hunters. Barnegat Inlet, to the north of the island, was an important path for freight shipments and whaling from the 17th century through the 20th century. Due to the Inlet's importance and its turbulent waters, a lighthouse tower was constructed in 1835 to guide shippers through the area, but was inadequate to ships, constantly being mistaken for another passing ship because the light was fixed. Erosion problems destroyed the tower in 1857, two years before the current Barnegat Lighthouse was completed in 1859, flashing at each point of the compass every 10 seconds. It was constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under the supervision of George Gordon Meade, famous for leading the Union forces to victory four years later during the Civil War at the Battle of Gettysburg. The United States Life-Saving Service built Station #17 in Barnegat Light (then known as Brownsville) around 1872, which continues today as a United States Coast Guard station. A lone fishing shack, a landmark to drivers entering LBI, stood dilapidated in the marsh alongside Route 72 until it was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy in 2012 A developing tourism sector prompted The Tuckerton Railroad (a short line running from Tuckerton to Whiting) to build a bridge across Barnegat bay that ran from Barnegat city to Beach Haven; the tracks were completed in 1886, and were leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). The Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 included a fatal attack in Beach Haven, killing University of Pennsylvania student Charles Vansant in July 1916, which partly inspired the book Jaws. A severe winter storm in 1920 destroyed most of the beaches along the island, several hotels, and reopening the new inlet in Holgate. A storm in 1923 further diminished the tourism sector, resulting in the discontinuation of train service to Barnegat City between 1923 and 1926. In 1935, the railroad bridge to the mainland washed out, leaving the entire island without rail service. Several storms throughout the island's history have resulted in the island being split in two, with the division occurring at the island's narrowest point in Harvey Cedars. Most famous of such storms, however, was the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, which split Long Beach Island into numerous pieces and nearly destroyed the island in its entirety. The storm caused the destroyer USS Monssen to run aground in Beach Haven Inlet, Long Beach Township. The existing Route 72 Causeway was erected in the late 1950s which replaced a low-level two-lane automobile bridge which in itself had replaced the previously destroyed railroad bridge. =Hurricane Sandy= New Jersey National Guard vehicles navigating floodwaters along Route 72 in Ship Bottom during Hurricane Sandy New Jersey National Guard workers clearing sand from streets in Holgate after Hurricane Sandy In late October 2012, portions of Long Beach Island were significantly damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Residents were evacuated and portions of the island were severely flooded, with the ocean meeting the bay in isolated spots. Streets were left covered with up to four feet of sand in some spots. Several homes along the ocean and bay front communities were damaged by the nine-foot storm surge and 18-foot seas that pounded the barrier island. The Manahawkin Bay Bridge remained closed to residents for a full 13 days following the storm, and locals were prohibited from returning to the island except for brief visits to retrieve belongings. Bulldozers and front-end loaders moved hundreds of tons of sand, along with power lines and boats, in an attempt to make the roadways passable. Long Beach Island was finally re-opened to residents and building owners on November 10, with the exception of the Holgate section of Long Beach Township, where infrastructure and road damage was still too dangerous. However, island officials warned that some areas were still without sewerage, water and electric service at that time. Damage was distributed unevenly throughout the island. Areas with a protective dune system had limited damage, while areas without dunes, or where dunes were breached, received significantly more damage. In those neighborhoods ‚Äî in sections like Holgate, on the island‚Äôs southern tip ‚Äî destruction was severe. The protective sand dunes, an ambitious project developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been a source of controversy in recent years, and have led to conflict between local officials arguing for the need of dunes, and property owners who felt that the dunes devalued their property. As such, the work is incomplete and there are significant breaks in the dune system. Other hard-hit areas included Loveladies and North Beach. Areas where the dune system was in place fared much better, such as Harvey Cedars, Ship Bottom, Surf City and Barnegat Light. Electricity was restored to 70% of the Island by November 4, 2012. By November 20, 2012 natural gas service was restored to nearly the entire Island. By mid- November many businesses were re-opened on Long Beach Island with life resuming as normal for much of the Island by mid-December.LBItoday.com. Archive.fo. Accessed March 16, 2019. Demographics There are six separate municipalities on Long Beach Island. Long Beach Township is the largest of these, and subdivides into multiple neighborhoods: *Barnegat Light *Beach Haven *Harvey Cedars *Long Beach Township **Brant Beach **Beach Haven Crest **Beach Haven Gardens **Beach Haven Inlet **Beach Haven Park **Beach Haven Terrace **Brighton Beach **Haven Beach **High Bar Harbor **Holgate **Loveladies **North Beach Haven **North Beach **Peahala Park **South Beach Haven **Spray Beach *Ship Bottom *Surf City Culture In the 1970s, an article in Philadelphia Magazine quipped that, \\"The haves turn right (south) and the have mores turn left (north),\\" referring to the option of turning right or left when arriving on the island from the bridge. Nominally accurate, the low-density northern end of the island, Loveladies, North Beach, and the surrounding neighborhoods are home to an assortment of large-scale waterfront homes which attract considerable attention from visitors and are often the source of rumors regarding vacationing celebrities during the summertime. The southern community of Beach Haven features historic and elegant Victorian homes that have survived the many storms. The south end contains significantly more commercial zoning, which generally decreases north of the bridge. Year- round residents and businesses in operation are more common toward the southern end of the island, particularly in the larger boroughs of Beach Haven and Ship Bottom. Long Beach Island typically attracts a family-oriented crowd during the summertime, unlike more frenzied beach vacation destinations such as Belmar and Seaside Heights. The island has not contained a boardwalk since the one in Beach Haven was washed away by the 1944 hurricane, and the night life is limited to a few bars. Visitors generally take part in such activities as miniature golf, parasailing, jet skiing, walking, shopping, and relaxing on the beaches. The island has a reputation as a base for many long-range recreational fishing and charter boats, whose trips can range from 10‚Äì100 miles from one of the island's two inlets (at Barnegat Light in the north, and Beach Haven in the south.) In 2009, the Lighthouse International Film Festival launched on the Island. The three-day event screens films in venues throughout the Island. Other art venues include the Surflight Theatre in Beach Haven, and numerous art galleries throughout the island. The Surflight Theatre was closed due to foreclosure, but has now reopened with plans to expand the number of shows presented yearly. The island also has options for nightlife. There are a wide range of bars including Joe Pops, Nardi's Tavern, The Seashell, The Ketch, Kubel's, and more. Each bar has its own entertainment. Some feature live music, DJ's, happy hour, and weekly specials. =Beach replenishment= Some of the island's of beaches have experienced significant erosion in recent decades, threatening the multimillion-dollar waterfront homes in the area. In 2005, with the help of the Army Corps of Engineers, work began on a $75 million project to build a high, wide dune the length of the island, using sand pumped from offshore. In front of the dunes, a wide stretch of sand separates the dune from the ocean. The beach replenishment project began in Ship Bottom and Surf City. With work on those beaches now complete, the project continues toward the northern end of the island. Beach replenishment has been a hugely controversial topic. Many surfers and swimmers argue that pumping the sand destroys the sandbars that create waves and provide a better swimming environment. Some homeowners claim that dunes will reduce property value, while island officials argue that dunes are necessary to counter beach erosion and protect the island from storms. Transportation Bisecting the developed region is the sole access point for road vehicles, via State Route 72, which consists of the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge (locally known as \\"The Causeway\\", though the term is incorrect in its application). The bridge is known for its \\"String of Pearls\\", a row of lights mounted on the railings lining the length of the bridge. The bridge was designed by an African American, New Jersey Department of Transportation engineer, Dorland J. Henderson who also designed the unique bridge lights. The bridge extends from Manahawkin on the mainland to Ship Bottom on the island. The island can also be reached by water transport. A $155 million plan unveiled by the New Jersey Department of Transportation in 2005 added a second span and will replace the existing bridge.\\"State unveils plan to add 2nd span over bay to island -- PROJECT MAY START IN 2009\\", Asbury Park Press, July 26, 2005. \\"STAFFORD - With the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge literally coming apart at the seams, the state Department of Transportation on Monday unveiled plans to rebuild the existing Route 72 causeway to Long Beach Island and add a second span beside it at a total cost of $155 million.\\" The new southern span was opened in 2016 and the original bridge will be rebuilt over the next 3 years. County Route 607 in Ship Bottom Within the island, one road forms the backbone of all transportation: County Route 607. This road, which is known as Bay Avenue in Beach Haven, Central Avenue and Broadway in Barnegat Light, and Long Beach Boulevard across the remainder of the island, runs the length of LBI and connects all the separate municipalities on the island as well as the separate sections of Long Beach Township.

Notable locations Barnegat Lighthouse on the north tip of Long Beach Island The historic Barnegat Lighthouse is located in Barnegat Lighthouse State Park at the northern tip of the island, along the Barnegat Inlet. The conical tower stands 165 feet (50 m) tall and the park includes several trails through native foliage as well as along the jetty constructed in the 1990s. The scallop boat Lindsay L, docked near Viking Village in Barnegat Light, was used in the movie The Perfect Storm. The lighthouse is open daily from 10 AM to 4:30 PM (weather permitting) from Memorial Day through Labor Day. There is a $3 fee per person to enter the lighthouse from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Children ages 6 to 11 are $1 and children ages 5 and under are free and must be accompanied by an adult. Visitors can also catch the views from the top without climbing the 217 steps thanks to four cameras that transmit live images of the view to a display in the adjacent Interpretive Center.Genovese, Peter. \\"Today's special: Jersey Shore\\", The Star-Ledger, July 17, 2005.

The organization provides arts, science and recreation programs to area residents and visitors. The Foundation offers an After School Arts Education Program to area schools, an Artists Residency and Retreat Program for New Jersey Artists, Visiting Artists in Ceramics during the summer season, and ceramics scholarships and residency opportunities. To the south, in Beach Haven, the Fantasy Island Amusement Park is the only full-time location on the island with standard-fare amusement rides (including a classically designed carousel). Fantasy Island offers rides, games, food, live entertainment, and a family style casino arcade. Entertainment, admission, and parking are free. The annual Festival Of The Sea carnival also makes an appearance at the St. Francis Community Church in Ship Bottom every August for one week per year. Lucille‚Äôs Oh Fudge! Candies has a large salt water taffy display in front of its shop in Brant Beach, a candy which was first created in nearby Atlantic City. Lucille's candy also has a location on Route 72 in Manahawkin Thundering Surf Water Park, the island's only water park, offers fun for all ages. With six water slides, a kids area, a lazy river, miniature golf, and a Flow House, the water park is a popular attraction for families. Two significant commercial establishments are Schooner's Wharf/Bay Village, in Beach Haven, and Viking Village, in Barnegat Light. The latter includes numerous family-owned shops generally oriented toward the local fishing industry and the many fishing charter boats that set sail there, though a variety of handmade crafts can also be found. The former is geared more specifically toward the tourism industry, featuring a variety of eateries and more mainstream shops. Across from the Thundering Surf Water Park, Bay Village began in 1965 when John Maschal purchased a half-block around his shop \\"Country Kettle Fudge\\" ‚Äî which had opened four years earlier ‚Äî and developed it into the existing shopping area. When Bay Village opened, it adjoined the Lucy Evelyn, a 3 masted schooner that had been set on land and turned into a gift shop and museum. The Lucy Evelyn, 140' long with a 32' beam and 10' draft, built in 1917 in Harrington, Maine, burned to the ground in January 1972. It was replaced by a building that resembles a schooner. One of the original \\"Seaman's Shacks\\" that surrounded the Lucy Evelyn still remains on the north-western outskirts of Bay Village. The annual Chowderfest clam chowder competition is held at Schooner's Wharf/Bay Village in Beach Haven every October, drawing a significant influx of tourists during the off-season. For the past 20 years, island restaurants have competed in Manhattan and New England clam chowder categories. Recent winners include Stefano's Pizza and Pasta, Howard's Restaurant, Country Kettle Chowda, Buckalew's Restaurant and Tavern, and The Black Whale Bar and Fish House. Media The Press of Atlantic City provides daily news coverage of the towns as does WPGG radio. The government of the towns provides columns and commentary to The Southern Ocean Times, which is one of seven weekly papers from Micromedia Publications. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Long Beach Island, New Jersey has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with hot, moderately humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation. Cfa climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature > 32.0 ¬∞F (> 0.0 ¬∞C), at least four months with an average mean temperature ‚â• 50.0 ¬∞F (‚â• 10.0 ¬∞C), at least one month with an average mean temperature ‚â• 71.6 ¬∞F (‚â• 22.0 ¬∞C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Long Beach Island, a cooling afternoon sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values ‚â• 95 ¬∞F (‚â• 35 ¬∞C). During the winter months, episodes of extreme cold and wind can occur with wind chill values < 0 ¬∞F (< -18 ¬∞C). The plant hardiness zone at 9th St Beach, Ship Bottom is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 3.8 ¬∞F (-15.7 ¬∞C). The average seasonal (Nov-Apr) snowfall total is between 12 and 18 inches (31 and 46 cm), and the average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in nor'easter activity. Ecology According to the A. W.

McCandless served in the United States Congress as a territorial delegate. A former member of the Hawaii Republican Party, McCandless was one of the earliest leaders of the Hawaii Democratic Party. Life Born September 18, 1859 in Indiana, Pennsylvania, his mother was Elizabeth Newman and father Thomas McCartney McCandless. McCandless grew up in Volcano, West Virginia. McCandless moved to Hawaii in 1882 to employ his expertise in oil drilling and mining to construct artesian wells. He joined his younger brothers James S. McCandless (born 1855) who had arrived in 1880, and John A. McCandless (born 1853) who had arrived in 1881, forming the McCandless Brothers family firm. On May 24, 1904 he married Elizabeth Janet Cartwright of New York. McCandless entered political life as a member of the Republic of Hawaii House of Representatives from the 5th district from 1898 to 1900. After the United States annexed the islands to form the Territory of Hawaii, McCandless was elected to the territorial legislature as a senator from 1902 to 1906. He started his career in the Hawaii Republican Party. But by 1906, he started to challenge the long-serving Prince Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana'ole. By 1908 McCandless switched to join the Hawaii Democratic Party to oppose K≈´hi≈ç as non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives for Hawaii Territory's At-large congressional district, He was also nominated in 1910, and in 1912, losing all those elections, but Democrat William Paul Jarrett was nominated and won the elections in 1922 and 1924. McCandless was nominated and won the election on November 8, 1932, and served one term from March 4, 1933 to January 3, 1935. Losing a bid for reelection, McCandless directed the construction of roads, buildings, and a sewer system for Honolulu. He died in Honolulu, on October 5, 1940 and was cremated and interred in Oahu Cemetery in the Nuuanu Valley.

The aether was assumed to exist for much of the 19th century‚Äîuntil the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment returned its famous null result. Further experiments were in general agreement with Michelson and Morley's result. By the 1920s, most scientists rejected the aether's existence. Timeline =Early experiments= : 4th-century BC ‚Äì Aristotle publishes Physics, in which the aether is briefly described as being an element lighter than air that surrounds celestial bodies. He describes the aether in relation to other elements - aether is lighter than air and is located above it, whereas air is lighter than water, and water is lighter than earth. In Aristotle's view, each element returns to its proper place when displaced, which explains why air rises, why earth and water fall, and why the heavens remain in place.\\"Physics by Aristotle\\" Translated by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye. The Internet Classics Archive : 1704 ‚Äì Isaac Newton publishes Opticks, in which he proposes a particle theory of light. This had trouble explaining diffraction, so he adds a \\"fudge factor,\\" claiming that an \\"Aethereal Medium\\" is responsible for this effect, and going further to suggest it might be responsible for other physical effects such as heat. : 1727 ‚Äì James Bradley measures stellar aberration for the first time, proving (again) that light has a finite speed as well as that the Earth is moving. : 1818 ‚Äì Augustin Fresnel introduces the wave theory of light, which proposes light is a transverse wave travelling in an aether, thereby explaining how polarization can exist. It is important to note that both Newton's particle theory and Fresnel's wave theory both assume an aether exists, albeit for different reasons. From this point on, no one even seems to question its existence. : 1820 ‚Äì Discovery of Sim√©on Poisson's \\"Bright Spot\\", supporting the Wave Theory. : 1830 ‚Äì Fresnel develops a formula for predicting and measuring aether dragging by massive objects, based on a coupling constant. Such dragging seems to be at odds with aberration however, which would require the Earth not to drag the aether in order to be visible. :: George Gabriel Stokes becomes a champion of the dragging theory. : 1851 ‚Äì Armand Fizeau carries out his famous experiment with light travelling through moving water. He measures fringing due to motion of the water, perfectly in line with Fresnel's formula. However he sees no effect due to the motion of the Earth, although he does not comment on this. Nevertheless this is seen as very strong evidence for aether dragging. : 1868 ‚Äì Martinus Hoek carries out an improved version of Fizeau's using an interferometer experiment with one arm in water. He sees no effect at all, and cannot offer an explanation as to why his experiment is so at odds with Fizeau's. : 1871 ‚Äì George Biddell Airy re-runs Bradley's experiment with a telescope filled with water. He too sees no effect. It appears that aether is not dragged by mass. : 1873 ‚Äì James Clerk Maxwell publishes his Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. : 1879 ‚Äì Maxwell suggests absolute velocity of Earth in aether may be optically detectable. : 1881 ‚Äì Albert Abraham Michelson publishes his first interferometer experiments, using the device for the measurement of extremely small distances. To Michelson's dismay, his experiment finds no \\"ether drag\\" slowing light, as had been suggested by Fresnel. :: Hendrik Antoon Lorentz finds Michelson's calculation have errors (i.e., doubling of the expected fringe shift error). : 1882 ‚Äì Michelson acknowledges his interpretation errors. =Crisis= : 1887 ‚Äì the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment (MMX) produces the famous null result. A small drift is seen, but it is too small to support any \\"fixed\\" aether theory, and is so small that it might be due to experimental error. :: Many physicists dust off Stokes' work, and dragging becomes the \\"standard solution\\" : 1887 to 1888 ‚Äì Heinrich Hertz verifies the existence of electromagnetic waves. : 1889 ‚Äì George FitzGerald proposes the Contraction Hypothesis, which suggests that the measurements are null due to changes in the length in the direction of travel through the aether. : 1892 ‚Äì Oliver Lodge demonstrates that aether drag is invisible around rapidly moving celestial bodies. : 1895 ‚Äì Lorentz proposes independently the Contraction Hypothesis. : 1902 to 1904 ‚Äì Morley and Morley conduct a number of MM experiments with a 100 ft interferometer, producing the null result. : 1902 to 1904 ‚Äì Lord Rayleigh and DeWitt Bristol Brace found no signs of double refraction (due to FitzGerald‚ÄìLorentz Contraction) of moving bodies in the aether. : 1903 ‚Äì the Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment, based on an entirely different concept using electrical forces, also produces the null result : 1905 ‚Äì Miller and Morley's experiment data is published. Test of the Contraction Hypothesis has negative results. Test for aether dragging effects produces null result. : 1908 ‚Äì the Trouton‚ÄìRankine experiment, another experiment based on electrical effects, does not detect the FitzGerald‚ÄìLorentz Contraction. =Change= : 1904 ‚Äì Hendrik Lorentz publishes a new theory of moving bodies, without discarding the stationary (electromagnetic) ether concept. : 1905 ‚Äì Henri Poincar√© shows that Lorentz's theory fulfills the principle of relativity, and publishes the Lorentz transformations. His model was still based on Lorentz's ether, but he argues that this aether is perfectly undetectable. : 1905 ‚Äì Albert Einstein publishes an observationally equivalent theory, but complete with a derivation from principles alone (leaving the ether aside). Einstein also emphasized that this concept implies the relativity of space and time. He later labelled it special relativity. : 1908 ‚Äì Trouton‚ÄìRankine experiment shows that length contraction of an object according to one frame does not produce a measurable change of resistance in the object's rest frame : 1913 ‚Äì Georges Sagnac uses a rotating MMX device and receives a clearly positive result. The so-called Sagnac effect was considered excellent evidence for aether at the time, but was later explained via general relativity. Good explanations based on SR also exist. : 1914 ‚Äì Walther Zurhellen uses observations of binary stars to determine if the speed of light is dependent on movement of the source. His measurements show that it is not to 10‚àí6. This is claimed to be additional evidence against aether dragging. : 1915 ‚Äì Einstein publishes on the general theory of relativity. : 1919 ‚Äì Arthur Eddington's Africa eclipse expedition is conducted and appears to confirm the general theory of relativity. : 1920 ‚Äì Einstein says that special relativity does not require rejecting the aether, and that the gravitational field of general relativity may be called aether, to which no state of motion can be attributed. : 1921 ‚Äì Dayton Miller conducts aether drift experiments at Mount Wilson. Miller performs tests with insulated and non-magnetic interferometers and obtains positive results. : 1921 to 1924 ‚Äì Miller conducts extensive tests under controlled conditions at Case University. : 1924 ‚Äì Miller repeats his experiments at Mount Wilson and yields a positive result. :: Rudolf Tomaschek uses stars for his interferometer light source, getting the null result. : 1925 ‚Äì the Michelson‚ÄìGale‚ÄìPearson experiment produces a positive result while attempting to detect the effect of Earth's rotation on the velocity of light. The significance of the experiment remains debated to this day, but this planetary Sagnac effect is measured by ring laser gyros and taken into account by the GPS system. : 1925 April ‚Äì Meeting of the National Academy of Sciences. :: Arthur Compton explains the problems with the Stokes aether drag solution. :: Miller presents his positive results of the aether drag. : 1925 December ‚Äì American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting. :: Miller proposes two theories to account for the positive result. One consists of a modified aether theory, the other a slight departure from the Contraction Hypothesis. : 1926 ‚Äì Roy J. Kennedy produces a null result on Mount Wilson :: Auguste Piccard and Ernest Stahel produce a null result on Mont Rigi. : 1927 ‚Äì Mount Wilson conference. :: Miller talks of partial entrainment :: Michelson talks about aether drag and altitude differential effects :: K. K. Illingworth produces a null result using a clever version of the MMX with a step in one mirror that dramatically improves resolution. The resolution is so good that most partial entrainment systems can be eliminated. : 1929 ‚Äì Michelson and F. G. Pease perform the Pearson experiment and produce a null result. : 1930 ‚Äì Georg Joos produces a null result using an extremely accurate interferometer placed entirely in vacuum. : 1932 ‚Äì the Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment uses an interferometer with arms of different lengths and not at right angles. They measure over several seasons and record on photographs to allow better post- measurement study. The Kennedy Thorndike experiment becomes one of the fundamental tests for SR, proving the independence of light speed wrt to the speed of the emitting source. The other two fundamental tests are Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment (proves light speed isotropy) and Ives‚ÄìStilwell experiment (proves time dilation) : 1934 ‚Äì Georg Joos publishes on the Michelson‚ÄìGale‚ÄìPearson experiment, stating that it is improbable that aether would be entrained by translational motion and not by rotational motion. : 1935 ‚Äì Hammar experiment disproves aether entrainment : 1951 ‚Äì Paul Dirac writes that currently-accepted quantum field theory requires an aether, although he never formulated this theory completely. =Debate slows= : 1955 ‚Äì R.

Kuerti performed an analysis of Miller's results and explained them as stemming from systematic errors (Shankland's explanation is now widely accepted). : 1958 ‚Äì Cedarholm, Havens, and Townes use two masers frequency locked to each other and send the light in two directions. They receive the null result. The experiment is not as precise as earlier light-based MMX experiments, but demonstrates a novel setup that would become much more accurate in the future. : 1964 ‚Äì Jaseja, Javan, Murray and Townes repeat the earlier experiment with newer and much more precise masers. : 1969 ‚Äì Shamir and Fox repeat the MMX experiment with the \\"arms\\" in acrylic glass waveguides and a highly stable laser as the source.

He first became known for directing almost all music videos by pop group ABBA, and subsequently became a feature film director. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for My Life as a Dog (Mitt liv som hund) (1985) and later for The Cider House Rules (1999). His other celebrated directorial works include What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) and Chocolat (2000). Early life Hallstr√∂m was born in Stockholm, Sweden. His father was a dentist and his mother was the writer Karin Lyberg (1907‚Äì2000). His maternal grandfather, Ernst Lyberg, was the Minister of Finance in the first cabinet of Carl Gustaf Ekman (1926‚Äì1928) and leader of the Liberal Party of Sweden (1930‚Äì1933). Career Hallstr√∂m attended Adolf Fredrik's Music School in Stockholm. He made his directorial debut in 1973, directing the comedy series \\"Pappas pojkar\\" for Swedish TV. He frequently collaborated with comic actors Magnus H√§renstam and Brasse Br√§nnstr√∂m during his Swedish period. Between 1974 and 1982, Hallstr√∂m worked with the Swedish group ABBA on many of their promotional videos and also directed their 1977 film, ABBA: The Movie. After the international success of My Life as a Dog (1985), for which he was nominated for Academy Awards for writing and directing, Hallstr√∂m has worked in American movies. His first American film was Once Around. His first notable American success was What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), starring Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. The latter's performance as a youth with disability earned him Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actor, and he won that award at the National Board of Review Awards. Hallstr√∂m's ability to elicit award-winning performances from the cast in a variety of stories adapted from novels was further solidified in his films over the next two decades. In 1999, Hallstr√∂m was nominated for an Academy Award for best director for The Cider House Rules (1999). The film earned six additional Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, with Michael Caine winning the Best Supporting Actor award and John Irving winning Best Adapted Screenplay. He followed that success the following year by directing Chocolat (2000), starring Johnny Depp, Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench. The film was a critical and box-office success, earning Golden Globe, BAFTA and Academy Award nominations, including for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Binoche and Dench won Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively at both the European Film Awards and the Screen Actors' Guild awards. His 2001 film The Shipping News, adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by E. Annie Proulx and starring Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, Julianne Moore and Cate Blanchett, won him a directorial Golden Bear award at the Berlin International Film Festival as well as Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for its lead and supporting actors. His 2011 film Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, based on the 2007 novel of the same name by Paul Torday and starring Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt, was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards in the Comedy or Musical category, including Best Motion Picture, Best Actor for McGregor, and Best Actress for Blunt. The film was nominated for the European Film Awards People's Choice Award. Hallstr√∂m at a Career Achievement Tribute at the 2013 Miami International Film Festival His 2012 film The Hypnotist was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. His 2017 film, A Dog's Purpose, based on the 2010 novel of the same name, is billed as \\"a celebration of the special connection between humans and their dogs\\". Other work Almost all of ABBA's promotional films were directed and shot by Hallstr√∂m, with the only (seven total) exceptions being \\"When I Kissed the Teacher\\" (1977); \\"Chiquitita\\" (1979), which was made by the BBC; \\"I Have a Dream\\" (1979); \\"On and On and On\\" (1980); \\"Lay All Your Love on Me\\" (1981) (Made by recycling material from older videos); \\"The Day Before You Came\\" (1982) and \\"Under Attack\\" (1982), which were both directed by Kjell Sundvall and Kjell- √Öke Andersson. The films for \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\" (1977), \\"Happy New Year\\" (1980) and \\"One of Us\\" (1981) all contained substantial scenes shot in Hallstr√∂m's own Stockholm apartment. In 1999, Hallstr√∂m also directed the music video for Northern Line's debut single \\"Run for Your Life\\". Personal life Hallstr√∂m married media personality and actress Malou Hallstr√∂m (died 3 February 2005) in 1974, with whom he has one child, Johan (born 1976). The couple divorced in 1981. In 1990, he met actress Lena Olin; they married on 18 March 1994. The couple currently reside in Bedford, New York, and raise two children, Tora (born 1995) and, a child from Lena Olin's first marriage to producer and director F. Auguste Rahmberg (born 1986). They also have a home located in the Stockholm archipelago. Hallstr√∂m is vegan.Randy Cordova, \\"Lasse talks 'Hundred Foot Journey',\\" The Arizona Republic, 5 August 2014.

It is the only genus in the monotypic family Montastraeidae. One common species, Montastraea cavernosa, is known as great star coral. It forms into massive boulders and sometimes develops into plates. Its polyps are the size of a human thumb and fully extend at night. Description Close-up with polyps extended Great star coral colonies form massive boulders and domes over 5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter in waters of shallow and moderate depths. In deeper waters, this coral has been observed growing as a plate formation. It is found throughout most reef environments, and is the predominant coral at depths of 40‚Äì100 feet (12.2-30.5 m). This coral occasionally has a fluorescent red or orange color during daytime; it has recently been suggested that this hue is due to phycoerythrin, a cyanobacterial protein. It appears that, in addition to symbiotic zooxanthella, this coral harbors endocellular symbiotic cyanobacteria, possibly to help it fix nitrogen. However more recently, Oswold et al. (2007) showed an absence of functional phycoerythrin in M. cavernosa. Dark brown, light brown, and white are typically the colors one sees when observing M. cavernosa in the wild. An interesting ecological finding published in 2015 by Marine Biology noted that when it came to the Coral bleaching of M. cavernosa, \\"conventional spectral reflectance techniques failed to discriminate white from bleached colonies.\\" Upon completion of a more meticulous reef survey conducted at the Bay of All Saints, it was revealed that \\"the proportion of bleached and white colonies is similar, suggesting coral reefs surveys may be overestimating the bleaching of M. cavernosa by nearly two-fold.\\" References Category:Scleractinia Category:Fauna of the Caribbean ","title":"Montastraea"},{"id":"904613","text":"Jonathan Charles Frederick, Hereditary Chief of the Miskito Nation, was the son of Princess Matilda, daughter of H.M.

Alternate names for the mythological Tsuchigumo include and . In the Kojiki and in Nihon Shoki, the name was phonetically spelled with the four kanji (for the four morae tsu-chi-gu-mo), and these words were frequently used in the fudoki of Mutsu, Echigo, Hitachi, Settsu, Bungo and Hizen as well as others. The Japanese name for large ground-dwelling tarantulas, ≈çtsuchigumo, is due to their perceived resemblance to the creature of the myth, rather than the myth being named for the spider. Japan has no native species of tarantula, and the similarities between the mythical and the actual creature‚Äîhuge wandering spiders with an obvious face that like to hide in burrows‚Äîwere entirely coincidental. The fact that the later iterations of the myth specifically refer to the body being that of a tiger, however, does imply that the description was influenced to some degree by the Chinese bird spider, which is commonly referred to as the \\"earth tiger\\" in its native habitat for its furry, prominently striped body and aggressive disposition. In history According to the 18th-century historian Motoori Norinaga, in ancient Japan, Tsuchigumo was used as a derogatory term against aborigines who did not show allegiance to the emperor of Japan. There is some debate on whether the mythical spider-creature or the historical clans came first. One theory is based on the knowledge that beginning with the earliest historical records, those who waged war against the imperial court were referred to as oni by the imperial court, both in scorn and as a way to demonize enemies of the court by literally referring to them as demons. Tsuchigumo may have been a pre-existing but obscure myth picked as the term of choice for a more humble threat to the empire, after which it was popularized. Alternately, the word tsuchigumo has been identified a derivation of an older derogatory term, tsuchigomori (ÂúüÈö†),Â•àËâØÂõΩÁ´ãÊñáÂåñË≤°Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ ‰ΩêÂéüÁúû „Äé‰ΩìÁ≥ª Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆÊ≠¥Âè≤ 1 Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆË™ïÁîü„Äè Â∞èÂ≠¶È§®„ÄÅ1987Âπ¥„ÄÅ178È†Å„ÄÇ„ÄÇ which roughly translates as \\"those who hide in the ground\\". This term refers to a common practice among many of the rural clans: utilizing existing cave systems and creating fortified hollow earthen mounds for both residential and military purposes.This implies that the use of the name for renegade clans began essentially as a pun, and over time tales surrounding a literal race of intelligent, occasionally anthropomorphic, spiders grew from this historical usage, first as allegory, then as myth. In the following examples from ancient historical records and accounts, tsuchigumo is used variously to describe well-known individual bandits, rebels, or unruly clan leaders, and also applied to clans as a whole. In some cases it is unclear in which way the term is being used. Its usage as a figurative term denotes that the person or clan referred to was defying Imperial authority in some covert but consistent fashion, generally by guerrilla warfare or actively eluding discovery. =Tsuchigumo of the Katsuragi= Of the clans referred to as tsuchigumo, those of the Mount Yamato Katsuragi are particularly well known. was said to be the remains where Emperor Jimmu captured tsuchigumo and buried their head, body and feet separately to prevent their grudges from harming the living. In historic Yamato Province, the unique physical characteristics of the tsuchigumo were that they were tailed people. In the Nihon Shoki, the founder of the Yoshino no Futo (ÂêâÈáéÈ¶ñ) were written to be \\"with a glowing tail,\\" the founder of Yoshino no Kuzu (ÂõΩÊ®î) were stated to \\"have tails and come along pushing rocks (Á£êÁü≥, iwa),\\" presenting the indigenous people of Yamato as non- humans. Even in the Kojiki, they shared a common trait with the people of Osaka (ÂøçÂùÇ) (now Sakurai city) in that they were \\"tsuchigumo (ÂúüÈõ≤) who have grown tails.\\" =Records from the Keiko generation and others= In the Hizen no Kuni Fudoki, there is an article writing that when Emperor Keiko made an imperial visit to Shiki island (ÂøóÂºèÂ≥∂, Hirado island) (year 72 in the legends), the expedition encountered a pair of islands in the middle of sea. Seeing smoke rising from inland, the Emperor ordered an investigation of the islands, and discovered that the tsuchigumo Oomimi (Â§ßËÄ≥) lived on the smaller island, and Taremimi (ÂûÇËÄ≥) lived on the larger island. When both were captured and about to be killed, Oomimi and Taremimi lowered their foreheads to the ground and fell prostrate, and pleaded, \\"we will from now on make offerings to the emperor\\" and presented fish products and begged for pardon. Also, in the Bungo no Kuni Fudoki, there appeared many tsuchigumo, such as the Itsuma-hime (‰∫îÈ¶¨Âß´) of Itsuma mountain (‰∫îÈ¶¨Â±±), the Uchisaru (ÊâìÁå¥), Unasaru (È†∏Áå¥), Yata (ÂÖ´Áî∞), Kunimaro (ÂúãÊë©‰æ∂), and Amashino (Á∂≤Á£ØÈáé), of Negi field (Á¶∞ÂÆúÈáé), the Shinokaomi (Â∞èÁ´πÈπøËá£) of Shinokaosa (Â∞èÁ´πÈπøÂ••), and the Ao (Èùí) and Shiro (ÁôΩ) of Nezumi cavern (Èº†„ÅÆÁ£êÁ™ü). Other than these, there is also the story of Tsuchigumo Yasome (ÂúüËúòËõõÂÖ´ÂçÅÂ•≥), who made preparations in the mountains to resist against the imperial court, but was utterly defeated. This word \\"Yaso\\" (ÂÖ´ÂçÅ), literally \\"eighty,\\" is a figurative term for \\"many,\\" so this story is interpreted to mean that many of the female chief class opposed the Yamato imperial court, and met a heroic end, choosing to die alongside their men. In the story, Yaso, one local female chief, was greatly popular among the people, and she separated her allies from those resisting the imperial forces. Tsuchigumo Yasome's whereabouts were reported to the emperor, and for her efforts she was spared.Áæ©Ê±üÊòéÂ≠ê„ÄéÂè§‰ª£Â•≥ÊÄßÂè≤„Å∏„ÅÆÊãõÂæÖ‚Äï‚Äï‚ÄúÂ¶π„ÅÆÂäõ‚Äù„ÇíË∂Ö„Åà„Å¶„Äè According to writings in the Nihon Shoki, in the 12th year of emperor Keiko (year 82 in the legends), in winter, October, emperor Keiko arrived in Hayami town, Ookita (now Ooita), and heard from the queen of the land, Hayatsuhime (ÈÄüÊ¥•Â™õ) that there was a big cave in the mountain, called the Nezumi cave, where two tsuchigumo, Shiro and Ao, lived. In Negino (Á¶∞ÁñëÈáé), Naoiri, they were informed of three more tsuchigumo named Uchizaru (ÊâìÁåø), Yata (ÂÖ´Áî∞), and Kunimaro (ÂõΩÊë©‰æ∂, ÂõΩÈ∫ªÂëÇ).

The large version continues for 2 more images. From the Japanese middle ages (Kamakura/Muromachi/Azuchi-Momoyama periods, or the late 12th to the early 17th centuries) onward, tsuchigumo began to be depicted as giant, monstrous spiders. Works such as the 14th-century picture scroll Tsuchigumo S≈çshi and the 15th-century Noh drama Tsuchigumo envision various versions of a legend in which Minamoto no Yorimitsu, also known as Raik≈ç, a famous 10th-century general and ancestor of the Minamoto clan defeat an enormous spider y≈çkai referred to as a tsuchigumo or yamagumo (\\"earth spider\\" or \\"mountain spider\\", respectively). In some versions, Yorimitsu and his retainer Watanabe no Tsuna pursue the spider, which takes various forms such as a beautiful woman, and when they defeat it they cut it open and skulls pour out of its torso, while in others, Yorimitsu is incapacitated and a young retainer hunts the spider down in his stead. A commonly cited early text depicting the y≈çkai tsuchigumo is The Tale of the Heike, or rather some variant texts of the Heike. This work, which was passed down orally among biwa lute players, has a complicated textual history and numerous variants, including the massively expanded Genpei J≈çsuiki, and some versions include an extended passages on swords, known as the \\"Sword Scroll\\", or tsurugi-no-maki. This is regarded as one of the most important and influential texts that depict the conflict between Yorimitsu and the tsuchigumo, and is the source for many later artistic representations. Tsuchigumo S≈çshi (see scrolling image below) interestingly contains a visual depiction that doesn't appear to match the accompanying text, as the text has Yorimitsu and Tsuna take down an enormous, 60-foot monster that they later realize is a giant spider, but the imagery shows them doing battle with two oni, or ogre-demons, resembling Gozu and Mezu, which perhaps represent another of the tsuchigumos transformations.

Photo published in the Cochin Government Royal War Efforts Souvenir in 1938. Nair woman wearing Mundum Neriyathum, painting by Raja Ravi Varma A man wearing mundu and melmundu The mundu (pronounced ) is a garment worn around the waist in the Indian states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, the Laccadives archipelago, and the Indian Ocean island nation of Maldives. It is closely related to sarongs like dhotis and lungis. It is normally woven in cotton and coloured white or cream. The colour is dependent on whether the cotton is bleached or unbleached. A khaddar mundu is made using handlooms. When unbleached, the mundu is called \\"neriyathu\\". In modern times, two types of mundu are prevalent‚Äîthe single and the double. A single mundu is wrapped only once around the waist, while the double one is folded in half before wearing. A mundu is usually starched before use. Men A mundu usually has a line of comparatively thicker cloth woven into it near the border called the kara. The kara can be coloured and comes in various sizes. There is also double coloured and ornamental kara (a strip of colour at the end of the mundu). & Costumes Of Kerala. For more ceremonial occasions (like weddings), a mundu has a golden embroidery known as kasavu. The wearer highlights the 'kara' by carefully folding the end of the mundu. The kara generally appears on the right-hand side of the person, though styles with the kara on the left side are prevalent. Unspoken rules of etiquette govern the way the mundu is worn. Men will often fold the garment in half to resemble a short skirt when working, cycling, etc., but it is considered disrespectful to speak to women or one's social superiors with the mundu folded up this way, revealing the legs from the knee down. When faced with such a social situation, the fold of the mundu is loosened with an imperceptible flick and it flutters down to cover the legs completely. Sometimes a belt will be used; a popular Velcro belt that comes in either green or black has yellow pockets to keep valuables and hold the mundu (or lungi) secure. The 'melmundu' is an upper garment similar to the '[neriyathu]' or '[thundu]'. that is worn by women; 'mundu' and 'melmundu' are part of the traditional Malayali costume worn by men. Despite the considerable influence of western dressing forms in South Indian culture, Hindu traditional ceremonies of Kerala (some Hindu castes in other south Indian states) it is mandatory for the men to wear the Mundu. For Hindu Marriages Men has to wear Mundu along with either shirt or a 'Mel Mundu'. Mundu along with uthareeyam is worn during religious occasions by Kerala Brahmins. It is also considered appropriate for men to wear Mundu during their visits to the temples and attending religious functions, though it is not mandatory at all places. However, it is a mandatory requirement to wear mundu and Mel-mundu for men to visit some famous temples in Kerala like the Guruvayur Temple, the Padmanabhaswamy Temple) etc. For the convenience of the devotees, temple managements do provide these on rent bear the temple premises itself. Women A variant called a mundum-neriyathum is used more often by women. The mundum-neriyathum is a set of two mundus, both having matching kara. The set contains a lower garment similar to those worn by men. The upper mundu, worn with a blouse, is wrapped once around the waist and upper body and left hanging from the left shoulder, resembling a saree. This is often called a set-mundu. This is usually worn during festivals or special occasions. In Kerala, a veshti is a small piece of cloth (generally put on the shoulders) along with a mundu, for formal occasions. Kerala Lungi In Kerala the Lungi, locally known as Kaili or Kalli Mundu, is worn by both men and women. It is considered a casual dress or working dress of labourers. Most men in Kerala use lungi as home dress or sleep dress. Lungis are generally colourful, and with varying designs. Lungis are not used during occasions such as weddings or other religious ceremonies. Saffron-coloured mundus are also known and kaavi mundu.

Knox argued that global climate models underestimated the climate response to the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The study also contended that global temperature returned to normal much faster after the eruption than the models had predicted. A 2007 paper by Douglass and coworkers questioned the reliability of 22 of the most commonly used global climate models analyzed by Benjamin D. Santer and used by the IPCC to predict accelerated warming in the troposphere. The study had originally been submitted to Geophysical Research Letters the previous year, but was rejected in September 2006 on Santer's recommendation. Santer and 17 co-authors later rebutted Douglass' paper. Douglass was named a fellow of Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1963. He is a Fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences.

News is typically reported in a series of individual stories that are presented by one or more anchors. A news program can include live or recorded interviews by field reporters, expert opinions, opinion poll results, and occasional editorial content.  History  News broadcasts in the United States were initially transmitted over the radio. NBC began broadcasts in November 1926, with CBS entering production on the 25th of September, 1927. Both initially discussed similar topics, such as election results, presidential inaugurations, and other matters of concern to the general public. However, NBC soon emerged as the dominant force for entertainment talent. In response, CBS President William S Paley focused on giving the news. Both broadcasters faced stiff competition from the newspapers, who didn't want radio news to render their medium obsolete. This standoff would continue until after World War II, with radio broadcasters successfully keeping their medium active. Chief among these reporters was Edward Roscoe Murrow, whose reports from London kept the American public focused on a war far from home. Evolution From their beginnings until around 1995, evening television news broadcasts continued featuring serious news stories right up to the end of the program, as opposed to later broadcasts with such anchors as Katie Couric, Brian Williams and Diane Sawyer. In the early-21st-century news programs especially those of commercial networks tended to become less oriented on \\"hard\\" news, and often regularly included \\"feel-good stories\\" or humorous reports as the last items on their newscasts, as opposed to news programs transmitted thirty years earlier, such as the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Editorial type A special category of news programs are entirely editorial in format. These host polemic debates between pundits of various ideological philosophies.

It is generally considered not to have a literal equivalent in English. Meaning Sisu is extraordinary determination in the face of extreme adversity, and courage that is presented typically in situations where success is unlikely. It expresses itself in taking action against the odds, and displaying courage and resoluteness in the face of adversity; in other words, deciding on a course of action, and then adhering to it even if repeated failures ensue. It is in some ways similar to equanimity, though ‚Äò‚Äôsisu‚Äô‚Äô entails an element of grim stress management. The English \\"gutsy\\" invokes a metaphor related to this one (and found in still other languages): the Finnish usage derives from sisus, translated as \\"interior\\", and as \\"entrails‚Äù or ‚Äúguts\\"; a closely related English concept evokes the metaphor grit, sharing some denoting elements; still, the Finnish concept also entails \\"stress management\\", and passion for a long-term goal. Sisu may have an element (not always present) of passion Abstract) unlike in the case of grit (as defined by Dr. Angela Duckworth). As a psychological capacity Sisu is a term which dates back hundreds of years and is described as being integral to understanding Finnish culture. It is a term for going beyond one's mental or physical capacity, and is a central part of the country's culture and collective discourse. However, hardly any empirical research has been done to explore the meaning of this construct as a possible psychological strength resource, and it has long seemed to have a somewhat elusive nature. It has been usually studied as a cultural component among Finns and Finnish Americans, Adapted from but as a psychological construct has remained under-researched and poorly defined. As early as the 1940s, attempts were made to grasp the essence of sisu. The Finnish newspaper Uusi Suomi reached out to its audience for their definition of sisu, and conducted a contest. Uusi-Suomi wrote: \\"All of us somewhat know what sisu is ... [it] has for long been a topic for discussion here in Finland and abroad. But how do we describe and define what sisu really is?\\". The quest for putting the essence of sisu into a definitive form has evidently been around for almost a century. More recently, William R. Aho, professor emeritus of sociology at Rhodes College, raised questions about sisu, and stated that \\"we need a good deal of organized, systematic scientific research to discover the scope and depth of sisu, geographically and situationally, and the depth and strength of both the beliefs and behaviors surrounding and emanating from sisu.\\" A study aimed to fill in that gap, and offer a more precise language for discussing the term. While examining sisu within the psychological framework, it sought to render it less elusive as a construct by giving it an easily citable definition rooted within the field of positive psychology. Sisu as a psychological power potential was introduced for the first time in the 3rd World Congress on Positive Psychology in Los Angeles on 29 June 2013. In the study, sisu is described as a psychological key competence which enables extraordinary action to overcome a mentally or physically challenging situation. Sisu also contributes to what has been named the action mindset; a consistent, courageous approach toward challenges which at first seem to exceed our capacities. A related on-line survey (conducted between March and May 2013) tracked the cultural representations of sisu among contemporary Finns (and Finnish Americans) and revealed that sisu is still deeply valued, and that there is public interest for cultivating this strength capacity as well. All in all, the study received 1,060 responses. Among the main findings was the perception of sisu as a reserve of power, which enables extraordinary action to overcome mentally or physically challenging situations (rather than being the ability to pursue long-term goals and be persistent). To elaborate on the function of sisu: it is a powerful psychological potential which enables the individual to tap into mental strength beyond their pre-conceived resources. Wielding sisu in the face of adversity helps individuals push through what first seemed like the boundaries of their mental or physical capacities. Furthermore, sisu is an action mindset which equips the individual to choose to take on challenges beyond their observed capacities. It provides the final empowering push when we would otherwise hesitate to act. Sisu can be conceptualized as taking action against the odds. Additionally, even though 53% of the respondents believed some people innately have more sisu, a majority of 83% of the respondents believed that sisu is a flexible quality which can be cultivated through conscious practice (rather than a being a fixed quality), and the majority of respondents were interested in developing this capacity. Sisu is not always an entirely positive quality. In Finnish, pahansisuinen literally translated means one possessing bad sisu, a description of a hostile and malignant person. Furthermore, the answers from the sisu survey indicate that there can be too much sisu, and according to the survey answers this leads to bull-headedness, foolhardiness, self-centeredness and inflexible thinking. The study suggests that sisu should be informed by reason and cultivated (and practiced) with self-compassion. Like any trait or psychological capacity, sisu is the complex product of genetic, psychological, biological and social factors, and its comprehensive understanding will require studies from multiple scientific perspectives. Finland may have the initial monopoly on sisu as a cultural construct, but it is a universal capacity and the potential for it exists within all individuals. The transformative power of narrative is widely acknowledged Through the process of social transfer of narratives, values become embedded within a culture and connected to the thought processes of its individuals. People, through their choices and actions, bring these narratives to life in a dynamic process which can prime the behavior of an entire nation. Fostering sisu may very well be embedded in such behavior, rather than being a genetical trait which one is born with. Sisu is a new term in the field of positive psychology, and it may contribute to our understanding of the determinants of resilience, as well as of achievement and the good life. It is suggested that positive psychology research could benefit from focusing future interest on the unique cultural resource of sisu that individuals across the globe can leverage; as well as actively examining relevant constructs from other cultures. Cultural significance Sisu has been described as \\"the word that explains Finland\\", and the Finns' \\"favorite word\\"‚Äî\\"the most wonderful of all their words.\\". As defined by Roman Schatz in his book From Finland with Love (2005), sisu is an ability to finish a task successfully. During the famous Winter War of 1939‚Äì1940, the Finnish perseverance in the face of the invasion by the Soviet Union popularized this word in English for a generation. In what may have been the first use of sisu in the English language, on 8 January 1940, Time magazine reported: Even in 2009, sisu has been described as so essential to the Finnish national character that \\"to be a real Finn\\" you must have it: \\"willpower, tenacity, persistency.\\" =Examples= Singled out for kudos for this attribute was \\"Finland's wiry old peasant President, Ky√∂sti Kallio‚Äî73 years old and full of sisu (courage)‚Äîlast week thought up a new scheme to get supplies for his country.\\" It was also used to describe the Finnish stubbornness in sticking to its loose alliance with The Third Reich from 1941 to 1944 (in the war against the Soviet Union, which had attacked Finland on 30 November 1939): During the 1952 Summer Olympics, sisu was further described in the context of the continuing Cold War looming over the Finnish capital city of Helsinki: Well into the 1960s, sisu was used to describe the Finnish resistance to the invasion of 20 to 30 years prior and its continuing discontents. In 1960, Austin Goodrich's book, Study in Sisu: Finland's Fight for Independence, was published by Ballantine. Also in 1960, a notable reviewer of Griffin Taylor's novel, Mortlake, wrote: In 2004, Jorma Ollila, CEO of Nokia, described his company's \\"guts\\" by using the word sisu: A Finnish heavy metal rock singer injured himself, without noticing, at a concert, to which a reviewer wrote: The concept is widely known in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is home to a large concentration of Americans of Finnish descent. This has extended to include a popular bumper sticker saying \\"got sisu?\\" or simply \\"SISU\\". In 2010, a 63-year-old Yooper named Joe Paquette Jr. of Munising, Michigan, walked 425 miles to the Detroit Lions training facility to bring the spirit of sisu to the team. The non-profit documentary SISU: Family, Love and Perseverance from Finland to America was made by Finnish- American filmmaker Marko Albrecht. The documentary looks at sisu through a powerful profile of his late mother, his Finnish-American family, and his uncle Heikki's tragic fight against pancreatic cancer. The film has been a called a time-capsule of modern Finnish-American life. In a 2008 episode of Top Gear, F1 racer Mika H√§kkinen described sisu to James May: As a proper name Due to its cultural significance, sisu is a common element of brand names in Finland. For example, there are Sisu trucks (and Sisu armored vehicles), the icebreaker MS Sisu, a brand of strong-tasting pastilles manufactured by Leaf and Suomen Sisu, a Finnish nationalist organisation with connections to other far-right groups. Sisu is also a male name with increasing popularity. More than 2,000 Finnish men have this name, most of them being born after 2010. The son of The Dudesons's Jukka Hilden is called Sisu. Globally, there are several fitness-related organizations and endurance sports teams such as the Sisu Project based in Haverhill and Worcester, Massachusetts, USA that carry the name sisu and base their philosophy on the characteristics included in the concept sisu, including courage, integrity, honesty, and determination. Mount Sisu is the name of a mountain first ascended by mountain climbers Veikka Gustafsson and Patrick Degerman in the Antarctic. Sisu is also the name of a London-based hedge-fund, operated by several directors including Joy Seppala. The firm bought the football club Coventry City FC in 2007. In Norway there is a seafood company named Sisu Seafood Norway AS that exports Norwegian seafoods. On the Western end of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the SISU Ski Fest is a popular annual event, highlighting a 21- and 42-kilometer cross-country ski race \\"finishing\\" in historic downtown Ironwood. According to the Finnish Population Register Centre's name service, over 2,000 Finnish men have the first name \\"Sisu\\". The name gained popularity especially in the 2000s and 2010s. In season 2 of McLaren's animated program Tooned Sisu is stated as a planet and the true origin of two-time Formula One Drivers' Champion Mika H√§kkinen (and possibly 2007 Drivers' Champion Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen as well based on a Sisu scene near the end of the episode in question). H√§kkinen and R√§ikk√∂nen are both Finnish and have driven for McLaren; H√§kkinen won both of his titles with the team while R√§ikk√∂nen won his after leaving McLaren for Ferrari.

The southern section runs for from Flagstaff, Arizona, to the southern entrance of Yellowstone National Park. The northern section runs for from the northern entrance of Yellowstone National Park in Montana, ending at the Canadian border. Unnumbered roads through Yellowstone connect the two sections. Before 1992, US 89 was a Canada‚ÄìMexico, border-to-border highway that ended at Nogales, Arizona, on its southern end. Sometimes called the National Park Highway, US 89 links seven national parks across the Mountain West. In addition, 14 other national park areas, mostly national monuments, are also reachable from this backbone of the Rockies. National Geographic named US Route 89 the No. 1 Driver's Drive in the world. Route description =Arizona= US 89 crossing Glen Canyon in Arizona US 89 begins at Flagstaff, Arizona. The highway proceeds north passing near Grand Canyon National Park and through the Navajo Nation. Near the Utah state line, the highway splits into US 89 and US 89A. The alternate is the original highway; what is now the main highway was constructed in the 1960s to serve the Glen Canyon Dam. The two highways rejoin in Kanab, Utah. The main branch passes over the Colorado River just south of the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell near Page, and then it enters Utah. The US 89A branch crosses the Colorado River at Navajo Bridge and then skirts the North Rim of the Grand Canyon before entering Utah. National Park Highway‚Äîstarting just north of the Mexican border in Arizona is the Tumacacori National Monument. Saguaro National Park is the first national park by title, in Tucson. Short links from Highway 89 take motorists to the Casa Grande National Monument and the Hohokam Pima National Monument, before reaching Phoenix. Approaching Flagstaff there is a quartet of parks, including Tuzigoot National Monument, Walnut Canyon National Monument, Sunset Crater National Monument, and Wupatki National Monument. North of Flagstaff is the Grand Canyon National Park, the second of the seven national parks along this highway. Continuing northward, U.S. 89 divides into U.S. 89 and U.S. 89A. The northern mainline route passes by Page and through the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area before leaving the state and Lake Powell. US 89A turns westward, and it serves Lees Ferry, and then it goes over the Kaibab Plateau, connecting with Arizona State Route 67 at Jacob Lake, Arizona, then with Arizona State Route 389 in Fredonia, before turning north into the state of Utah. State Route 67 will take travelers to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, while State Route 389 serves the Pipe Spring National Monument, which is the last National Park Service area in Arizona.National Park System, US Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. =Utah= U.S. Route 89 at the border of Arizona and Utah The first city in Utah along either US 89 or US 89A is Kanab where the two routes re-unite. From Kanab US 89 proceeds north passing by Zion National Park, Cedar Breaks National Monument, and Bryce Canyon National Park. It eventually enters Sevier County and the Sanpete Valleys. The highway then passes by Thistle, a ghost town that was destroyed by a lake resulting from a landslide in 1983. The highway then enters the Wasatch Front where US 89 becomes the main street for many cities in Utah. The highway is also often in the shadows of Interstate 15 (I-15) during its route along the Wasatch Front. US 89 runs concurrently with I-15 from Bountiful to Farmington, where it departs and runs at the base of the Wasatch Mountains until it reaches Ogden. In Ogden, the highway is Washington Boulevard. From Ogden the highway runs north until it meets US 91 at Brigham City, where it turns east to serve Cache Valley and Logan, concurrent with US 91. In Logan, US 89 forms the southern portion of Main Street before splitting off to the east, passing by the campus of the Utah State University. The highway next proceeds up Logan Canyon to Bear Lake where the highway exits Utah. Two sections of US 89 in Utah have been designated Scenic Byways. The Kanab to Mt. Carmel and Long Valley Scenic Byway is a designated Utah Scenic Byway. The segment from Logan to Bear Lake is designated as the Logan Canyon Scenic Byway by the National Scenic Byways project. The section of US 89 in Utah, other than concurrencies with I-70, I-15, US 6, and US 91, is defined in the Utah Code Annotated ¬ß 72-4-114(8). Utah is dominated by the Colorado Plateau. Along US 89 are Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, and Cedar Breaks National Monument. Although not readily adjacent to US 89, Capitol Reef National Park is accessible from US 89. US 89 leaves northern Utah well north of Salt Lake City and Timpanogos Cave National Monument and the Golden Spike National Historic Site. =Idaho= US 89 heading south along the Idaho/Wyoming state line In Idaho, the highway partially circumnavigates Bear Lake, which straddles the Utah‚ÄìIdaho state line. =Wyoming= In Wyoming, US 89 passes through many scenic sites including Grand Teton National Park, the Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River Canyon, and the Star Valley. Passing northward along the western border of Wyoming with Idaho, US 89 enters the Grand Teton National Park. Here, US 89 is the backbone visitor highway for two U.S. National Parks. Leaving the Tetons, the road enters a lesser known park, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, before ending at the South Entrance of Yellowstone National Park. An unnumbered park road connects the two sections of US 89 through Yellowstone. =Montana= US 89 enters Montana at the North Entrance of Yellowstone National Park. It traverses the width of the state before approaching Glacier National Park. At St. Mary, Montana, US 89 is the access highway to Glacier Route One, also known as the Going-to-the- Sun Road. The Kings Hill Scenic Byway passes through the Little Belt Mountains in the Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana. The route is home to a wide variety of wildlife and provides many recreational opportunities for travelers on the route. The byway is a route that begins on US 89 at its junction with US 12. From the junction of the byway it travels north through the Lewis and Clark National Forest through the communities of Neihart and Monarch and on to its junction with US 87. The route offers access to the Showdown Ski Area and Sluice Boxes State Park. The route travels over the Kings Hill Pass which snow removal crews work to keep open throughout the winter season. The northern terminus of US 89 is at the Canadian border. There, the highway continues into Canada as Alberta Highway 2 - The Queen Elizabeth 2 Highway. History When US 89 was first created, it ran as far north as Spanish Fork, Utah. This was the case until 1934, when it was extended to more or less of its current alignment up to the Piegan Port of Entry north of Babb, Montana. North of Great Falls, Montana, US 89's route was originally in the US 87 corridor until 1934. US 87 ended in Great Falls until 1945, when it was extended to its current northern terminus near Havre, Montana. Prior to 1992, the southern terminus of US 89 was at Nogales, Arizona, and the highway proceeded to Flagstaff, Arizona, along what is now I-19, State Route 79, US 60, US 93, and State Route 89\\\\. In addition, there was another US 89A in Arizona between Prescott and Flagstaff on which is now State Route 89A. In central Arizona, the need for a north‚Äìsouth U.S. Highway was largely superseded by the completion of I-17, which now carries the bulk of the traffic and all of the heavy trucks along this north‚Äìsouth corridor. I-17 connects I-40 in Flagstaff with I-10 in Phoenix, Arizona, along a very hilly route that also passes through the Verde Valley. US 89 in central Utah was discontinuous for most of 1983 due to a landslide that destroyed the town of Thistle and closed the highway for about eight months. From early 2013 to mid 2015, US 89 was closed approximately south of Page, due to a geological event that caused the roadway to buckle and subside. Traffic was being re-routed via of secondary and tertiary roads on the Navajo Nation. US 89T opened on August 29, 2013, a paved portion of a Navajo route to serve as a long-term bypass of the closed section.

The highway starts in rural Wasco County in Central Oregon at an intersection with US 97\\\\. US 197 travels north as a continuation of The Dalles-California Highway No. 4 through the cities of Maupin, Tygh Valley, and Dufur to The Dalles. Within The Dalles, the highway becomes concurrent with US 30 and intersects Interstate 84 (I-84) before it crosses over the Columbia River on The Dalles Bridge into Washington. The highway continues through the neighboring city of Dallesport in Klickitat County and terminates at a junction with State Route 14 (SR 14). US 197 was established in 1952 using the existing The Dalles-California Highway, itself created as a part of the initial named Oregon highways in 1917. US 197 traveled from its current northern terminus at Dallesport to US 97 in Maryhill along Primary State Highway 8 (PSH 8) and US 830, successors to the original State Road 8 designated along the corridor in 1907. The Dallesport‚ÄìMaryhill section was transferred to SR 14 in 1979, but was not recognized by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) until 2006. Route description US 197 runs in Oregon and Washington and is maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). =Oregon= Deschutes River into Maupin in rural Wasco County US 197 begins at an intersection with US 97 at Shaniko Junction in Wasco County, located between the cities of Madras and Shaniko in Central Oregon. The highway, a continuation of The Dalles-California Highway No. 4, travels northwest over the Criterion Summit and down along Stag Canyon through the community of Criterion towards Maupin. US 197 crosses the Deschutes River and a BNSF rail line on a warren truss bridge, becoming Deschutes Avenue as it passes South Wasco County High School and through the city of Maupin. The highway continues west into the Juniper Flat and intersects Oregon Route 216 (OR 216), designated as Wapinitia Highway No. 44, and forms a concurrency. US 197 and OR 216 travel north and northwest to Tygh Valley, where OR 216 leaves the concurrency and heads east on Sherars Bridge Highway No. 290 towards Grass Valley. The lone highway continues north up Butler Canyon onto Tygh Ridge, passing through the Tygh Grade Summit. US 197 travels east of Dufur and down into the Columbia River Gorge, entering the city of The Dalles. The highway begins a concurrency with US 30, traveling north over an east‚Äìwest BNSF rail line to a diamond interchange with I-84. US 197 leaves the interchange and the state of Oregon on The Dalles Bridge, crossing over the Columbia River into Washington. An ODOT survey measuring traffic volume for any average day of the year, expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), was conducted in 2011 on US 197 and calculated that the busiest section of the highway in Oregon was on The Dalles Bridge, serving 5,800 vehicles, while the least busiest section of the highway was north of its terminus at US 97, serving 390 vehicles. =Washington= US 197 is carried by The Dalles Bridge over the Columbia River into Washington US 197 enters Washington on The Dalles Bridge, a steel cantilever truss bridge that crosses the Columbia River downstream of The Dalles Dam, and travels into Dallesport in Klickitat County. The highway continues north past Columbia Gorge Regional Airport to its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 14. US 197 is defined by the Washington State Legislature as SR 197, part of the Revised Code of Washington as ¬ß47.17.382. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume, expressed in terms of AADT. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the Washington section of US 197 served between 3,700 and 6,100 vehicles, mostly on The Dalles Bridge. History US 197 northbound on Tygh Grade between Tygh Valley and Dufur US 197 within Washington was added to the state highway system in 1907 as State Road 8, later designated as PSH 8 in 1937, traveling east along the Columbia River from Vancouver to Maryhill. US 197 within Oregon is designated as a segment of The Dalles-California Highway No. 4, created as part of the initial named state highway system, adopted by the Oregon State Highway Commission on November 27, 1917. The highway traveled south from The Dalles through Central Oregon to the California state line south of Klamath Falls. Under the United States Numbered Highway system, approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on November 11, 1926, State Road 8 in Washington was co-signed with US 830 from Vancouver to Maryhill and The Dalles-California Highway in Oregon was co-signed with US 97 from Shaniko Junction to the California state line. The Oregon State Highway Department created a numbered state highway system to complement the U.S. route system on May 18, 1937, and The Dalles-California Highway from Shaniko Junction to The Dalles was numbered as OR 50. OR 50 was renumbered to OR 23 on May 26, 1950, and became the Oregon section of US 197 when it was established in 1952. US 197 traveled north onto the newly constructed The Dalles Bridge over the Columbia River to US 830 and PSH 8 northeast of Dallesport and traveled east with the two highways to end at US 97 in Maryhill. US 830 and its concurrency with US 197 were removed from the U.S. route system in 1968, leaving US 197 concurrent with the successor to PSH 8, SR 14, after the 1964 state highway renumbering. The concurrency with SR 14 was removed from the Washington state highway system in 1979, but remained as a part of US 197 as defined by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) until September 22, 2006.

It has an operations center in St. Louis Park, Minnesota and regional and local offices around the world. MoneyGram businesses are divided into two categories: Global Funds Transfers and Financial Paper Products. The company provides its service to individuals and businesses through a network of agents and financial institutions. In 2014, MoneyGram was the second largest provider of money transfers in the world. The company operates in more than 200 countries and territories with a global network of about 347,000 agent offices.  History  MoneyGram International formed as a result of two businesses merging, Minneapolis-based Travelers Express and Denver-based Integrated Payment Systems Inc. MoneyGram was first established as a subsidiary of Integrated Payment Systems and afterwards became independent company before it was acquired by Travelers in 1998. In 2004, Travelers Express became what is known today as MoneyGram International. = Travelers Express (1940‚Äì1997) = The Minneapolis-based Travelers Express Co. Inc. was founded in 1940. In 1965, Travelers Express was acquired by The Greyhound Corporation (now known as Viad Corp) and became the nation's largest provider of money orders before initiating a company reorganization plan in 1993. =MoneyGram Systems (1988‚Äì1997)= MoneyGram was formed in 1988 as a subsidiary of Integrated Payment Systems Inc. Integrated Payment Systems was a subsidiary of First Data Corporation, which was itself a subsidiary of American Express. In 1992, First Data was spun off from American Express and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. First Data Corporation later merged with First Financial, the owners of rival Western Union. In order to approve the merger, the Federal Trade Commission forced First Data to sell Integrated Payment Systems. Thomas Cook Global Foreign Exchange, under the stewardship of John Bavister, launched a re-engineered money transfer service in 1994. Branded as MoneyGram, the venture saw the partnering of the global travel giant with First Data Corp. In 1996, Integrated Payment Systems, the nation's second largest non-bank consumer money transfer business, became its own publicly traded company and was renamed MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc. In 1997, James F. Calvano, former president of Western Union, became MoneyGram Payment Systems CEO. By the late 1990s, MoneyGram Payment Systems had served customers at over 22,000 locations in 100 countries. Moneygram International Ltd. was established in 1997 by MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc. and Thomas Cook, a year after the company had gone public. At the time when MoneyGram International was established, MoneyGram Payment Systems owned 51 percent of the company, while the other 49 percent was owned by the Thomas Cook Group. =MoneyGram International (1998‚Äìpresent)= In April 1998, Viad Corp acquired MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc. for $287 million. MoneyGram was then folded into Viad's Travelers Express in Minneapolis. In November 2000, the Moneygram brand and business was sold to Travelex as part of its acquisition of Thomas Cook Financial Services for ¬£400m. In 2003, Travelers Express gained full ownership of the MoneyGram network, including MoneyGram International. Later that year, Viad spun off Travelers Express as an independent company. In January 2004 and Travelers Express was renamed to MoneyGram International Inc. In June 2004, Viad sold MoneyGram and it became a publicly traded, individual entity. By 2006, MoneyGram International had expanded internationally to include over 96,000 agents in regions such as the Asian-Pacific, Eastern Europe, and Central America. The company had also introduced additional services such as bill payment and online money transfers. During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, MoneyGram's shares fell 96 percent from 2007 to 2009. It lost more than $1.6 billion from investments in securities backed by risky mortgages in 2008, and the losses led the company to sell a majority stake to Thomas H. Lee Partners and Goldman Sachs in exchange for a cash infusion. During the drop, U.S. Bancorp shifted its money transfer services to Western Union. The company became profitable again in 2009. Amid MoneyGram's turnaround, Pamela Patsley became the executive chairwoman of the company in January 2009 and was later named CEO in September of that year. In November 2010, MoneyGram officially relocated its global headquarters to the city of Dallas, Texas. The company continues to maintain global operations and information technology centers in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2013, MoneyGram began considering a sale. In 2014, MoneyGram lost a relationship with Wal-Mart Stores and then began restructuring to cut costs. From their peak in 2013 until late 2015, shares fell about 70%. MoneyGram closed a call center in Lakewood, Colorado resulting in over 500 layoffs. Furthermore, MoneyGram closed its 376-person Brooklyn Center operation in 2015. Moneygram has moved numerous positions to Warsaw, Poland from its Colorado and Minnesota locations for cut costs further. In 2015, the company's agent network in Africa reached 25,000 locations, including an agreement with the Mauritius Post Office. Between late October 2016 and January 2017, MoneyGram's shares doubled in value. On January 26, 2017, Ant Financial Services Group announced a deal to acquire MoneyGram International for $880 million; the deal subsequently collapsed after it was rejected by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. On June 17th 2019, Moneygram announced they were partnering with Ripple to utilize the digital asset XRP for cross-border remittance. In July 2020, Digital Financial Services LLC and MoneyGram have collaborated to provide overseas remittance services in the UAE. Through this partnership, eWallet consumers will enable real-time foreign money transfers to friends and families in more than 200 countries and territories around the world through an vast network of mobile wallet providers, bank account deposit facilities and more than 350,000 walk- in locations.

Legal cases In November 2012, MoneyGram International admitted to anti-money laundering and wire fraud violations. MoneyGram services were used by unrelated parties involved in mass marketing and consumer phishing scams that defrauded thousands of victims in the United States. As a part of the settlement, MoneyGram created a $100 million victim compensation fund. MoneyGram also retained a corporate monitor who will report regularly to the United States Department of Justice for a five-year trial period. If MoneyGram fulfills its obligations under the settlement, prosecutors will seek dismissal of the charges of aiding and abetting wire fraud.\\"Federal judge OKs MoneyGram fraud deal, $100M fund.\\" ap.org. November 28, 2012. Retrieved on March 21, 2013. MoneyGram also terminated any agents complicit in the 2009 scams and invested more than $84 million in improvements to the company's consumer anti-fraud systems and consumer awareness education. In February 2015, MoneyGram assisted a Houston reporter in shutting down a fraud scam after discovering a scheme that utilized an account with the company. In February 2016, MoneyGram agreed it would pay $13 million to end a probe stemming from customer complaints that scam artists duped them into wiring funds via the money transfer service. The settlement, with attorneys general in 49 states and Washington, D.C., includes $9 million for a nationwide fund that will facilitate the return of money to some MoneyGram customers and $4 million to cover states' costs and fees, according to numerous announcements by state attorneys general. Philanthropy MoneyGram launched the MoneyGram Foundation in 2013, which focuses on distributing grants internationally to support education. The MoneyGram Foundation distributed grants in 19 countries in its first year of operations. The Foundation gets the bulk of its funding from MoneyGram International, and builds on MoneyGram's previous Global Giving Program.\\"MoneyGram Foundation awards six more grants .\\" Through MoneyGram, Global Giving made a donation of $100,000 to World Vision International for education and school supplies, and another donation of $30,000 for the Girls Exploring Math and Science program in Dallas. MoneyGram participated in relief aid following the 2010 Haiti earthquake by reducing their fees to only $1 for any transactions to Haiti along with a $10,000 grant to Pan American Development Foundation and American Red Cross. In 2012, MoneyGram contributed to Hurricane Sandy relief efforts by pledging to donate $1 per transaction up to $200,000 to the American Red Cross. The foundation has also contributed to other relief efforts following events such as Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.

Life and career Born in La Malbaie, Quebec, the son of Ferdinand Asselin and Eug√©nie Tremblay, he was called to the Bar of Quebec in 1951. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1967. From 1957 to 1963, he was the Mayor of La Malbaie. Asselin was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1958 election as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) in the Diefenbaker sweep. He represented the riding of Charlevoix. Asselin was defeated in the 1962 election. Despite no longer having a seat, he was appointed to the position of Minister of Forestry in Diefenbaker's pre-1963 election Canadian cabinet, in the hope that he and the Tories would both win the upcoming election. He served for only a month until the defeat of the Conservatives and Asselin's failure to regain his seat. He returned to the House of Commons in the 1965 election, and he was re-elected in the 1968 election. Prior to the 1972 election, he accepted an appointment to the Senate of Canada. He sat in the Senate until 1990, when he was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Quebec by the Governor General, on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Asselin was in office during the 1995 Quebec Referendum for sovereignty. In 1996, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1992, he was given the right to use the honorific style of \\"The Right Honourable\\", which is granted for life and to very few eminent Canadians.

The highway starts in rural Idaho north of the city of Lewiston as a state highway in an interchange with US 95\\\\. As the road crosses into Washington it becomes a state highway that connects communities in the Palouse region of Eastern Washington. US 195 travels north, serving the cities of Pullman, Colfax and Rosalia in Whitman County before continuing into Spokane County to its terminus in the city of Spokane at an interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90). The first section of US 195 designated as part of Washington's state highway system was codified in 1913 from Colfax to Spokane as the Inland Empire Highway and from the Idaho state line to Pullman as the Second Division of the Eastern Route of the Inland Empire Highway. The two highways were included as part of State Road 3 in 1923 and US 195 during the creation of the US Highway System on November 11, 1926. Originally, the northern terminus of the highway was at US 95 in Sandpoint, but was truncated to Spokane after US 2 was extended west from Bonners Ferry in 1946. US 195 was cosigned with Primary State Highway 3 (PSH 3) from US 95 to Spokane and PSH 6 from Spokane to Newport from the creation of the primary and secondary state highways in 1937 until the 1964 highway renumbering. US 195 was extended south into Idaho after the relocation of US 95, designated as the North and South Highway in 1916, onto its present freeway in 1975. Bypasses of Pullman, Rosalia, and Plaza were completed during the early 1970s, converting portions of US 195 into a divided highway. Route description US 195 runs in Idaho and Washington and is listed in its entirety as part of the National Highway System, a system of roads crucial to the nation's economy, defense and mobility. As a state highway in both states, the roadway is maintained by the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) and Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). =Idaho= US 195 travels within Idaho for from an interchange with US 95 to the Washington state line, entirely north of Lewiston atop the Lewiston Hill in unincorporated Nez Perce County. ITD surveys the roads under its control on a regular basis to measure the amount of traffic using the state's highways. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. A July 2011 survey reported average daily traffic of 6,761 vehicles being served the US 95 interchange. Administratively, US 195 does not exist in Idaho. According to ITD's milepoint log, both carriageways are officially US 95 ramps into Washington state. =Washington= US 195 traveling along Hangman Creek in Spokane, viewed from the east US 195 travels north through the Palouse region of Eastern Washington, from the Idaho state line north to Spokane. The highway serves as an important link between Pullman and Spokane as well as part of the Palouse Scenic Byway and a main north-south route in the region alongside State Route 27 (SR 27). US 195 enters Washington north of Clarkston in unincorporated Whitman County and travels west to an intersection with its spur route, providing a connection to US 95 northbound towards Moscow. The highway continues northwest through farmland and the towns of Uniontown and Colton along Union Flat Creek towards Pullman. US 195 intersects SR 27, also part of the Palouse Scenic Byway, and travels west of Pullman on a highway bypass of the city. The bypass travels through the termini of SR 194 and SR 270 as it leaves the Pullman area heading north towards Colfax along the South Fork Palouse River. US 195 becomes Main Street within Colfax and travels through the town along a WSDOT rail line to the eastern terminus of SR 272 and SR 26. The highway continues north along Pine Creek and the WSDOT rail line past the northern terminus of SR 271, a diamond interchange south of Rosalia, before leaving the Palouse Scenic Byway at the Spokane County border. The roadway heads north through a diamond interchange in Plaza and along Spangle Creek past the community of Spangle. US 195 enters the city of Spokane as a four- lane highway along Hangman Creek and ends at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-90, cosigned with US 2 and US 395. US 195 is defined by the Washington State Legislature as SR 195, part of the Revised Code of Washington as ¬ß47.17.380. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of AADT, which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of US 195 within Washington was in Hangman Valley before the I-90 interchange in Spokane, serving 19,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was between Pullman and Colfax, serving 3,100 vehicles. The entire route of US 195 is designated as a Highway of Statewide Significance by WSDOT, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington. History The Inland Empire Highway was originally a collection of gravel county roads that have existed since 1898 in the Spokane area and 1905 in the Pullman area. These roads roughly followed an early territorial highway built in the 1870s between Colfax and Spokane. The highway was added to the state highway system in 1913, traveling within the Palouse region between Colfax and Spokane. The Second Division of the Eastern Route of the Inland Empire Highway was also established in 1913, traveling northwest from Sampson Trail Y at the Idaho-Washington state line to Pullman. The Idaho portion of US 195 became part of the North and South Highway in 1916 and was not numbered under Idaho's state highway system in 1953. The gap in the Second Division between Pullman and Colfax was named by Whitman County as a highway of importance the following year and was not built until 1925 as part of State Road 3. State Road 23, connecting Spokane to Newport, was designated in 1915 before it was renamed to the Pend O'Reille Highway and renumbered to State Road 6 in 1923. The Inland Empire Highway was numbered as State Road 3 in 1923 and retained the designation as PSH 3 in 1937, while State Road 6 became PSH 6. The United States Highway System was established on November 11, 1926, during its adoption by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and included US 195, traveling north from US 95 within Washington through Pullman and Spokane before ending at US 95 in Sandpoint, Idaho. The present four-lane divided highway along Hangman Creek in Spokane was constructed in 1939 as part of general improvements to Eastern Washington highways, relocating the route of the creek and a nearby Northern Pacific Railway line. The section of US 195 between Spokane and Sandpoint became co-signed with an extension of US 2 from Bonners Ferry, Idaho to Everett, Washington in 1946, and the highway was truncated to US 10 and US 395 in 1969. During the 1964 highway renumbering, Washington converted its highways to the present state route system, to take effect in 1970. US 195 replaced PSH 3 and its branches along its present route, with its southern terminus at US 95 atop Lewiston Hill in Idaho and its northern terminus at I-90 in Spokane at an interchange that was opened in December 1965, along with a new segment between Thornton and Rosalia. The State Department of Highways completed construction of three highway bypasses between 1973 and 1975, avoiding Pullman, Rosalia, and Plaza, using funding originally intended for the canceled Bay Freeway project in Seattle. US 95 was relocated onto its present freeway, bypassing Washington state, in 1979 and US 195 was extended south into Idaho to the new interchange with a spur route traveling towards northbound US 95. The highway between Uniontown and Rosalia was designated as part of the Palouse Scenic Byway on December 19, 2002, as part of the Washington State Scenic and Recreational Highways program. In 2002, WSDOT adopted a long range plan to upgrade US 195 within the Hangman Valley in Spokane to limited-access standards by constructing new interchanges at four intersections. One of the interchanges, at Cheney‚ÄìSpokane Road, was completed in 2014 at a cost of $9.4 million. Funding for the remaining interchange projects, estimated to cost $106 million in 2002 dollars, was not allocated and WSDOT is instead considering lower-cost improvements to the intersections. Increased traffic congestion on US 195 in Spokane lead to a development moratorium in place until capacity improvements are made to the highway. The first ramp meter in the Spokane area was installed at US 195's interchange with I-90 in 2019. Major junctions Spur route US 195 has a spur route near its southern terminus on the Washington-Idaho state line that travels east from US 195 to serve US 95 northbound atop Lewiston Hill. The unsigned highway, also known as the Genesee Spur, was established in 1979 on the former alignment of US 95 as it passed briefly through Washington before it was moved onto its present alignment. WSDOT included the road in its annual AADT survey in 2012 and calculated that 100 vehicles per day used the spur route. ITD designates the spur route as US-95 Spur in their milepoint log. =Major intersections= Notes References External links * US 195 at US Highway Ends * US 195 at Highways of Washington State 95-1 1 95-1 95-1 195 Category:Transportation in Nez Perce County, Idaho Category:Transportation in Whitman County, Washington Category:Transportation in Spokane County, Washington ","title":"U.S. Route 195"},{"id":"904703","text":"Klar√§lven (\\"The clear river\\" in SwedishPage 168 of the Swedish Etymological Dictionary Svenskt ortnamnslexikon, published 2003 by the institute of Spr√•k- och folkminnesinstitutet, Uppsala: The name Klar√§lven or Clara √§lv has been used since the beginning of the 18th century.

It emanates at the northeast side of Mount Br√§ndst√∂ten and flows through a couple of smaller lakes down to Lake Rogen in H√§rjedalen, Sweden, and then passes through the Norwegian Hedmark, where it flows through the lake Femunden. There it is known as Femundelva and Trysilelva (before the nationalistic movement in the 19th century the river was called Klara even in Norway; today it is called Femundelva in the municipality of Engerdal and Trysilelva in the municipality of Trysil, reflecting strong local patriotism in Norway). The rest of the river, the longest part, flows through V√§rmland to ultimately discharge in a delta into V√§nern at Karlstad. In its turn, V√§nern drains then into G√∂ta √§lv, reaching the sea at Gothenburg. The river has historically provided significant economic benefits, providing a suitable transport route for log driving, and currently is internationally recognized as excellent sport fishing waters. Geography and geology Map of the Klar√§lven delta and accompanying water bodies. Not showed here are the southern branches of the west part of the delta. The watershed of Klar√§lven is commonly referred to as Klar√§lvdalen (the Klar√§lv basin), where it accumulates much of its water on its journey to V√§nern. Other important sources of water are the snowy mountains in the northern areas of the watershed area, providing substantial flows in the spring when the snow melts; annual floods are common. The straight river course north of Edeb√§ck has been classified by Sten De Geer as a \\"tectonic valley\\" as it follows the Protogine Zone‚Äîa bedrock weakness zone of Precambrian age. During deglaciation of Scandinavia about 10,000 years before present the glacier ice retreated unevenly with the valley of Klar√§lven hosting a protruding ice tongue while the surrounding uplands were ice-free. The retreat of the ice left dead-ice buried in the glacifluvial sediments of the valley. The river course north of Edeb√§ck formed an ancient fjord after it became free of glacier ice and before the post-glacial rebound definitely raised the valley bottom above the sea. The river course south of Edeb√§ck is possibly a Quaternary deflection caused by the accumulation of glacial deposits. Since the end of the last ice age, the mouth of Klar√§lven has moved southward from Forshaga to its current position at Karlstad,History of Forshaga published by the Genealogy Society of V√§rmland and is still moving, albeit for different reasons, as the river carries substantial quantities of sand, cut from the outer edges of its meandering curves, causing the shoreline of V√§nern to constantly move southward. The heavy meandering of Klar√§lven results in numerous oxbow lakes, formed as a result of a too sharp curve, eventually causing the river to create a new, shorter path. An artificial islet, Gubbholmen found in central Karlstad has also been created as a result of the accumulation of of sand transported each day during the spring flood.Dubbskadeexkursion den 22 juni Entering the Karlstad region, the river delta splits into two main parts and eight smaller parts. The east part splits into two further main branches after passing Gubbholmen (eventually three branches). The west part splits into five branches. In the first half of the 20th century the geography and Quaternary geology Klar√§lven was studied by various Swedish researchers including Alfred Elis T√∂rnebohm, Sten De Geer and Lennart von Post. This last Quaternary geologist died in 1951 leaving his research unfinished, despite of this Klar√§lven was by 1956 the most studied river in Sweden. √Öke Sundborg's 1956 outstanding PhD thesis and publication on the geomorphology and hydrology of Klar√§lven is considered a major reference work for river studies in Sweden. Economic importance  There are some hydroelectric power plants in the river. These are the hydroelectric power plants from south to north. # Forshaga power plant in Forshaga, # Dejefors power plant in Deje, 20 MW # Munkfors power plant in Munkfors, 33 MW, # Skymn√§sforsen power plant in Skymn√§sfors, 17 MW, # Forshult power plant in Forshult, 20 MW, # Krakerud power plant in Krakerud, 22 MW, # Skogaforsen power plant in Skogafors 15 MW, # Edsforsen power plant in Edsfors 9 MW # H√∂ljes power plant in H√∂ljes, 130 MW. =Fishing= In recent years, the sport fishing of Klar√§lven has gained an international recognition for its Atlantic salmon and brown trout fisheries; these two species of fish are sought after by fly fishers. Competition for use of areas rich in the popular species is vigorous, and at high season the price of fishing licenses may be as high as 500 Swedish krona (US$68) per day. Other measures are taken to ensure the survival of the fishery, including strict rules on the minimum sizes and quantities of fish allowed to be taken, as well as the requirement that unwanted fish, such as the northern pike, be killed when caught.Rules for sport fishing Although the river was a busy log driving route, it has been reported that the fish populations of Klar√§lven has not suffered from the heavy activity, underwater life benefited from it, especially the grayling population. When the log driving stopped in 1991, it was later reported that the beneficial effects were slowly disappearing as shore vegetation grew denser, providing a less favourable environment for the fish.Lund√©n, Bo. Flottningen p√• Klar√§lven (1986) As of 1997, an upper secondary school specializing in sport fishing education was established to meet the demands for skilled professionals to guide fishing tourism.SportfiskeAkademin - om skolan = Other tourism = Klar√§lven has clean and fresh water, suitable for bathing, although caution must be taken if bathing at a point before the river reaches its delta, as the currents can be treacherous. Modern day tourist attractions in addition to sport fishing include canoeing, as well as rafting from Bran√§s to Edeb√§ck. = Log driving = A workforce of log drivers from Finnskoga, working at the Lusten separation point, Forshaga, taken 1918 A stone bridge crossing the Klar√§lven delta in Karlstad. The red constructions were made to catch passing logs. Such constructions can be seen throughout Klar√§lven. Log driving has been traced back to the 17th century, although log driving increased to a significant level at the beginning of the 20th century, when the paper industry started to expand. Log driving was accomplished by dumping the harvested logs into the river, there they floated until the separation point at Forshaga. They were then held up by a floating structure resembling a fence until loggers could move out on the logs, identify them and guide them to their designated areas using special hooks. After grouping logs with the same company marks together, the logs would then be towed to their destinations.Flottningens historia on Museum of V√§rmland As many as 1,500 people were working seasonally, employed by the local log drivers' society, paid by the paper mills and forest owners. Although a risky job, the personnel were skilled and only one drowning incident was reported in the last 30 years of operation. Out of the 19 Lusten boats used to tow the logs to their final destinations, only one remains in working condition today; Lusten 8, serving as a tourist attraction.Forshaga kanal After the shutdown of the log driving industry in 1991, the remaining equipment was auctioned off, most was sold to the Forshaga Municipality, who used the equipment to found the log driving museum, using the old buildings used for the operations as its main building. Upon the shutdown of the flood driving in Klar√§lven, the practice of log driving in Sweden had officially come to its end.

The family contains some of the largest species of moths in the world. Notable members include the emperor moths, royal moths, and giant silk moths. Adults are characterized by large, lobed wings, heavy bodies covered in hair-like scales, and reduced mouthparts. They lack a frenulum, but the hindwings overlap the forewings to produce the effect of an unbroken wing surface.Tuskes PM, Tuttle JP, Collins MM (1996). The Wild Silk Moths of North America: A Natural History of the Saturniidae of the United States and Canada. Pages 182-184. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York. Saturniids are sometimes brightly colored and often have translucent eyespots or \\"windows\\" on their wings. Sexual dimorphism varies by species, but males can generally be distinguished by their larger, broader antennae. Most adults possess wingspans between 1-6 in (2.5‚Äì15 cm), but some tropical species such as the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas) may have wingspans up to 12 in (30 cm). Together with certain Noctuidae, Saturniidae contains the largest Lepidoptera and some of the largest insects alive today.  Distribution  Marbled emperor moth (Heniocha dyops) in Botswana The majority of saturniid species occur in wooded tropical or subtropical regions, with the greatest diversity in the New World tropics and Mexico, though they are found all over the world. About 12 described species live in Europe, one of which, the emperor moth, occurs in the British Isles, and 68 described species live in North America, 42 of which reside north of Mexico and Southern California.  Life cycle  Life stages of giant emperor moth (Saturnia pyri) Some saturniids are strictly univoltine, producing only one generation a year, whereas others are multivoltine, producing more than one brood a year. Spring and summer broods hatch in a matter of weeks; autumn broods enter a state known as diapause and emerge the following spring. How the pupae know when to hatch early or hibernate is not yet fully understood, though research suggests day length during the fifth larval instar plays a major role, as well as cooling temperatures. Longer days may prompt pupae to develop early, while shorter days result in pupal diapause. The number of broods is flexible, and a single female may produce both fast-developing and slow-developing individuals, or they may produce different numbers of broods in different years or parts of the range. In some species - e.g. the Luna moth (Actias luna) or Callosamia securifera (both Saturniinae) -, spring and summer broods look different, with different genes activated by environmental conditions. = Eggs = Clutch of emperor gum moth (Opodiphthera eucalypti) eggs Depending on the moth, a single female may lay up to 200 eggs on a chosen host plant. Others are laid singly or in small groups.Scoble (1995) They are round, slightly flattened, smooth and translucent or whitish. = Larvae = Citheronia laocoon fifth-instar caterpillar in Brazil Saturniid caterpillars are large (50 to 100 mm in the final instar), stout, and cylindrical. Most have tubercules that are often also spiny or hairy. Many are cryptic in coloration, with countershading or disruptive coloration to reduce detection, but some are more colorful. Some have urticating hairs. A few species have been noted to produce clicking sounds with the larval mandibles when disturbed. Examples: Luna moth (Actias luna) and Polyphemus moth (Antheraea polyphemus). The clicks may serve as aposematic warning signals to a regurgitation defense. Most are solitary feeders, but some are gregarious. The Hemileucinae are gregarious when young and have stinging hairs, those of Lonomia containing a poison which may kill a human. Arsenura armida is another well-known example, and are infamous for their large conspicuous masses during the day. Their coloration is not cryptic, instead exhibiting aposematism. The other caterpillars in this size range are almost universally Sphingidae, which are seldom hairy and tend to have diagonal stripes on their sides. Many Sphingidae caterpillars bear a single curved horn on their hind end. These are actually not dangerous, but large-haired caterpillars should generally not be touched except by experts. Most saturniid larvae feed on the foliage of trees and shrubs. A few, particularly Hemileucinae such as Automeris louisiana, A. patagonensis, and Hemileuca oliviae, feed on grasses. They moult at regular intervals, usually four to six times before entering the pupal stage. Prior to pupation, a wandering stage occurs, and the caterpillar may change color, becoming more cryptic just before this stage. Luna moth (Actias luna, Saturniinae) pupa (right) removed from cocoon (left, note last larval skin) = Pupae = Most larvae spin a silken cocoon in the leaves of a preferred host plant or in leaf litter on the ground, or crevices in rocks and logs. While only moderately close relatives to the silkworm (Bombyx mori) among the Lepidoptera, the cocoons of most larger saturniids can be gathered and used to make silk fabric. However, larvae of some species - typically Ceratocampinae, like the regal moth (Citheronia regalis) and the imperial moth (Eacles imperialis), burrow and pupate in a small chamber beneath the soil. This is common in the Ceratocampinae and Hemileucinae. Unlike most silk moths, those that pupate underground do not use much silk in the construction. Once enclosed in the cocoon, the caterpillar sheds the larval skin and becomes a pupa, and the pupa undergoes metamorphosis for about 14 days, at which point it either emerges or goes into diapause. During metamorphosis, respiratory systems will stay intact, the digestive system will dissolve, and reproductive organs will take form. = Adults = Adult females emerge with a complete set of mature ova and \\"call\\" males by emitting pheromones (specific \\"calling\\" times vary by species). Males can detect these chemical signals up to a mile away with help from sensitive receptors located on the tips of their feather-like antennae. The males fly several miles in one night to locate a female and mate with her; females generally will not fly until after they have mated. Since the mouthparts of adult saturniids are vestigial and digestive tracts are absent, adults subsist on stored lipids acquired during the larval stage. As such, adult behavior is devoted almost entirely to reproduction, but the end result (due to lack of feeding) is a lifespan of a week or less once emerged from the pupa. One specific species in the family Saturniidae with a special mating pattern is Callosamia promethea (promethea silkmoth). Females will mate with multiple males and males will mate with multiple females. Females that mate with more than one male will produce 10% more eggs.  Importance to humans  Typical example of Saturniidae camouflage, Eacles imperialis (imperial moth), next to a nearly identical yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) leaf A few species are important defoliator pests, including the orange-striped oakworm moth (Anisota senatoria) on oaks, the pandora pinemoth (Coloradia pandora) on pines and Hemileuca oliviae on range grasses. Other species are of major commercial importance in tussah and wild silk production. These notably include the Chinese tussah moth (Antheraea pernyi), its hybridogenic descendant Antheraea √ó proylei, and the ailanthus silkmoth (Samia cynthia). Mopane worm (Gonimbrasia belina), Gonimbrasia zambesina, the cabbage tree emperor moth (Bunaea alcinoe), Gynanisa maia, Imbrasia epimethea, Imbrasia oyemensis, Melanocera menippe, Microgone cana, Urota sinope and the pallid emperor moth (Cirina forda).\\"Edible insects: future prospects for food and feed security\\" - van Huis et al. (2013)\\"Food Insects Newsletter\\"\\"Food Insects\\"\\"Insects as food in Sub-Saharan Africa\\" - A. van Huis Some species of Saturniidae such as the mopane worm (Gonimbrasia belina) are used as a food source.Chavunduka, D.M. 1975. Insects as a source of protein to the African. Rhodesia Science News 9: 217-220. (Quoted in ch.13 DeF 2003) Most Saturniidae are harmless animals at least as adults, and in many cases at all stages of their lives. Thus, some of the more spectacular species - in particular Antheraea - can be raised by children or school classes as educational pets. The soft, silken cocoons make an interesting keepsake for pupils. Some, including the genus Automeris, have urticating spines which sting. Caterpillars of the genus Lonomia produce a deadly toxin injected into the victim when it is touched.  Systematics and evolution  In terms of absolute numbers of species, the Saturniidae are most diverse in the Neotropics. Also, their most ancient subfamilies occur only in the Americas. Only the very \\"modern\\" Saturniidae are widely distributed across most parts of the world. Thus, it is quite safe to assume - even in the absence of a comprehensive fossil record - that the first Saturniidae originated in the Neotropical region. Note that at least two of the subfamilies included below are commonly treated as separate families (Oxyteninae and Cercophaninae). The following list arranges the subfamilies in the presumed phylogenetic sequence, from the most ancient to the most advanced. Some notable genera and species are also included. * Subfamily Oxyteninae (3 genera, 35 species) ** Oxytenis * Subfamily Cercophaninae (4 genera, 10 species) * Subfamily Arsenurinae (10 genera, 60 species, Neotropics) ** Paradaemonia Bouvier, 1925 Anisota stigma (Ceratocampinae) Male Citheronia splendens (Ceratocampinae) Automeris belti (Hemileucinae) Female tau emperor (Aglia tau, Agliinae) Comet Moth, Argema mittrei, male * Subfamily Ceratocampinae (27 genera, 170 species, Americas) ** Adeloneivaia ** Anisota *** Anisota stigma - spiny oakworm moth *** Anisota senatoria - orange-striped oakworm moth ** Citheronia *** Citheronia azteca *** Citheronia lobesis *** Citheronia regalis - regal moth *** Citheronia sepulcralis - pine-devil moth *** Citheronia splendens - splendid royal moth ** Dryocampa *** Dryocampa rubicunda - rosy maple moth ** Eacles *** Eacles imperialis - imperial moth ** Syssphinx *** Syssphinx bicolor *** Syssphinx hubbardi *** Syssphinx montana * Subfamily Hemileucinae (51 genera, 630 species, Americas) ** Automeris *** Automeris io - Io moth *** Automeris louisiana ** Coloradia ** Hemileuca *** Hemileuca nevadensis - Nevada buck moth *** Hemileuca maia - buck moth ** Lonomia ** Ormiscodes * Subfamily Agliinae (1 genus, 3 species) ** Aglia *** Aglia tau - tau emperor * Subfamily Ludiinae (disputed) (8 genera, Africa) * Subfamily Salassinae (1 genus, 12 species, tropics) ** Salassa * Subfamily Saturniinae (59 genera, 480 species, tropical and temperate regions worldwide) Giant Peacock Moth On Arum by Vincent van Gogh, 1889.

The highway was established in 1926 as a spur of U.S. Route 99, which has since been replaced by Interstate 5. US 199 stretches from U.S. Route 101 near Crescent City, California northeast to Interstate 5 in Grants Pass, Oregon. The highway is the northern portion of the Redwood Highway. In Oregon, US 199 is officially known as Redwood Highway No. 25. The majority of the road in California is the Smith River Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway. The first roadway, a plank road, from Crescent City was established in May 1858, and before the US 199 designation was applied to the highway, the roadway was designated Highway 25 (in Oregon) and Route 1 (in California). Exit Sign for US 199 Route description US 199 begins at a partial interchange with US 101 northeast of Crescent City; Elk Valley Cross Road (County Route D2) connects the two routes just to the north for full access. The highway quickly enters the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, climbs over a ridge, crosses the Smith River, and meets State Route 197 (which heads northwest to US 101 via the Smith River). US 199 follows the banks of the river and its Middle Fork as it takes a steady but curvy climb through the Smith River National Recreation Area in the Six Rivers National Forest, passing the settlements of Hiouchi, Gasquet and Patrick Creek. As it approaches the summit, the Middle Fork Smith River turns east, but US 199 continues northeast, following Griffin Creek to near its source (where there is a rest area), and passing under Hazel View Summit, the border between the Smith River NRA and the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, in the 1963 Collier Tunnel (elevation about 2100 feet/650 m). (The old curving route over the summit still exists as Oregon Mountain Road.) Upon leaving the tunnel, US 199 descends alongside the small Broken Kettle Creek into the Elk Valley and crosses into Oregon.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed December 2007 via ACME Mapper US 199 southbound at the California- Oregon state line US 199 leaves the national forest as it enters Oregon and descends into the Illinois Valley, passing O'Brien and the west end of OR 46 in Cave Junction. North of Cave Junction, US 199 leaves the Illinois River, which curves west towards the ocean, and follows several small creeks past Selma to Hayes Hill Summit (elevation about 1700 feet/500 m). The highway descends from the summit alongside Slate Creek past Wonder and Wilderville and ends up in the Rogue River Valley, where it enters Grants Pass. South of downtown Grants Pass, US 199 meets OR 99 and OR 238 and splits at a partial interchange. The main Redwood Highway turns north with OR 99, passing through downtown and ending at exit 58 of I-5, while the Redwood Spur No. 482, locally known as Grants Pass Parkway, continues straight, bypassing downtown to end at I-5 exit 55. Both of these are signed in both directions as US 199, while signage on US 199 itself at the split only shows \\"OR 99 north\\" for the mainline through downtown and \\"to I-5\\" for the bypass. On I-5, exit 55 is marked as \\"US 199\\", but exit 58 is \\"OR 99 to US 199\\".Oregon Department of Transportation, Public Road Inventory (primarily the Digital Video Log), accessed December 2007 The Oregon Transportation Commission's defined routing of US 199 takes it along the main Redwood Highway through downtown,Oregon Department of Transportation, Descriptions of US and OR Routes, July 2007 and the OTC calls the spur to exit 55 \\"US 199 Spur\\",Oregon Transportation Commission, Minutes of the Regular Monthly Meeting, August 16‚Äì17, 2005 but, consistent with signs on I-5 (but not on the surface), the Oregon Department of Transportation calls the spur US 199 and the downtown route OR 99 only.Oregon Department of Transportation, Grants Pass 7th Street Bridge Improvement Project, accessed December 2007 The older route through downtown is a one-way pair on Sixth (southbound) and Seventh (northbound) Streets, entirely overlapping OR 99 to I-5 exit 58, where OR 99 continues with I-5 to the north. The Caveman Bridge, a concrete through arch bridge built in 1927, carries Sixth Street over the Rogue River, while the parallel Seventh Street Bridge is a utilitarian bridge from 1960. The Grants Pass Parkway (Redwood Spur) also crosses the river on a four-lane bridge built in 1990;National Bridge Inventory database, 2006 before that bypass was completed, the spur began downtown on E (southbound) and F (northbound) Streets. Soon after the old and new routes join, the spur ends at a trumpet interchange with I-5 (exit 55). US 199 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. US 199 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. US 199 Oregon Shield and Sign History By 1854, when it was incorporated, Crescent City had a population of 800 but no road leading inland. The Crescent City and Yreka Plank and Turnpike Company was incorporated at a meeting on June 10, and a survey was completed in October, but work stopped with the Panic of 1855. The corporation was revived in December 1856 as the Crescent City Plank Road and Turnpike Company, began construction of a plank road in 1857, and opened the road in May 1858. This road, shown on USGS topographic maps as Wimer Road, led northeast from Crescent City to the Smith River, where there was a toll booth, and then took a generally northerly route to near the state line, where it turned east, crossing back and forth between the states, to Oregon Mountain. There it turned northeast, following the Illinois River and branches past O'Brien and Waldo to north of Kerby. The final stretch ran easterly to Jacksonville via Wilderville, along the present US 199, Fish Hatchery Road, and OR 238.Howard McKinley Corning, Dictionary of Oregon History, 1956, p. 127Roger Brandt, Illinois Valley News, Early day 'Road to the Sea' marked initial efforts to open valley-coastal commerce, March 15, 2006U.S. Department of the Interior National Park Service Division of History Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation, Redwood National Park: History Basic Data, Chapter 9B: Roads, September 1, 1969 Simpson-Reed redwood grove in Jedediah Smith State Park, along US 199 near Crescent City, California A second road in California was built by Horace Gasquet, who acquired a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet, California ‚Äî where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge ‚Äî in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River to the mouth of the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.Nancy Wey, National Park Service, A History of Chinese Americans in California: Gasquet Toll Road As part of Oregon's initial state highway system, the road from Grants Pass southwest to Wilderville and then along the Crescent City Plank Road to the state line was named the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway No. 25 in November 1917.Oregon Department of Transportation, History of State Highways in Oregon, January 2007, pp. 187-189 At the time, the Grants Pass-Crescent City route, via the Gasquet Toll Road, was a narrow, winding unpaved mountain road with long grades and some remaining plank road in California.Official Automobile Blue Book, Volume Eight, 1918, p. 163 California added its portion to the state highway system in 1919, for the state's third highway bond issue, as an extension of Legislative Route 1.Howe & Peters, Engineers' Report to California State Automobile Association Covering the Work of the California Highway Commission for the Period 1911-1920, pp. 11-16 By 1924, the road was part of the Redwood Highway, which continued south to Sausalito,Los Angeles Times, Splendid Camps Along the Road, May 18, 1924, p. F5 but was still completely unimproved between Crescent City and Waldo, Oregon.Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas, 1926, accessed via the Broer Map Library (Oregon changed the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway name to Redwood Highway in May 1924.) A new highway between Gasquet and Kerby was completed by the two states in September 1926,Oakland Tribune, New Redwood Highway Completed, September 12, 1926 and in June 1929 the new Hiouchi Bridge over the Smith River was dedicated, bypassing the remainder of the old road over Howland Hill.Oakland Tribune, Governors to Dedicate New Hiouchi Span, June 21, 1929 In 1948, US 199 became part of the Winnemucca to the Sea Highway, organized to promote the route that has largely become Nevada State Route 140 and Oregon Route 140 from I-80 at Winnemucca, Nevada to Crescent City.Nevada State Journal, June 15, 1948 One major improvement to the highway's alignment was made after 1929: the Collier Tunnel replaced the winding route over Hazel View Summit in California on July 20, 1963.Independent Press-Telegram, July 21, 1963 Neither of the early designations ‚Äî Highway 25 and Route 1 - was marked (signs posted by the California State Automobile Association used the Redwood Highway name), but in 1926 it became U.S. Route 199, a branch of US 99 from Grants Pass to US 101 in Crescent City.United States Numbered Highways, American Highways (AASHO), April 1927 Oregon moved the Pacific Highway No. 1 from present OR 99 to I-5, which bypassed Grants Pass, in 1959, and the Redwood Highway No. 25 was extended north through downtown Grants Pass to I-5. A proposed branch on M Street to I-5 east of downtown was also included in Highway 25, but this was moved to the E and F Streets one-way pair in 1961. (I-5 here was built in the early 1960s,Oregon State Highway Department, State Highway System, December 31, 1961 and 1962 but US 99 remained on the old alignment.United States Geological Survey, Medford, Oregon (scale 1:250,000), 1963) On the California side of the state line, US 199 was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 and the State Scenic Highway System in 1963; in the 1964 renumbering the Route 1 designation was dropped, making Route 199 the legislative number. Although US 299 and US 399 became state routes in 1964, the shorter US 199, which crossed a state line, remained. US 99 has since become Oregon Route 99 through Grants Pass, and US 199 now ends at I-5. The spur east from downtown Grants Pass to I-5 was built at the same time as I-5,National Bridge Inventory database, 2006 and in 1991 it was moved from E and F Streets to bypass downtown on the new Grants Pass Parkway.Oregon Department of Transportation, Bypass #7 - Grants Pass Parkway, US 199, Redwood Highway, Highway 25 (MP 0.35-0.25, Y-0.69-Y1.99) Major intersections =Redwood Spur (Grants Pass Parkway)= See also * References External links * AARoads ‚Äî U.S. Highway 199: California, Oregon * California Highways: US 199 * End of U.S. Highway 199 (photos of current and former endpoints) * California Highway Conditions: US 199 Category:Roads in Del Norte County, California Category:Transportation in Josephine County, Oregon 99-1 99-1 99-1 1 Category:Plank road ","title":"U.S. Route 199"},{"id":"904712","text":"Bluemink (Ageratum houstonianum) Ageratum ()Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606‚Äì607 (whiteweed in the USA) is a genus of 40 to 60 tropical and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central America and Mexico but four are native to the United States. They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters. The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and spread in small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.  Cultivation  Ageratums are grown for their flowers, especially A. houstonianum. Most common ageratums, \\"Hawaii\\" for example, are a short 6-8 inches when full grown. Tall ageratum are also available in seed catalogues. They are about 18 inches in height with blue flowers. There is also a medium height snowcapped variety, white top on blue flowers. The blues are most popular and common, but colors also include violet, pink and white. Their size and color makes ageratums good candidates for rock gardens, bedding, and containers. They grow well in sun or partial shade, from early summer to first frost. They are quite easy to grow, producing a profusion of fluffy flowers all season long.

The bunad movement has its root in 19th- century national romanticism, which included an interest for traditional folk costumes not only in Norway, but also in neighbouring countries such as Denmark and notably Germany. However, in Norway national romanticist ideas had a more lasting impact, as seen in the use of folk inspired costumes.  History  Traditional folk clothing of eastern Telemark, 1880s The bunad movement has been carried forward by enthusiasts all over the country and new bunad variations are frequently created and proposed for approval. Designers such as Lise Skj√•k Br√¶k have developed entire lines of costumes based on the bunad tradition. In the field of folk costumes it is common to differentiate between bunad and folk costume, the latter being the local dress in previous times with all its variations and use. Modern interpretations of these costumes have often modified or done away with completely parts of the traditional dresses in order to align them with a more conventional idea of beauty and fashion. For example, few Norwegians still use the headdresses and headpieces that were a part of the traditional costumes, preferring instead to show their hair, in accord with modern, western fashions. These headdresses, like the one in the photo at the top of this article, were often seen as the most important part of the costume for native practitioners of the customs as the headdress often indicated an individual's social or marital status. There is a continuing debate about the extent to which bunads must conform to the standards, or whether it is acceptable to vary or improvise based on general themes. Some groups (sometimes derisively referred to as the bunad police) argue that bunads must be sewn and worn according to strict standards; others advocate a more creative, lenient approach. Traditionally it is correct for women to wear proper bunad shoes and purses, and to avoid wearing sunglasses, earrings, and heavy makeup when dressed in a bunad. Bunads are nowadays often viewed as a status symbol, ranging in the price of $2,000‚àí10,000, depending on the desired design, material, embroidery, gold, silver and accessories. The price also depends on whether the customer buys from a well-established company like Husfliden, from local sewers or decides to sew or do part of the embroidery themselves. It usually takes up to a year to finish making the bunad, and it has become a tradition for parents to give their children a bunad as a confirmation gift, which they will wear on their confirmation day. In recent years, Chinese companies have starting selling cheaper bunads made in China, so-called \\"China bunads.\\"Tr√∏nderbunad sys i Estland It has caused concern that these \\"China bunads\\" may undermine the authenticity and the desirability of the bunads.‚Äì Bunad handler om ekthet, NRK Image:Braut ausBergen.jpgHardanger bunad with a bridal crown (brudekrone) Image:Hulda Garborg-bunad.jpgHulda Garborg in bunad Image:Portrett av Hulda Garborg (1862-1934) (5180708385).jpgHulda Garborg in bunad Image:Wang sisters in USA.jpgNorwegian immigrants in the U.S. wearing their traditional bunads Image:Gerhard Munthe-Budeia 1890 Hallingdal.jpg Budeia - painting by Gerhard Munthe (1890) Image:Nils Bergslien-Frieriet.jpgFrieriet ‚Äì painting by Nils Bergslien (1853‚Äì1928) Image:Nils Bergslien-Kven er st√∏rst m√•tru.jpgKven er st√∏rst m√•ttru ‚Äì painting by Nils Bergslien (1853‚Äì1928) Image:Johannes flintoe norwegian folk costume from telemark.jpgFolkedrakter fra Gran i Telemark ‚Äì painting by Johannes Flintoe Image:Trondheim bunad May 17.jpgTwo young women in bunad in Tr√∏ndelag Image:Young girls in bunad.jpgYoung girls in different national costumes at Akershus Image:Setesdalsbunaden1.jpgSetesdalsbunad from Setesdal (female) Image:Setesdalsbunaden10.jpgSetesdalsbunad (male)  Bunad traditions in Norway  Nordic bunad and folk dress on Faroe Islands stamps In Norway in the postwar era, especially in more recent times, it is common, but by no means mandatory, to wear bunad at various celebrations such as: folk dances, weddings, baptisms, confirmations and especially the May 17 National Day celebrations. In recent years, its use has reached far outside folk dancing, folk music, and particular holidays. Accepted as proper gala attire, it is increasingly common to see people, and especially women, dressed in bunad. The former Norwegian foreign minister, Thorvald Stoltenberg, made history by presenting his accreditation as ambassador to Margrethe II of Denmark dressed in a bunad. Draktskikk i √òsterdalen i tida rundt napoleonskrigene (Trond B√¶kkevold) Bunads were also conspicuous among those present at the Blessing of the Reign of King Harald and Queen Sonja, demonstrating that the bunad is now considered acceptable as an alternative form of formal wear even on the most solemn public occasions. Moreover, people tend to wear bunads to festive celebrations such as anniversaries and birthdays, and for religious occasions including baptisms, confirmations and Christmas. There is ongoing debate about the official status of various outfits, and what allowed variations are. Due to ongoing discussions on the status of bunads, it is not possible to state accurately the number of different types of bunads in Norway, but most estimates place the number at around 200.History of Bunad og Folkedraktr√•det (Bunad og Folkedraktr√•det) In 1947 an official institution, the National Committee for Bunad-related Questions (Landsnemnda for Bunadsp√∏rsm√•l) was organized to act in an advisory capacity on all questions dealing with bunads in Norway. That function is presently assigned to the Norwegian Institute for Costume and Folk Costume (Norsk institutt for bunad og folkedrakt), a national institution dealing with documentation and research of folk costumes as a cultural expression. Since 2008, the institution's management has operated in cooperation with the Valdres Folkemuseum (Valdresmusea) with which it shares facilities in Fagernes. The Institute has established an archive of costume registrations, photo, cut patterns and sketches, and writings of traditional material from various districts.Bunad- og folkedraktr√•det (Norsk institutt for bunad og folkedrakt) From the late 19th century until quite recently the image which was most commonly used to represent the Norwegian traditional rural dress in general was that of the Hardanger woman's bunad, but in more recent times this image is being increasingly superseded by that of the East Telemark woman's bunad. As the bunad most often is based upon older designs from specific areas, the particular bunad will get its name from that area. Most people with roots from an area will choose (if not the same) bunads from their own area or their (grand)parents birthplace. People in general will expect that your bunad represents an area that you have a strong connection to. However, there are no specific rule that states your choice, and you are free to pick whatever kind you like. In the meantime, local bunad-sellers might have some difficulties with getting the right bunad if it is not from their area.  Design and origins of bunad  Woman in a traditional bunad, 1892 The various bunads have been designed through different means. Some of them are based on old local customs; other models are constructions made in the 20th century, relying (often very loosely) on local and historical material. The interest for bunads dates back to Norwegian romantic nationalism and gained increasing interest with the folk-dance movement at the beginning of the 20th century. While the contemporary bunad tradition has most of its roots in folk costumes from the 18th and 19th centuries, records documenting the use of folk costumes go as far back as the Middle Ages. Setesdal in Southern Norway, for example, had a folk costume tradition dating back to the 14th century that remained relatively untouched until the middle of the 20th century. Norwegians from Setesdal still wear this time-honored traditional costume as a bunad today.Stakkeklede i Setesdal : byklaren og valld√∏len, Aagot Noss Such long- standing folk costume traditions can be found all over Norway, but not all regions have retained these traditions as well as areas like Setesdal. In Tr√∏ndelag in central Norway, for example, the traditional costumes fell by the wayside in favor of modernized versions, but are now starting be revived in the local populations and used as conventional bunad again. The names of these traditional bunads are based on their geographic origin, and traditionally, people choose their bunad based on their own or their ancestors‚Äô origin. Hulda Garborg (1862‚Äì1934) and Klara Semb (1884‚Äì1970) are cited as pioneers in bringing bunads into mainstream culture. With Garborg's publication of the pamphlet Norsk Kl√¶debunad in 1903, the focus moved from the creation of a single national costume to the development of several regional bunads. Although bunads are based on traditions in various areas, these designs are embellished by additions such as embroidery. The overarching sense of bunad design is to preserve the way people dressed for festive occasions in one particular era. This has led local and national councils to impose official constraints on various details in the bunad, including colors, fabric, embroidery, jewellery, cut, and allowable headwear.Klara Semb (Store norske leksikon)  Designs and popularity  The designs are typically elaborate, with embroidery, scarves, shawls and hand-made silver or gold jewelry known as s√∏lje. There are bunads both for men and women, although women's bunads are more diverse and popular. However, according to daily manager Turid Liss Agersborg at Husfliden Oslo, they now produce and sell more men's bunads than women's for the first time in history. The male customers are often characterized as urban and modern, and range between the ages of 20 and 40 years old.\\"Barsk i Bunad\\" Aftenposten  References   Other sources  *Fossnes, Heidi Norges bunader og samiske folkedrakter (Cappelen.

Early life and politics Doriot moved to Saint Denis, near Paris, at an early age and became a labourer. In 1916, in the midst of World War I, he became a committed socialist, but his political activity was halted by his joining the French Army in 1917. Participating in active combat during World War I, Doriot was captured by enemy troops and remained a prisoner of war until 1918. For his wartime service, Doriot was awarded the Croix de guerre. After being released, he returned to France and in 1920 joined the French Communist Party (PCF), quickly rising through the party - within a few years, he had become one of the PCF major leaders. In 1922 he became a member of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern, and a year later was made Secretary of the French Federation of Young Communists. In 1923, Doriot was arrested for violently protesting French occupation of the Ruhr Area. He was released a year later, upon being elected to the French Chamber of Deputies (the Third Republic equivalent of the National Assembly) by the people of Saint Denis. Fascism In 1931, Doriot was elected mayor of Saint Denis. Around this time, he came to advocate a Popular Front alliance between the Communists and other French socialist parties with whom Doriot sympathized on a number of issues. Although this would soon become official Communist Party policy, at the time it was seen as heretical and Doriot was expelled from the Communist Party in 1934.Alexander 145. Still a member of the Chamber of Deputies, Doriot struck back at the Communists who had renounced him: now bitter towards the Comintern, his views turned to embrace the French nation, evolving into a 'national' socialism‚Äîas opposed to the socialism of the Third International. By now embodying fascist more than socialist ideals, Doriot founded the ultra- nationalist Parti Populaire Fran√ßais (PPF) in 1936. Doriot and his supporters were vocal advocates of France becoming organized along the lines of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany and were bitter opponents of Socialist Premier L√©on Blum and his Popular Front coalition. Collaboration destroyed city of Saint-L√¥, July 1944. When France went to war with Germany in 1939, Doriot became a staunch pro-German and supported Germany's occupation of northern France in 1940. Doriot resided in collaborationist Vichy France for a time, but he eventually found that it was not nearly as Fascist as he had hoped it would be and moved to occupied Paris, where he espoused pro-German and anti- communist propaganda on Radio Paris. In 1941, he and fellow fascist collaborator Marcel D√©at founded the L√©gion des Volontaires Fran√ßais (LVF), a French unit of the Wehrmacht. Doriot fought with the LVF and saw active duty on the Eastern Front when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 and was awarded the Iron Cross in 1943. In his absence leadership of the PPF officially passed to a directorate, although real power came to lie with Maurice-Yvan Sicard.David Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, London: Heinemann, 1972, p. 272 In December 1944, Doriot travelled to Germany and made contact with the former members of the Vichy regime and other collaborators who had gathered together in the Sigmaringen enclave. Doriot's PPF struggled to assume a leadership role within the French expatriate community, basing itself in Mainau and setting up its own radio station, Radio-Patrie, at Bad Mergentheim and publishing its own paper Le Petit Parisien.Olivier Pigoreau, \\"Rendez-vous tragique √† Mengen\\" 53-61 in (2009) 34 Batailles: l'Histoire Militaire du XXe si√®cle The PPF was also involved in conducting intelligence and sabotage activities by supplying some volunteers whom the Germans dropped by parachute into liberated France.Pierre-Philippe Lambert and G√©rard Le Marrec, Les Fran√ßais sous le casque allemand Granchier, 1994. Some 95 Frenchmen were dropped into liberated France, but some were Milice or Franciste members.

New Romantics  A broader movement of New Romantics has been postulated to cover many of the British poets between the Auden group of the 1930s and The Movement. This is much more debatable; it may be something of a flag of convenience for those such as the followers of Dylan Thomas and George Barker whose style clearly marked them off, or on the other hand a tag for those addressed polemically and retrospectively by the Robert Conquest introduction to the New Lines anthology. The phrase New Romantics was used at the time, though, for example by Henry Treece; it is usually attributed to Cyril Connolly.  Effects of the times  Wartime conditions had posed great editorial difficulties, and the London operations of the publishers such as Tambimuttu, Grey Walls Press and Fortune Press had been stopgaps. Kenneth Rexroth produced a post-war anthology covering the period, but it had little circulation in the UK. Another view was that from John Lehmann's New Writing.  Retrospect from the 1950s  By 1953 John Heath- Stubbs could write of the New Romantics as a movement of the past, though acutely singling out W. S. Graham under the heading of in it, though not of it. This was in the introduction to an anthology Images of Tomorrow, which also points out that the debate over the 'romanticism' was also a fissure within the Christian poets over style‚Äîindeed harking back to the religious and psychological depths of apocalypse.

The case stems from Hanegbi's denial that he was behind an ad boosting his appointments of Likud party's political activists to positions in the Ministry of the Environmental Protection. The judges verdict cleared Hanegbi of any criminal wrongdoing, accepting the defense's argument that such appointments were not illegal prior to 2004, and that this was the common practice among all cabinet members in all the previous governments since Israel's independence. The court ruled that selectively prosecuting Hanegbi for what was a widespread and common practice was wrong and unfair. Hanegbi was urged by his legal team to appeal the perjury conviction to Israel's High court of Justice. Following the verdict, several prominent leaders and officials publicly defended Hanegbi. Former Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg who opposes Hanegbi politically, has called for the firing of the prosecutor by the Attorney General. On 9 November 2010, the Jerusalem court fined Hanegbi 10,000 NIS, and in a 2-to-1 decision imposed moral turpitude to the offense. Hanegbi therefore suspended himself from the Knesset and from his position as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, pending his legal appeal. His seat was taken by Nino Abesadze. = Return to Likud = Hanegbi with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, 2016 Hanegbi resigned from Kadima and returned to Likud when Kadima decided to leave the short-lived unity government in July 2012. Hanegbi explained that he believed Kadima's decision to quit the unity government was irresponsible, and motivated by short-term political goals.Hanegbi announces his return to Likud (Hebrew) Following his decision, Hanegbi was re-elected on the Likud list in the January 2013 elections. In June 2014 he was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.Nineteenth Knesset: Government 33 Knesset website On 30 May 2016 Hanegbi was appointed Minister without portfolio in the Fourth Netanyahu Cabinet, dealing with issues concerning defense and foreign affairs. On 2 June 2016 Hanegbi denied allegations that he intentionally wrote a report on Operation Protective Edge that cleared the Israeli government of all wrongdoing.The Jerusalem Post, June 2, 2016 He was appointed Acting Minister of Communications in February 2017, a post he held until being replaced by Ayoob Kara in May.Ayoob Kara appointed minister of communications Ynetnews, 28 May 2017 See also *List of Israeli public officials convicted of crimes or misdemeanors References External links * Tzachi Hanegbi's official website * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Deputy ministers of Israel Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Category:Israeli people of Moroccan-Jewish descent Category:Israeli people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:Israeli people of Turkish-Jewish descent Category:Israeli people of Yemeni-Jewish descent Category:Kadima politicians Category:Likud politicians Category:Members of the 12th Knesset (1988‚Äì1992) Category:Members of the 13th Knesset (1992‚Äì1996) Category:Members of the 14th Knesset (1996‚Äì1999) Category:Members of the 15th Knesset (1999‚Äì2003) Category:Members of the 16th Knesset (2003‚Äì2006) Category:Members of the 17th Knesset (2006‚Äì2009) Category:Members of the 18th Knesset (2009‚Äì2013) Category:Members of the 19th Knesset (2013‚Äì2015) Category:Members of the 20th Knesset (2015‚Äì2019) Category:Members of the 21st Knesset (2019) Category:Members of the 22nd Knesset (2019‚Äì2020) Category:Members of the 23rd Knesset (2020‚Äì) Category:Ministers of Environment of Israel Category:Ministers of Health of Israel Category:Ministers of Justice of Israel Category:Ministers of Public Security of Israel Category:People from Jerusalem Category:Perjurers Category:Tel Aviv University alumni Category:Israeli politicians convicted of crimes ","title":"Tzachi Hanegbi"},{"id":"904771","text":"The Seal of the President of the United States is used to mark correspondence from the president of the United States to the U.S. Congress, and is also used as a symbol of the presidency itself. The central design, based on the Great Seal of the United States, is the official coat of arms of the U.S. presidency and also appears on the presidential flag. The presidential seal developed by custom over a long period before being defined in law, and its early history remains obscure. The use of presidential seals goes back to at least 1850, and probably much earlier. The basic design of today's seal originated with Rutherford B. Hayes, who was the first to use the coat of arms on White House invitations in 1877. The precise design dates from 1945, when President Truman specified it in . The only changes since were in 1959 and 1960, which added 49th and 50th stars to the circle following the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii as states.  Design and symbolism  The current seal is defined in Executive Order 10860, made by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on February 5, 1960, and effective since July 4, 1960. It states: The blazon (design) is essentially the same as the obverse of the Great Seal of the United States as defined in 1782, although with some extra colors specified, and a different arrangement of the stars, clouds, and glory than is typically seen in modern versions of the Great Seal. The only purely distinct element is the ring of 50 stars, representing the 50 states. Likewise, the symbolism follows that of the Great Seal: *The stripes on the shield represent the 13 original states, unified under and supporting the chief. The motto (meaning \\"Out of many, one\\") alludes to the same concept. *The arc of thirteen clouds, and the thirteen stars, also refer to the original 13 states. *The olive branch and arrows denote the powers of peace and war. Uses =Official use= A member of the White House Communications Agency (WHCA) placing the seal on the president's lectern. The Presidential Seal Podium Plaque The actual seal die is only used on correspondence from the President to the United States Congress, closing the envelopes with wax seals. This has been the primary use throughout the seal's history, though isolated uses have been made for correspondence with other members of government. Documents signed by the President when representing the nation are instead sealed with the Great Seal of the United States.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 455 (see footnote 15) Strictly speaking, the brass die used at the White House is the only actual seal of the president ‚Äî other versions are technically \\"facsimiles\\". The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has other dies, used to produce such facsimiles on documents, stationery, and invitations as requested by the White House.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 454-456 Other versions of the seal are often used as a visual symbol to represent the president, and are most often seen: * on the lectern at presidential press conferences * on the sides of presidential transports Air Force One, Marine One, and the presidential limousine * at the center of the ceiling in the Oval Office of the White House * affixed to the balcony of the South Portico during a State Arrival Ceremony The presidential coat of arms (the central device on the seal, i.e. without the encircling \\"SEAL OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\\" legend) has even wider usage. It appears: * on the presidential flag Reverse of the Kennedy Half dollar, 1964‚Äì1975, 1977‚Äìpresent * on the reverse of the Kennedy half dollar (encircled with \\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\" on the top and \\"HALF DOLLAR\\" on the bottom). For the United States Bicentennial, a depiction of Independence Hall was used on the reverse of the coin. The seal returned to the reverse starting in 1977. * at the center of the iconic oval rug in the Oval Office of the White House (each president typically designs his own, but most rugs since President Truman have used the arms). * incorporated into the Presidential Service Badge issued to US Military personnel. * on many versions of presidential china, such as the Wilson or Reagan china, which is often used at state dinners at the White House. * at the burial sites of former Presidents (e.g., Wilson and Reagan). = Regulated use = In general, commercial use of the seal is prohibited by 18 USC 713 of the United States Code, and further defined by Executive Orders 11916 and 11649. The United States Secret Service is authorized to use the seal in conjunction with fund raising sales for its charitable benefit fund. Unofficial use of the seal is regulated by the White House Graphics and Calligraphy Office and monitored by the office of the White House Counsel. On September 28, 2005, Grant M. Dixton, associate counsel to George W. Bush, requested that the satirical newspaper The Onion remove the presidential seal from its website. (TimesSelection subscription required) The Graphic and Calligraphy Office will approve of the seal's use in application of official gifts, an example being its application to a silver cigarette box presented as a gift to Franklin Roosevelt. History The early history of the president's seal remains obscure, as there is essentially no record on early usage, nor when its use started. It appears that the primary use was to seal the envelopes on correspondence from the President to Congress, and the envelopes were presumably discarded even if the correspondence was kept, so there is little record remaining.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 422 The first documented seal was in 1850 (which almost certainly was not the first one), and the design used on today's seal had its origins in a coat of arms used on invitations by President Hayes in 1877. It was not defined in law until an executive order by President Truman in 1945. =Seal of the President of the Congress of the Confederation= During the period of the Congress of the Confederation, prior to the creation of the U.S. federal government and thus the presidency, the President of the Continental Congress (a mostly ceremonial position, elected to preside over meetings) had a seal. It was a small oval, with the crest from the recently adopted Great Seal (the radiant constellation of thirteen stars surrounded by clouds) in the center, with the motto E Pluribus Unum above it. Much like today's presidential seal, the primary purpose was apparently to seal envelopes on correspondence sent to the Congress. Benson Lossing (writing in 1856) claimed it was used by all the Presidents of the Congress after 1782, though only two examples from Thomas Mifflin are documented today: Lossing described a 1784 letter, and Commodore Byron McCandless (while doing research for the 1945 seal redesign) photographed a seal on a November 17, 1783 Mifflin letter to the Governor of Rhode Island. An 1885 article from the Daily Graphic included an original engraving of the seal supposedly from a 1784 letter; it is not known if this was just based on Lossing's version or if they had a separate impression. None of these impressions are known to still exist, and no confirmation of an order for this seal (proving an official status) has been found in Continental Congress records.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 562-566 This seal's use apparently did not pass over to the new government in 1789. =Dorsett seal= Dorsett seal, reversed photo In 1894, Palemon Howard Dorsett (a lifelong Department of Agriculture employee) turned up with a metal die very similar to the original die of the Great Seal, except that the arrows and the olive branch were switched, indicating an intentional \\"difference\\" to distinguish it from the actual Great Seal. The die had apparently been owned by George Washington, though there are no known uses of this die, and there even is no indication it could actually be used as a seal. The origins and purpose of this die remain unknown, though the authors of a 1978 book on the Great Seal speculated it was a gift to Washington and possibly an early version (or forerunner) of a presidential seal.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 409-417 The Dorsett seal was subsequently loaned to the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association to be displayed at Washington's estate.https://archive.org/stream/TheEagleAndTheShield/The%20Eagle%20and%20the%20Shield#page/n463/mode/2up/ =Early presidential seals= There is little extant evidence of any seals actually used by early U.S. presidents. One possibility is a letter from 1835, sent from Paris to President Jackson and then forwarded to the Department of State. The envelope has a small circular red wax seal, with the upper portion appearing to have a circle of cloud puffs similar to the Great Seal, with rays of a glory. However, the rest of the design has been obliterated, so nothing further can be determined, and no other uses of this seal have been found.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 418 The documented history begins in 1850, when a seal was made after a crude drawing submitted by President Fillmore. It depicted an eagle \\"displayed with wings inverted\\", i.e. with its wingtips down, holding an olive branch and three arrows in its talons. The shield is essentially the same as the Great Seal, with a blue chief and red and white stripes and the eagle facing to its right, though there were nineteen stripes and the outermost stripes were red, both unlike the Great Seal. Thirty-one stars were distributed above and around the eagle, indicating that the seal dates from after when California became the 31st state in September 1850. It was made by Edward Stabler, a farmer and postmaster in Sandy Spring, Maryland, who had earlier made seals for the Senate, House of Representatives, and several government departments.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 418-420The Eagle and the Shield, p. 423 Stabler had also made a seal for the Vice President in 1846, and the correspondence surrounding it indicated that even earlier vice presidential seals existed, so presumably earlier presidential seals existed as well.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 458 The president's seal was described by Benson Lossing in 1856 as \\"round, with an eagle upon it\\" (contrasting it to the seal used during the Continental Congress). \\"The Old Seal\\", possibly from the 1840s The information on Fillmore's seal is from an 1885 article in the Daily Graphic, and (according to Daniel S. Lamont, the private secretary to President Cleveland and one of the article's sources) the 1850 seal was still in use at that time and was used to seal envelopes sent to either house of Congress. The article claims that Stabler made two seals, the other being a smaller one for use on letters, and stated that both were illustrated in the article. While the large seal was illustrated, the rendering of a smaller seal was labeled the \\"Old Seal\\" and had only twenty-seven stars, seeming to indicate it would date from 1845 during James K. Polk's administration rather than being a smaller 1850 seal. While Fillmore did use a personal seal (a simple script F in a circular border) it does not appear that this was the smaller seal mentioned. The design on the \\"Old Seal\\" was quite similar to the large version, though it was a different rendering of the eagle with small differences in positioning. The inscriptions were also slightly different; the large seal had THE SEAL OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, while the smaller one (like the present-day version) omitted the word \\"The\\" at the beginning. =Lincoln's seal= The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum owns a small seal used by Abraham Lincoln, which was previously a part of the Taper Collection. It is about the size of a penny, has an ivory handle, and is still encrusted with red wax. The design is exactly the same as the one labeled the \\"Old Seal\\" in the Daily Graphic article, except it has 36 stars (Nevada became the 36th state in October 1864). A 1927 book also describes a red wax presidential seal on a letter from Lincoln to Hiram Barney. In September 1864, an engraver named J. Baumgarten from Baltimore, Maryland made and sent Lincoln an unsolicited seal, marked with \\"A Lincoln\\" on its side, meant for personal use. Baumgarten also claimed to have made seals of the \\"same plan\\" for both Presidents Fillmore and Buchanan. and This was just prior to Nevada becoming the 36th state, but as the design of this seal is not described, and no reply from Lincoln is known and no payment is recorded, it is not possible to know if it was the aforementioned 36-star seal, something similar to the simple F seal used by Fillmore, an entirely different seal, or if it was used at all. Baumgarten may well have been related to Selig Baumgarten, an engraver who emigrated to Baltimore from Hanover with eight children in 1852. One of Selig's sons, Herman Baumgarten, later engraved the 1877 version of the Great Seal.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 223-225 =Hayes design= Hayes coat of arms President Hayes was the first to use the presidential coat of arms on White House invitations, and the design used was the direct precursor to the modern version. Its first appearance was in April 1877, about six weeks after his inauguration. The eagle's wings were shown \\"displayed\\" (wingtips up), with an arc of cloud puffs between the wings, and thirteen stars scattered below the arc and surrounding a scroll reading E Pluribus Unum. The eagle's head was turned to its left toward the arrows for the first time, a feature which would last until 1945. The eagle itself was similar to the Great Seal rendering at the time (prior to the more robust eagle used in the 1885 redesign of the Great Seal). The designer of this embossing is not known; with minor variations it was used on invitations until the early years of President Wilson's administration.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 426-429 The design using the arc of clouds is reminiscent of an early rendering of the Great Seal made by James Trenchard in 1786, which was then later used on Indian Peace Medals handed out by President Washington. It is also very similar to a design seen on the letterhead of a proclamation by President Polk in 1846, which also had the eagle facing its left but additionally switched the olive branch and arrows so the head was still looking towards the branch. (Earlier proclamation letterheads, and even the Andrew Jackson White House china, also switched the arrows and branch and had the eagle facing to its left, though they were completely different designs otherwise.For example, an 1828 J.Q. Adams proclamation, an 1834 Jackson proclamation, and an 1838 Van Buren proclamation. The Jackson china can be seen at ) Other influences may have been some U.S. coins and President Grant's china, which used the general design of an arc of clouds though the rest of the details were different.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 428 see footnote 39 The actual seal used by the president was changed to have a similar design, though apparently not at the time. The Daily Graphic article reported the 1850 seal was still in use in 1885, but the change had been made by 1894, as an impression of this new seal was obtained from Henry T. Thurber (President Cleveland's private secretary) for use in a book on heraldry. This version moved closer to the modern design, with the words OF THE in smaller capital letters than the other words (a feature which is still used), and the layout of stars being slightly changed into essentially the arrangement still used today.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 429-431 This seal remained in use until 1945, as Gaillard Hunt confirmed the design was still current as of 1916, and it also matches actual impressions taken from the presidential seal in 1936 during Franklin Roosevelt's administration.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 439-440 The design continued to evolve in other places in the meantime, particularly the presidential flag, and these evolved designs were used when the seal was changed again in 1945. =Martiny plaque= During renovations in early 1903, a bronze inlaid version of the seal was placed in the floor of the Entrance Hall of the White House, directly under the lantern. It was made from a model by the sculptor Philip Martiny, who followed the general arrangement of the Hayes arms but used considerable artistic license with the details. The eagle is substantially altered, with differently-shaped wings and thickly feathered legs. The shape of the shield was different, and the stars were arranged differently, with all stars appearing above the scroll using an arc of 10 stars with three more directly underneath. The scroll's inscription was E¬∑PLVRIBVS¬∑VNVM.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 430-432 President Truman later felt that it was not right for people to walk over it, so when the White House was renovated again in 1948 he had the seal removed and placed over the door to the Diplomatic Reception Room, where it still is today.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 432 The plaster seal in the Oval Office ceiling (originally installed in 1934 and at some point changed so the eagle faces to its right) is also based on this design,The Eagle and the Shield, p. 440-441 and a version is in the floor next to Wilson's tomb in the Washington National Cathedral. =Bailey Banks & Biddle representation= The Bailey Banks & Biddle print used during discussions; annotations from McCandless are on the right In 1916 President Wilson decided to make a change in the presidential flag, the Navy version of which used the Great Seal on a blue background (there was a competing design from the Army, which was different but also used the Great Seal). The Aide to the Secretary of the Navy, Lt. Commander Byron McCandless, suggested adding four stars to the Navy version. Wilson however wanted the \\"president's eagle\\" used on the flag instead, showing McCandless the Martiny plaque as an example.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 434-435 Wilson at some point obtained a color print of the president's seal, probably from the Philadelphia firm of Bailey Banks & Biddle, which was also used in the discussions. The eagle in this version was more based on the 1885 Great Seal, and is essentially the design used in the modern seal ‚Äî the style and details of the eagle, the rays of the glory, the arrangement of the thirteen stars, and the cloud puffs have all been carried over into the current version.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. xl-xli This design was used for the 1916 flag, and also on subsequent presidential invitations and Wilson's presidential china, meaning the coat of arms was effectively changed as well. The actual presidential seal die was not changed at the time, though a 1917 McCandless publication on flags did show the new design as its depiction the seal.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 437-439 =The 1945 seal= Illustration from the 1945 executive order, with 48 stars In March 1945, President Roosevelt (who had been Assistant Secretary of the Navy during Wilson's administration and was involved in the four-star 1916 presidential flag design) noted that the flags for the new ranks of Fleet Admiral and General of the Army both had five stars, and asked the Army and Navy Departments for suggestions. The Secretary of the Navy (whose flag also had four stars) replied that there was no issue, as the combination of four stars and the Coat of Arms of the Presidential Seal was indicative of higher rank.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 441 Roosevelt persisted though, and in March sent a query to Commodore Byron McCandless, then commanding the Naval Repair Base in San Diego, California. Roosevelt died on April 12, before McCandless could reply, but President Truman expressed a continuing interest in the matter and eventually a long reply was sent. McCandless recommended changing the four stars such that they were each made of 12 small stars, arranged in the shape of a larger six-pointed star; the four large stars would represent Roosevelt's Four Freedoms, the 48 total stars would represent the states, and the six-pointed star would be representative of the president's rank above five-star generals and admirals. Truman however disliked the idea of representing relative rank, and instead decided on a simple circle of 48 stars.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 441-443 The proposed design was sent to the War and Navy Departments for comment. In a memorandum dated August 22, 1945 Arthur E. DuBois, the chief of the Heraldic Section of the Army's Office of the Quartermaster General (forerunner to the Army Institute of Heraldry), made several suggestions. He recommended making the eagle in full color per heraldic tradition (the presidential flag of the time depicted the eagle as entirely white), and recommended against using 48 stars, believing that flags and seals should not be subject to external changes such as adding additional states and instead suggested a ring of 13 stars. DuBois also noted that the seal had never had an official definition, meaning there was also no explanation for the eagle facing to its left instead of the typical heraldic custom of having such figures face to their right (\\"dexter\\"), which is considered the honorable side. Therefore, he recommended changing the direction the eagle faced, and provided an illustration along with a suggested blazon to be used in an official description.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 442-445 Truman agreed with most of these suggestions, additionally liking that the eagle would now face towards the olive branches (which he felt was symbolic of a nation on the march and dedicated to peace,The Eagle and the Shield, p. 449, \\"In the new Coat of Arms, Seal and Flag, the Eagle not only faces to its right the direction of honor but also toward the olive branches of peace which it holds in its right talon. Formerly the eagle faced toward the arrows in its left talon arrows, symbolic of war.\\", White House press release, October 25, 1945.), but decided to keep the 48 stars. Truman also considered adding a lightning effect to the arrows as a reference to the atomic bomb, but later decided against it. On August 28 Truman had DuBois make a model containing all the final decisions, which was then approved.The Eagle and the Shield, pp. 446-447 On October 25, 1945, President Truman issued Executive Order 9646, which officially defined the presidential coat of arms and seal for the first time, and unified the design between the seal and the flag. The only changes since have been to add stars to the outer circle. The actual die of the new seal was first used on December 5, 1945.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 450 =The 1959 and 1960 changes= Illustration from the 1960 executive order Alaska was admitted as the 49th state on January 3, 1959, which caused the 49th star to be added to the United States flag on the following July 4. On May 26, President Eisenhower issued , which added a 49th star to the outer ring on the presidential coat of arms (and therefore the seal and flag as well), also effective on July 4. The order was otherwise identical to Truman's order, which it replaced. Hawaii was admitted as the 50th state on August 21, 1959, and Eisenhower duly issued on February 5, 1960 (effective July 4, 1960) to add the 50th star to the coat of arms. Once again, it was identical to the previous orders other than the number of stars. This remains the official definition today.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 451 Because the upcoming admission of Hawaii would cause a further change the following year, no seal dies were made in 1959 with 49 stars, and the 1945 dies continued in use. New dies with 50 stars were made by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing only after the 1960 executive order came into effect.The Eagle and the Shield, p. 454  Misconception  A popular but erroneous myth is that the seal is changed during times of war, so that the eagle faces the arrows in its left talon. This belief may have arisen because major changes to the seal have coincidentally been made before or after wars ‚Äì specifically, the 1945 change in the seal, and also the 1916 change in the flag (though not the seal) from the right-facing Great Seal to the left-facing presidential seal. This misconception may also have arisen from a comment made by Winston Churchill, who (regarding Truman's redesign of the seal) joked: \\"Mr. President, with the greatest respect, I would prefer the American eagle's neck to be on a swivel so that it could face the olive branches or the arrows, as the occasion might demand\\". The belief is perpetuated by a 2000 episode of The West Wing entitled \\"What Kind of Day Has It Been?\\". Character Admiral Fitzwallace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, notes that the presidential seal in the center of the Oval Office carpet contains a shield bearing a bald eagle clutching the olive branch in its right talons and arrows in its left. The eagle's head is turned toward the olive branch. Fitzwallace alleges that in times of war the Seal is replaced with one in which the eagle's head is turned toward the arrows. Similarly, the Dan Brown novel Deception Point (2001) includes a passage implying that the seal embroidered on the carpet in the Oval Office is switched by White House workers. The novel states that an alternative carpet is stored in the basement, and the workers make the change overnight when no one notices. The Presidential Seal as depicted in National Treasure: Book of Secrets. This is a modification of a Great Seal graphic, not a presidential seal. In the 2007 film National Treasure: Book of Secrets, there is a variation of the Presidential Seal that shows the eagle clutching a scroll. This variation is supposed to represent the president's secret book that is passed down from president to president and contains the country's secrets.  Popular culture  The seal is sometimes used in modified form as a marketing tool, or to make a political statement. The punk rock group the Ramones used a personal variation of the seal as their logo, replacing the arrows with a baseball bat and the inscription around it with the members' names, and also changing the motto and the design on the shield. Blink-182 and other bands have also used the logo on T-shirts. Some fashion brands (mainly for teenagers) have also used the logo as an added design for accessories like bags. In addition, the animated menu sequence on all DVDs of The West Wing contains a slightly altered version of the seal (40 stars, added country name, segmented ribbon). In the backing video for Skinny Puppy's \\"VX Gas Attack\\", featured on the Greater Wrong of the Right LIVE DVD, another altered version of the seal is shown (the olive and arrows replaced with bleeding gas nozzles, and the eagle replaced with a skull). It is also used by rap group The Diplomats as their trademark logo, except that the olive branch and arrows are usually replaced by two guns and the word \\"Diplomats\\" is across the center of the eagle. In the video game Metal Wolf Chaos, the titular powered armor is piloted by President Michael Wilson, the protagonist, and is adorned with large images of the seal, although modified from the real-life version. 2019 spoof incident The spoof seal that appeared at the Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit 2019 On July 23, 2019, President Donald Trump, the forty-fifth president, gave an address to young Republicans at the Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit 2019 in front of a screen onto which a spoof caricature of the seal was projected. The graphic was switched after 80 seconds. At the time, no one from the White House, the hosting facility, the hosting organization, or the summit organizers appears to have been aware of the substitution. The story was reported by the Washington Post on July 24, including photos and video of Trump speaking in front of the fake seal. Turning Point USA later blamed an audio-visual employee for the gaffe. The \\"faux seal\\" showed a double-headed eagle, in the tradition of the Russian state (suggestive of Russian interference in U.S. politics). In one claw the arrows had been replaced with golf clubs (representing the president's connection to the sport), while the other held a wad of green banknotes. The chief of the shield bore five white hammer-and-sickle devices; and the motto E pluribus unum had been replaced by the phrase , Spanish for \\"Number 45 is a puppet\\". The graphic had been designed and marketed in 2016 as a joke by Charles Leazott, a former Republican who opposes President Trump. He later commented that the unidentified perpetrator was \\"either wildly incompetent or the best troll ever. Either way, I love them.\\" He now displays an image of Trump speaking before his seal design on the site for his related products.

Previously a quiet and little-known location, a development boom in the 1980s sparked growth in the area, and since then, Corolla has become a popular vacation destination. Resting between the Currituck Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, Corolla attracts mainly beach-goers, especially in the summer months. Corolla is home to numerous attractions such as the historic Whalehead Club, Currituck Beach Light, Center for Wildlife Education, and is known for its numerous locations for shopping, dining, and participating in water sports.Corolla Guide& Carova.‚ÄúCorolla NC outer Banks Vacations, Corolla Guide, Retrieved 13 May 2016.OuterBanks.com.‚ÄúCorolla, NC‚Äù, OuterBanks.com & Visitors Guide, Retrieved 13 May 2016.

History Corolla, as viewed from the Currituck Beach Lighthouse The community of Corolla began as a European development on American Indian hunting grounds. Tribes including the Chowanoke and Poteskeet hunted along the barrier island. The town of Corolla was first called Jones Hill, after an early settler. It was also known as Whalehead or Currituck Beach. Early settlers made a living from fishing and hunting, as well as from salvage from shipwrecks and serving as guides to hunters. Currituck was derived from an American Indian term, Carotank, meaning land of the wild geese. On the Atlantic migratory flyway, the area at the time had a large wild geese population. Over hunting in the late 19th century caused numbers to severely drop. The town officially took the name Corolla in 1895 when a post office opened in the community. The name was chosen to refer to the botanic term for the petals of a flower. Banker horses of Corolla Development of Currituck's Northern Outer Banks began in 1967 when investors from Sandbridge, Virginia, put together an investment group to purchase undeveloped land. The first subdivision plotted was Carova with 1,993 lots. The lots were originally priced in the early 1970s at $8,000; as of 2006, some of these lots are worth up to $500,000. Currituck Heritage Park which houses the Outer Banks Center for Wildlife Education The investors planned for a road to come through from Virginia Beach, Virginia, to allow access to the lots; however, these plans were abandoned in 1973 when the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge south of Sandbridge was closed to all vehicular traffic, except by permit. Development pushed south through the 1970s, creating well over 1,000 additional lots in several subdivisions. In 1984 the residents of Corolla succeeded in their attempts to gain a public access road from the south. The state began paving the extension of NC-12 toward the north. In addition to the Currituck Beach Light, the Currituck Shooting Club and Whalehead Club are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Beaches of Corolla  The total number of beaches where public can access is fifteen. Among these fifteen beaches six beaches have life guards while two have showers. The beach which have life guards is, Corolla Village Road (shower, bathhouse, parking), Shad Street (parking), Sturgeon Walkway (parking), Bonito Street (parking), Sailfish Walkway (parking), Yaupon Lane (shower, bathhouse, parking).  Drive time from Corolla to other outer banks  The time in summer usually increases because of heavy traffic and observed up-to ten more minutes it takes. The list of time required to outer banks are as below * Corolla to Duck ‚Äì 25 minutes * Corolla to Southern Shores ‚Äì 35 minutes * Corolla to Kitty Hawk ‚Äì 40 minutes * Corolla to Kill Devil Hills ‚Äì 45 minutes * Corolla to Nags Head ‚Äì 50 minutes * Corolla to Manteo ‚Äì 1 hour 15 minutes * Corolla to Oregon Inlet ‚Äì 1 hour 20 minutes * Corolla to Avon ‚Äì 1 hour 45 minutes * Corolla to Hatteras Village ‚Äì 2 hours 15 minutes Climate According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Corolla, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (Cfak).

As of the 2010 census, the population was 369. During the peak vacation season, starting after Memorial Day, the population increases to over 20,000. Duck is the northernmost incorporated town in Dare County and the Outer Banks' newest town, incorporated on May 1, 2002. Duck offers visitors outdoor recreational activities, summer events and concerts, watersports, fine dining, shopping, art galleries, and a nationally known jazz festival, as well as the Town Park and soundside boardwalk. Geography Duck is located along the northern Outer Banks, between the Atlantic Ocean to the east and Currituck Sound to the west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 35.02% is water. Originally part of Currituck County to the north, the stretch of the Outer Banks which includes Duck was transferred to Dare County in the early 20th century. The region was named for the many ducks and waterfowl in the area. Tourist attractions The town park is a recreational facility with trails through the maritime forest and willow swamp. It also has an amphitheater, playground, picnic shelter, and public kayak/canoeing launch. The town has built a boardwalk which can be accessed from the park and through the commercial village. The boardwalk extends along Currituck Sound. Duck's beach was named one of the \\"Top 15 Family-Friendly Beaches in America\\". In October, Duck hosts its annual Jazz Festival. During the summer months, the town offers over 60 events and programs including Yoga on the Green, Movies on the Sound, a family magic show, live concerts and interactive theater. Programs are free and open to the public. Town Council The town of Duck encourages people to play an active role in their government.

Retrieved from http://www.townofduck.com/ History In 1984, the North Carolina General Assembly established Duck as a North Carolina Beautification District. As such, an ad valorem tax could be levied to beautify the district and/or protect its citizens. Initially, a tax was levied for the purpose of providing for the underground installation of power lines throughout the community. This action prevented the power company from installing concrete poles along Duck Road. The result was an uncluttered skyline, increased safety for evacuation from the area (no downed poles or wires), and maintaining household power through major storm periods. From 1986 to 1988, the community agreed to levy a tax for a two-year period to pay for the construction costs of a multiple-use trail. These funds were augmented by a $30,000 grant received by the Duck Civic Association (DCA) from the Dare County Tourism Bureau. The State Department of Transportation was also a major participant in obtaining easements and contracting for the trail installation. In 1987, the Duck Civic Association was established to represent the community in matters of public safety, land use, and other public interests. The association management was set up with a nine-member board of directors and the usual complement of officers. A morning theater and music show at the Duck Town Park. On July 18, 1994, the Dare County Commissioners adopted a resolution \\"to preserve our coastal village atmosphere through land use management and the policies and implementation strategies contained in the 1994 Land Use Plan update,\\" signed by Robert V. Owens, Jr., Chairman. Incorporation On March 28, 2001, Representative Bill Culpepper introduced the Duck Incorporation Bill in the House. On August 29, 2001, after clearing the Senate on August 28 and the House on August 29, the bill became law. On November 6, 2001, voters voted in favor of the incorporation of Duck.

Tourist economy Many of Rodanthe's restaurants, shops and markets are seasonal, closing during the winter months and reopening the following spring. Many of these are family-owned, rather than chain franchises. Provisions can still be purchased on the Outer Banks during the winter months, but a short drive south to the town of Avon or north to Nags Head is required. There are only two motels within the larger settlement of Chicamacomico. There are, however, three inns or bed and breakfasts on the island of Hatteras (\\"The Inn on Pamlico Sound\\", \\"Cape Hatteras Bed and Breakfast\\", and the \\"Seaside Inn\\".) There are numerous rental houses, large and small, as well as numerous campgrounds ranging from deluxe to rustic (\\"Camp Hatteras\\", \\"Ocean Waves\\", \\"Cape Hatteras KOA\\", etc.). Several smaller campgrounds cater to water sports enthusiasts. Local water sports include fishing, kayaking (both ocean and sound-side), swimming, sailboarding, kiteboarding, and Wreck diving, among others. In fiction The rental house, Serendipity, used in filming Nights in Rodanthe In 2002, Nicholas Sparks published the book Nights in Rodanthe that was later adapted into a movie. George C. Wolfe directed the film adaptation, which was partially filmed in the town of Rodanthe and entirely filmed in eastern North Carolina - including Cape Hatteras, Southport and Wilmington. The movie was released on September 26, 2008. Several Rodanthe landmarks such as the Rodanthe Pier were used during filming. During film production, one of the rental houses, \\"Serendipity\\", the northeasternmost house in Rodanthe, was transformed into the fictional \\"Inn at Rodanthe\\". This house was damaged and condemned after a nor'easter storm in November 2009.

The images, however, were blurry from diffraction. While working on an alternate approach for General Electric, a technician came to him with a badge. The technician did not believe there were X-Rays in the machine, he had taken his warning badge, with X-ray film, and placed a bit of screen wire on it. He pulled the badge out and saw the exposed screen wire pattern on it. He also saw another screen wire pattern, however, far smaller and finer. Newberry recognized that the fine pattern was the screen wire mounting for the specimen, but that it was 400-to-the-inch wire and that it had been magnified by expansion of the shadow. This gave him the insight he needed to create a working commercial microscope, placing the specimen very close to a point source of X-rays and then farther back a photographic plate. The \\"shadow\\" of the specimen would be under-exposed, that is X-ray dark, on the plate. This process is similar to medical X-rays, except that the microscope uses a point source for clarity whereas a medical x-ray tends to use a much larger x-ray source to avoid distortion.

He served as British Ambassador to the United States between 1924 and 1930. He was one of Britain's most influential diplomats of the early part of the twentieth century. With a gift for languages and a skilled diplomat, Howard is described in his biography as an integral member of the small group of men who made and implemented British foreign policy between 1900 and 1930, a critical transitional period in Britain's history as a world power.B. J. C. McKercher, Esme Howard: A Diplomatic Biography, CUP, 1989, revised ed., 2006 Early life Howard was born on 15 September 1863 at Greystoke Castle, near Penrith, Cumberland. He was the youngest son of the former Charlotte Caroline Georgina Long and Henry Howard, an MP for Steyning and New Shoreham. His elder brothers were Henry Howard, an MP for Penrith, and Sir Stafford Howard, an MP for Thornbury and Cumberland East who served as Under-Secretary of State for India in 1886. His paternal grandfather was Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard, the younger brother of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. His maternal grandparents were Henry Lawes Long and Lady Catharine Long (a daughter of Horatio Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford and sister of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford). Howard was educated at Harrow School. Career In 1885, he passed the Diplomatic Service examination, and was assistant private secretary to the Earl of Carnarvon as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland before being attached to the British Embassy in Rome. In 1888, he arrived in Berlin as the embassy's third secretary, and after retiring from the Diplomatic Service four years later, he was made assistant private secretary to the Earl of Kimberley, the Foreign Secretary at the time. Howard was a talented linguist who would spoke 10 languages and chose to retire from the diplomatic service in 1890 out of boredom. For the next 13 years, Howard lived a life of irregular employment, spending his time prospecting for gold in South Africa, working as a researcher for the social reformer Charles Booth, making two lengthy trips to Morocco, working as the private secretary to Lord Kimberley in 1894‚Äì1895, frequently visiting his sister at her estate in Italy and running unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate in the 1892 election. Greatly concerned with social problems, Howard had developed in the 1890s his \\"Economic Credo\\" about \\"co-partnership\\" under which he envisioned the state, businesses and unions working together for the improvement of the working classes. Alongside his \\"Economic Credo\\", Howard believed in \\"Imperial Federation\\" under which Great Britain would be united in a federation that would take in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and South Africa. In 1897, Howard set up a rubber plantation in Tobago, which was partly intended to finance a \\"co- partnership\\" business in Britain and partly to demonstrate to the British working class how the British empire benefited them financially. Howard came from a cadet branch of one of the most famous Roman Catholic aristocratic families in England, but his grandfather had converted to the Church of England and Howard had been raised as an Anglican. In 1898, Howard converted to Roman Catholicism to marry the Countess Isabella Giustiniani-Bandini, who came from a \\"black\\" Italian aristocratic family who supported the Papacy in its refusal to recognize the Italian state, unlike the \\"white\\" aristocrats who supported the Italian crown against the Catholic Church. In 1903, following the failure of his rubber plantation together with a lack of public interest in his \\"Economic Credo\\" led to Howard rejoining the Diplomatic Service. Having fought in the Second Boer War with the Imperial Yeomanry, Howard became Consul General for Crete in 1903, and three years later was sent to Washington as a counsellor at the embassy there. Esme Howard was married to Isabella Giovanna Teresa Gioachina Giustiniani-Bandini of Venice. In 1906, the Liberals won the general election and Howard's old friend whom he had known since 1894, Sir Edward Grey became Foreign Secretary, which greatly benefited his career. In 1908, he was appointed in the same role to Vienna, and that same year became Consul General at Budapest. Three years later, Howard was made Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Swiss Confederation, and in 1913 he was transferred to Stockholm, where he spent the whole of the First World War. During World War I, Sweden leaned in a pro-German neutrality and Howard's time as the British minister in Stockholm was a difficult one with the Swedish leaders openly expressing their hopes for a German victory. In an attempt to counter-act the pro-German sympathies of the Swedish elite, Howard sought to broaden his social contacts in Sweden, meeting with journalists, union leaders, businessmen, academics, clergymen, soldiers, and any local anglophiles in order to explain to them the British viewpoint. In 1916, having already been appointed CMG and CVO ten years earlier, he was knighted as KCMG, becoming KCB three years later. In 1919, Sir Esm√© Howard was attached to the British delegation during the Paris Peace Conference, also being made British Civil Delegate on the International Commission to Poland. At the Paris Peace Conference, Howard was assigned to drafting sections of the Treaty of Versailles dealing with Poland. That same year, he was sent to Madrid as ambassador there, arriving in August 1919. Being appointed ambassador to Spain was a major step up in the Foreign Office, but Howard knew that Spanish issues were for the most part secondary to Lord Curzon, the Foreign Secretary. In Howard's first annual summary as an ambassador from Madrid, Howard wrote: \\"In the first survey of the situation which I wrote after my arrival in this country I drew attention to three dominant factors in the state of affairs then existing: the activities of the juntas, the labor unrest and the bankruptcy of parliamentary institutions. These elements were perhaps not so immediately threatening as they then seemed but they are still elements of mischief\\". Howard reported that the Spanish economy which depended upon exports of raw materials was collapsing due to the fall in commodity prices, that the politicians were incapable of providing leadership and King Alfonso XIII was not behaving as a constitutional monarch with the king trying to rule by intriguing with various politicians and generals instead of reigning. Howard reported that for in 1920 that Spain had 1, 060 strikes that year and predicated that 1921 seemed likely to surpass that record. Through Howard reported almost weekly bombings, assassinations and other \\"outrages\\" committed by extreme left-wing groups, in the main he blamed the confrontational relations between unions and businesses on the management, reporting that most Spanish corporations had little interest in compromise. On 9 July 1920, the miners working for the British Rio Tinto company went on strike. Howard's dispatches to London stating that the attitude of Walter Browning, Rio Tinto's manager in Spain, was harming Britain's image in Spain, led to the Foreign Office discreetly pressuring the CEO of the Rio Tinto company, Lord Denbigh, to settle the strike. Much to Howard's satisfaction, the strike was ended in early 1921 with the Rio Tinto company giving wage increases to their Spanish miners. In a sort of goodwill tour, Howard visited the Basque country in November 1920 where he toured mines, shipyards and foundries owned by British companies in an attempt to improve the British image with the Basque working class. In 1921, Howard had to play detective to find out the truth about reports about a major Spanish military disaster in the Rif mountains of Morocco. After two weeks of seeking the truth, Howard reported to London that the Spanish defeat at the Battle of the Annual had been \\"decisive\\" and warned that the \\"Disaster of the Annual\\" as the battle was known in Spain had plunged the country into a crisis. Howard reported that much fighting and huge expenditure of money that almost everything the Spanish had won in the Rif over the years had been lost in a matter of weeks and that the Spanish had been driven back in disorder to two coastal enclaves. Howard predicated that the \\"Disaster of the Annual\\" would lead to \\"the growth of a chauvinistic Pan- Islamic movement\\" in North Africa and that the French would intervene rather than see their own position threatened in Algeria and French Morocco. As the British did not wish for the French to control all of Morocco, Howard was ordered to see if it was possible if somehow the Spanish might rescue themselves from the war that they were losing in the Rif without the help of the French. Howard wrote that in the aftermath of the \\"Disaster of the Annual\\", the Spanish people were obsessed with finding out who had sent General Manuel Fern√°ndez Silvestre into his ill-fated drive into the Rif and growing evidence was emerging that the King Alfonso had given the orders, predicating the future of the Spanish monarchy was at stake. Howard described Spain's colonial rule in Morocco as \\"a byword for cruelty, incompetence and corruption\\", but argued Britain had never let moral factors interfere \\"for the sake of larger and wider purposes of Policy\\", giving the example of British support for the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century despite the mistreatment of Christians in the Balkans. Howard argued that the main concern for Britain was preventing France from expanding its influence in Morocco, which meant that Britain should support Spain wholeheartedly in the Rif war. In 1922, Howard suggested that to improve the image of Britain in Spain that several British intellectuals visit that country to give talks that might about the needed change in public relations and shortly afterwards, Hilaire Belloc visited Madrid to speak about Anglo-Spanish relations. To formalize these exchanges, Howard together with the Duke of Alba founded the English Committee in Spain, which arranged for university students in both countries to take exchange courses and for various British intellectuals to undertake lecture tours in Spain. In another initiative to improve Britain's image in Spain, Howard with the British-born Queen Victoria Eugenia established a relief fund for Spanish soldiers wounded in Morocco. In the immediate post-war period, British decision-makers viewed France as too powerful and wanted a stronger Spain to check French power in the Mediterranean, and for this reason Howard welcomed the coup d'√©tat of General Miguel Primo de Rivera in September 1923 as a force for order in Spain. Through Howard initially distrusted Primo de Rivera because of his stance on the Gibraltar issue, he quickly found from his discussions with Primo de Rivera that his main concern was winning the Rif war and he wanted British support for Spanish claims in Morocco against the French. In 1924, Howard returned to Washington as ambassador. Puzzled at first by the provincial background and eccentric style of President Calvin Coolidge, Howard came to like and trust the president, realizing that he was conciliatory And eager to find solutions to mutual problems, such as the Liquor Treaty of 1924 which diminished friction over smuggling. Washington was greatly pleased when Britain ended its alliance with Japan. Both nations were pleased when in 1923 the wartime debt problem was compromised on satisfactory terms.Benjamin D.

An X-ray microscope uses electromagnetic radiation in the soft X-ray band to produce magnified images of objects. Since X-rays penetrate most objects, there is no need to specially prepare them for X-ray microscopy observations. Unlike visible light, X-rays do not reflect or refract easily, and they are invisible to the human eye. Therefore, an X-ray microscope exposes film or uses a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector to detect X-rays that pass through the specimen. It is a contrast imaging technology using the difference in absorption of soft X-rays in the water window region (wavelengths: 2.34-4.4 nm, energies: 280-530 eV) by the carbon atom (main element composing the living cell) and the oxygen atom (main element for water). Microfocus X-ray also achieves high magnification by projection. A microfocus X-ray tube produces X-rays from an extremely small focal spot (5 Œºm down to 0.1 Œºm). The X-rays are in the more conventional X-ray range (20 to 300 kV), and they are not re-focused.  Invention and Development  The history of X-ray microscopy can be traced back to the early 20th century. After the German physicist R√∂ntgen discovered X-rays in 1895, scientists soon illuminated an object using an X-ray point source and captured the shadow images of the object with a resolution of several microns. In 1918, Einstein pointed out that the refractive index for X rays in most mediums should be just slightly less than 1, which means refractive optical parts would be difficult to use for X-ray applications. Early X-ray microscopes by Paul Kirkpatrick and Albert Baez used grazing incidence reflective X-ray optics to focus the X-rays, which grazed X-rays off parabolic curved mirrors at a very high angle of incidence. An alternative method of focusing X-rays is to use a tiny Fresnel zone plate of concentric gold or nickel rings on a silicon dioxide substrate. Sir Lawrence Bragg produced some of the first usable X-ray images with his apparatus in the late 1940s. Indirect drive laser inertial confinement fusion uses a \\"hohlraum\\" which is irradiated with laser beam cones from either side on its inner surface to bathe a fusion microcapsule inside with smooth high intensity X-rays. The highest energy X-rays which penetrate the hohlraum can be visualized using an X-ray microscope such as here, where X-radiation is represented in orange/red. In the 1950s Sterling Newberry produced a shadow X-ray microscope which placed the specimen between the source and a target plate, this became the basis for the first commercial X-ray microscopes from the General Electric Company. After a silent period in the 1960s, X-ray microscopy regained people's attention in the 1970s. In 1972, Horowitz and Howell built the first synchrotron-based X-ray microscope at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator. This microscope scanned samples using synchrotron radiation from a tiny pinhole and showed the abilities of both transmission and fluorescence microscopy. Other developments in this period include the first holographic demonstration by Sadao Aoki and Seishi Kikuta in Japan, the first TXMs using zone plates by Schmahl et al., and Stony Brook's experiments in STXM. The uses of synchrotron light sources brought new possibilities for X-ray microscopy in the 1980s. However, as new synchrotron source-based microscopes were built in many groups, people realized that it was difficult to perform such experiments due to insufficient technological capabilities at that time, such as poor coherent illuminations, poor quality x-ray optical elements, and user-unfriendly light sources. Entering the 1990s, new instruments and new light-sources greatly fueled the improvement of X-ray microscopy. Microscopy methods including tomography, cryo, and cryo-tomography were successfully demonstrated. With rapid development, X-ray microscopy found new applications in soil science, geochemistry, polymer sciences, and magnetism. The hardware was also miniaturized so that researchers could perform experiments in their own laboratories. Extremely high intensity sources of 9.25 keV X-rays for X-ray phase-contrast microscopy, from a focal spot about 10 um x 10 um, may be obtained with a non-synchrotron X-ray source which uses a focused electron beam and a liquid metal anode. This was demonstratred in 2003, and in 2017 was used to image mouse brain at a voxel size of about one cubic micrometer (see below).Liquid-metal-jet anode electron-impact x-ray source. O. Hemberg, M. Otendal, and H. M. Hertz. Appl. Phys. Lett. 83, 1483 (2003); With the applications continuing to grow, X-ray microscopy has become a routine, proven technique used in environmental and soil sciences, geo- and cosmo-chemistry, polymer sciences, biology, magnetism, material sciences. With this increasing demand for X-ray microscopy in these fields, microscopes based on synchrotron, liquid metal anode, and other laboratory light sources are being built around the world. X-ray optics and components are also being commercialized rapidly. Instrumentation = X-ray optics = = Synchrotron Light Sources =  Advanced Light Source  The Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley, California, is home to XM-1, a full-field soft X-ray microscope operated by the Center for X-ray Optics and dedicated to various applications in modern nanoscience, such as nanomagnetic materials, environmental and materials sciences and biology. XM-1 uses an X-ray lens to focus X-rays on a CCD, in a manner similar to an optical microscope. XM-1 held the world record in spatial resolution with Fresnel zone plates down to 15 nm and is able to combine high spatial resolution with a sub-100ps time resolution to study e.g. ultrafast spin dynamics. In July 2012, a group at DESY claimed a record spatial resolution of 10 nm, by using the hard X-ray scanning microscope at PETRA III.Coherent X-Ray scanning microscopy at PETRA III reached 10 nm resolution (June 2012). Hasylab.desy.de. Retrieved on 2015-12-14. The ALS is also home to the world's first soft x-ray microscope designed for biological and biomedical research. This new instrument, XM-2 was designed and built by scientists from the National Center for X-ray Tomography. XM-2 is capable of producing 3-dimensional tomograms of cells. = Liquid metal anode X-ray source = Extremely high intensity sources of 9.25 keV X-rays (gallium K-alpha line) for X-ray phase-contrast microscopy, from a focal spot about 10 um x 10 um, may be obtained with an X-ray source which uses a liquid metal galinstan anode. This was demonstratred in 2003. The metal flows from a nozzle downward at a high rate of speed and the high intensity electron source is focused upon it. The rapid flow of metal carries current, but the physical flow prevents a great deal of anode heating (due to forced- convective heat removal), and the high boiling point of galinstan inhibits vaporization of the anode. The technique has been used to image mouse brain in three dimensions at a voxel size of about one cubic micrometer. = Detection devices = Scanning Transmission Sources of soft X-rays suitable for microscopy, such as synchrotron radiation sources, have fairly low brightness of the required wavelengths, so an alternative method of image formation is scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy. Here the X-rays are focused to a point and the sample is mechanically scanned through the produced focal spot. At each point the transmitted X-rays are recorded using a detector such as a proportional counter or an avalanche photodiode. This type of Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscope (STXM) was first developed by researchers at Stony Brook University and was employed at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Resolution The resolution of X-ray microscopy lies between that of the optical microscope and the electron microscope. It has an advantage over conventional electron microscopy in that it can view biological samples in their natural state. Electron microscopy is widely used to obtain images with nanometer to sub-Angstrom level resolution but the relatively thick living cell cannot be observed as the sample has to be chemically fixed, dehydrated, embedded in resin, then sliced ultra thin. However, it should be mentioned that cryo-electron microscopy allows the observation of biological specimens in their hydrated natural state, albeit embedded in water ice. Until now, resolutions of 30 nanometer are possible using the Fresnel zone plate lens which forms the image using the soft x-rays emitted from a synchrotron. Recently, the use of soft x-rays emitted from laser-produced plasmas rather than synchrotron radiation is becoming more popular. Analysis Additionally, X-rays cause fluorescence in most materials, and these emissions can be analyzed to determine the chemical elements of an imaged object. Another use is to generate diffraction patterns, a process used in X-ray crystallography. By analyzing the internal reflections of a diffraction pattern (usually with a computer program), the three- dimensional structure of a crystal can be determined down to the placement of individual atoms within its molecules. X-ray microscopes are sometimes used for these analyses because the samples are too small to be analyzed in any other way.  Biological Applications  One early applications of X-ray microscopy in biology was contact imaging, pioneered by Goby in 1913. In this technique, soft x-rays irradiate a specimen and expose the x-ray sensitive emulsions beneath it. Then, magnified tomographic images of the emulsions, which correspond to the x-ray opacity maps of the specimen, are recorded using a light microscope or an electron microscope. A unique advantage that X-ray contact imaging offered over electron microscopy was the ability to image wet biological materials. Thus, it was used to study the micro and nanoscale structures of plants, insects, and human cells. However, several factors, including emulsion distortions, poor illumination conditions, and low resolutions of ways to examine the emulsions, limit the resolution of contacting imaging. Electron damage of the emulsions and diffraction effects can also result in artifacts in the final images. X-ray microscopy has its unique advantages in terms of nanoscale resolution and high penetration ability, both of which are needed in biological studies. With the recent significant progress in instruments and focusing, the three classic forms of optics‚Äîdiffractive, reflective, refractive optics‚Äîhave all successfully expanded into the X-ray range and have been used to investigate the structures and dynamics at cellular and sub-cellular scales. In 2005, Shapiro et al. reported cellular imaging of yeasts at a 30 nm resolution using coherent soft X-ray diffraction microscopy. In 2008, X-ray imaging of an unstained virus was demonstrated. A year later, X-ray diffraction was further applied to visualize the three-dimensional structure of an unstained human chromosome. X-ray microscopy has thus shown its great ability to circumvent the diffractive limit of classic light microscopes; however, further enhancement of the resolution is limited by detector pixels, optical instruments, and source sizes. A longstanding major concern of X-ray microscopy is radiation damage, as high energy X-rays produce strong radicals and trigger harmful reactions in wet specimens. As a result, biological samples are usually fixated or freeze- dried before being irradiated with high-power X-rays. Rapid cryo-treatments are also commonly used in order to preserve intact hydrated structures.A square beryllium foil mounted in a steel case to be used as a window between a vacuum chamber and an X-ray microscope. Beryllium, due to its low Z number is highly transparent to X-rays.

The system is scalable and flexible enough to handle anything from the local news at a small-market station to large organizations spanning remote bureaus in multiple countries. The basic organization of each news broadcast is called a \\"rundown\\" (US) or \\"running order\\" (UK). The run-down is a grid listing scripts, video, audio, character generator data, teleprompter control, director notations, camera operator cues, and timing estimates for each section of the broadcast. ENPS integrates scripts, wire feeds, device control, and production information in a server/client environment. On the server side, ENPS runs an identical backup server (called a \\"buddy\\") at all times as a fail-safe. If the primary server fails, all users are redirected to the buddy server until such time as the primary comes back on-line. All document changes are queued on the buddy and copied back to the primary automatically when it returns to production. Note that this is not a mirror server as the changed data is copied to the buddy, but there is no direct replication inherent within the intercommunications between the servers, so if the data is corrupted due to hardware failure on one server, this corruption will not be replicated to the \\"buddy\\". Device control can be managed either through a serial interface, or the MOS (Media Object Server) protocol. MOS functionality is included in the base ENPS license, but may be an extra add-on for the device that needs to interface with ENPS. MOS items such as video or audio clips can be added directly to scripts, and then used by third party software and devices during the broadcast. Many broadcast media systems support the MOS protocol to a greater or lesser degree by implementing any of the seven MOS Protocol 'profiles'. An example of a MOS System which fully supports all seven MOS Profiles is SIENNA , used by ENPS customers including the BBC. The ENPS client utilizes the .NET framework and other Windows-only technologies. The client, therefore, will only run in the Microsoft Windows operating system. ENPS was originally developed by the Associated Press for use at the BBC in the United Kingdom as a replacement for the text mode system BASYS (which developed into Avid iNEWS), and the Corporation has the largest installation of the system with over 12,000 users in 300 different locations .

Biography Verbeek was of Dutch ancestry. He was born as Gustave Verbeck () in Nagasaki, Japan in 1867, the son of Reformed Church in America missionary Guido Verbeck and Maria Verbeck (nee Manion). He grew up in Japan, but went to Paris to study art, and worked for several European newspapers, creating illustrations and cartoons. In 1900 he moved to the United States, where he did illustrations for magazines such as Harper's, and produced a series of weekly comic strips for newspapers. In the 1910s he abandoned cartooning and became a fine artist. He was noted for his expressionist monotypes, which were the subject of an article in The Century Magazine in June 1916. He was ill for two years, and died on December 5, 1937 at the Home for Incurables, on Third Avenue and 183rd Street in the Bronx, New York City. He had been a patient there for two months. Comics Verbeek's first strip was Easy Papa, a fairly conventional strip about two mischievous kids and their father, similar to the highly popular contemporary strip The Katzenjammer Kids, which ran in a competing newspaper. Easy Papa appeared in The New York Herald from May 25, 1902, through February 1, 1903. Verbeek's strips could be seen differently when viewed upside down (this image will flip upside-down automatically) Verbeek is most noted for The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo, a weekly 6-panel comic strip in which the first half of the story was illustrated and captioned right-side-up, then the reader would turn the page up-side-down, and the inverted illustrations with additional captions describing the scenes told the second half of the story, for a total of 12 panels. His signature usually appeared at the top of the first/last panel, upside down. The two main characters were designed such that each would be perceived as the other character when inverted. For example, in one often- reproduced panel, Muffaroo appears in a canoe next to a tree-covered island, and is being attacked by a large fish. When inverted, the image shows a later scene of Lovekins in the beak of a giant roc: Muffaroo's canoe has become the bird's beak, the fish has turned into the bird's head, the island has become its body and the trees its legs, and Muffaroo has turned into Lovekins. Verbeek created a total of 64 of these strips for The New York Herald, from October 11, 1903, to January 15, 1905. A pilot strip was published on October 4, 1903. The format of the strip put extreme restrictions on the use of word balloons (even with the use of ambigrams only three strips used word-balloons, all in March 1904). Although the July 10, 1904, strip implies that the stories are set in America, Verbeek filled his milieu with African animals and peoples, fabulous monsters, fairy castles, etc. Verbeek's longest-running strip was The Terrors of the Tiny Tads, published by the Herald from May 28, 1905, to October 28, 1914. This strip features a group of four unnamed and interchangeable boys, who encounter a variety of strange creatures based on inventive word combinations. For example, they find a \\"hippopautomobile\\" (a hippopotamus with a steering wheel and seating in its back as in an automobile), a \\"pelicanoe\\" (a pelican in which a rider could sit and paddle like a canoe), and a \\"samovarmint\\" (a samovar for serving tea with the head and claws of a wild animal). As with The Upside Downs, the strip's text consisted of captions below the illustrations; there were no speech balloons. Dan Nadel describes the strip as \\"quiet, subdued, and somnambulant\\" in character, partly because Verbeek eschewed \\"speed lines, stars of pain\\", and other such cartoon conventions. Although most strips involved strange creatures, the tads had a clash with a pair of aggressive suffragettes in the June 28, 1914 strip. He created a short-lived comic strip in 1910 called The Loony Lyrics of Lulu. These strips are about a girl who encounters imaginary creatures and writes (inoffensive) limericks about them. =Reprints= Verbeek's strips got republished multiple times over the years, always only a subselection however until Sunday Press Books released their complete collection. * The Incredible Upside-Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo, G.W.

That was nearly a year before Robert Peary, who similarly claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts have been disputed ever since.Henderson 2009, pp. 58‚Äì69. His expedition discovered Meighen Island, the only discovery of an island in the North American Arctic by an expedition with a United States national on board. In December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the University of Copenhagen ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition that continued his claim. His account of reaching the summit of Denali has also been discredited.  Biography  Cook's birthplace is often listed as Callicoon (CDP), New York, but he was born in Hortonville, New York, also in the Town of Delaware in Sullivan County.Bryce (1997), p. 3. His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting a phonetic version of their surname. He attended local schools before college. He graduated from Columbia University and did medical studies at New York University Medical School, receiving his doctorate in 1890. Cook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters together. After more than two decades of marriage, they divorced in 1923. = Early expeditions = Cook was the surgeon on Robert Peary's Arctic expedition of 1891‚Äì1892, and on the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897‚Äì1899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship‚Äîthe ‚Äîwas ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent scurvy, Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat. In 1897, Cook twice visited Tierra del Fuego, where he met Anglican missionary Thomas Bridges. They studied the Ona and Yahgan peoples, with whom Bridges had worked for two decades. During this time, he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.\\"Cook Tried to Steal Parson's Life Work\\". New York Times, May 21, 1910. Accessed October 3, 2013 = Summit of Denali = Alleged photo of Denali's summit, now known as Fake Peak In 1903, Cook led an expedition to Denali, during which he circumnavigated the range. He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's Denali ascent was also fraudulent. Unlike Hudson Stuck in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier, away.Bryce, R. (1997). \\"An aerial photograph by Bradford Washburn\\". DIO. 7 (2). p. 40. In late 1909, Ed Barrill, Cook's sole companion during the 1906 climb, signed an affidavit saying that they had not reached the summit. In the late 20th century, historians found that he had been paid by Peary supporters to deny Cook's claim. (Henderson writes that this fact was covered up at the time, but Bryce says that it was never a secret.)DIO. 9 (3). p. 129. note 18. Up until a month before, Barrill had consistently asserted that he and Cook had reached the summit. His 1909 affidavit included a map correctly locating what came to be called Fake Peak, featured in Cook's \\"summit\\" photo, and showing that he and Cook had turned back at the Gateway.Bryce, R. (1997). DIO. 7 (2). p. 57. Climber Bradford Washburn gathered data, repeated the climbs, and took new photos to evaluate Cook's 1906 claim. Between 1956 and 1995, Washburn and Brian Okonek identified the locations of most of the photographs Cook took during his 1906 Denali foray and took new photos at the same spots. In 1997 Bryce identified the locations of the remaining photographs, including Cook's \\"summit\\" photograph;Compare rock-by-rock the left side of Cook's 1906 \\"summit\\" photo to the corresponding parts of the 1957 photo by Adams Carter and Bradford Washburn.

Washburn showed that none of Cook's 1906 photos was taken past the \\"Gateway\\" (north end of the Great Gorge), 12 horizontal bee-line miles from Denali and below its top. A 1910 expedition by the Mazama Club reported that Cook's map departed abruptly from the landscape at a point when the summit was still distant. Critics of Cook's claims have compared Cook's map of his alleged 1906 route with the landscape of the last .Bryce, R. (1997). DIO. 7 (3). pp. 96‚Äì97. Cook's descriptions of the summit ridge are variously claimed to bear no resemblance to the mountain and to have been verified by many subsequent climbers.Henderson (2005) p.282 In the 1970s, climber Hans Waale found a route that fit both Cook's narrative and descriptions.Bryce (1997) DIO p.73 Three decades later, in 2005 and 2006, this route was successfully climbed by a group of Russian mountaineers.\\"Following the traces of Dr. Frederick Cook\\", SH Paro No evidence of Cook's purported journey between the \\"Gateway\\" and the summit has been found. His claim to have reached the summit is not supported by his photos' vistas, his two sketch maps' markers, and peak-numberings for points attained.Bryce. (1997). DIO pp. 60‚Äì61. Similarly, neither his recorded compass bearings, barometer readings, route-map, nor camp trash support his claim of reaching the summit. However, samples of all such evidence have been found short of the Gateway.Bryce, R. (1999). DIO. 9 (3). pp. 124‚Äì125. = North Pole = Photo allegedly taken at, or near, the North Pole After the Mount Denali expedition, Cook returned to the Arctic in 1907. He planned to attempt to reach the North Pole, although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left Annoatok, a small settlement in the north of Greenland, in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 21, 1908, after traveling north from Axel Heiberg Island, taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to Jones Sound, spending the open water season and part of the winter on Devon Island. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing Nares Strait to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey. Cook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian Pierre Berton (Berton, 2001), Cook's story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook's companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view. There are similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook's sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in Jules Verne's novel The Adventures of Captain Hatteras. For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of Jones Sound in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization.Osczevski (2003). Cook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer Robert Peary, who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as football coach Fielding H. Yost (as related in Fred Russell's 1943 book, I'll Go Quietly). Cook in arctic gear Cook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with Harry Whitney, an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey south to Upernavik. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the US on Peary's ship Roosevelt in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found. On December 21, 1909, a commission at the University of Copenhagen, after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole. (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the National Geographic Society, which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.) Cook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some.Cook, F. (1911). My Attainment of the Pole. pp. 258, 274. Cook's first account of what he left with Whitney did not mention data, and Whitney knew of no data in what was left with him. See Rawlins, 1973, pp. 87, 166, 301‚Äì302. These have an incorrect solar diameter.Rawlins (1972). Norwegian Journal of Geography. Oslo University. 26. pp. 135‚Äì140. Ahwelah and Etukishook, Cook's Inuit companions, gave seemingly conflicting details about where they had gone with him. The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge.Osczevski, R. J. (2003). Arctic. 56 (4). Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy. The Peary expedition's people (primarily Matthew Henson, who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had traveled only a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook that correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown Meighen Island, which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed.Osczevski, R. J. (2003). \\"Frederick Cook and the Forgotten Pole\\". Arctic. 56 (2). pp. 207‚Äì217.Rawlins, 1973, Chapter 6. Meighen Island, a genuine Cook discovery, is the only island to be discovered by a United States expedition in the North American arctic.Discoveries: \\"Meighen Island\\", DIOI For more detail see Bryce (1997) and Henderson (2005). The conflicting claims of Cook and Peary prompted Roald Amundsen to take extensive precautions in navigation during his South Pole expedition so there could be no doubt concerning attainment of the pole if successful. Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims. At the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: \\"I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision.\\"  Reputation  Cook's reputation never recovered from the attacks on his claim. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has since been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the National Geographic Society, which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. Researching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to assess how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and evaluated them against the period of the Gilded Age. He believes that Cook, as a physician and ethnographer, cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook \\"genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration‚Äîmapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge‚Äîand that of the world‚Äîfor its own sake.\\"Ken Ringle, review: \\"Cook & Peary - The Polar Controversy Resolved\\", Backsights, 1997, published by Surveyors Historical Society, accessed 3 October 2013 But, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain financial support for continued expeditions. = Fraud trial = In 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in Fort Worth. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and went to trial. Also tried was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions. Among other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician Joseph Weldon Bailey, who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud. In November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.Olien, R. (1989). \\"Doctor Frederick A. Cook and the Petroleum Producers' Association\\", Journal of the West. 28 (4). pp. 33‚Äì36.  Later life  Cook was imprisoned until 1930. Roald Amundsen, who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the Belgica, visited him several times. Cook was pardoned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5. He was interred at the Chapel of Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo.

A native of Nottingham, England, Luckett emigrated to Canada in 1979, settling in Saint John, New Brunswick. In the early 1990s, he moved from Saint John to Bedford, Nova Scotia and currently makes his home in Gaspereau, Nova Scotia. Enterprises =Pete's Fine Foods (ex-Pete's Frootique)= Luckett became widely known in the Maritimes for his Pete's Fine Foods (ex-Pete's Frootique) specialty grocery stores. The first Pete's Frootique store opened in 1981 at the Saint John City Market. This is now ran under Pete's nephew and his partner. This was followed by a second store that opened on Mountain Road in Moncton. In 1992, the third Pete's Frootique store opened at the Sunnyside Mall in Bedford. In 2004, the fourth Pete's Frootique store opened on Dresden Row in downtown Halifax, and the fifth Pete's Frootique opened in Wolfville in 2012. On March 27, 2015 Pete's announced that the Wolfville location will close at the end of May 2015. A press release indicated that the Wolfville store was unable to attract enough local customers to become profitable. A similar business has since reopened at the same location. The Pete's Fine Foods stores are all different in scale. The Bedford store is the most expansive and up-scale as it houses the following operating divisions: a power juice bar, a gourmet fruit and gift basket shop, a European delicatessen, a gourmet butcher and fish shop, a British specialty food emporium named Best of Britain, plus a wine shop. Sale to Sobeys In October 2015, Luckett announced that the national grocery chain Sobeys would be entering into an agreement to purchase the Pete‚Äôs Fine Foods grocery retail and wholesale business. =Luckett Vineyards= Luckett vineyard in the Gaspereau River valley In 2010, Luckett opened Luckett Vineyards in Gaspereau Valley, Nova Scotia. He also operates a farm that supplies vegetables and fruit to his stores, as well as commercial customers such as restaurants and caterers. =Media personality= Luckett's TV career started while in Saint John as a frequent guest on the CBC television show Midday. Upon moving to Nova Scotia in the early 1990s, Luckett became a contributing guest to the Halifax CTV affiliate, ATV, where he hosted a bi-weekly segment on fruit and vegetables on the supperhour news show Live at Five. Luckett's catchphrase in his broadcast media appearances is \\"Toodlee-doo.\\" Luckett hosted the Food Network series The Food Hunter where he travels around the world. Luckett has also written a column for the Halifax Chronicle-Herald and serves as a consultant for Chartwells, which delivers all food services at Acadia University, near his home. Luckett has also appeared on such programs as CBC's Steven and Chris. In December 2011, Luckett starred as a cab driver at the end of a TV ad for the NSLC encouraging Nova Scotians not to drink and drive by saying \\"If you've had a few, your car has too\\". The ad shows cars parked outside a party as drunk saying such phrases as \\"I love you man\\" and other drunken ramblings. Impact on retailing in Nova Scotia In 1999, Luckett made headlines when he won a court battle against the Government of Nova Scotia when he sought to keep his Bedford store open on Sunday. To circumvent Nova Scotia's Sunday shopping laws, Luckett registered sections of his Bedford store as separate businesses. He copied this approach at his Halifax store when it opened in 2004. In October 2006 the province's Sunday shopping restrictions were over-turned after both Sobeys and Atlantic Superstore copied Luckett's approach to several of their supermarkets, forcing the government to enact restrictions that were successfully contested in court. In 2014, Pete's Frootique became Pete's Fine Foods.

Electrolytes play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis in the body. They help to regulate heart and neurological function, fluid balance, oxygen delivery, acid‚Äìbase balance and much more. Electrolyte imbalances can develop by consuming too little or too much electrolyte as well as excreting too little or too much electrolyte. Electrolyte disturbances are involved in many disease processes, and are an important part of patient management in medicine. The causes, severity, treatment, and outcomes of these disturbances can vastly differ depending on the implicated electrolyte. The most serious electrolyte disturbances involve abnormalities in the levels of sodium, potassium or calcium. Other electrolyte imbalances are less common and often occur in conjunction with major electrolyte changes. The kidney is the most important organ in maintaining appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance, but other factors such as hormonal changes and physiological stress play a role. Chronic laxative abuse or severe diarrhea or vomiting can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. People suffering from malnutrition are at especially high risk for an electrolyte imbalance. Severe electrolyte imbalances must be treated carefully as there are risks with overcorrecting too quickly, which can result in arrhythmias, brain herniation, or refeeding syndrome depending on the cause of imbalance. General function Electrolytes are important because they are what cells (especially nerve, heart and muscle cells) use to maintain voltages across their cell membranes. Electrolytes have different functions, and an important one is to carry electrical impulses between cells. Kidneys work to keep the electrolyte concentrations in blood constant despite changes in the body. For example, during heavy exercise, electrolytes are lost in sweat, particularly in the form of sodium and potassium. The kidneys can also generate dilute urine to balance sodium levels. These electrolytes must be replaced to keep the electrolyte concentrations of the body fluids constant. Hyponatremia, or low sodium, is the most commonly seen type of electrolyte imbalance. Treatment of electrolyte imbalance depends on the specific electrolyte involved and whether the levels are too high or too low. The level of aggressiveness of treatment and choice of treatment may change depending on the severity of the disturbance. If the levels of an electrolyte are too low, a common response to electrolyte imbalance may be to prescribe supplementation. However, if the electrolyte involved is sodium, the issue is not a deficiency of sodium, but rather a water excess, causing the imbalance. Supplementation for these people may correct the electrolyte imbalance but at the expense of volume overload, which can be dangerous particularly for neonates. Because each individual electrolyte affects physiological function differently, they must be considered separately when discussing causes, treatment, and complications.  Sodium  Sodium is the most abundant electrolyte in the blood. Sodium and its homeostasis in the human body is highly dependent on fluids. The human body is approximately 60% water, a percentage which is also known as total body water. The total body water can be divided into two compartments called extracellular fluid (ECF) and intracellular fluid (ICF). The majority of the sodium in the body stays in the extracellular fluid compartment. This compartment consists of the fluid surrounding the cells and the fluid inside the blood vessels. ECF has a sodium concentration of approximately 140 mEq/L. Because cells membranes are permeable to water and not sodium, the movement of water across membranes affects the concentration of sodium in the blood. Sodium acts as a force that pulls water across membranes, and water moves from places with lower sodium concentration to places with higher sodium concentration. This happens through a process called osmosis. When evaluating sodium imbalances, both total body water and total body sodium must be considered. = Hypernatremia = Hypernatremia means that the concentration of sodium in the blood is too high. An individual is considered to be having high sodium at levels above 145 mEq/L of sodium. Hypernatremia is not common in individuals with no other health concerns. Most individuals with this disorder have either experienced loss of water from diarrhea, altered sense of thirst, inability to consume water, inability of kidneys to make concentrated urine, or increased salt intake.  Causes  There are three types of hypernatremia each with different causes. The first is dehydration along with low total body sodium. This is most commonly caused by heatstroke, burns, extreme sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea. The second is low total body water with normal body sodium. This can be caused by diabetes insipidus, renal disease, hypothalamic dysfunction, sickle cell disease, and certain drugs. The third is increased total body sodium which is caused by increased ingestion, Conn's syndrome, or Cushing's syndrome.  Symptoms  Symptoms of hypernatremia may vary depending on type and how quickly the electrolyte disturbance developed. Common symptoms are dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, increased thirst, excess urination. Patients may be on medications that caused the imbalance such as diuretics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Some patients may have no obvious symptoms at all.  Treatment  It is crucial to first assess the stability of the patient. If there are any signs of shock such as tachycardia or hypotension, these must be treated immediately with IV saline infusion. Once the patient is stable, it is important to identify the underlying cause of hypernatremia as that may affect the treatment plan. The final step in treatment is to calculate the patients free water deficit, and to replace it at a steady rate using a combination of oral or IV fluids. The rate of replacement of fluids varies depending on how long the patient has been hypernatremic. Lowering the sodium level too quickly can cause cerebral edema. = Hyponatremia = Hyponatremia means that the concentration of sodium in the blood is too low. It is generally defined as a concentration lower than 135 mEq/L. This relatively common electrolyte disorder can indicate the presence of a disease process, but in the hospital setting is more often due to administration of Hypotonic fluids. The majority of hospitalized patients only experience mild hyponatremia, with levels above 130 mEq/L. Only 1-4% of patients experience levels lower than 130 mEq/L.  Causes  Hyponatremia has many causes including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, treatment with thiazide diuretics, psychogenic polydipsia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. It can also be found in the postoperative state, and in the setting of accidental water intoxication as can be seen with intense exercise. Common causes in pediatric patients may be diarrheal illness, frequent feedings with dilute formula, water intoxication via excessive consumption, and enemas. pseudohyponatremia is a false low sodium reading that can be caused by high levels of fats or proteins in the blood. Dilutional hyponatremia can happen in diabetics as high glucose levels pull water into the blood stream causing the sodium concentration to be lower. Diagnosis of the cause of hyponatremia relies on three factors: volume status, plasma osmolality, urine sodium levels and urine osmolality.  Symptoms  Many individuals with mild hyponatremia will not experience symptoms. Severity of symptoms is directly correlated with severity of hyponatremia and rapidness of onset. General symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, confusion, agitation, and weakness. More concerning symptoms involve the central nervous system and include seizures, coma, and death due to brain herniation. These usually do not occur until sodium levels fall below 120 mEq/L.  Treatment  Considerations for treatment include symptom severity, time to onset, volume status, underlying cause, and sodium levels. If the sodium level is <120 mEq/L, the person can be treated with hypertonic saline as extremely low levels are associated with severe neurological symptoms. In non-emergent situations, it is important to correct the sodium slowly to minimize risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. If a person has low total body water and low sodium they are typically given fluids. If a person has high total body water (such as due to heart failure or kidney disease) they may be placed on fluid restriction, salt restriction, and treated with a diuretic. If a person has a normal volume of total body water, they may be placed on fluid restriction alone.  Potassium  Potassium resides mainly inside the cells of the body, so its concentration in the blood can range anywhere from 3.5 mEq/L to 5 mEq/L. The kidneys are responsible for excreting the majority of potassium from the body. This means their function is crucial for maintaining a proper balance of potassium in the blood stream. = Hyperkalemia = Hyperkalemia means the concentration of potassium in the blood is too high. This occurs when the concentration of potassium is >5 mEq/L. It can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and even death. As such it is considered to be the most dangerous electrolyte disturbance.  Causes  Hyperkalemia is typically caused by decreased excretion by the kidneys, shift of potassium to the extracellular space, or increased consumption of potassium rich foods in patients with kidney failure. The most common cause of hyperkalemia is lab error due to potassium released as blood cells from the sample break down. Other common causes are kidney disease, cell death, acidosis, and drugs that affect kidney function.  Symptoms  Part of the danger of hyperkalemia is that it is often asymptomatic, and only detected during normal lab work done by primary care physicians. As potassium levels get higher, individuals may begin to experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Patients with severe hyperkalemia, defined by levels above 7 mEq/L, may experience muscle cramps, numbness, tingling, absence of reflexes, and paralysis. Patients may experience arrhythmias that can result in death.  Treatment  There are three mainstays of treatment of hyperkalemia. These are stabilization of cardiac cells, shift of potassium into the cells, and removal of potassium from the body. Stabilization of cardiac muscle cells is done by administering calcium intravenously. Shift of potassium into the cells is done using both insulin and albuterol inhalers. Excretion of potassium from the body is done using either hemodialysis, loop diuretics, or a resin that causes potassium to be excreted in the fecal matter. = Hypokalemia = The most common electrolyte disturbance, hypokalemia means that the concentration of potassium is <3.5 mEq/L. It often occurs concurrently with low magnesium levels.  Causes  Low potassium is caused by increased excretion of potassium, decreased consumption of potassium rich foods, movement of potassium into the cells, or certain endocrine diseases. Excretion is the most common cause of hypokalemia and can be caused by diuretic use, metabolic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperaldosteronism, and renal tubular acidosis. Potassium can also be lost through vomiting and diarrhea.  Symptoms  Hypokalemia is often asymptomatic, and symptoms may not appear until potassium concentration is <2.5 mEq/L. Typical symptoms consist of muscle weakness and cramping. Low potassium can also cause cardiac arrythmias.  Treatment  Hypokalemia is treated by replacing the body's potassium. This can occur either orally or intravenously. Because low potassium is usually accompanied by low magnesium, patients are often given magnesium alongside potassium.  Calcium  Though calcium is the most plentiful electrolyte in the body, a large percentage of it is used to form the bones. It is mainly absorbed and excreted through the GI system. The majority of calcium resides extracellularly, and it is crucial for the function of neurons, muscle cells, function of enzymes, and coagulation. The normal range for calcium concentration in the body is 8.5 - 10.5 mg/dL. The parathyroid gland is responsible for sensing changes in calcium concentration and regulating the electrolyte with parathyroid hormone. = Hypercalcemia = Hypercalcemia describes when the concentration of calcium in the blood is too high. This occurs above 10.5 mg/dL.  Causes  The most common causes of hypercalcemia are certain types of cancer, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, excessive ingestion of vitamin D, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis. Hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the predominate causes. It can also be caused by muscle cell breakdown, prolonged immobilization, dehydration.  Symptoms  The predominant symptoms of hypercalcemia are abdominal pain, constipation, kidney stones, extreme thirst, excessive urination, nausea and vomiting. In severe cases where the calcium concentration is >14 mg/dL, individuals may experience confusion, altered mental status, coma, and seizure.  Treatment  Primary treatment of hypercalcemia consists of administering IV fluids. If the hypercalcemia is severe and/or associated with cancer, it may be treated with bisphosphonates. For very severe cases, hemodialysis may be considered for rapid removal of calcium from the blood. = Hypocalcemia = Hypocalcemia describes when calcium levels are too low in the blood, usually less than 8.5 mg/dL.  Causes  Hypoparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency are common causes of hypocalcemia. It can also be caused by malnutrition, blood transfusion, ethylene glycol intoxication, and pancreatitis.  Symptoms  Neurological and cardiovascular symptoms are the most common manifestations of hypocalcemia. Patients may experience muscle cramping or twitching, and numbness around the mouth and fingers. They may also have shortness of breath, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmias.  Treatment  Patients with hypocalcemia may be treated with either oral or IV calcium. Typically, IV calcium is reserved for patients with severe hypocalcemia. It is also important to check magnesium levels in patients with hypocalcemia and to replace magnesium if it is low.  Magnesium  Magnesium is mostly found in the bones and within cells. Approximately 1% of total magnesium in the body is found in the blood. Magnesium is important in control of metabolism and is involved in numerous enzyme reactions. A normal range is 0.70 - 1.10 mmol/L. The kidney is responsible for maintaining the magnesium levels in this narrow range. = Hypermagnesemia = Hypermagnesemia, or abnormally high levels of magnesium in the blood, is relatively rare in individuals with normal kidney function. This is defined by a magnesium concentration >2.5 mg/dL.  Causes  Hypermagnesemia typically occurs in individuals with abnormal kidney function. This imbalance can also occur with use of antacids or laxatives that contain magnesium. Most cases of hypermagnesemia can be prevented by avoiding magnesium-containing medications.  Symptoms  Mild symptoms include nausea, flushing, tiredness. Neurologic symptoms are seen most commonly including decreased deep tendon reflexes. Severe symptoms include paralysis, respiratory failure, and bradycardia progressing to cardiac arrest.  Treatment  If kidney function is normal, stopping the source of magnesium intake is sufficient. Diuretics can help increase magnesium excretion in the urine. Severe symptoms may be treated with dialysis to directly remove magnesium from the blood. = Hypomagnesemia = Hypomagnesemia, or low magnesium levels in the blood, can occur in up to 12% of hospitalized patients. Symptoms or effects of hypomagnesemia can occur after relatively small deficits.  Causes  Major causes of hypomagnesemia are from gastrointestinal losses such as vomiting and diarrhea. Another major cause is from kidney losses from diuretics, alcohol use, hypercalcemia, and genetic disorders. Low dietary intake can also contribute to magnesium deficiency.  Symptoms  Hypomagnesemia is typically associated with other electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. For this reason, there may be overlap in symptoms seen in these other electrolyte deficiencies. Severe symptoms include arrhythmias, seizures, or tetany.  Treatment  The first step in treatment is determining whether the deficiency is caused by a gastrointestinal or kidney problem. People with no or minimal symptoms are given oral magnesium; however, many people experience diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. Those who cannot tolerate or receive magnesium, or those with severe symptoms can receive intravenous magnesium. Hypomagnesemia may prevent the normalization of other electrolyte deficiencies. If other electrolyte deficiencies are associated, normalizing magnesium levels may be necessary to treat the other deficiencies.  Chloride  Chloride, after sodium, is the second most abundant electrolyte in the blood, and most abundant in the extracellular fluid. Most of the chloride in the body is from salt (NaCl) in the diet. Chloride is part of gastric acid (HCl), which plays a role in absorption of electrolytes, activating enzymes, and killing bacteria. The levels of chloride in the blood can help determine if there are underlying metabolic disorders. Generally, chloride has an inverse relationship with bicarbonate, an electrolyte that indicates acid-base status. Overall, treatment of chloride imbalances involve addressing the underlying cause rather than supplementing or avoiding chloride. = Hyperchloremia =  Causes  Hyperchloremia, or high chloride levels, is usually associated with excess chloride intake (e.g., saltwater drowning), fluid loss (e.g., diarrhea, sweating), and metabolic acidosis.  Symptoms  Patients are usually asymptomatic with mild hyperchloremia. Symptoms associated with hyperchloremia are usually caused by the underlying cause of this electrolyte imbalance.  Treatment  Treat the underlying cause, which commonly includes increasing fluid intake. = Hypochloremia =  Causes  Hypochloremia, or low chloride levels, are commonly associated with gastrointestinal (e.g., vomiting) and kidney (e.g., diuretics) losses. Greater water or sodium intake relative to chloride also can contribute to hypochloremia.  Symptoms  Patients are usually asymptomatic with mild hypochloremia. Symptoms associated with hypochloremia are usually caused by the underlying cause of this electrolyte imbalance.  Treatment  Treat the underlying cause, which commonly includes increasing fluid intake.  Dietary sources  Diet significantly contributes to our electrolyte stores and blood levels. Below are a list of foods that are associated with higher levels of these electrolytes. = Sodium = It is recommended that an individual consumes less than 2,300 mg of sodium daily as part of a healthy diet. A significant portion of our sodium intake comes from a just a few types of food, which can be surprising as large sources of sodium may not taste salty. * Breads, rolls * Soups * Cured meats and cold cuts * Cheese * Savory snacks (e.g., chips, crackers, pretzels) = Potassium = Good sources of potassium are found in a variety of fruits and vegetables. Recommend potassium intake for adults ranges from 2,300 mg to 3,400 mg depending on age and gender. * Beans and lentils * Dark leafy greens (e.g., spinach, kale) * Apples * Apricots * Potatoes * Squash * Bananas * Dates = Calcium = Dairy is a major contributor of calcium to diet in the United States. The recommended calcium intake for adults range from 1,000 mg to 1,300 mg depending on age and gender. * Yogurt * Cheese * Milk * Tofu * Canned sardines = Magnesium = Magnesium is found in a variety of vegetables, meats, and grains. Foods high in fiber generally are a source of magnesium. The recommended magnesium intake for adults range from 360 mg to 420 mg depending on age and gender. * Epsom salt * Nuts and seeds (e.g., pumpkin seeds, almonds, peanuts) * Dark leafy greens (e.g., spinach) * Beans *Fortified cereals See also * Acidosis * Alkalosis * Dehydration * Malnutrition * Starvation *Sports drink References  External links  * Category:Causes of death ","title":"Electrolyte imbalance"},{"id":"904831","text":"The Speakeasy Club, also known as The Speak, was a club situated at 48 Margaret Street, London, England and served as a late-night meeting place for the music industry from 1966 to June 1978.

He was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he also studied, receiving his BA at the University of Chicago in 1942, and his BFA and MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1949 and 1950, respectively. He was married to and collaborated with the artist Nancy Spero (August 24,1926 ‚Äì October 18, 2009). Their son Stephen Golub was an economics professor at Swarthmore College. Their son Philip Golub is Professor of International and Comparative Politics at the American University of Paris and was a longstanding contributing editor of the influential journal Le Monde diplomatique. Their youngest son Paul Golub is a theater director and acting teacher working in France.  Early life  Born in Chicago in 1922, Golub received his B.A. in Art History from the University of Chicago in 1942. From 1947 to 1949 he studied under the G.I. Bill at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The student body included a large number of vets, including Golub‚Äôs one-time flatmate Cosmo Campoli, George Cohen, Theodore Halkin and Seymour Rosofsky, whose work often reflected the horrors of war, as well as the uncertainties of the Cold War and Nuclear age.Corbett, John. \\"Bleak House: Chicago's Monster Artists,\\" in Monster Roster: Existentialist Art in Postwar Chicago, John Corbett, Jim Dempsey, Jessica Moss, and Richard A. Born, University of Chicago Press: Smart Museum of Art, 2016. It was at SAIC that he met the artist Nancy Spero, to whom he was married for nearly fifty years. Golub helped organize and showed in the seminal Momentum Exhibitions of 1948‚Äì1949, put together by SAIC and Institute of Design students in protest over their exclusion from the Art Institute‚Äôs prestigious \\"Annual Exhibition by Artists of Chicago and Vicinity.\\" He was also featured, along with Campoli, Halkin and Rosofsky, in the Art Institute‚Äôs \\"Veteran's Exhibition\\" of 1948.Corbett, John and Jim Dempsey, Jessica Moss, and Richard A. Born. Monster Roster: Existentialist Art in Postwar Chicago, University of Chicago Press: Smart Museum of Art, 2016. The group included, in addition to Golub‚Äôs aforementioned classmates, June Leaf, H.C. Westermann, Irving Petlin, Evelyn Statsinger, Don Baum, and Arthur Lerner. In Chicago, Golub became involved with other artists collectively dubbed the \\"Monster Roster\\" by critic Franz Schulze in the late 1950s, based on their affinity for sometimes gruesome, expressive figuration, fantasy and mythology, and existential thought.Schulze, Franz. \\"Art in Chicago: The Two Traditions,\\" in Art in Chicago 1945-1995, Museum of Contemporary Art, ed. Lynne Warren. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1996, p.16-20. Retrieved March 30, 2018. They believed that an observable connection to the external world and to actual events was essential if art was to have any relevance to the viewer or society. This is a view that informed Golub's work throughout his career. Golub, and the group, gained notice in the 1950s when art historian and curator Peter Selz featured him, Campoli and Cohen in a 1955 ARTnews article, \\"Is There a New Chicago School?\\", and included him, Campoli and Westermann in the 1959 Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition, New Images of Man, as examples of vanguard expressive figurative work in Europe and the United States.Adrian, Dennis. \\"Introduction,\\" in Monster Roster: Existentialist Art in Postwar Chicago, John Corbett, Jim Dempsey, Jessica Moss, and Richard A.

In later years, the Monster Roster would be regarded as forerunners to the more widely known Chicago Imagists. 'Interrogation III', acrylic on linen painting by Leon Golub, 1981  Career  Golub, who always painted in a figural style, drew upon diverse representations of the body from ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, to photographs of athletic competitions, to gay pornography; often pulled directly from a huge database he assembled of journalistic images from the mass media. He likened his painting process to sculptural technique and employed a method of layering and scraping away paint, sometimes using a meat cleaver, leaving varying amounts of canvas untouched. From 1959 through 1964, Golub and his wife Nancy Spero opted to live in Europe, a move occasioned in part by the belief that Europe would be more receptive to their work dealing overtly with issues of power, sexual and political. During this period Golub's work increased in size because of larger available studio space and the inspiration of the French tradition of large-scale history painting. He also switched from using lacquer to acrylics, left more of the surface unpainted, and began to grind the paint directly into the canvas. While in Italy, both Golub and Spero were profoundly influenced by the figurative works of Etruscan and Roman art, whose narratives addressed ancient themes of power and violence. When Golub returned to New York State, the Vietnam War was escalating, and he responded with his two series: Napalm and Vietnam. He and Spero became active with Artists and Writers Protest, \\"the first such group to take a public stand against the war\\".Kurtz, Lester R, Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict Second Edition, Academic Press, 2008. In 1967 as part of the group's Angry Arts Week, Golub organized The Collage of Indignation, a collaborative work by over 150 artists which he described as \\"not political art, but rather an expression of popular revulsion.\\"Event, quote and source found in The Turning Point Art And Politics In 1968 by Nina Castelli Sundell, Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, Cleveland, 1988. See: Golub had a career breakthrough that same year when he was selected to exhibit five paintings at the Museum of Modern Art's \\"New Images of Man\\" show in New York City. His work was included alongside that of such established and rising artists as Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon and Jackson Pollock. In the mid-1970s, Golub was beset with self-doubt. He destroyed or cut up many works he produced up to this period and nearly abandoned painting. In the late seventies, however, he produced more than a hundred portraits of public figures, among them political leaders, dictators, and religious figures. Leon Golub: Paintings, 1950-2000 includes several portraits of Nelson Rockefeller and Ho Chi Minh, along with images of Fidel Castro, Francisco Franco, Richard Nixon, and Henry Kissinger. In the 1980s, Golub turned his attention to terrorism in a variety of forms, from the subversive operations of governments to urban street violence. Killing fields, torture chambers, bars, and brothels became inspiration and subject for work that dealt with such themes as violent aggression, racial inequality, gender ambiguity, oppression, and exclusion. Among the work produced in this period are the series Mercenaries, Interrogation, Riot, and Horsing Around. His Interrogation II (1981; Art Institute of ChicagoInterrogation II at the Art Institute of Chicago) is representative of the subject from this period and Golub's technique, \\"the canvas painted, scraped and repainted many times to create a tense, skinlike surface.\\"Lawrence Gowing, ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.2 (Facts on File, 2005): 269. From the nineties to his death, Golub's work shifted toward the illusionistic, with forms semi-visible, and appropriated graphic styles from ancient carvings, medieval manuscripts, and contemporary graffiti. As an older man he began to consider his own mortality, and moved toward themes of separation, loss, and death. Text appeared in many of the paintings combined with a series of symbolic references, including dogs, lions, skulls, and skeletons. Golub's work was seen in solo exhibitions throughout the world, among them World Wide (1991), a Grand Lobby project at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. For World Wide the artist created a process, repeated in exhibitions at several other museums, by which he enlarged images and details from his paintings and screened them on transparent sheets of vinyl, hung so that they surround the viewer. He was represented in many group exhibitions and was one of the few white artists included in Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1994. In 1996, Golub was given a commission to design a set of stained glass windows for Temple Sholom in Chicago, the four windows depict the life of Joseph. These would be the only stained glass windows Leon Golub ever did. They were fabricated in New York by Victor Rothman and Gene Mallard.  2001: renaissance  While Leon Golub's later works from the 1990s offer more fragmented (in his words \\"left-over\\") reincarnations of his early messages, it is his larger, carved works, vividly depicting power relations that have re-gained attention with the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2003, Golub revisited his 1959 painting, Reclining Youth, part of a series of paintings inspired by friezes at the Great Altar of Zeus in Pergamon. Working with Magnolia Editions, the artist translated the painting into a large-scale [] Jacquard tapestry, his first and only textile work.Magnolia Editions - Leon Golub. Retrieved Nov. 6, 2009.

Initially a party with members holding moderate and conservative views, by the time of its banning, on 18 February 1931, it had become a solidly leftist, workers-oriented party. In a political atmosphere increasingly dominated by the rise of Japanese fascism, the party never participated in electoral politics. The party grew out of the conflict within the Taiwanese Cultural Association. By the late 1920s that organization had become largely socialist- dominated. A group of its founders met during the first half of 1927 to plan an alternative, more moderate organization. After several of their proposals had been rejected by the Japanese authorities, they finally settled on \\"Taiwanese People's Party\\" and a much diluted, vaguely worded party program. Specifically the new party officially disavowed any ambition to promote \\"national struggle\\" and declared its intention to use legal means to \\"affirm democratic politics\\", establish \\"reasonable economic organization\\" and reform \\"defects in the social institutions\\". In terms of policy it advocated the rights of Taiwanese to publish newspapers, the need to teach Taiwanese in public schools, abolition of a system of informers known as \\"Baojia Zhidu\\", removal of the need for passports when travelling to mainland China, and reform of the farmers' associations and government monopolies. The party grew quickly; by the end of 1927 it had 15 branches and 456 members, among them many prominent elites, including landowners, lawyers and doctors. However, the vague party charter soon presented problems: on the one hand the charter had apparently managed to placate the wary authorities; on the other, the vague wording had the effect of hiding away some of the divisive ideological differences among the most powerful players. During the party's short existence its internal politics was dominated by the struggle between the left-wing, led by Chiang Wei-shui, and the right-wing, represented by , to define the party's core values, particularly its position on \\"the class question\\". Whereas Chiang's faction sought to define the party as representing the interests of workers and peasants, Peng's faction took the moderate position of \\"working to improve their quality of life\\". After Chiang set up the as a party affiliate in February 1928, Peng resigned in protest. In August 1930 a number of conservatives left the party to form the , led by Lin Hsien- tang and . By the third party congress later that year, Chiang had won control of the executive committee. His proposal for a revision of the party charter was passed the following year. It admonished \\"bourgeoise\\" and \\"reactionary\\" members for not heeding the international climate, which had \\"strengthened the consciousness of struggle within the island's masses\\". The revised charter characterized the party as one to work toward the political freedom and interests of workers, peasants, the urban proletariat, and all similarly oppressed. Chiang believed that the time was ripe for a strategy that combined class and national (anti-colonial) movements. For the most part the party was not effective in achieving its goals. On 7 July 1927 it put forward a \\"Statement of Recommendations\\", given to Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi, that demanded local autonomy for the island and urged freedom of speech. The following year it demanded that the colonial governor institute popular, proportionally representative ballot for some councils. Its singular triumph was in forcing the authorities to set aside budget for establishing treatment centers for opium addicts. The party successfully created international pressure by filing complaints to the League of Nations (of which Japan remained a member until the early 1930s), which then sent a representative to investigate. As civilian rule gave way to a new, harsher phase of all- consuming militarism in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Japanese colonies, the fate of the party was sealed. Ironically the result was essentially as Peng Hua-ying had predicted in his objection to Chiang's more radical vision: No sooner had the fourth party congress passed the revised charter, the authorities proceeded to ban the organization. Chiang Wei-shui and other party leaders were arrested. In its statement the authorities accused \\"leftist, nationalist members\\" of controlling the party and secretly working on independence for the colony, as well as alerting the international community of Japan's use of chemical warfare in suppressing the Wushe Rebellion of 1930. Chiang himself came to be disillusioned with legitimate political means of reform. After his death in August 1931 from typhoid, the party fell into disarray and later disbanded.

Their role is to make the final decision in questions referred to them by the two on-field umpires or the players. The third umpire is also there to act as an emergency on-field umpire if required. History The third umpire was conceptualized by former Sri Lankan domestic cricketer, and current cricket writer Mahinda Wijesinghe. It debuted in Test cricket in November 1992 at Kingsmead, Durban for the South Africa vs. India series. Karl Liebenberg was the third umpire with Cyril Mitchley the on-field umpire, referring the run-out decision in this match. Sachin Tendulkar became the first batsman to be dismissed (run out) by using television replays in the second day of the Test scoring 11. Appointment The third umpire is appointed from the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires or the International Panel of ICC Umpires for Test matches, ODIs, and T20Is. For all Test matches, and for ODIs where DRS is used, the third umpire is appointed by the ICC, and is a different nationality to the two sides. For ODIs where DRS is not used, and for all T20Is, the third umpire is appointed by the home side's Governing body. Functions =Decision requests= An on-field umpire can, at his own discretion, use a radio link to refer particular types of close decision to the third umpire, this is called an Umpire Review. When the full Umpire Decision Review System is not in use, the third umpire uses television replays (only) to assist him in coming to a decision. When the full DRS is in use, players can also initiate reviews of particular decisions by the on-field umpires, this is called a Player Review. These are judged by the third umpire, and the third umpire has the full range of technology available beyond simple replays, for both Umpire Reviews and Player Reviews. =Emergency on-field umpire= In the case of injury or illness to one of the on-field umpires, the third umpire will take his place. The third umpire duties will then be taken on by the Fourth umpire. For example, during the 4th ODI between Australia and India at Canberra in 2015‚Äì16, umpire Richard Kettleborough was injured during Australia's innings and was replaced by third umpire Paul Wilson.

Retrieved: May 1, 2015. The film was distributed by United Artists. Plot After seeing his wife (Janet Warren) off on her trip, Kerry West (Hans Conried), a philosophy teacher at a small-town college goes inside his home to contemplate his new purchase: a television set. Sitting down in his office, he places a cigarette in his mouth and is about to light it when a solid beam of light shoots from the television screen, lighting it for him. Absentmindedly unaware of what has taken place, it is only when the television subsequently lights his pipe that West realizes that his television is behaving abnormally. West soon discovers that the television can walk and perform a variety of functions, including dishwashing, vacuuming, and card-playing. When the television deliveryman (Edwin Max) returns to settle the bill, the television materializes copies of a five-dollar bill in order to provide payment. Yet the television soon exhibits other, more controlling traits, permitting West only a single cup of coffee and breaking West‚Äôs classical music records in favor of military marches to which it dances. After West demonstrates the television to his friend Coach Trout (Billy Lynn), the coach declares the television set to be a ‚Äútwonky‚Äù, the word he used as a child to label the inexplicable. Trout concludes that the Twonky is actually a robot committed to serving West. When he tests this hypothesis by attempting to kick West, the Twonky paralyzes his leg. After tending to the coach, West attempts to write a lecture on the role of individualism in art, but the Twonky hits him with beams that alter his thoughts and censors his reading. When West attempts to give his lecture the next day, he finds himself unable to do more than ramble on about trivialities. Frustrated, West goes to the store from which his wife had ordered the television and demands that they take it back or exchange it. Meanwhile, at West‚Äôs house, the coach summons members of the college's football team and orders them to destroy the Twonky. West arrives with the television deliveryman and his replacement set, only to find the players passed out in front of the machine. Upon being awakened by West, they appear to be in a hypnotic state mumbling that they have ‚Äúno complaints,‚Äù a condition the Twonky soon inflicts on the deliveryman as well. Upstairs, Trout theorizes that the Twonky is from a future ‚Äúsuper state‚Äù that uses such machines to control the population, which the Twonky soon demonstrates by walking into the room and altering his mind so that he no longer believes there to be a problem. As the now-fixed Trout attempts to leave, police storm into the house in response to a call made by the device seeking female companionship for West, followed by Treasury men tracking down the bogus $5 bills manufactured by the set. When the law enforcement officers attempt to arrest West, though, the Twonky places all of them in a trance, and they leave without complaint. Frustrated, West escapes the house and returns drunk, only to have the Twonky return him to sobriety with a light beam. After his wife returns to see a visiting bill collector driven from their home by the machine, West decides to take action. Luring the device into his car, he attempts to crash it by a variety of means but is frustrated by the Twonky‚Äôs ability to control the vehicle. Spotting a vehicle parked alongside the road, West pulls over and abandons his car, hitching a ride from the other driver, an elderly Englishwoman. His relief at having escaped is soon negated by the woman‚Äôs erratic driving, and by the discovery that the Twonky was able to hide in the trunk. When the Twonky attempts to stop the woman‚Äôs reckless driving, it precipitates a crash that destroys itself.

The band currently consists of Jascha Richter, Mikkel Lentz and K√•re Wanscher. S√∏ren Madsen was an original member of the group since its formation but left in 2000. The band has sold over 11 million records over the course of their career, with the majority sold in Europe and Asia. Despite being Danish, the band performs songs in English. The band has attributed its success in Asia to their drugs-free, clean-living image and to singing in English as a second language. MLTR has earned Gold and Platinum status for records in many countries and won many awards, including the Gold Preis Award from RSH, Germany and \\"The Best Performing Act of the Year\\" at the SEA Grammy Awards in Singapore. In addition, their song \\"Take Me to Your Heart\\" was awarded \\"most downloaded single of the year 2006\\" with 6 million or more paid downloads. The band has recorded nine studio albums as well as a number of live and greatest hits albums. Their latest studio album, Still, was released on 21 March 2018. During the peak of their popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, MLTR was described by critics as being \\"as good (if not better) a band as any current big name group out of America or the UK or the Australia.\\" Jowu Entertainment & Media Ltd Retrieved 14 March 2010 According to the band's record label releases, their sound is \\"the perfect balance of a Scandinavian glow and the international pop song that has been instrumental in forming the compelling sound of the band\\", although the lead singer and songwriter, Jascha Richter, disagrees with this, maintaining that the music defies geographical categorization.  History  =The beginnings ‚Äî Michael Learns to Rock (1988‚Äì1992)= In 1988, singer Jascha Richter with the intent of forming a band to perform his songs, asked his high school friend and drummer K√•re Wanscher in Aarhus, Denmark to perform with him. Realizing the limitations of playing as a duo, they recruited the guitarist Mikkel Lentz, who was then playing rock music with his group the Rocking Studs. On 15 March 1988, their first night of practice made them realize they needed a fourth musician, so they asked S√∏ren Madsen, another guitarist who was into Led Zeppelin, to join in on bass guitar. Although Madsen was not an obvious choice for a pop band, he was invited on the basis that he had been part of the band Hip Hop that had reached the finals of a Danish competition to nominate a song to the Eurovision Song Contest. Since Richter already had a number of original songs, eliminating the need to jam, they were able to quickly record a demo tape intending it to be sent to the 'Rock Grand Prix' competition in their hometown Aarhus, they had to hurriedly come up with a name before posting it; Richter wrote as the name of the sender 'Michael Learns to Rock', partly inspired by a line from his school English textbook and partly because they were a pop band taking part in a rock concert. Lentz and Richter have admitted that the band was named after Michael Jackson: \\"I think Richter was thinking of Michael Jackson, because he was called 'the king of pop' and it was kind of funny, because it was like, what would he sound like if he learned to rock? It was wordplay,\\" Lentz has stated. Richter claimed in an interview : \\"Yeah, it was like Johnny Hates Jazz and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Sure, I've regretted calling ourselves this many times since, but we were successful so quickly, we had to stick with it and over time I got used to it.\\" On 22 May 1988, the quartet played their first public show in Aarhus in 'Rock Grand Prix' at Aarhus's biggest venue, Ridehuset. As one of the two winning teams, MLTR performed that summer at the Aarhus Outdoor Festival on 20 June, however, only 20 people turned up. The disappointment was offset by a daily newspaper, Information, describing the unknown group as \\"an immensely positive surprise\\". On 30 July 1988, the group entered and won the city's famed annual talent shows 'We Have The Stage ‚Äì Do You Have The Music?' at Aarhus Musikhus. Jens Peter (J.P.) Andersen, a member of the contest jury as well as a promoter of Danmarks Smukkeste Festival (literally, \\"Denmark‚Äôs Most Beautiful Festival\\") at Skanderborg, was impressed with the band's talent but was somewhat annoyed at their lack of professionalism, so he decided to become the band's manager, at the band's request. Michael Learns to Rock continued playing live throughout Jutland and recording material in order to attract the attention of Danish record labels. One of these efforts included the band contributing four tracks for the double album Secrets, a record organised by the Danish Rock Council to create interest in four talented but 'secret' new bands. They finally signed a record deal with the Danish label Medley in January 1989. Thai Ticket major Retrieved 30 September 2010 However, the band did not release their first album, Michael Learns to Rock, until September 1991, backed by the American record label Impact Records and with much of the album including the first American single, \\"My Blue Angel\\", mixed and produced by the American producers Tony Peluso and Steve Barri. discogs.com Retrieved 30 September 2010 Although not making any headway as intended in America despite airplay for \\"My Blue Angel\\", a later single (the second in Denmark after \\"I Still Carry On\\") from the album, \\"The Actor\\", topped the Danish chart and also did well in Norway, Sweden, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.

The album included the singles \\"Sleeping Child\\", \\"25 Minutes\\" and \\"Out of the Blue\\". The band toured Asia for the first time. At the Phoebus Concert Hall in Bangkok they played to their largest audience until then of 12,000 people.

To promote the album, the group performed 25 shows in ten countries. The release of this album also increased the band's presence in hitherto untapped markets like Brazil, South Africa, the UAE and eleven countries in the Far East, including Japan. To capitalize on the success of Played on Pepper and to curb piracy, Michael Learns to Rock released the greatest hits album Paint My Love in October 1996, primarily in Asia; the album sold 3.4 million copies. The song, \\"Paint My Love\\", is an English version of \\"Kun med dig\\" by Danish singers Dorthe Andersen and Martin Loft, which was composed by Jascha Richter. The band was also chosen as the headliner for the 'Celebrate Hong Kong' concert on 6 July 1997, marking the transfer of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China. The album also topped the charts in South Africa with sales of more than 350,000 copies in South Africa alone. =Re-brand band name ‚Äî Nothing to Lose, MLTR & Strange Foreign Beauty (1997‚Äì1999)= They released their fourth studio album, Nothing to Lose, was released in September 1997, and also sold more than 1.1 million copies. In an incident that showcased Michael Learns to Rock's popularity in Asia, 20,000 fake tickets were sold (more than twice the number of real ones) for a concert in Hanoi, Vietnam, in December 1997 and while the concert was on, those outside with fake tickets tried to break into the concert hall through the windows causing riot police to be deployed. The band travelled to South Africa in January 1998, playing sell-out concerts in Johannesburg and Pretoria, consequently taking Nothing to Lose to the top of the charts in South Africa. Soon after, the band's members took a break to spend time with their families and to develop projects on their own or in collaboration with other performers. They also decided to re-brand the band under the simpler name of MLTR.Allan Lykke Poulsen, \\"Nu hedder vi MLTR\\", Ekstra Bladet, 20 May 1999 During the break, Richter wrote some new songs for the band, one of which is \\"Strange Foreign Beauty\\" that was later added to the 1999 greatest hits album Greatest Hits ‚Äì Strange Foreign Beauty. In a process undertaken by MLTR for the first time, the song was made by compiling the best details from recordings of ideas made individually by the four members. This album included their previous hits, either remixed or refined in some way by notable international producers such as Chris Lord-Alge (for \\"Someday\\", \\"Something You Should Know\\" etc.), Cutfather & Joe (for \\"Sleeping Child\\") and the Swedish producer Per Magnusson (for the MLTR top hit \\"The Actor'\\").\\"Michael Learns To Rock udsender den 19. maj et ¬ªGreatest Hits¬´-album\\", Berlingske Tidende, 7 May 1999 This greatest hits album went to the top of the Danish sales charts (the second MLTR album after their first album to do so), as well in Sweden and Portugal, and logged sales of nearly a million copies. =S√∏ren Madsen's departure and new releases ‚Äî Blue Night & Take Me to Your Heart (2000‚Äì2006)= In 2000, S√∏ren Madsen decided to leave the group to embark on a solo career. The remaining three members set themselves the challenge of pursuing a sound different from that of their previous albums and thus produced the album Blue Night, which almost went platinum in Denmark and sold well in Asia, with sales over one million. The following year a biography of MLTR, Something You Should Know written by Poul Martin-Bonde, was published along with a few previously unreleased recordings. The English translation of the book was called It Never Rains on Bali, a reference to an incident that took place during the band's 1995 Bali concert, where a no-rain forecast proved wrong and the unexpected rain stopped the concert. After the release of Blue Night, the band took a prolonged break, with Richter working on his solo album Planet Blue. The band later admitted that they even considered disbanding during this time. They ultimately decided against it, following the success of their greatest hits album releases, including 19 Love Songs / Love Ballads in 2002, which went to number 2 in Denmark. In 2004, the band regrouped again, departing from the name MLTR, and using the original name for their sixth album called Michael Learns to Rock, released in Asia as Take Me to Your Heart. The album focused on the Asian market. The single \\"Take Me to Your Heart\\" was a remake of Jacky Cheung's \\"Goodbye Kiss\\" (\\"ÂêªÂà´\\"), and was popular in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan. By the end of 2006 alone, the single created a record when it sold over 6 million paid downloads and was awarded the \\"Most Downloaded Single of the Year 2006\\". MLTR sang an English and Chinese duet of \\"Take Me to Your Heart\\" with the Chinese singer Hu Yanbin at a 2005 New Year's Party in Guangzhou, China. The band also sang the song with the South Korean star Shin Hye-sung, lead vocalist of the famous boy band Shinhwa. This album has been one of the major successes of MLTR in Asia, especially China.

In late January 2018, the band organized a competition over their social media platforms for the title of their upcoming album. Over the course of the week, they released the titles of the songs slated to be released through their new record. On 2 February 2018, the band released a new single titled \\"Everything You Need\\". After the contest, the band announced its winner, as well as the title of their ninth studio album, Still. Released on 21 March 2018 through all digital music platforms successfully and on limited number of special physical copies, the album features songs that sound like \\"Michael Learns to Rock but [it] sounds like today,\\" according to Wanscher. =Celebrating 25 Years of Played On Pepper (2020- ) = On Sept 17, 2020, The band posted on Twitter about the 25th anniversary of their 3rd album, Played On Pepper. They stated that the band is also preparing for DK POPLive Tour 2021 embarking small shows across Denmark to celebrate the album's 25th anniversary.  Touring  As of September 2010, Michael Learns to Rock have played over 450 shows, mltr- universe.dk Retrieved 2 October 2010 including both large and small open-air & closed-hall stage concerts, TV appearances, unplugged and sing-back gigs, over a period of 22 years. In total, MLTR have played in at least 21 countries and territories which include Denmark, Nepal, Indonesia, China, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, South Africa, Switzerland, Bangladesh, UAE, Faroe Islands, Vietnam, Cambodia, Norway, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea and Sweden. They have also traveled to Hollywood for recording part of their debut album, to Spain, Finland and Germany to attend interviews, and to the UK to shoot a video. In Asia, MLTR are one of the few artists to have played more than once in a country and to have still sustained an audience turn-out comparable to that of their earlier appearances. Midas Promotions Retrieved 2 October 2010 Michael Learns to Rock were also the first international act to have performed in Cambodia when they played a show (that was also televised live) in front of 700 fans in CTN's Studio One in Phnom Penh in October 2005.

Indian Express Retrieved 2 October 2010 In various interviews, the band members have admitted that touring and the response from fans to their concerts, among other reasons, keep them together, in spite of the stresses associated with traveling. In a recent interview Mikkel Lentz said, \\"The reason we stay together is because it makes sense. Our fans come to our shows and we still enjoy playing and travelling, so why should we stop? There is also the pleasure of making music, even though sometimes things like television shows or interviews can become a little boring.\\" K√•re Wanscher has also said in an interview that the highest points of their career have been when they were out touring Asia over the last few years. MLTR toured China in December 2010, playing unplugged concerts. The 2011 spring leg of the Danish tour started on 17 February 2011 and ended on 12 March 2011 with MLTR playing gigs in most of the Danish cities and towns, many of which were sold out. MLTR then completed their first full-production concert tour after their extended unplugged stint by playing on 22 April 2011 at Penang, 24 April 2011 at Kuala Lumpur and 30 April 2011 at Kuantan in Malaysia. The Summer tour commenced on 11 August 2011 with the band playing in Skanderborg, and later on 12 August 2011 at Aarhus and on 13 August at Aabenraa. The band played on 19 November 2011 for the first time ever in Kathmandu, Nepal at the Tudikhel Ground, as the headliners of Nepal Rocks. Retrieved 5 October 2011 The band were only the second internationally acclaimed band to play in Nepal, after the Canadian artist Bryan Adams did so earlier in the year. They also performed in Dhaka, Bangladesh on 22 June 2012 and in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia on December 7 and 8 2012. The band is the first to stream their 25th anniversary concert live to a global audience, using the Subcell smartphone app. The concert was broadcast live in sound and video from the Skanderborg Smukfest festival in Denmark on 11 August 2013. In Asia, their MLTR 25 Tour was staged in the Philippines on 19 September 2015. On 13 December 2015, MLTR performed live for the first time in North East India's prehistoric ancient city of Guwahati(earlier known as Pragjyotishpur) in Assam in front of a 75,000 strong audience at the huge Sarusajai Stadium, in company of multiple award-winning popular Assamese- Indian singer-composer Jim Ankan Deka. The musical nite was inaugurated with multilingual performances by Jim Ankan Deka and his music band VooDoo Child, wherein they sang their own compositions of Assamese and English songs. The attendance in the show was unprecedented in the city of Guwahati so far. On 31 August 2017, MLTR's first stop in their Eternal Asia Tour was staged at the Kia Theatre in Manila to a sold-out crowd.  Musical style and influences  Michael Learns to Rock follow a basic verse-chorus song-form (which is typical of most pop songs) with lyrics comprising straight forward and short-length phrasing incorporating very basic sentence constructions. The verses consist of either one or two couplets and the chorus often contrasts the verse melodically, rhythmically, and harmonically, assuming a higher level of dynamics and activity. The essence of this style followed invariably by MLTR is evident from Jascha Richter's dead-pan response to a query in an interview as to what constituted the elements of a good song: \\"You got to have a chorus and a verse\\".Philippine Entertainment Portal Retrieved 2 October 2010 Many songs incorporate a bridge section following the second chorus section (most notably \\"25 Minutes\\", \\"That's Why (You Go Away)\\", \\"Someday\\", \\"Paint My Love\\", \\"Blue Night\\" etc.). Many songs also contain instrumental solos, more commonly, guitar (e.g. \\"Someday\\", \\"That's Why (You Go Away)\\", \\"How Many Hours\\", \\"The Actor\\", \\"Something You Should Know\\", \\"Breaking My Heart\\", \\"Watch Your Back\\" etc.) and sometimes the keyboard (e.g. \\"Messages\\"), following the second chorus or following the bridge, in case the latter is present. Vocal harmonies also constitute a common feature of their songs. Lentz admits that they never really jam to come out with or develop upon a song and most of MLTR's songs are written and composed by Jascha Richter on the piano. Retrieved 2 October 2010 According to Richter, however, after he has written the song, Lentz takes the ideas further and makes it into a final production.insing.com Retrieved 2 October 2010 Lentz insists that MLTR do not fit to any genre of music except for having a classic pop-sound. Retrieved 2 October 2010 Further, he believes the secret behind MLTR's sustained music career is the non-conformance to any musical trends; \\"We never tried to follow trends. I think that's the reason we are still around. There's been trip hop, grunge, pop. We never fitted into these trends. What seems to be tough then is now our strength. They're just songs. The songs don't belong to a musical wave.\\" Michael Learns to Rock have cited their influences to be Supertramp, Elton John, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, Eagles, Billy Joel, ABBA, Bee Gees and \\"all the bands that write good lyrics\\" Philstar.com Retrieved 2 October 2010 (as Mikkel Lentz puts it tongue-in-cheek). Lentz, however, denies the influence of Michael Jackson on their music.Zee News Retrieved 2 October 2010 However, Jascha Richter reveals on his Facebook page in response to a fan's query that Michael Jackson's music did influence their music, especially the latter's Bad album which was released in the year preceding MLTR's formation. Also, Jascha Richter has cited Talk Talk, a-ha and Eurythmics to be his influences. A-ha's international success, in spite of originating from the small Scandinavian country of Norway, instilled the self-belief in the MLTR members that even they, hailing from a similarly small Scandinavian country (Denmark), could carve out a career for themselves in international music. Despite being branded simplistic, easy-listening and sometimes, down-right cheesy, banal or even naive by many, Michael Learns to Rock are adamant that these are the very qualities of their lyrics and music which have found favor with Asian music listeners.

It is north of the major town of Woking and for passengers is from Junction 11 of the M25 motorway which is between the M3 and A3 junctions. The airport is operated by Fairoaks Operations Ltd, owned by Albemarle Fairoaks Airport Ltd. and Airport Development Partners. Fairoaks Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (number P560) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Fairoaks Operations Ltd). The facility is used as by light aircraft, some of which are operated by its two resident training schools - Synergy Aviation and London Transport Flying Club, and as a maintenance airfield. Its business centre is substantially dedicated to aviation-related enterprises, including the headquarters of the European Regions Airline Association and the British Helicopter Advisory Board. Fairoaks is equipped with a non-directional beacon (NDB) for short- range radio navigation. There is a small on-site fire and rescue service, comprising two 4WD rescue vehicles. From 1994 until 2009 one of three South East Regional Air Support Unit (Metropolitan and Surrey Police Forces) helicopters (and for a period of this time one for the latter force alone) were at Fairoaks. In June 2009, the remaining police helicopter was transferred to RAF Odiham in Hampshire on security grounds. There are no restrictions on the number of helicopter movements, although there is a ban on training with the Robinson R22. Fixed wing movements are limited to 120,000 per annum. Hangar with old branding at Fairoaks History Fairoaks opened as a private airstrip in 1931, but was signed up for military use in 1936 and became RAF Fairoaks during World War II. It was used as a training airfield, with No. 18 Elementary & Reserve Flying School being formed on 1 October 1937 equipped with De Havilland Tiger Moths. 6,000 pilots were trained at the airfield, mostly in Tiger Moths. Terence O'Brien, an Australian pilot, later wrote a series of books about his experiences in the RAF. In \\"Chasing After Danger\\"O'Brien, T. (1990). Chasing After Danger. Toronto. HarperCollins Canada p. 34, he recounts doing primary flight training on Tiger Moths at Fairoaks in 1940, when it was still a grass aerodrome. The unit was re-designated No. 18 Reserve Flying School on 14 May 1947 and was managed by Universal Flying Services. The Tiger Moths were replaced by De Havilland Canada Chipmunks in 1951 but the school was disbanded on 31 July 1953. In the early postwar years, the airfield was managed by Universal Flying Services, which operated a flying training school and provided aircraft maintenance services. The airfield was sold by auction in 1967. Alan Mann Helicopters began operations there in 1968 after which The Alan Mann Group became the operator. The hard runway was constructed in 1979. The Alan Mann Group sold its interests in 2008 to Albemarle Fairoaks Airport Ltd which owns Fairoaks Operations Ltd, the operator.

Designed by American gun manufacturer ArmaLite in 1956, it was based on its AR-10 rifle. The ArmaLite AR-15 was designed to be a lightweight rifle and to fire a new high-velocity, lightweight, small-caliber cartridge to allow infantrymen to carry more ammunition. In 1959, ArmaLite sold its rights to the AR-15 to Colt due to financial difficulties and limitations in terms of manpower and production capacity.

June 1, 1968 Colt continued to use the AR-15 trademark for its line of semi-automatic-only rifles marketed to civilian and law-enforcement customers, known as Colt AR-15. The Armalite AR-15 is the parent of a variety of Colt AR-15 and M16 rifle variants. History After World War II, the United States military started looking for a single automatic rifle to replace the M1 Garand, M1/M2 Carbines, M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, M3 \\"Grease Gun\\" and Thompson submachine gun.The M16. By Gordon Rottman. Osprey Publishing, 2011. page 6 However, early experiments with select-fire versions of the M1 Garand proved disappointing. During the Korean War, the select-fire M2 Carbine largely replaced the submachine gun in US service and became the most widely used Carbine variant.Leroy Thompson (2011). The M1 Carbine. Osprey Publishing. p. 35. . However, combat experience suggested that the .30 Carbine round was under-powered. American weapons designers concluded that an intermediate round was necessary, and recommended a small-caliber, high-velocity cartridge. However, senior American commanders having faced fanatical enemies and experienced major logistical problems during WWII and the Korean War,Fanaticism And Conflict In The Modern Age, by Matthew Hughes & Gaynor Johnson, Frank Cass & Co, 2005 insisted that a single powerful .30 caliber cartridge be developed, that could not only be used by the new automatic rifle, but by the new general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) in concurrent development. This culminated in the development of the 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge. The United States Army then began testing several rifles to replace the obsolete M1 Garand. Springfield Armory's T44E4 and heavier T44E5 were essentially updated versions of the Garand chambered for the new 7.62 mm round, while Fabrique Nationale submitted their FN FAL as the T48. ArmaLite entered the competition late, hurriedly submitting several AR-10 prototype rifles in the fall of 1956 to the United States Army's Springfield Armory for testing.Pikula, pp. 36, 38 ArmaLite AR-10 with mounted bayonet made by Artillerie Inrichtingen (A.I.). The AR-10 featured an innovative straight-line barrel/stock design, forged aluminum alloy receivers and with phenolic composite stocks.Pikula, Major Sam. The ArmaLite AR-10. Regnum Fund Press, 1998. . pp. 27-29 It had rugged elevated sights, an oversized aluminumPikula, Sam (Major), The ArmaLite AR-10, p. 38: Later changed to titanium. flash suppressor and recoil compensator, and an adjustable gas system.Pikula, pp. 27-30 The final prototype, featured an upper and lower receiver with the now- familiar hinge and takedown pins, and the charging handle was on top of the receiver placed inside of the carry handle. For a 7.62 mm NATO rifle, the AR-10 was incredibly lightweight at only empty. Initial comments by Springfield Armory test staff were favorable, and some testers commented that the AR-10 was the best lightweight automatic rifle ever tested by the Armory.Pikula, pp. 39-40 In the end the United States Army chose the T44, now called the M14 rifle, which was an improved M1 Garand with a 20-round magazine and automatic fire capability. The U.S. also adopted the M60 general purpose machine gun (GPMG). Its NATO partners adopted the FN FAL and HK G3 rifles, as well as the FN MAG and Rheinmetall MG3 GPMGs. The first confrontations between the AK-47 and the M14 came in the early part of the Vietnam War. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammo to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47. While the M2 Carbine offered a high rate of fire, it was under-powered and ultimately outclassed by the AK-47. A replacement was needed: a medium between the traditional preference for high-powered rifles, such as the M14, and the lightweight firepower of the M2 Carbine. Early ArmaLite AR-15 without magazine or flash hider As a result, the Army was forced to reconsider a 1957 request by General Willard G. Wyman, commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC), to develop a .223 caliber (5.56 mm) select-fire rifle weighing 6 lb (2.7 kg) when loaded with a 20-round magazine. The 5.56mm round had to penetrate a standard U.S. M1 helmet at and retain a velocity in excess of the speed of sound, while matching or exceeding the wounding ability of the .30 Carbine cartridge.Hutton, Robert (ed.), The .223, Guns & Ammo Annual Edition, 1971. This request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaled-down version of the ArmaLite AR-10, called the ArmaLite AR-15 rifle. In 1958, ArmaLite submitted ten AR-15s and one hundred 25-round magazines for CONARC testing. The tests found that a five to seven man team armed with AR-15s had the same firepower as an 11 man team armed with M14sRifle Squad Armed with a Light Weight High Velocity Rifle. U.S. Army Combat Experimentation Center. Fort Ord. California. June 24, 1959. and soldiers armed with AR-15s could also carry three times more ammunition than those armed with M14s (649 rounds vs. 220 rounds).http://www.forgottenweapons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1959-Rifle- Squad-Armed-with-a-Light-Weight-High-Velocity-Rifle.pdf Rifle Squad Armed with a Light Weight High Velocity Rifle. U.S. Army Combat Experimentation Center. Fort Ord. Californaia. June 24, 1959 The AR-15 was found to be three times more reliable than the M14 rifle. However, General Maxwell Taylor, then Army Chief of Staff, \\"vetoed\\" the AR-15 in favor of the M14. In 1959, ArmaLite‚Äînow frustrated with the lack of results and suffering ongoing financial difficulties‚Äîsold its rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 to Colt. =Colt era= After acquiring the AR-15, Colt promptly redesigned the rifle to facilitate mass production. Based on the final ArmaLite design, most notably, the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle, like the earlier AR-10 to the rear of the receiver, like the later M16 rifle. Colt then renamed and rebranded the rifle \\"Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 01\\". After a Far East tour, Colt made its first sale of Colt ArmaLite AR-15 rifles to Malaya on September 30, 1959. Colt manufactured their first batch of 300 Colt ArmaLite AR-15 rifles in December 1959. Colt would go on to market the Colt ArmaLite AR-15 rifle to military services around the world. In July 1960, General Curtis LeMay, then Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, was impressed by a demonstration of the AR-15 and ordered 8500 rifles. In the meantime, the Army would continue testing the AR-15, finding that the intermediate cartridge .223 (5.56mm) rifle is much easier to shoot than the standard 7.62mm NATO M14 rifle. In 1961 marksmanship testing, the U.S. Army found that 43% of AR-15 shooters achieved Expert, while only 22% of M-14 rifle shooters did so. Also, a lower recoil impulse, allows for more controllable automatic weapons fire. In the summer of 1961, General LeMay was promoted to Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, and requested an additional 80,000 AR-15s. However, General Maxwell D. Taylor, now Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, (who repeatedly clashed with LeMay) advised President John F. Kennedy that having two different calibers within the military system at the same time would be problematic and the request was rejected. In October 1961, William Godel, a senior man at the Advanced Research Projects Agency, sent 10 AR-15s to South Vietnam. The reception was enthusiastic, and in 1962, another 1,000 AR-15s were sent. United States Army Special Forces personnel filed battlefield reports lavishly praising the AR-15 and the stopping-power of the 5.56 mm cartridge, and pressed for its adoption. The damage caused by the 5.56 mm bullet was originally believed to be caused by \\"tumbling\\" due to the slow 1 in rifling twist rate. However, any pointed lead core bullet will \\"tumble\\" after penetration in flesh, because the center of gravity is towards the rear of the bullet. The large wounds observed by soldiers in Vietnam were actually caused by bullet fragmentation, which was created by a combination of the bullet's velocity and construction.Martin L. Fackler, \\"Wounding patterns of military rifle bullets\\" https://www.ar15.com/ammo/project/Fackler_Articles/wounding_patterns_military_rifles.pdf These wounds were so devastating that the photographs remained classified into the 1980s. However, despite overwhelming evidence that the AR-15 could bring more firepower to bear than the M14, the Army opposed the adoption of the new rifle. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara now had two conflicting views: the USAF's (General LeMay's) repeated requests for additional AR-15s and the ARPA report favoring the AR-15, versus the Army's position favoring the M14. Even President Kennedy expressed concern, so McNamara ordered Secretary of the Army Cyrus Vance to test the M14, the AR-15 and the AK-47. The Army reported that only the M14 was suitable for service, but Vance wondered about the impartiality of those conducting the tests. He ordered the Army Inspector General to investigate the testing methods used; the Inspector General confirmed that the testers were biased towards the M14. In January 1963, Secretary McNamara received reports that M14 production was insufficient to meet the needs of the armed forces and ordered a halt to M14 production. At the time, the AR-15 was the only rifle that could fulfill a requirement of a \\"universal\\" infantry weapon for issue to all services. McNamara ordered its adoption, despite receiving reports of several deficiencies, most notably the lack of a chrome-plated chamber. After minor modifications, the new redesigned rifle was renamed the \\"Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16\\". Meanwhile, the Army relented and recommended the adoption of the M16 for jungle warfare operations. However, the Army insisted on the inclusion of a forward assist to help push the bolt into battery in the event that a cartridge failed to seat into the chamber. The Air Force, Colt and Eugene Stoner believed that the addition of a forward assist was an unjustified expense. As a result, the design was split into two variants: the Air Force's M16 without the forward assist, and the \\"XM16E1 (AKA: M16A1)\\" with the forward assist for the other service branches. In November 1963, McNamara approved the U.S. Army's order of 85,000 XM16E1s; and to appease General LeMay, the Air Force was granted an order for another 19,000 M16s. In March 1964, the M16 rifle went into production and the Army accepted delivery of the first batch of 2129 rifles later that year, and an additional 57,240 rifles the following year. The Colt ArmaLite AR-15 was discontinued with the adoption of the M16 rifle. Most AR-15 rifles in U.S. service have long ago been upgraded to M16 configuration. The Colt ArmaLite AR-15 was also used by the United States Secret Service and other U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Shortly after the United States military adopted the M16 rifle, Colt introduced its line semi-automatic-only Colt AR-15 rifles, which it markets to civilians and law enforcement. Colt continues to use the AR-15 name for these rifles.

It was designed to be manufactured with the extensive use of aluminium and synthetic materials by state of the art Computer Numerical Control (CNC) automated machinery. ArmaLite AR-15 with 25-round magazine and flash hider The ArmaLite AR-15 internal piston action was derived from the original ArmaLite AR-10 action and was later used in the M16 rifle action. This internal piston action system designed by Eugene Stoner is commonly called a direct impingement system, but it does not utilize a conventional direct impingement system. In , the designer states: ‚Ä≥This invention is a true expanding gas system instead of the conventional impinging gas system.‚Ä≥ The gas system, bolt carrier, and bolt-locking design were novel for the time. The AR-15 is a Modular Weapon System. It is easy to assemble, modify and repair using a few simple hand tools, and a flat surface to work on. The AR-15's upper receiver incorporates the fore stock, the charging handle, the gas operating system, the barrel, the bolt and bolt carrier assembly. The lower receiver incorporates the magazine well, the pistol grip and the buttstock. The lower receiver also contains the trigger, disconnector, hammer and fire selector (collectively known as the fire control group). The AR-15's \\"duckbill\\" flash suppressor had three tines or prongs and was designed to preserve the shooter's night vision by disrupting the flash. Early AR-15's had a 25-round magazine. Later model AR-15s used a 20-round waffle-patterned magazine that was meant to be a lightweight, disposable item.Thomas P. Ehrhart Increasing Small Arms Lethality in Afghanistan: Taking Back the Infantry Half- Kilometer As such, it is made of pressed/stamped aluminum and was not designed to be durable. The AR-15's most distinctive ergonomic feature is the carrying handle and rear sight assembly on top of the receiver. This is a by-product of the design, where the carry handle serves to protect the charging handle. The AR-15 rifle has a 500 mm (19.75 inches) sight radius. The AR-15 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage. The sights can be adjusted with a bullet tip or pointed tool. \\"The (AR-15's) Stoner system provides a very symmetric design that allows straight line movement of the operating components. This allows recoil forces to drive straight to the rear. Instead of connecting or other mechanical parts driving the system, high pressure gas performs this function, reducing the weight of moving parts and the rifle as a whole.\\" ARMALITE TECHNICAL NOTE 54: DIRECT IMPINGEMENT VERSUS PISTON DRIVE The AR-15's straight-line recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action, and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer. The stock being in line with the bore also reduces muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire. Because recoil does not significantly shift the point of aim, faster follow-up shots are possible and user fatigue is reduced. =Colt ArmaLite AR-15 (Model 601 and 602)= Colt's first two models produced after the acquisition of the rifle from ArmaLite were the 601 and 602, and these rifles were in many ways clones of the original ArmaLite rifle (in fact, these rifles were often found stamped Colt ArmaLite AR-15, Property of the U.S. Government caliber .223, with no reference to them being M16s).Pages 744‚Äì759 \\"Small Arms of the World\\" 12th Revised Edition by Edward Clinton Ezell. The 601 and 602 are virtually identical to the later M16 rifle without the forward-assist. Like the later M16 rifle their charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like AR-10 to the rear of the receiver. They were equipped with triangular fore-stocks and occasionally green or brown furniture. Their front sight had a more triangular shape. They had flat lower receivers without raised surfaces around the magazine well. Their bolt hold open device lacked a raised lower engagement surface and had a slanted and serrated surface that had to be engaged with a bare thumb, index finger, or thumb nail because of the lack of this surface. Their fire-selector was also changed from upward = safe, backward = semi-auto and forward = full-auto, to the now familiar forward = safe, upward = semi-auto, and backward = full-auto of the M16 rifle.https://www.forgottenweapons.com/explaining-the-ar-safety-lever-design- video/ The only major difference between the 601 and 602 is the switch from the original 1:14-inch rifling twist to the more common 1:12-inch twist. The 601 was first adopted by the United States Air Force, and was quickly supplemented with the 602s (AKA: XM16s) and later the 604s (AKA: M16s). Over time, the 601s and 602s were converted to M16 rifle configuration. The USAF continued to use ArmaLite AR-15 marked rifles well into the 1990s. File:Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 01.

A dual sai-wielding assassin, she acts as the evil twin and magenta palette swap of Princess Kitana in Mortal Kombat II in 1993. She has been promoted throughout the Mortal Kombat games as its semi-ironic sex symbol, especially since Mortal Kombat: Deception when she began a pattern of wearing more revealing outfits. The series' 2011 reboot made her even more psychologically unstable, not to mention cannibalistic, and her resemblance to her sister has greatly diminished. In the backstory of Mortal Kombat X, Mileena is the sole surviving heir of Shao Kahn and vies for the Outworld throne with the warlord Kotal Kahn. Despite some criticism for her character designs, Mileena has become one of the most popular characters in the series. Her exclusion from Mortal Kombat 11 led to negative criticism from fans who demanded for her return through both the Mortal Kombat and Netherealm Studios' Twitter accounts, as well as series creator Ed Boon. Eventually, Mileena was added as a DLC in the updated version of the game, Mortal Kombat 11: Ultimate Edition. Appearances =In video games= After the ruler of the other dimensional realm Outworld, Shao Kahn, conquered the realm of Edenia and merged it with his own, he decided he would keep the former king's daughter Kitana alive and raise her as his own. Though she grew up knowing nothing of her origin, the emperor nonetheless feared that one day Kitana would discover her true parentage and turn against him, and so he ordered Shang Tsung to bring to life a more vicious and loyal version of Kitana that could take her place if necessary. This was done by fusing her essence with a Tarkatan warrior from Baraka's race. The process was not a complete success, however, as the hybrid clone was disfigured with the hideous mouth of the Tarkata. Instead of replacing Kitana, as originally planned, Mileena would be used to spy on her and to ensure her allegiance to him, and so Shao Kahn introduced Mileena to Kitana as her supposedly lost twin sister. The two thus grew up together as his daughters and elite personal assassins, although Mileena grew to harbor a great bitterness and jealousy towards Kitana, whom Kahn favored over her. As Kahn feared, Kitana did finally find the truth about her past and so Mileena was ordered to keep close watch over her rival when Kitana secretly allied with Earthrealm warriors during the events of Mortal Kombat II (1993).Bryan Dawson, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (Prima Official Game Guide), Prima Games 2006 (p. 101). Mileena has a secret companion in Baraka.Mortal Kombat Warehouse: Mortal Kombat II: Mileena, Mortal Kombat Online network. Determined to stop her twin at any cost,Mortal Kombat II Game Gear manual (p. 20). she is then murderedUltimate Mortal Kombat 3 SNES manual (p. 25). by Kitana, her soul descending into the Netherrealm. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, the 2005 beat'em up retelling of Mortal Kombat II, Mileena fights against Liu Kang and Kung Lao alongside Jade and Kitana, but is defeated by the two Shaolin warriors and flees to the Wasteland to seek help from Goro. Damned to the Netherealm after her death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler Shinnok. During the events of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her skills as a vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically granting her the ability to read Kitana's thoughts.Mortal Kombat Trilogy PlayStation manual, p.19. Shinnok sees this as an opportunity to covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he allows her to return to life. After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherealm. In Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana's palace and demands the power over Edenia be shared with her. Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena and locks her away in a dungeon. Mileena remains imprisoned for years, until Onaga the Dragon King began his own invasion of Edenia, during which she is freed from her imprisonment by her ally Baraka. During the events of Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004), Mileena is ordered by Onaga to pose as Kitana in order to confuse and misdirect his enemies.Bryan Dawson, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (Prima Official Game Guide), Prima Games 2006 (p. 118). However, as Mileena begins the game's titular deception, she develops a hidden agenda and decides to take control of both the forces of Edenia and Onaga's own undead army for herself. In the game's story mode (Konquest), Mileena also trains the young Shujinko in Outworld and fights against Jade.Mark Ryan Sallee, Mortal Kombat: Deception - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide - p. 25, GameSpy, January 8, 2004. In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006), Mileena seizes Shao Kahn's fortress, still under the guise of Kitana, and decides to continue her charade until the Edenian forces were corrupted enough to follow her under the true identity. Though at first confident that Outworld is hers to rule, Mileena is forced to reveal herself and surrender to the returning Shao Kahn when he mounts an offensive against the fortress to re-instate himself as the ruler. The emperor then commands her to capture Shujinko, who would be used as a bargaining chip in gaining Onaga as an ally. Mileena, pretending to be Kitana, succeeds in capturing Shujinko, taking him to Shao Kahn's palace. But having tasted power for herself, she is no longer content with being his minion and still plans to get the throne of Edenia back for herself. She is later killed by Shang Tsung during the final all-out battle at the Pyramid. Mileena returns in Mortal Kombat (2011), an alternative-timeline retelling of the original Mortal Kombat trilogy that brought some major changes to her character. In this game, Mileena was created by Shang Tsung in the \\"Flesh Pit\\" and introduced during the second tournament, instead of many years earlier. Meant to be a loyal replacement for Kitana, she is physically and mentally damaged, her animalistic rage controlled only by Shao Kahn as she uses her lascivious behavior to lure victims and then slaughter and devour them.Richard Mitchell, Video: Mileena gets stab-happy in Mortal Kombat, Joystiq, January 15, 2011. In the game's story mode, she serves as an opponent for Kitana, Jade, Stryker and Kabal, and is referred to by Shao Kahn as his \\"true daughter\\", succeeding him after his death by Raiden's hand. The game's Challenge Tower mode has Mileena killing Shang Tsung and absorbing his soul, while Kitana's uncanonical ending shows her being unusually sympathetic towards Mileena.Mortal Kombat Kitana's Ending in High Definition, G4tv.com, April 25, 2011 (\\"Kitana had ended Shao Kahn's life for his betrayal. She had discovered the truth about Mileena...but rather than slay her as well, she took pity on her half-sister. She offered Mileena a home within the Edenian aristocracy. She was, after all, of royal blood. Mileena cautiously accepted her sister's invitation. With Mileena and Jade at her side, Kitana formed a fighting force dedicated to bringing justice to the realms. Never again would a warlord arise to create such terror.\\"). Mileena returned as a playable character in Mortal Kombat X (2015). Though she became empress of Outworld after Shao Kahn's death, Mileena is overthrown by Kotal Kahn after Reptile reveals her origins, with her followers either killed or siding with Kotal Kahn. Refusing to accept defeat, Mileena resolves to reclaim the throne with the power of possessing Shinnok's amulet. Allying herself with Rain, Tanya, and Kano, Mileena launches an unsuccessful surprise attack on Kotal Kahn in Outworld and is captured. She uses the amulet to protect herself from execution, but is overcome by its power before being rescued and taken away by Rain. She is later tracked down by Cassie Cage, who worked with D'Vorah in apprehending Mileena again and recover the amulet. Mileena fights D'Vorah but is defeated, and she is brought to Kotal Kahn. He orders Mileena to be executed by D'Vorah, who subjects her to flesh-eating parasites through mouth- to-mouth transmission. Mileena will return in Mortal Kombat 11 as part of the Kombat Pack 2 DLC to be released on November 17th. Due to popular demand by fans, Ed Boon has also added Mileena to Kitana's friendship. This particular version of Mileena originates from the past during the second tournament, having been brought to the present by Kronika, and learns of her future self's death. Design Mileena was the first evil female character to appear in the series, created by John Tobias for Mortal Kombat II simply to accommodate another palette-swapped character.Kitsune, Kitana's Origin - ClassicMK (based on a series posts by John Tobias (therealsaibot) on Twitter). Tobias recalled: \\"I took advantage of Kitana and Mileena being masked sisters to make a play on the veil myth‚Ä¶ One sister is beautiful. One is ugly. One is good. One is evil. Choose wisely before asking one on a date.\\" According to Acclaim Entertainment's producer Robert O'Farrell, the game was given two female fighters so it would better compete against Capcom's Street Fighter II,\\"Immortal Kombat\\", The One Amiga 75 (December 1994), pp. 31‚Äì33. which had only one. Mortal Kombat co-creator and producer Ed Boon described the sisters as the \\"female versions of Scorpion and Sub-Zero\\".Kitana's Kombat Kard video for Mortal Kombat: Deception. left Since her debut, Mileena's characteristic weapon is a pair of sharpened, dagger-like sai, that at first she has been using in combat only as projectiles and during some of her finishing moves (eventually, the sai were given more use in Mortal Kombat 2011). Only in Mortal Kombat Gold does she use a European style longsword (similar to that of Scorpion in Mortal Kombat 4) as her primary physical weapon. Prior to the release of MK2011, Mileena was one of the five \\"legendary characters\\" spotlighted by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, alongside the likes of Scorpion and Sub-Zero. Her MK2011 X-ray attack was altered to incorporate sai stabbings after fan feedback \\"to fit Mileena as far as her style, her brutality.\\" Her trademark moves through the series include double-sai throws that can be performed midair, teleport kicks, and on-ground rolling attacks. Mileena also utilizes her sai in most of her Fatalities, including immobilizing her opponents prior to the killing sequence (such as her \\"Rip Off\\" finisher in MK2011), while she pretends to kiss her victims in others. In MKX, both of her Fatalities exhibit her cannibalistic traits. There was a popular but completely false urban legend-style rumor regarding a supposed \\"Nudality\\" finishing move in MKII.Jason Wilson, Adam Hernandez, Mortal Kombat: Prima Official Game Guide, Prima Games 2011 (p. 7). Her Animality in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy sees her transform into a skunk that sprays the defeated opponent. MKXalt= Mileena is physically identical to Kitana, the most glaring exception being her half-Tarkata face with large and exposed fang-like teeth (which got noticeably downsized for Mortal Kombat Deception and Armageddon). Boon described Mileena as \\"Anti-Kitana\\" and said that her large \\"sharp, nasty teeth\\" have been not originally planned and were only drawn for her infamous Fatality \\"Man-Eater\\" (featured in UMK3 too),Mileena's Kombat Kard video for Mortal Kombat: Deception. in which she sucks up the entire body of her victims and then regurgitates their clean bones.\\"Get Your Kicks With These\\", Albany Times Union, October 4, 1995. After MKII, her teeth were almost never used again during gameplay until MK2011 (in a leap attack to bite an opponent in the neck and in one Fatality to gnaw on the killed enemy's severed head),Mortal Kombat Mileena Examined, GameTrailers, January 20, 2011. with a sole exception of one Fatality in Deception in which she uses them to tear off the opponent's head. Mileena's skin color appears to be at times mildly darker than Kitana's, but is always lighter than Jade's. After the two were given more varying appearances in Gold (hairstyle of all Kitana-derived characters is loose in MKII and pinned back in a bun in UMK3), Mileena's hair is usually much shorter than Kitana's and is most often worn gathered in a ponytail. One element of Mileena's anatomy that has often changed is her eyes. As her supposed twin sister, Mileena shared Kitana's eyes in MKII; her eyes then became \\"undead\\" style all-white (similar to the eyes of Scorpion and Noob Saibot) in UMK3. In Deception, Armageddon and Shaolin Monks, Mileena's eyes return to normal, but are yellow (Kitana's eyes are brown). In Mortal Kombat 2011, however, she has Baraka-like yellow eyes with slit pupils (her eyes are also sometimes seen as glowing whole), except of her alternate UMK3 style costume (available through pre-order bonuses and later in a DLC packageMichael McWhertor, Mortal Kombat Adds Klassic Costumes, Klassic Fatalities and Skarlet With Its First DLK, Kotaku, May 26, 2011.) in which she has human eyes once again.GameStop Advertisement Shows Classic Scorpion and Mileena Outfits, Shoryuken, 03-22-2011. In MKX, her facial appearance has undergone major changes on her facial appearance based on those from Mortal Kombat Legacy live-action series, such as having a human-like mouth, yet still retain most of her Tarkatan mouth, as seen on both of her cheeks. Deception by Steve Beran were included in the game's bonus gallery \\"The Krypt\\". One of them was originally planned to be Kitana but was developed into Mileena's primary costume, while the other one became Mileena's alternate. Beran said he \\"wanted to give Mileena an Arabic feel to her costume and the final version showed a lot more skin and her mask developed into more of a veil\\"MILEENA CONCEPTS (Koffin ET 141 Jade Koins). Mortal Kombat: Deception, Midway Games 2004.alt=left Mileena's main color has been either a shade of purple or magenta in various installments (including when masquerading as Kitana in Deception) and their outfits did not differ in a significant way (more than just having different color patterns) until Gold. Since then, her costumes have been generally getting more skimpy with every new game,The Evolution of Mortal Kombat Fatalities, IGN, April 7, 2011. including always having an exposed midriff since Deception. Mileena's main costume in Deception and Armageddon is actually mostly black and features long flowing arm sleeves, a back-only loincloth and a partially transparent veil. In Shaolin Monks, Mileena appears half-naked (her costume made largely of just belts of leather and scraps of fabric), barefoot (with a bandaged midfoot), and again wearing a veil in place of a mask (the veil returns as part of her formal outfit in MK2011). In the 2011 reboot game, her prime costume is based on her famous provocative alternate from Deception, but more detailed and again featuring a mask. In all, in this game she has the largest number of costumes out of all characters in the entire series. Her \\"Flesh Pit\\" alternate costume in the 2011 game is made of just some loose bandages put around her otherwise completely naked body,Hamza CTZ Aziz, The new winner for skimpiest 'outfit' in a videogame ever, Destructoid, 4.22.2011. marking the first time that she has appeared unmasked by default. \\"The Ultimate Horror Pack\\" DLC for MKX features the Vampiress Mileena. Like Kitana and Jade, Mileena has been originally portrayed by Katalin Zamiar in MKII, who was using her own sai.Benedykt Dziuba≈Çtowski, Interview with Katalin Ogren - an actress played a character of Kitana, Mileena and Jade in \\"Mortal Kombat 2\\", PPA.pl, 09.11.2012. A false rumor printed in Game Informer told of a Mileena-like secret character named Emerald supposedly hidden in the game. After MKII, Mileena was first filmed during the very early development, then officially declared by Tobias and Boon to be \\"gone\\" and not returning,Video Games The Ultimate Gaming Magazine 75 (April 1995) p. 49. and eventually brought back due to popular demand, with Becky Gable taking over the role in UMK3. Her motion capture actors for 3D games have included Carlos Pesina in Deception and Armageddon, but at least in MK2011 she was played by a woman. Gameplay Mileena has been commonly perceived as one of the top (or even the best) characters of Mortal Kombat II in gameplay terms. Game Players described her as a \\"big purple flash that bolts across the screen and kicks your tail before you even knew the round started.\\" She was ranked as the game's best overall fighter by Sega Visions for her high speed and reach as well as her teleport kick that can uniquely dodge the opponent's projectiles.\\"Sega Saturn Features: Mortal Kombat II\\". Sega Visions 21 (October/November 1994), p. 25. Super Play too called her \\"the best MKII character\\" as she is \\"fast, with a good range of attacks, and the potential for the most awesome combo in the game.\\"Super Play 26 (December 1994), p 64. EGM noted about how this \\"deadly woman...can hold her own against any man in the game\\" as her players can use her \\"lightning speed\\" and the sai blasts to overcome other players,EGM's Complete Guide to Mortal Kombat II (supplement to Electronic Gaming Monthly). while C+VG evaluated all of MKII characters as \\"well-balanced\\" and \\"potentially excellent\\", but still the teleport kick of the \\"very fast\\" Mileena was singled out by them as \\"the best surprising move in the game.\\"\\"Tougher than the best: Mortal Kombat II\\", Computer + Video Games 154 (September 1994), p. 48‚Äì51. According to CU Amiga, Mileena was \\"third only to Jax and Liu Kang for sheer brilliance,\\" being a \\"somewhat misleading character\\" whose moves need to be \\"learnt the right way to put them all together to be devastating.\\"\\"Player's Guide: Mortal Kombat II\\".

In GamePro test, the \\"queen of the hill\\" Mileena was effective against all characters, and especially versus Jax (who shared tier 1 with her in their ranking), Reptile and Shang Tsung. GamePro testers opined that \\"although Jax is the better overall characters against Tiers 2-4, Mileena's massive advantage over him makes her number one.

Mileena is a hidden playable character in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, for which she needs to be unlocked with a special \\"Kombat Kode\\", but is available from the start in the compilation game Mortal Kombat Trilogy (appearing as seen in UMK3). Sega Saturn Magazine stated \\"she's pretty much identical to the last time,\\" meaning MKII.\\"Showcases: Mortal Kombat 3\\". Official Sega Saturn Magazine 6 (April 1996), p. 48.

EGM Strategy Guide for UMK3 noted she has largely retained her ability to \\"zone\\" the opponent with her sai projectiles, which had contributed to making her \\"one of the toughest\\" characters in MKII. A alt= According to GameSpy's guide to Mortal Kombat Deception, Mileena \\"has some solid offensive tools\\" and \\"a few solid combos up her sleeve, as well as a few pop-up attacks that are extremely quick and open up brief juggle opportunities,\\" however she now also has severe weaknesses such as a very short range of her sai and poor ranged attack abilities. Prima Games' official guide for a Deception-based Mortal Kombat Armageddon gave Mileena an overall rating of 6/10, calling her a \\"punisher\\" type character and a better fighter than Kitana (\\"seems to have the upper hand between the two\\"), but while she \\"is able to punish from any range and even interrupt high attacks and projectiles, the damage she iflicts is minor.\\"Bryan Dawson, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (Prima Official Game Guide), Prima Games 2006 (p. 221‚Äì224). In Prima Games' official guide for the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, Mileena was judged to be well-balanced and universal, displaying neither particular weaknesses nor advantages that would result in a one-sided battle against anyone else. In their test, Mileena always won around half of fights against any character (in the range of 40‚Äì60%, wins depending on an opposing character).Jason Wilson, Adam Hernandez, Mortal Kombat: Prima Official Game Guide, Prima Games 2011 (p. 157). In Mortal Kombat X, Mileena's style of fighting is translated into her three variations: \\"Ravenous\\", \\"Piercing\\", and \\"Ethereal\\". In \\"Ravenous\\", as the name suggests, Mileena gains an expanded number of biting and pouncing attacks, highlighting her beastly and cannibalistic tendencies and turning her into a more aggressive fighter. In \\"Piercing\\", her main trait is her sai, which she uses for both projectiles and extensive combination attacks. Her \\"Ethereal\\" variation focuses on her ability to teleport, and allows her to disappear for extended periods of time in order to strike stealthily. Prima evaluated her as a \\"solid character\\" with \\"several great ways to stop opponents from jumping toward her,\\" but who is \\"not as safe as some of the other characters, which means she has to take a few risks.\\" Mileena is not playable in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks wherein she only appears as a sub-boss character alongside Kitana and Jade, as well as an optional boss in a secret stage encounter. Mileena also appears in the super deformed-style \\"cute\\" form in every minigame through the series: \\"Chess Kombat\\", \\"Puzzle Kombat\\" and \\"Motor Kombat\\". In \\"Motor Kombat\\", Mileena's Kombat Karting special weapon is a brief speed boost that is very useful to save her from a Fatality in a death trap or at the finish line, and makes her a \\"great character\\" to use in the arena Speedster.Bryan Dawson, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (Prima Official Game Guide), Prima Games 2006 (pp. 38&80).

She was a recurring secondary character in Malibu Comics' Mortal Kombat series that was published from 1994 to 1995. Making her debut in the first issue of the Goro: Prince of Pain miniseries, she is part of a team led by Kitana with orders to find the missing Goro in Outworld. She additionally has reservations about Kitana's true loyalty to Kahn (though she never speaks about it to anyone) and considers herself to be the loyal \\"Shao Kahn's true daughter.\\" Mileena is paired with Reptile in Battlewave, and duels Sonya Blade twice‚Äîincluding the first \\"Tournament Edition\\" finale in which she stabs Sonya with her sai‚Äîbut she loses both times. She was also featured in a one-shot special entitled Kitana and Mileena: Sister Act, which explained their past: Mileena is a creation ordered by Shao Kahn, though he would never let her replace Kitana. Mileena was a minor character in the Mortal Kombat: Live Tour stage show in 1995, where she was played mostly by Jennifer DeCosta and Lexi Alexander in a dual role. They primarily played Kitana but wore Mileena's costume underneath for a quick wardrobe change as Mileena would reveal herself to the heroes Jax and Liu Kang after having led them into Shao Kahn's trap while impersonating Kitana. She was the only player character at the time absent from the first Mortal Kombat film. alt=This image shows a masked woman with braided black hair, in a martial arts pose, wearing a pink-and-black outfit. Mileena appeared briefly in the 1997 feature film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and was played by martial artist and stuntwoman Dana Hee.Current Biography Yearbook 2008, H. W. Wilson Co., 2008 (p.217). She was featured in one scene in which she ambushes Sonya Blade from behind in a desert.

Her fight against Sonya Blade was shot in -3¬∞ Celsius (26¬∞ Fahrenheit) weather at a copper mine in Wales, and the crew had trucked in synthetic mud for the scene, but a hurricane struck near the set a day before filming and left both actresses and their stunt performers fighting in actual mud.Mortal Kombat II - Cory Doctorow, SciFi Entertainment, 11/97; reprinted on craphound.com. Mileena's character and the fight scene have been originally quite different in Brent V. Friedman and Bryce Zabel's scripts for the film. In Jerome Preisler's novelization of Mortal Kombat Annihilation, based on the film's scripts, Mileena has teamed up with Smoke, but she is still killed by Sonya after an ensuing fight scene, albeit by different means. In Preisler's novel, Mileena appears in a scene similar to this in the film, but instead set in a mist-covered jungle wilderness. She ambushes Sonya while Smoke attacks Jax, and she is depicted as being an unmasked \\"angular, exotic- looking woman with eyes like burning coals, and a body as tautly well- conditioned as her smile was vicious\\", laughing an insane and inhuman laughter. Mileena scissor-grips Sonya's neck with \\"her powerful thigh muscles\\" before being thrown off by Sonya. She then introduces herself after this initial confrontation, adding that she does not appreciate being confused with her \\"virtuous half-sister.\\" Eventually, Sonya fatally strangles Mileena with the handle of her own sai after a second fight, and when she and Jax examine Mileena's corpse, Sonya wonders if Mileena was just \\"another cyborg\\" after spotting a shoulder tattoo similar to the mark found on Cyrax. Mileena appeared in the 1999 episode \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\" of the television series Mortal Kombat: Konquest, in which she had no direct relation to Kitana and was here depicted as an initially very repulsive and aggressive Outworld warrior sent by Shao Kahn to assassinate the weakened Kung Lao, with a magic spell placed over her to give her Kitana's look (for a while, he even called her his \\"new daughter\\"). Mileena, wearing a green costume, succeeded in seducing Kung Lao, but could not bring herself to kill him during their night of passion. She makes excuses for Kahn and later fights an inconclusive duel against Kitana, broken by Shao Kahn. As punishment for her taking too much time in her mission, Kahn allows Mileena to keep her beauty with the exception of making her teeth exaggeratedly pointed.Mileena Unmasked - The Kombat Pavilion. Retrieved December 15, 2013. She then starts to wear her signature mask, which Kahn gives her before banishing her from his sight. In Konquest, Mileena was portrayed by Meg Brown and Audie England played Mileena pretending to be Kitana. Mileena's costume is very similar to that in Annihilation but she has different hair. Mileena was supposed to return in the third Mortal Kombat film that has not been made despite multiple attempts, including the early 2010s reboot project by Kevin Tancharoen. In 2018, she was revealed as included in a current reboot project, planned to be directed by Simon McQuoid in the script written by Greg Russo.

The adolescent Mileena is clad in violet, does not appear to be Kitana's twin, and is seen wearing a mask only in some of the animated sections (in which both of them are wearing outfits similar to those in Mortal Kombat II). She is shown spar-dueling against Kitana and losing to her, then killing and devouring a palace guard in a fit of insanity, as well as killing impostors of King Jerrod, Kitana's biological father, in a team together with Kitana. When the two are eventually sent by Shao Kahn on a mission to assassinate the actual King Jerrod, Mileena kills him with a double sai throw to the chest when he was talking to Kitana.

Cocking used the \\"two Asian twin sisters, Mileena and Kitana,\\" as an example of a \\"highly eroticized dragon lady\\" trope, with Mileena's \\"Man-Eater\\" Fatality described as \\"a high-powered kiss that evokes vagina dentata.\\" The authors wrote that despite the inclusion of \\"characters of color\\" such as the two and Jax, \\"we cannot assume that this greater diversity represents a more progressive identity politics, for one could argue that it merely increases the racist and sexist potential of individual fights.\\"Patricia Marks Greenfield, Rodney R. Cocking, Interacting With Video, Greenwood Publishing Group 1996 (p.34). Critical studies professor Marsha Kinder similarly accused Mortal Kombat II of \\"allowing you to have a misogynistic aspect of combat,\\" alleging that \\"some of the most violent possibilities are against women,\\" whose own \\"fatality moves are highly eroticised.\\" Kinder singled out Mileena to describe how the character can kill her opponent \\"by sucking him in and spitting out his bones. Talk about Spider Woman!\\"\\"Women, of a sort, enter Mortal Kombat\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 29, 1995. Feminist-oriented criticism of the series and of Mileena's character in particular has continued in the following decades, eventually also in video game journalism.

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Spero lived for much of her life in New York City. She married and collaborated with, artist Leon Golub. As both artist and activist, Nancy Spero had a career that spanned fifty years. She is known for her continuous engagement with contemporary political, social, and cultural concerns. Spero chronicled wars and apocalyptic violence as well as articulating visions of ecstatic rebirth and the celebratory cycles of life. Her complex network of collective and individual voices was a catalyst for the creation of her figurative lexicon representing women from prehistory to the present in such epic-scale paintings and collage on paper as Torture of Women (1976), Notes in Time on Women (1979) and The First Language (1981). In 2010, Notes in Time was posthumously reanimated as a digital scroll in the online magazine Triple Canopy.\\"Notes in Time\\" Spero has had a number of retrospective exhibitions at major museums. Early years Spero was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1926. A year later her family moved to Chicago, where she grew up. After graduating from New Trier High School, she studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and graduated in 1949. Among Spero's peers at the Art Institute was a young GI who had returned from service in World War II, Leon Golub. Spero and Golub exhibited at the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago as part of the group the Monster Roster.Richard Vine, \\"Where the Wild Things Were\\", Art in America, May 1997, pp. 98-111. After graduating from the Art Institute of Chicago, Spero continued to study painting in Paris at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts and at the Atelier of Andre Lhote, an early Cubist painter, teacher and critic. Soon after her return to the United States in 1950, she married Leon Golub, and the two artists settled in Chicago. From 1956 to 1957, Spero and Golub lived and collaborated in Italy, while raising their three sons. Spero and Golub were equally committed to exploring a modernist representation of the human form, with its narratives and art historical resonances, even as Abstract Expressionism was becoming the dominant idiom. In Florence and Ischia, Spero became intrigued by the format, style and mood of Etruscan and Roman frescoes and sarcophagi which would have influence on her later work. Finding a more varied, inclusive and international atmosphere in Europe than in the New York art world of the time, Spero and her family moved to Paris, living there from 1959 to 1964. Spero's third son was born in Paris, and the artist had major solo exhibitions in Paris at Galerie Breteau in 1962, 1964, and 1968. During this period, Spero painted a series titled Black Paintings depicting themes including mothers and children, lovers, prostitutes, and hybrid, human-animal forms. This collection of works has a more personal meaning for her, rather than political. Later years Spero and Golub returned to New York in 1964, where the couple remained to live and work. The Vietnam War was raging and the Civil Rights Movement was exploding. Affected by images of the war broadcast nightly on television and the unrest and violence evident in the streets, Spero began her War Series from 1966‚Äì70. These small gouache and inks on paper, executed rapidly, represented the obscenity and destruction of war. The War Series is among the most sustained and powerful group of works in the genre of history painting that condemns war and its real and lasting consequences. An activist and early feminist, Spero was a member of the Art Workers Coalition (1968‚Äì69), Women Artists in Revolution (1969), and Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists (1971) the work of which developed into the first women's cooperative gallery, A.I.R. Gallery (Artists in Residence) in SoHo, of which she was a founding member. It was during this period that Spero completed her \\"Artaud Paintings\\" (1969‚Äì70), finding her artistic \\"voice\\" and developing her signature scroll paintings, the Codex Artaud (1971‚Äì1972), in which she directly quoted the writings of the poet and playwright Antonin Artaud. Uniting text and image, printed on long scrolls of paper, glued end-to-end and tacked on the walls of A.I.R., Spero violated the formal presentation, choice of valued medium and scale of framed paintings. Although her collaged and painted scrolls were Homeric in both scope and depth, the artist shunned the grandiose in content as well as style, relying instead on intimacy and immediacy, while also revealing the continuum of shocking political realities underlying enduring myths. In a 2008 interview in The Brooklyn Rail with publisher Phong Bui, Spero says of her early identification with Artaud: \\"For me, the spoken words were part of the body, as if whatever I was trying to paint, and my own awareness of pain and anger‚Äîyou can call it the destruction of the self‚Äîwas an integral part, that duality. Things get split up right in the middle, which I was very much interested in at that moment in my life.\\" In 1974, Spero chose to focus on themes involving women and their representation in various cultures. Her Torture in Chile (1974) and the long scroll, Torture of Women (1976, 20 inches x 125 feet), interweave oral testimonies with images of women throughout history, linking the contemporary governmental brutality of Latin American dictatorships (from Amnesty International reports) with the historical repression of women. Spero re-presented previously obscured women's histories, cultural mythology, and literary references with her expressive figuration. Rarely exhibited, Torture of Women was translated into book form in 2009.Torture of Women Siglio Press Spero manifested a desire for women to be a part of the art conversation. Spero's most mature work lives along the lines of a peinture feminine. This is when a women is the subject as well as the \\"artistic consciousness\\". Spero's open-ended, thought provoking compositions of ruthless uncomfortable subject matter was depicted in hangings and friezes. This is seen in Helicopter, Victim, Astronaut, made in 1968 of gouache and ink on paper. Spero uses the crimes and assaults on women from all eras and cultures to provide intense and emotional imagery for her art and text. Political violence, sexism, and life-threatening situations that women endure are subjects she explored throughout her career, but especially in the 1960s and 19702. These interests are evidence of Spero's conviction that \\"the personal and the political are indistinguishable.\\" Spero was influenced by Jean Dubuffet, Antonin Artaud, Simone de Beauvoir; and Helene Cixous. Developing a pictographic language of body gestures and motion, a bodily hieroglyphics, Spero reconstructed the diversity of representations of women from pre-history to the present. From 1976 through 1979, she researched and worked on Notes in Time on Women, a 20 inch by 210 foot paper scroll. She elaborated and amplified this theme in The First Language (1979‚Äì81, 20 inches by 190 feet), eschewing text altogether in favor of an irregular rhythm of painted, hand-printed, and collaged figures, thus creating her \\"cast of characters.\\" In 1983, Spero began using, in her large scroll paintings, an exuberantly vaginal female figure going by the name of Sheela-na-gig. The acknowledgement of Spero's international status as a preeminent figurative and feminist artist was signaled in 1987 by her traveling retrospective exhibitions in the United States and United Kingdom. By 1988, she developed her first wall installations. For these installations, Spero extended the picture plane of the scrolls by moving her printed images directly onto the walls of museums and public spaces. Harnessing a capacious imaginative energy and a ferocious will, Spero continued to mine the full range of power relations. In 1987, following retrospective exhibitions in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, the artist created images that leapt from the scroll surface to the wall surface, refiguring representational forms of women over time and engaging in a dialogue with architectural space. Spero's wall paintings in Chicago, Vienna, Dresden, Toronto, and Derry form poetic reconstructions of the diversity of representations of women from the ancient to the contemporary world, validating a subjectivity of female experience. Spero expressed her art once in this way: \\"I've always sought to express a tension in form and meaning in order to achieve a veracity. I have come to the conclusion that the art world has to join us, women artists, not we join it. When women are in leadership roles and gain rewards and recognition, then perhaps 'we' (women and men) can all work together in art world actions.\\" Nancy Spero died of heart failure in Manhattan on October 18, 2009.Cotter, Holland (October 19, 2009) \\"Nancy Spero, Artist of Feminism, Is Dead at 83\\", The New York Times.Searle, Adrian (October 20, 2009). \\"Nancy Spero's death means the art world loses its conscience\\", The Guardian.

Specifically, a space X is said to be first-countable if each point has a countable neighbourhood basis (local base). That is, for each point x in X there exists a sequence N1, N2, ‚Ä¶ of neighbourhoods of x such that for any neighbourhood N of x there exists an integer i with Ni contained in N. Since every neighborhood of any point contains an open neighborhood of that point the neighbourhood basis can be chosen without loss of generality to consist of open neighborhoods. Examples and counterexamples The majority of 'everyday' spaces in mathematics are first-countable. In particular, every metric space is first-countable. To see this, note that the set of open balls centered at x with radius 1/n for integers n > 0 form a countable local base at x. An example of a space which is not first-countable is the cofinite topology on an uncountable set (such as the real line). Another counterexample is the ordinal space œâ1+1 = [0,œâ1] where œâ1 is the first uncountable ordinal number. The element œâ1 is a limit point of the subset [0,œâ1) even though no sequence of elements in [0,œâ1) has the element œâ1 as its limit. In particular, the point œâ1 in the space œâ1+1 = [0,œâ1] does not have a countable local base. Since œâ1 is the only such point, however, the subspace œâ1 = [0,œâ1) is first-countable. The quotient space \\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{N} where the natural numbers on the real line are identified as a single point is not first countable. However, this space has the property that for any subset A and every element x in the closure of A, there is a sequence in A converging to x. A space with this sequence property is sometimes called a Fr√©chet-Urysohn space. First-countability is strictly weaker than second-countability. Every second-countable space is first- countable, but any uncountable discrete space is first-countable but not second-countable. Properties One of the most important properties of first-countable spaces is that given a subset A, a point x lies in the closure of A if and only if there exists a sequence {xn} in A which converges to x. (In other words, every first-countable space is a Fr√©chet-Urysohn space.) This has consequences for limits and continuity. In particular, if f is a function on a first-countable space, then f has a limit L at the point x if and only if for every sequence xn ‚Üí x, where xn ‚â† x for all n, we have f(xn) ‚Üí L. Also, if f is a function on a first-countable space, then f is continuous if and only if whenever xn ‚Üí x, then f(xn) ‚Üí f(x). In first-countable spaces, sequential compactness and countable compactness are equivalent properties. However, there exist examples of sequentially compact, first-countable spaces which are not compact (these are necessarily non-metric spaces). One such space is the ordinal space [0,œâ1). Every first-countable space is compactly generated. Every subspace of a first-countable space is first-countable. Any countable product of a first-countable space is first-countable, although uncountable products need not be.

CNN International carries news- related programming worldwide; it cooperates with parent network CNN's national and international news bureaus. Unlike its sister channel, CNN, a North American only subscription service which is mostly broadcast from CNN studios in New York City and Atlanta, CNN International is carried on a variety of TV platforms across the world, and mostly broadcast from studios outside the US, in London, Mumbai, Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi. In some countries, it is available as a free-to-air network. The service is aimed at the overseas market, similar to BBC World News, France 24, DW, RT, CGTN, NHK World or Al Jazeera English. History =Early years= CNN International logo from 1985 to 1995 CNN International, in large part a result of Ted Turner's globalization ideals, began broadcasting on September 1, 1985, at first primarily broadcasting to American business travelers in hotels. The first studio for CNNI was at CNN's original studio building known as Techwood, home at that time to all of Turner Broadcasting System's channels. Today, it is home to the Turner Studios complex that houses the entertainment channels. Other early studios in Atlanta were tucked away in various corners of the CNN Center, and the newsroom lacked even a digital clock. The vast majority of the network's programming originally consisted of simulcasts of the two domestic CNN channels (CNN/US and Headline News). In 1990, however, the amount of news programming produced by CNNI especially for international viewers increased significantly. A new newsroom and studio complex was built in 1994, as CNN decided to compete against BBC World Service Television's news programming. CNNI emerged as an internationally oriented news channel, with staff members of various national backgrounds, even though some accusations of a pro-U.S. editorial bias persist. CNN International was awarded the Liberty Medal on July 4, 1997. Ted Turner, in accepting the medal on behalf of the network, said: \\"My idea was, we're just going to give people the facts... We didn't have to show liberty and democracy as good, and show socialism or totalitarianism as bad. If we just showed them both the way they were ... clearly everybody's going to choose liberty and democracy.\\" =New international era (1995‚Äì2006)= CNN International logo from February 1, 1995, to December 31, 2005. In 1995, creative director Morgan Almeida defined a progressive rebranding strategy, to target CNNI's diverse global market, making the on-air look less overtly American and with a cleaner, simpler \\"international\\" aesthetic going forward. The word \\"International\\" in the channel's logo was replaced with a globe, and the new branding featured numerous international locations filmed in time-lapse, channel idents created in CGI with Velvet Design in Munich, and a news brand designed with The Attik in New York. =2006‚Äì2009 revamp= CNN International logo from January 1, 2006, to September 21, 2009. The network undertook another major rebranding effort in 2006 overseen by Mark Wright and London agency Kemistry. The ticker was replaced by a flipper, on-screen graphics were more unified and from October 2007 until August 2008, new studios were progressively rolled out. However, on January 1, 2009, CNN International adopted the \\"lower-thirds\\" that CNN/US had introduced a month earlier which were inspired by the clean modern design of the CNNI rebrand efforts. In the U.S., CNNI North America was distributed overnight and on weekends over the CNNfn financial channel, until that channel's demise in December 2004. It is now available as a standalone, full-time channel, usually as part of high-tier packages of subscription providers including Time Warner Cable, AT&T; U-Verse, Verizon FiOS and Cox Communications. =Going beyond borders (2009‚Äì2013)= Throughout January until September 2009, CNN International adapted more programs that became geared towards a primetime European audience with a few titled after CNN International personalities, most notably the interview program Amanpour. On September 21, 2009, the channel launched a new tagline \\"Go Beyond Borders\\", along with a new logo, and consolidated its general newscasts (World News, CNN Today, World News Asia, World News Europe and Your World Today) into a single newscast entitled World Report. The slogan \\"Go Beyond Borders\\" emphasizes the international perspective that gives the information in this string and the plurality of the audiences. With this tagline, CNN also refers to the various platforms to disseminate their contents. The new image was created by the creativity and marketing department, and agency CNN Tooth & Nail. An important element of the rebrand was a new evening program that adds the broadcast of programs Amanpour and World One. The makeover of CNN International has subject to a lot of criticism on both the new prime time lineup and the redesigned graphics. On January 11, 2009, in a bid to compete directly with Al Jazeera English, the network launched a new production center: CNN Abu Dhabi, based in the United Arab Emirates. Then, CNN International adapted half-hour shows in its schedule with a new evening prime program for Middle East viewers, Prism. In 2010, CNN International launched new programs for its evening lineup in order to improve its schedule. In 2011, programs from CNN U.S. were added to the CNN International schedule, including the talk program Piers Morgan Live which was later cancelled and replaced with CNN Tonight hosted by Don Lemon. CNN International logo from 2009 to 2014. =This is CNN (2013‚Äìpresent)= \\"This is CNN\\" represents CNN International's rebrand with new sets and output in full 16:9 high definition. The \\"This is CNN\\" slogan is also used on its sister network CNN in USA. The managing director of CNN International from 2003 to May 2019 was Tony Maddox.Why didn't CNN's international arm air its own documentary on Bahrain's Arab Spring repression? CNNi's president, Tony Maddox In 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs, with CNNI losing $10 million per year. Later that year, CNNI cancelled its Asia-Pacific Primetime Show, News Stream, anchored by Kristie Lu Stout, effectively ending production output from its Hong Kong Studios.CNN cancels News Stream in a ‚Äúpivot away from Asia‚Äù Regional and online versions There are seven variants of CNN International: * CNN International Asia Pacific, based in Hong Kong SAR, * CNN International Europe/Africa, based in London, United Kingdom * CNN International Latin America, based in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. * CNN International Middle East, based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates * CNN International North America, based in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. * CNN International South Asia, based in New Delhi, India The schedules of the different regional versions no longer differ significantly from each other, but there are still minor variations such as content during the commercial breaks (e.g. weather forecasts and local airtimes shown). CNN has reported that its broadcast agreement in mainland China includes an arrangement that its signal must pass through a Chinese-controlled satellite. With this method of transmission, Chinese authorities have been able to black out CNNI segments at will. CNN has also said that its broadcasts are not widely available in mainland China, but rather only in certain diplomatic compounds, hotels, and apartment blocks. In June 2015, CNN International was made available online in the United States for CNN/U.S subscribers on participating television providers through the CNNgo service. Simulcasts between CNNI and CNN/US Although dramatically scaled down since its early days, CNNI currently draws from the feed of the main CNN channel due to the COVID-19 pandemic for all editions of The Lead with Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper 360¬∞, Cuomo Prime Time, both hours of The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer and CNN Tonight with Don Lemon, the whole three hours of the weekday edition of New Day, several hours of the CNN/U.S. CNN Newsroom, the Sunday edition of Inside Politics, State of the Union, Fareed Zakaria GPS, Reliable Sources, Smerconish and some CNN Special Investigations Unit documentaries. The timepiece of CNN/US is replaced by that of CNNI, but no longer the ticker, and CNN/US's red logo on a white field is retained in the on-screen graphic (rather than replaced by CNNI's white logo on a red field), signifying CNN/US as the originating source. CNNI also simulcasts CNN/U.S. newscasts whenever major events happen in the United States or around the world. Examples include the death and funeral of Ronald Reagan, the crash of Continental Airlines Flight 3407 in the Buffalo suburb of Clarence Center, the Hudson River plane landing, the attempted Christmas Day bombing of flight 253 and the death and memorial service of Michael Jackson as well as scheduled broadcasts such as New Year's Eve Live and Election Night in America. Likewise, CNN/U.S. occasionally turns to CNNI newscasts, primarily when major international news breaks during overnight hours in the U.S. A notable case was during the death of Pope John Paul II and the aftermath of the London Underground bombings of July 7, 2005. CNN/U.S. simulcast CNNI coverage of the death of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on the night after her assassination took place. Simulcasts also happened from November 27 to 29, 2008, due to the terror attacks in Mumbai, India, on January 4, 2009, when Israel launched strikes into Gaza, and during the early hours of January 14, 2010, due to the earthquake in Haiti. From 2005 until early 2008, CNNI's Your World Today aired on CNN/U.S. during the 12‚Äì1 p.m. ET timeslot. That program was initially pre-empted by Issue #1, a program dealing in the American economic, financial, and housing sectors as part of the lead- up to the 2008 U.S. presidential election, and permanently replaced by another hour of CNN Newsroom in September 2008. During the Atlanta tornado outbreak in March 2008, CNN/U.S. and CNNI simulcasted coverage after Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ ended. That coverage ended around 12:36 a.m. EDT and the channels resumed their normal programming. Furthermore, the next day, with storms impending, CNN/U.S. had to move onto CNNI's U.S. news set and weather center to avoid water from possible flooding during the storms. On January 17, 2011, CNN/U.S. dropped its early morning rebroadcasts of ParkerSpitzer and Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ during the 4‚Äì6 a.m. ET time period, and began to simulcast World Business Today and World One from CNNI in those slots. Both newscasts are the only programs broadcast entirely in 4:3 fullscreen frames on CNN/U.S.' standard- definition and high-definition feeds (the SD feed of CNN/US switched to a widescreen letterbox screen format on January 11, 2011). World One was dropped from CNN/U.S. just a few months later to allow the addition of an extra hour of American Morning which has been replaced with Early Start. As of August 2014, following the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, a permanent simulcast of CNNI's block of Newsroom with Rosemary Church and Errol Barnett was added to the late-night lineup of CNN/U.S., serving as a lead-in to Early Start. In late 2015, John Vause and anchor Isha Sesay began to anchor a two-hour block of the simulcast from CNN studios in Los Angeles. In 2017, CNN International began simulcasting the first hour of the weekday edition of New Day and on September 10, 2018, The Lead with Jake Tapper started to be simulcast on CNNI.CNN refreshes European schedule In 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs. Consequently, an additional two hours of simulcasts with CNN/U.S. on weekdays were added - the first hour of Early Start and the second hour of New Day, resulting in CNNI broadcasting CNN/U.S. for seven hours each weekday. By mid- April 2020, due to the impact of Covid-19 on CNN's operation, CNN/U.S. weekday programming accounted for 14 hours within each 24 hour cycle of CNN International broadcasting time, with CNN International's daily worldwide programming in Europe consisting of five hours of the international version of CNN Newsroom, from 5a.m. - 10a.m. GMT, and four internationally focused programs: First Move with Julia Chatterley and Connect the World with Becky Anderson between the hours of 1p.m. ‚Äî 4p.m. GMT; with Amanpour and Quest Means Business, between 6p.m. ‚Äî 8p.m. GMT. Each of those internationally focused programmes air for one hour each, except Connect the World, which airs for two hours and if live news events are slated to happen during Amanpour's timeslot, that show may air at a different time. Weekend simulcasts of CNN/U.S. were increased with CNN/U.S.'s live news output shown in full at the time. Apart from between from 5a.m. - 11a.m GMT when editions of the international version of CNN Newsroom were aired alongside magazine programmes, CNN International only showed its own programming - consisting of magazine programmes - when CNN/US was broadcasting repeat showings of programmes it had aired earlier that day. As at September 2020, live weekend domestic programming on CNN International has been somewhat reduced to accommodate newer editions of magazine programmes.

Prior to June 3, 2013, only programming from CNN/U.S. was available natively in HD, while shows made for CNN International were produced in 4:3 576i. In February 2013, the European SD feed of CNN International began broadcasting in widescreen by downscaling the HD feed, which resulted in all 4:3-native programming being broadcast in pillarbox until the June 3 switchover, finalising on June 17 of the same year, when the switchover was completed. Following the March 2003 launch of CNNj, a live relay of CNN/U.S. and CNN International, with simultaneous audio translation into Japanese, starting in late 2010, the high definition feed of CNN/U.S. was launched in Japan under the name CNN HD.http://www.jctv.co.jp/images/press101108.pdf CNN/U.S. (both SD and HD) is also available on Greater China-based satellite service DishHD, a subsidiary of Dish Network in the United States. On June 28, 2016, CNN International HD was launched for Sky customers in the UK (including on Freesat from Sky), on channel 506 or 579, making the next news channel launch in the 600s, as it is next to the GOD Channel. The HD version is available free-to-air within the British Isles, and is provided on satellite and IPTV services, and also live-streamed for U.K. users (and geo-blocked outside the U.K.), through CNN International's official U.K. video site. However, viewers with non-proprietary Freesat boxes will need to add the channel manually as Freesat does not market CNN International HD publicly as part of its offerings. Online CNN debuted its news website CNN.com (initially an experiment known as CNN Interactive) on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, social media and user-generated content have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late 2005. In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S. according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year. CNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or \\"pipes\\"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up \\"news alerts\\" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows. There was also a browser-based \\"web client\\" that did not require installation. In July 2007, the service was discontinued and replaced with a free streaming service. The now-defunct topical news program Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005. Blog coverage was expanded when Inside Politics was folded into The Situation Room. In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech shootings sent-in first hand photos of what was going during the shootings. In early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to those who receive CNN at home. CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the RealNetworks SuperPass subscription outside the U.S. CNN also offers several RSS feeds and podcasts. On April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the 2008 Tibetan unrest. CNN reported that they took preventive measures after news broke of the impending attack.Claburn, Thomas: \\"CNN Faces Cyberattack Over Tibet Coverage\\" InformationWeek, 2008 The company was honored at the 2008 Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital newsgathering system. On October 24, 2009 CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website, revamping it adding a new \\"sign up\\" option where users may create their own user name, a new \\"CNN Pulse\\" (beta) feature along with a new red color theme. However, most of the news archived on the website has been deleted. CNN also has a channel in the popular video-sharing site YouTube, but its videos can only be viewed in the United States, a source of criticism among YouTube users worldwide. In April 2010, CNN announced via Twitter its upcoming food blog called \\"Eatocracy,\\" in which it will \\"cover all news related to food ‚Äì from recalls to health issues to culture.\\" CNN had an internet relay chat (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with Benjamin Netanyahu on the network in 1998. CNN also maintains a wire service known as CNN Wire. Bureaus CNN bureau locations The CNN Center in Atlanta.

These tables have since been removed. = Accusations of US-centric viewpoint = Former CNN Beijing and Tokyo bureau chief Rebecca MacKinnon described how the news- gathering priorities of CNN International were skewed to \\"produce stories and reports that would be of interest to CNN USA.\\" Nevertheless, Jane Arraf, a former correspondent who was with the Council on Foreign Relations and later served as a Middle East-based correspondent for Al Jazeera English, noted that when she spoke on international affairs, CNN International would usually give her more airtime than CNN/US. For its own part, former CNN executive Eason Jordan has defended CNN International's \\"international\\" perspective, saying \\"No matter what CNN International does, as long as CNN's headquarters is in the United States people are going to say, well, it's an American service. But the reality is that it's an international service based in the United States, and we don't make any apologies about that.\\" = Accusations of anti-Israel bias = In 2002, Honest Reporting spearheaded a campaign to expose CNN for pro-Palestinian bias, citing public remarks in which Ted Turner equated Palestinian suicide bombing with Israeli military strikes. On November 18, 2014, a misleading headline was posted by CNN. Two Palestinian terrorists had entered a synagogue with knives and a gun, killing four Jewish worshippers and wounding seven. The headline stated instead that two Palestinian were killed by Israeli police, thus equating the perpetrators of the massacre of Jews with the killing of the armed terrorists. The headline failed to mention the four Jews who were murdered in this 2014 Jerusalem synagogue attack. CNN stated that the attack occurred at a mosque, when in fact the synagogue was attacked, compounding the bias.CNN apologizes for bias, Hollywoodreporter.com; accessed November 21, 2014. = Accusations of pro-American bias = CNN is one of the world's largest news organizations, and its international channel, CNN International is the leading international news channel in terms of viewer reach. Unlike the BBC and its network of reporters and bureaus, CNN International makes extensive use of affiliated reporters that are local to, and often directly affected by, the events they are reporting. The effect is a more immediate, less detached style of on-the-ground coverage. This has done little to stem criticism, largely from Middle Eastern nations, that CNN International reports news from a pro-American perspective. This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a \\"liberal\\" or \\"anti-American\\" bias. = Accusations of anti-China bias = A Chinese website, anti-cnn.com, has accused CNN and western media in general of biased reporting against China, with the catchphrase \\"Don't be so CNN\\" catching on in the Chinese mainstream as jokingly meaning \\"Don't be so biased\\". Pictures used by CNN are allegedly edited to have completely different meanings from the original ones. In addition, the channel was accused of largely ignoring pro- China voices during the Olympic Torch Relay debacle in San Francisco. = Accusations of propaganda and censorship = In October 2011, Amber Lyon claimed to the Syrian government news agency SANA that she had been directed by CNN to report selectively, repetitively, and falsely in order to sway public opinion in favor of direct American aggression against Iran and Syria, and that this was common practice under CNN. She subsequently repeated this claim, addressing the degraded state of journalistic ethics in an interview during which she also discussed the Bahraini episode, suggesting paid-for content was also taken from Georgia, Kazakhstan, and other states, that the War on Terrorism had also been employed as a pretext to pre-empt substantive investigative journalism within the U.S., and that following the Bahrain reporting, her investigative department had been terminated and \\"reorganized\\", and her severance and employee benefits used as a threat to intimidate and attempt to purchase her subsequent silence. Lyon claimed to have met with Tony Maddox, president of CNN International, twice about this issue in 2011 and had claimed that during the second meeting she was threatened and intimated to stop speaking on the matter. CNN issued a detailed response to Lyon's claims about its coverage of Bahrain. Lyon also claimed on the Russian news channel RT that CNN reporters, headed by Maddox, have been instructed to over-cover Iran as a form of propaganda, and that CNN International has been paid by the Bahraini government to produce and air news segments intentionally painting them in a positive light. = Other dismissals = On July 7, 2010, Octavia Nasr, senior Middle East editor and a CNN journalist for 20 years, was fired after she expressed admiration on her Twitter account for a militant Muslim cleric and former Hezbollah leader who had recently died.

Avcraft operated from a 136,000 sq ft complex of hangars, paint facilities and back shops that provide FAA, EASA and Transport Canada-approved heavy maintenance, as well as structural repairs, modifications and refurbishment. History The company began its life as AvCraft Support Services, Inc., the North American operating subsidiary of Avcraft Inc. The parent company purchased the production rights for the 328JET from the receivers of Fairchild Dornier GmbH in December 2002 following the European company's demise. The final transfers of the type and production certificates were completed in the third quarter of 2003. The company intended to restart 328Jet production in Germany during 2004 and was bringing the production of its wing, formerly outsourced, in-house. By August 2004, AvCraft Inc. had re-entered the regional airline market and was entering the corporate aircraft market, placing previously unsold Dornier product with a number of customers. It exhibited at the 2004 Farnborough Airshow and joined major industry associations. However, in March, 2005, the company went into administration citing a lack of cash caused, it claimed, by an airline failing to accept delivery of completed aircraft. AvCraft Support Services continued to operate while under company administration, initially focusing exclusively on MRO support for the Fairchild Dornier 328 family, operating from a facility at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In September 2009 AvCraft Support Services entered into a joint venture agreement with Indaer International, a commercial aircraft technical services company with offices in Colombia and Canada. The joint venture initially targeted heavy maintenance on ATR regional turboprops and then expanded to include Dash 8 aircraft too. In September 2010 Indaer International led a group of investors that purchased AvCraft Support Services out of administration, renaming it AvCraft Technical Services. In the summer of 2015, AvCraft filed for bankruptcy, laying off all remaining employees and closing down. Capabilities AvCraft holds US, European, Canadian and Venezuelan approvals to provide MRO services in their 136,000 sq. ft. facility and 500,000 sq. ft. of ramp space. The company is ideally situated in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, AvCraft can easily provide easy access to North American, South American, Caribbean and European customers.

V. annabella occurs throughout much of the western US and southwestern Canada. The other two species are the cosmopolitan Vanessa cardui (painted lady) and the eastern Vanessa virginiensis (American painted lady). This species has also been considered a subspecies of the South American, Vanessa carye, and is frequently misspelled as \\"anabella\\". Distinguishing features Schematic of standard wing terminology Aside from general differences in distribution, V. annabella can be distinguished from the other two painted ladies of North America as follows: Most conspicuously, it lacks obvious ventral eyespots on the hindwings; there are two large ones on V. virginiensis and four small ones on V. cardui. Like the latter, it also lacks a white dot in the pinkish-orange subapical field of the ventral and dorsal forewings. Its upperwing coloration has the purest orange of the three; the American painted lady is usually quite reddish. A less reliable indicator is the row of black eyespots on the dorsal submarginal hindwing. These are usually of roughly equal size in V. cardui and lack blue centers, though the summer morph may have a few tiny ones. In the other two, usually two eyespots are larger and have more conspicuous blue centers. In V. virginiensis, these normally are the spot at each end of the row, whereas in the present species it is the two middle ones.

They may also burn or sting. Often the patches of rash move around. Typically they last a few days and do not leave any long-lasting skin changes. Fewer than 5% of cases last for more than six weeks. The condition frequently recurs. Hives frequently occur following an infection or as a result of an allergic reaction such as to medication, insect bites, or food. Psychological stress, cold temperature, or vibration may also be a trigger. In half of cases the cause remains unknown. Risk factors include having conditions such as hay fever or asthma. Diagnosis is typically based on the appearance. Patch testing may be useful to determine the allergy. Prevention is by avoiding whatever it is that causes the condition. Treatment is typically with antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and ranitidine. In severe cases, corticosteroids or leukotriene inhibitors may also be used. Keeping the environmental temperature cool is also useful. For cases that last more than six weeks immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin may be used. About 20% of people are affected. Cases of short duration occur equally in males and females while cases of long duration are more common in females. Cases of short duration are more common among children while cases of long duration are more common among those who are middle aged. Hives have been described at least since the time of Hippocrates. The term urticaria is from the Latin urtica meaning \\"nettle\\". Signs and symptoms Hives on the left chest wall. Notice that they are slightly raised.Hives Drawing of hives Hives, or urticaria, is a form of skin rash with red, raised, itchy bumps. They may also burn or sting. Welts (raised areas surrounded by a red base) from hives can appear anywhere on the surface of the skin. Whether the trigger is allergic or not, a complex release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine from cutaneous mast cells, results in fluid leakage from superficial blood vessels. Welts may be pinpoint in size or several inches in diameter. Often the patches of rash move around. About 20% of people are affected. Cases of short duration occur equally in males and females, lasting a few days and without leaving any long-lasting skin changes. Cases of long duration are more common in females. Cases of short duration are more common among children while cases of long duration are more common among those who are middle aged. Fewer than 5% of cases last for more than six weeks. The condition frequently recurs. In half of cases of hives, the cause remains unknown. Angioedema is a related condition (also from allergic and nonallergic causes), though fluid leakage is from much deeper blood vessels in the subcutaneous or submucosal layers. Individual hives that are painful, last more than 24 hours, or leave a bruise as they heal are more likely to be a more serious condition called urticarial vasculitis. Hives caused by stroking the skin (often linear in appearance) are due to a benign condition called dermatographic urticaria. Cause Hives can also be classified by the purported causative agent. Many different substances in the environment may cause hives, including medications, food and physical agents. In perhaps more than 50% of people with chronic hives of unknown cause, it is due to an autoimmune reaction. Risk factors include having conditions such as hay fever or asthma. =Medications= Drugs that have caused allergic reactions evidenced as hives include codeine, sulphate of morphia, dextroamphetamine, aspirin, ibuprofen, penicillin, clotrimazole, trichazole, sulfonamides, anticonvulsants, cefaclor, piracetam, vaccines, and antidiabetic drugs. The antidiabetic sulphonylurea glimepiride, in particular, has been documented to induce allergic reactions manifesting as hives. =Food= The most common food allergies in adults are shellfish and nuts. The most common food allergies in children are shellfish, nuts, eggs, wheat, and soy. One study showed Balsam of Peru, which is in many processed foods, to be the most common cause of immediate contact urticaria. A less common cause is exposure to certain bacteria, such as Streptococcus species or possibly Helicobacter pylori. =Infection or environmental agent= Hives including chronic spontaneous hives can be a complication and symptom of a parasitic infection, such as blastocystosis and strongyloidiasis among others. The rash that develops from poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac contact is commonly mistaken for urticaria. This rash is caused by contact with urushiol and results in a form of contact dermatitis called urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. Urushiol is spread by contact but can be washed off with a strong grease- or oil-dissolving detergent and cool water and rubbing ointments. =Dermatographic urticaria= Dermatographic urticaria (also known as dermatographism or \\"skin writing\\") is marked by the appearance of weals or welts on the skin as a result of scratching or firm stroking of the skin. Seen in 4‚Äì5% of the population, it is one of the most common types of urticaria, in which the skin becomes raised and inflamed when stroked, scratched, rubbed, and sometimes even slapped. The skin reaction usually becomes evident soon after the scratching and disappears within 30 minutes. Dermatographism is the most common form of a subset of chronic hives, acknowledged as \\"physical hives\\". It stands in contrast to the linear reddening that does not itch seen in healthy people who are scratched. In most cases, the cause is unknown, although it may be preceded by a viral infection, antibiotic therapy, or emotional upset. Dermographism is diagnosed by taking a tongue blade and drawing it over the skin of the arm or back. The hives should develop within a few minutes. Unless the skin is highly sensitive and reacts continually, treatment is not needed. Taking antihistamines can reduce the response in cases that are annoying to the person. =Pressure or delayed pressure= This type of hives can occur right away, precisely after a pressure stimulus or as a deferred response to sustained pressure being enforced to the skin. In the deferred form, the hives only appear after about six hours from the initial application of pressure to the skin. Under normal circumstances, these hives are not the same as those witnessed with most urticariae. Instead, the protrusion in the affected areas is typically more spread out. The hives may last from eight hours to three days. The source of the pressure on the skin can happen from tight fitted clothing, belts, clothing with tough straps, walking, leaning against an object, standing, sitting on a hard surface, etc. The areas of the body most commonly affected are the hands, feet, trunk, abdomen, buttocks, legs and face. Although this appears to be very similar to dermatographism, the cardinal difference is that the swelled skin areas do not become visible quickly and tend to last much longer. This form of the skin disease is, however, rare. =Cholinergic or stress= Cholinergic urticaria (CU) is one of the physical urticaria which is provoked during sweating events such as exercise, bathing, staying in a heated environment, or emotional stress. The hives produced are typically smaller than classic hives and are generally shorter-lasting. Multiple subtypes have been elucidated, each of which require distinct treatment. =Cold-induced= The cold type of urticaria is caused by exposure of the skin to extreme cold, damp and windy conditions; it occurs in two forms. The rare form is hereditary and becomes evident as hives all over the body 9 to 18 hours after cold exposure. The common form of cold urticaria demonstrates itself with the rapid onset of hives on the face, neck, or hands after exposure to cold. Cold urticaria is common and lasts for an average of five to six years. The population most affected is young adults, between 18 and 25 years old. Many people with the condition also suffer from dermographism and cholinergic hives. Severe reactions can be seen with exposure to cold water; swimming in cold water is the most common cause of a severe reaction. This can cause a massive discharge of histamine, resulting in low blood pressure, fainting, shock and even loss of life. Cold urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing an ice cube against the skin of the forearm for 1 to 5 minutes. A distinct hive should develop if a person suffers cold urticaria. This is different from the normal redness that can be seen in people without cold urticaria. People with cold urticaria need to learn to protect themselves from a hasty drop in body temperature. Regular antihistamines are not generally efficacious. One particular antihistamine, cyproheptadine (Periactin), has been found to be useful. The tricyclic antidepressant doxepin has been found to be effective blocking agents of histamine. Finally, a medication named ketotifen, which keeps mast cells from discharging histamine, has also been employed with widespread success. =Solar urticaria= This form of the disease occurs on areas of the skin exposed to the sun; the condition becomes evident within minutes of exposure. =Water-induced= This type of urticaria is also termed rare and occurs upon contact with water. The response is not temperature-dependent and the skin appears similar to cholinergic form of the disease. The appearance of hives is within one to 15 minutes of contact with the water and can last from 10 minutes to two hours. This kind of hives does not seem to be stimulated by histamine discharge like the other physical hives. Most researchers believe this condition is actually skin sensitivity to additives in the water, such as chlorine. Water urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing tap water and distilled water to the skin and observing the gradual response. Aquagenic urticaria is treated with capsaicin (Zostrix) administered to the chafed skin. This is the same treatment used for shingles. Antihistamines are of questionable benefit in this instance since histamine is not the causative factor. =Exercise= The condition was first distinguished in 1980. People with exercise urticaria (EU) experience hives, itchiness, shortness of breath and low blood pressure five to 30 minutes after beginning exercise. These symptoms can progress to shock and even sudden death. Jogging is the most common exercise to cause EU, but it is not induced by a hot shower, fever, or with fretfulness. This differentiates EU from cholinergic urticaria. EU sometimes occurs only when someone exercises within 30 minutes of eating particular foods, such as wheat or shellfish. For these individuals, exercising alone or eating the injuring food without exercising produces no symptoms. EU can be diagnosed by having the person exercise and then observing the symptoms. This method must be used with caution and only with the appropriate resuscitative measures at hand. EU can be differentiated from cholinergic urticaria by the hot water immersion test. In this test, the person is immersed in water at 43 ¬∞C (109.4 ¬∞F). Someone with EU will not develop hives, while a person with cholinergic urticaria will develop the characteristic small hives, especially on the neck and chest. The immediate symptoms of this type are treated with antihistamines, epinephrine and airway support. Taking antihistamines prior to exercise may be effective. Ketotifen is acknowledged to stabilise mast cells and prevent histamine release, and has been effective in treating this hives disorder. Avoiding exercise or foods that cause the mentioned symptoms is very important. In particular circumstances, tolerance can be brought on by regular exercise, but this must be under medical supervision. Pathophysiology The skin lesions of urticarial disease are caused by an inflammatory reaction in the skin, causing leakage of capillaries in the dermis, and resulting in an edema which persists until the interstitial fluid is absorbed into the surrounding cells. Hives are caused by the release of histamine and other mediators of inflammation (cytokines) from cells in the skin. This process can be the result of an allergic or nonallergic reaction, differing in the eliciting mechanism of histamine release. = Allergic hives = Histamine and other proinflammatory substances are released from mast cells in the skin and tissues in response to the binding of allergen-bound IgE antibodies to high- affinity cell surface receptors. Basophils and other inflammatory cells are also seen to release histamine and other mediators, and are thought to play an important role, especially in chronic urticarial diseases. = Autoimmune hives = Over half of all cases of chronic idiopathic hives are the result of an autoimmune trigger. Roughly 50% of people with chronic urticaria spontaneously develop autoantibodies directed at the receptor FcŒµRI located on skin mast cells. Chronic stimulation of this receptor leads to chronic hives. People with hives often have other autoimmune conditions, such as autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus. = Infections = Hive-like rashes commonly accompany viral illnesses, such as the common cold. They usually appear three to five days after the cold has started, and may even appear a few days after the cold has resolved. = Nonallergic hives= Mechanisms other than allergen-antibody interactions are known to cause histamine release from mast cells. Many drugs, for example morphine, can induce direct histamine release not involving any immunoglobulin molecule. Also, a diverse group of signaling substances called neuropeptides, have been found to be involved in emotionally induced hives. Dominantly inherited cutaneous and neurocutaneous porphyrias (porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria) have been associated with solar urticaria. The occurrence of drug-induced solar urticaria may be associated with porphyrias. This may be caused by IgG binding, not IgE. = Dietary histamine poisoning = This is termed scombroid food poisoning. Ingestion of free histamine released by bacterial decay in fish flesh may result in a rapid-onset, allergic-type symptom complex which includes hives. However, the hives produced by scombroid is reported not to include wheals. = Stress and chronic idiopathic hives = Chronic idiopathic hives has been anecdotally linked to stress since the 1940s. A large body of evidence demonstrates an association between this condition and both poor emotional well-being and reduced health-related quality of life. A link between stress and this condition has also been shown. A recent study has demonstrated an association between stressful life events (e.g. bereavement, divorce, etc.) and chronic idiopathic urticaria and also an association between post-traumatic stress and chronic idiopathic hives. Diagnosis Micrograph of urticaria. Dermal edema [solid arrows in (A,B)] and a sparse superficial predominantly perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils without signs of vasculitis (dashed arrow). Diagnosis is typically based on the appearance. The cause of chronic hives can rarely be determined. Patch testing may be useful to determine the allergy. In some cases regular extensive allergy testing over a long period of time is requested in hopes of getting new insight. No evidence shows regular allergy testing results in identification of a problem or relief for people with chronic hives. Regular allergy testing for people with chronic hives is not recommended. =Acute versus chronic= * urticaria is defined as the presence of evanescent wheals which completely resolve within six weeks. Acute urticaria becomes evident a few minutes after the person has been exposed to an allergen. The outbreak may last several weeks, but usually the hives are gone in six weeks. Typically, the hives are a reaction to food, but in about half the cases, the trigger is unknown. Common foods may be the cause, as well as bee or wasp stings, or skin contact with certain fragrances. Acute viral infection is another common cause of acute urticaria (viral exanthem). Less common causes of hives include friction, pressure, temperature extremes, exercise, and sunlight. * urticaria (ordinary urticaria) is defined as the presence of evanescent wheals which persist for greater than six weeks. Some of the more severe chronic cases have lasted more than 20 years. A survey indicated chronic urticaria lasted a year or more in more than 50% of sufferers and 20 years or more in 20% of them. Acute and chronic hives are visually indistinguishable. =Related conditions= Angioedema Angioedema is similar to hives, but in angioedema, the swelling occurs in a lower layer of the dermis than in hives, as well as in the subcutis. This swelling can occur around the mouth, eyes, in the throat, in the abdomen, or in other locations. Hives and angioedema sometimes occur together in response to an allergen, and is a concern in severe cases, as angioedema of the throat can be fatal. Vibratory angioedema This very rare form of angioedema develops in response to contact with vibration. In vibratory angioedema, symptoms develop within two to five minutes after contact with a vibrating object and abate after about an hour. People with this disorder do not suffer from dermographism or pressure urticaria. Vibratory angioedema is diagnosed by holding a vibrating device such as a laboratory vortex machine against the forearm for four minutes. Speedy swelling of the whole forearm extending into the upper arm is also noted later. The principal treatment is avoidance of vibratory stimulants. Antihistamines have also been proven helpful. Management The mainstay of therapy for both acute and chronic hives is education, avoiding triggers and using antihistamines. Chronic hives can be difficult to treat and lead to significant disability. Unlike the acute form, 50‚Äì80% of people with chronic hives have no identifiable triggers. But 50% of people with chronic hives will experience remission within 1 year. Overall, treatment is geared towards symptomatic management. Individuals with chronic hives may need other medications in addition to antihistamines to control symptoms. People who experience hives with angioedema require emergency treatment as this is a life-threatening condition. Treatment guidelines for the management of chronic hives have been published. According to the 2014 American practice parameters, treatment involves a stepwise approach. Step 1 consists of second generation, H1 receptor blocking antihistamines. Systemic glucocorticoids can also be used for episodes of severe disease but should not be used for long term due to their long list of side effects. Step 2 consists of increasing the dose of the current antihistamine, adding other antihistamines, or adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist such as montelukast. Step 3 consists of adding or replacing the current treatment with hydroxyzine or doxepin. If the individual doesn't respond to steps 1‚Äì3 then they are considered to have refractory symptoms. At this point, anti-inflammatory medications (dapsone, sulfasalazine), immunosuppressants (cyclosporin, sirolimus) or other medications like omalizumab can be used. These options are explained in more detail below. =Antihistamines= Non-sedating antihistamines that block histamine H1 receptors are the first line of therapy. First-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine, block both brain and peripheral H1 receptors, and cause sedation. Second-generation antihistamines, such as loratadine, cetirizine or desloratadine, selectively antagonize peripheral H1 receptors, and are less sedating, less anticholinergic, and generally preferred over the first-generation antihistamines. Fexofenadine, a new-generation antihistamine that blocks histamine H1 receptors, may be less sedating than some second-generation antihistamines. People who do not respond to the maximum dose of H1 antihistamines may benefit from increasing the dose, then to switching to another non-sedating antihistamine, then to adding a leukotriene antagonist, then to using an older antihistamine, then to using systemic steroids and finally to using ciclosporin or omalizumab. H2-receptor antagonists are sometimes used in addition to H1-antagonists to treat urticaria, but there is limited evidence for their efficacy. =Systemic steroids= Oral glucocorticoids are effective in controlling symptoms of chronic hives however they have an extensive list of adverse effects such as adrenal suppression, weight gain, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, etc. Therefore, their use should be limited to a couple of weeks. In addition, one study found that systemic glucocorticoids combined with antihistamines did not hasten the time to symptom control compared with antihistamines alone. =Leukotriene- receptor antagonists= Leukotrienes are released from mast cells along with histamine. The medications, montelukast and zafirlukast block leukotriene receptors and can be used as add on treatment or in isolation for people with CU. It is important to note that these medications may be more beneficial for people with NSAID induced CU. =Other= Other options for refractory symptoms of chronic hives include anti-inflammatory medications, omalizumab, and immunosuppressants. Potential anti-inflammatory agents include dapsone, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine. Dapsone is a sulfone antimicrobial agent and is thought to suppress prostaglandin and leukotriene activity. It is helpful in therapy-refractory cases and is contraindicated in people with G6PD deficiency. Sulfasalazine, a 5-ASA derivative, is thought to alter adenosine release and inhibit IgE mediated mast cell degranulation, Sulfasalazine is a good option for people with anemia who cannot take dapsone. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent that suppresses T lymphocytes. It has a low cost however it takes longer than dapsone or sulfasalazine to work. Omalizumab was approved by the FDA in 2014 for people with hives 12 years old and above with chronic hives. It is a monoclonal antibody directed against IgE. Significant improvement in pruritus and quality of life was observed in a phase III, multicenter, randomized control trial. Immunosuppressants used for CU include cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and mycophenolate. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, inhibit cell responsiveness to mast cell products and inhibit T cell activity. They are preferred by some experts to treat severe symptoms. Sirolimus and mycophenolate have less evidence for their use in the treatment of chronic hives but reports have shown them to be efficacious. Immunosuppressants are generally reserved as the last line of therapy for severe cases due to their potential for serious adverse effects. Research Afamelanotide is being studied as a hives treatment. Opioid antagonists such as naltrexone have tentative evidence to support their use. History The term urticaria was first used by the Scottish physician William Cullen in 1769.Volcheck, Gerald W. (2009) Clinical Allergy Diagnosis and Management. London: Springer. It originates from the Latin word urtica, meaning stinging hair or nettle, as the classical presentation follows the contact with a perennial flowering plant Urtica dioica. The history of urticaria dates back to 1000‚Äì2000 BC with its reference as a wind-type concealed rash in the book The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic from Huangdi Neijing. Hippocrates in the 4th century first described urticaria as \\"knidosis\\" after the Greek word knido for nettle.McGovern TW, Barkley TM (2000). The electronic textbook of Dermatology.

Col. Nathaniel Burwell (1750‚Äì1814). Carter Hall was launched on 4 March 1943 by Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, sponsored by Mrs. T. Wilson; and commissioned on 18 September 1943, Lieutenant Commander F. J. Harris, USNR, in command. Operational history = World War II = Carter Hall sailed from San Francisco 12 October 1943 with cargo and passengers for Brisbane, Australia. She arrived at her next port, Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 26 November to act as receiving ship, tender, and supply ship for small craft there and at Buna until 10 May 1944. During this period, she took part in the invasion landings at Cape Merkus, Arawe, New Britain on 15 December 1943, where valuable experience in the use of newly developed landing craft was gained. Upon the invasion of Aitape and Tanahmerah Bay late in April, Carter Hall once again launched laden landing craft, and stood by the invaded beaches to service small craft, remaining in the area until 2 May 1944. Carter Hall underway in the Coral Sea, 25 November 1943. Carter Hall arrived at Guadalcanal on 12 May 1944 for amphibious training, then sailed to Kwajalein to stand by in case she should be needed during the invasion of Saipan. Her services not required for that assault, she sailed on to Eniwetok and final preparations for the smashing return to Guam, where she arrived 21 July, the day of the initial assault. She remained off the island, supporting the operation through servicing small craft, until 26 July. The dock landing ship returned to Hollandia on 29 August, and from 11 September to 1 October supported the operations at Morotai. Carter Hall sailed from Hollandia on 12 October 1944 with the Palo Attack Group of the Northern Attack Force, bound for the landings on Red Beach near Tacloban, San Pedro Bay, Philippines on 20 October. Working efficiently in the apparent chaos that concealed the intricate, smoothly meshed landing plans, Carter Hall's men carried out their key role both in landing their craft and in caring for small craft through 24 October, when she made her retirement as the Battle of Leyte Gulf raged nearby. Her participation in the Leyte operation continued as she carried cargo from New Guinea on a series of runs until 17 November. From then until 30 December, she was stationed in San Pedro Bay as tender and supply ship for landing craft. Overhauled at Oakland, California, between 31 January and 4 April 1945, Carter Hall returned to Subic Bay on 1 May to transport small craft, and to take part in the invasions at Brunei Bay, 10 to 16 June, and Balikpapan, 1 to 4 July. She remained at Leyte drydocking small craft until 6 September, when she sailed for Jinsen, Korea, carrying LCMs and picket boats for use in the occupation of Korea. Occupation duty at Shanghai and Sasebo continued until 9 April 1946, when Carter Hall cleared for San Francisco. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at San Diego 12 February 1947. = 1951‚Äì1956 = LSM-175 about to enter the well of Carter Hall in San Diego Bay, Spring 1951. Recommissioned 26 January 1951 for duty in the Atlantic Fleet, Carter Hall arrived at her home port, Norfolk, Virginia, on 11 June 1951. Until 7 January 1955, she operated on training, salvage, and fleet exercises, as well as a tour with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean from January through May 1953. Prior to the Mediterranean cruise, she operated in support of construction of the Defensive Early Warning system off Hebron, Labradore and briefly visited Greenland, crossing the Arctic Circle at 1431, latitude 66'30\\"N and in longitude 52'03\\"W on 22 July 1952.

He was also a noted calligrapher and prominent political thinker and reformer of the late Qing dynasty. Through his connections, he became close to the young Guangxu Emperor and fervently encouraged him to promote his friends and consequently soured the relationship between the emperor and his adoptive mother, the powerful Empress Dowager Cixi. His ideas inspired a reformation movement, the Hundred Days' Reform. Although he continued to advocate a constitutional monarchy after the founding of the Republic, Kang's political theory was never put into practice as he was forced to flee China for repeated attempts to assassinate the Empress Dowager Cixi. He was an ardent Chinese nationalist and internationalist. Early life Kang was born on 19March 1858 in Nanhai County, Guangdong province (now the Nanhai District of Foshan City). According to his autobiography, his intellectual gifts were recognized in his childhood by his uncle. As a result, from an early age, he was sent by his family to study the Confucian classics to pass the Chinese civil service exams. However, as a teenager, he was dissatisfied with the scholastic system of his time, especially its emphasis on preparing for the eight-legged exams, which were artificial literary exercises required as part of the examinations. Studying for exams was an extraordinarily rigorous activity so he engaged in Buddhist meditation as a form of relaxation, an unusual leisurely activity for a Chinese scholar of his time. It was during one of these meditations that he had a mystical vision that became the theme for his intellectual pursuits throughout his life. Believing that it was possible to read every book and \\"become a sage\\", he embarked on a quasi-messianic pursuit to save humanity. Biography Kang called for an end to property and the family in the interest of an idealized future cosmopolitan utopia and cited Confucius as an example of a reformer and not as a reactionary, as many of his contemporaries did. The latter idea was discussed in great detail in his work Kongzi Gaizhi Kao (Â≠îÂ≠êÊîπÂà∂Êî∑), or Study of the Reforms of Confucius. He argued, to bolster his claims that the rediscovered versions of the Confucian classics were forged, as he treated in detail in Xinxue weijing kao‚Äô‚ÄôÔºàÊñ∞Â≠¶‰º™ÁªèËÄÉÔºâ (A Study of the Classics Forged during the Xin Dynasty [9‚Äì23 C.E.]). Kang was a strong believer in constitutional monarchy and wanted to remodel the country after Meiji Japan. These ideas angered his colleagues in the scholarly class who regarded him as a heretic. Kang and his noted student, Liang Qichao, were important participants in a campaign to modernize China now known as the Hundred Days' Reform. The reforms introduced radical change into the stale Chinese government, many of which were already being implemented. By most popular historical accounts, the Empress Dowager ended the reforms and ordered Kang executed by slow slicing. Kang also organized the Protect the Emperor Society, which claimed that the weak emperor was being unduly locked up for his role in the assassination attempt on his adoptive mother/aunt. Kang relied on his principal American military advisor, General Homer Lea to head the military branch of the Protect the Emperor Society. Kang even traveled throughout the Chinese diaspora, supposedly to promote constitutional monarchy but mostly to promote his own self-interest. He competed with the revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen's Revive China Society and Revolutionary Alliance for funds and followers. He visited India twice, first in 1901‚Äì1903 and then again in October 1909, in part to study India, which he regarded as comparable to China. Although his information about Indian history was derived from English authors, he observed that India's plight as a colonised country was due to the disunity among the different regions of India. Kang Youwei‚Äôs Journey to India: Chinese Discourse on India During the Late Qing and Republican Periods, Liu Xi, CHINA REPORT 48 : 1&2 (2012): 171‚Äì185 The Xinhai Revolution led to the abdication of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of a Republic under Sun Yat-sen in 1912. Some advocated that a Han be installed as Emperor, either the descendant of Confucius, who was the Duke Yansheng, which Kang briefly endorsed before dropping the idea and returning to the idea of a Qing monarch, or the Ming dynasty Imperial family descendant, the Marquis of Extended Grace. Kang remained an advocate of constitutional monarchy and launched a failed coup d'√©tat in 1917. General Zhang Xun and his queue-wearing soldiers occupied Beijing, declaring a restoration of Emperor Puyi on July1. The incident was a major miscalculation. The nation was highly anti-monarchist. Kang became suspicious of Zhang's insincere constitutionalism and feared he was merely using the restoration to become the power behind the throne. He abandoned his mission and fled to the American legation. On July 12, Duan Qirui easily occupied the city. Kang's reputation serves as an important barometer for the political attitudes of his time. In the span of less than twenty years, he went from being regarded as an iconoclastic radical to an anachronistic pariah. Da Tongshu Kang's best-known and probably most controversial work is Da Tong shu (Â§ßÂêåÊõ∏). The title of the book derives from the name of a utopian society imagined by Confucius, but it literally means \\"The Book of Great Unity\\". The ideas of this book appeared in his lecture notes from 1884. Encouraged by his students, he worked on this book for the next two decades, but it was not until his exile in India that he finished the first draft. The first two chapters of the book were published in Japan in the 1900s, but the book was not published in its entirety until 1935, about seven years after his death. Dmitry E. Martynov,\\"Edward Bellamy and Kang Youwei's utopian society: Comparative analyses.\\" Journal of Sustainable Development 8.4 (2015): 233. Kang proposed a utopian future world free of political boundaries and democratically ruled by one central government. In his scheme, the world would be split into rectangular administrative districts, which would be self- governing under a direct democracy but loyal to a central world government. There would also be the dissolution of racial boundaries. Kang outlines an immensely ambitious eugenics program that would eliminate the \\"brown and black\\" racial phenotype after a millennia and lead to the emergence of a fair- skinned homogeneous human race whose members would \\"be the same color, the same appearance, the same size, and the same intelligence\\". Tang Poem: Returning Home As An Unrecognized Old Man, Nantoy≈çs≈ç Collection, Japan Kang Youwei, circa 1920 His desire to end the traditional Chinese family structure defines him as an early advocate of women's independence in China. He reasoned that the institution of the family practiced by society since the beginning of time was a great cause of strife. Kang hoped it would be effectively abolished. The family would be replaced by state-run institutions, such as womb-teaching institutions, nurseries and schools. Marriage would be replaced by one-year contracts between a woman and a man.Kang Youwei 2010, Datong Shu, Beijing: Renmin chubanshe, p.310. Kang considered the contemporary form of marriage, in which a woman was trapped for a lifetime, to be too oppressive. Kang believed in equality between men and women and that there should be no social barrier barring women from doing whatever men can do. Kang saw capitalism as an inherently evil system. He believed that government should establish socialist institutions to overlook the welfare of each individual. At one point, he even advocated that government should adopt the methods of \\"communism\\" although it is debated what Kang meant by this term. He was surely one of the first advocates of Western communism in China. In this spirit, in addition to establishing government nurseries and schools to replace the institution of the family, he also envisioned government-run retirement homes for the elderly. It is debated whether Kang's socialist ideas were inspired more by Western thought or by traditional Confucian ideals. Lawrence G. Thompsom believes that his socialism was based on traditional Chinese ideals. His work is permeated with the Confucian ideal of ren (‰ªÅ), or humanity. However, Thompson also noted a reference by Kang to Fourier. Thus, some Chinese scholars believe that Kang's socialist ideals were influenced by Western intellectuals after his exile in 1898. Notable in Kang's Da Tong Shu were his enthusiasm for and his belief in bettering humanity through technology, unusual for a Confucian scholar during his time. He believed that Western technological progress had a central role in saving humanity. While many scholars of his time continued to maintain the belief that Western technology should be adopted only to defend China against the West, he seemed to whole-heartedly embrace the modern idea that technology is integral for advancing mankind. Before anything of modern scale had been built, he foresaw a global telegraphic and telephone network. He also believed that as a result of technological advances, each individual would only need to work three or four hours per day, a prediction that would be repeated by the most optimistic futurists later in the 20th century. When the book was first published, it was received with mixed reactions. Kang's support for the Guangxu Emperor was seen as reactionary by many Chinese intellectuals, who believed that Kang's book was an elaborate joke and that he was merely acting as an apologist for the emperor as to how a utopian paradise could have developed if the Qing dynasty had been maintained. Others believe that Kang was a bold and daring protocommunist, who advocated modern Western socialism and communism. Amongst the latter was Mao Zedong, who admired Kang Youwei and his socialist ideals in the Da Tongshu. Modern Chinese scholars now often take the view that Kang was an important advocate of Chinese socialism. Despite the controversy, Da Tongshu still remains popular. A Beijing publisher included it on the list of 100 most influential books in Chinese history. Philosophical views Kang enumerated sources of human suffering in a way similar to that of Buddhism.Dmitry E. Martynov, \\"Edward Bellamy and Kang Youwei's utopian society: Comparative analyses.\\" Journal of Sustainable Development 8.4 (2015): 233. The sufferings associated with man's physical life are being implanted in the womb, premature death, loss of a limb, being a barbarian, living outside China, being a slave and being a woman. The sufferings associated with natural disasters are famine resulting from flood or drought, epidemic, conflagration, flood, volcanic eruptions, collapse of buildings, shipwreck and locust plagues. The sufferings associated with the human relationship are being a widow, being orphaned or childless, being ill with no one to provide medical care, suffering poverty and having a low and mean station in life. The sufferings associated with society are corporal punishment and imprisonment, taxation, military conscription, social stratification, oppressive political institutions, the existence of the state and the existence of the family. The human feelings which cause suffering are stupidity, hatred, fatigue, lust, attachment to things and desire. The things that cause suffering because of the esteem in which they are held are wealth, eminent position, longevity, being a ruler and being a spiritual leader. He also imagined a hierarchy of religions, in which Christianity and Islam were the lowest, above them being Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. He predicted that in the future the lower religions would disappear.\\"The One-World Philosophy of K'ang Yu-Wei\\" by Shri O. K.

The army's occupation of Prairie du Chien spanned the existence of two fortifications, both of them named Fort Crawford. The first of was occupied from 1816‚Äì1832, the second from 1832 - 1856. Both of the forts formed part of a string of fortifications along the upper Mississippi River that also included Fort Snelling near Saint Anthony Falls in Minnesota, and Fort Armstrong in Rock Island, Illinois. Fort Crawford was also associated with a string of forts built along the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway, which included Fort Winnebago in Portage, Wisconsin and Fort Howard in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The site of the second fort has been preserved and holds the Fort Crawford Museum, located in the Second Fort Crawford Military Hospital. This is a 1930s reconstruction of the hospital serving the second fort. This building contains the only surviving building fragments of either fort, and it was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1960. First Fort Crawford The U.S. Army established a presence in Prairie du Chien during the War of 1812, when it built Fort Shelby on St. Feriole Island in the Mississippi River, which was part of the town separated by a marshy bayou. On July 19, 1814, Fort Shelby was captured by British forces and renamed Fort McKay. The British would continue to occupy Prairie du Chien until 1815, after the Treaty of Ghent restored the pre-war border between the United States and British Canada. When the British retreated from the city, they burned Fort McKay rather than give it back to the Americans. Footings of the first fort can be seen just north of the Villa Louis. The blockhouse in upper right is a reconstruction.To protect Prairie du Chien against future invasion, U.S. forces returned in June 1816, with orders to construct a new fort on the site of Fort McKay. This fort was named Fort Crawford in honor of William H. Crawford, the Secretary of War under James Madison. Built entirely of wood except for the magazine, the fort measured 343 ft on each side and included Blockhouses at its northwest and southeast corners. Construction of the fort lasted through the summer of 1816. Following the completion of Fort Crawford, the garrison was engaged primarily in peacekeeping between the new white settlers arriving in the region and the region's historic Native American tribes. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Leavenworth, a former U.S. Indian Agent, was among the early commanders at the fort. The United States conducted several negotiations with American Indians at Fort Crawford during the 1820s. One of the largest Indian councils in U.S. history was held at the fort in 1825, when over 5000 representatives of nearly a dozen Native American nations gathered to discuss and sign the first Treaty of Prairie du Chien. Because of the first Fort Crawford's location alongside the Mississippi River, diseases such as malaria and dysentery were common among the troops. They did not understand the role of mosquitoes and sanitation in these diseases. In addition, the fort's wooden walls rotted because of seasonal flooding that took place nearly every spring. The post took meteorological observations in 1822. In 1826, after a major flood, the garrison at Fort Crawford was ordered to leave Prairie du Chien and reinforce Fort Snelling in Minnesota. During 1827, while no troops remained in Prairie du Chien, a group of hostile Winnebago Indians led by chief Red Bird murdered a family of settlers near the abandoned fort. This incident was the start of the Winnebago War of 1827. The federal government ordered the return of soldiers to Prairie du Chien. Shortly afterward, the Army decided that the first Fort Crawford was no longer habitable. In 1828 a decision was made to build a new fort on higher ground. Maj. Stephen W. Kearny, commanding officer at the time, surveyed the area and chose a site for the new fort upon a hill near the Mississippi River's eastern bank. Second Fort Crawford A painting of the Second Fort Crawford, circa 1840 The construction of the second Fort Crawford began in 1829 under the direction of the new commander, Col. Zachary Taylor, later elected as President of the United States. The new fort's location on the mainland in Prairie du Chien was much more floodproof. In addition, to make the fort more weather-proof, it was decided to construct the structure using quarried limestone rather than wood. Use of this material and delays in federal funding resulted in delays to complete the new fort; it was not finished until 1835. Troops in Prairie du Chien were unable to fully occupy the new fort's barracks until 1832, and in the meantime remained at the first Fort Crawford. Army surgeon Dr. William Beaumont did his best to keep the troops healthy. Beaumont would later achieve fame for a series of experiments on human digestion which he conducted at locations across the United States. Fifty-six of these experiments were conducted at Fort Crawford hospital, and allowed Beaumont to draw conclusions on the effects of temperature and emotion on the digestive process. As the second fort's barracks were being completed in 1832, the Black Hawk War broke out in Illinois, and the troops at Fort Crawford were called to defend pioneer settlements. After the Battle of Bad Axe near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, Chief Black Hawk surrendered to Col. Zachary Taylor at Fort Crawford. Black Hawk was imprisoned at the fort until he was escorted by Lt. Jefferson Davis to St. Louis, Missouri. Davis, who had been assigned to Fort Crawford in 1831, was later elected as President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. While assigned to Fort Crawford, Davis met and fell in love with Sarah Knox Taylor, the daughter of his commanding office Zachary Taylor. Colonel Taylor disapproved of the relationship between Davis and his daughter, as he felt the life of an Army officer was too hard on wives and families. In 1834 Davis was reassigned to Fort Gibson in Oklahoma. Shortly afterward, Davis resigned his commission in order to pursue his relationship with Sarah in Prairie du Chien. Upon discovering that Zachary Taylor still would not consent to their marriage, the couple eloped to Kentucky, where Davis married Sarah Taylor in 1835. The surviving portion of the Second Fort Crawford in March 1864 During the 1840s the garrison at Fort Crawford was assigned to build a road between Fort Crawford and Fort Winnebago in Portage. The route they chose for the road is now followed by U.S. Highway 18 eastward from Prairie du Chien towards Madison, Wisconsin over Military Ridge, which is so named because of the military road which followed its crest. After the road was completed and the Winnebago Tribe was relocated from Wisconsin to Minnesota, the fort had little use. It was abandoned in 1849. In 1855 Fort Crawford was reoccupied when rumors circulated of an impending uprising among the remaining Native Americans, but no such event occurred. Troops left the fort for the last time on June 9, 1856. During the American Civil War, the fort housed part of the Swift United States Army General Hospital. Fort Crawford Museum Ruins of the Fort Crawford hospital, 1903. This building was reconstructed and is now used as a museum. Except during the American Civil War, when the fort was used as both a recruitment center and hospital for Union soldiers, Fort Crawford was left unoccupied between 1856 and 1933. In 1933, the Daughters of the American Revolution began work on reconstructing a portion of the fort's hospital, while clearing away the remaining parts of the dilapidated fort to allow for other development. In the 1960s, the reconstructed fort hospital was transformed into a museum of medical history called the Fort Crawford Museum of Medical Progress. The museum featured exhibits on the experiments by Dr. Beaumont and other medical innovations. It was operated by the Wisconsin Medical Society until 1995. In 1996, the museum was donated to the Prairie du Chien Historical Society. It was converted into a museum of local history, called the Prairie du Chien Museum at Fort Crawford. While the fort's hospital, which is registered as a National Historic Landmark, still houses exhibits related to Dr. Beaumont and medical history, adjacent buildings are now filled with exhibits on other aspects of Prairie du Chien history.

These cells transport water and nutrients throughout the plant. Sap is distinct from latex, resin, or cell sap; it is a separate substance, separately produced, and with different components and functions. Insect honeydew is called sap, particularly when it falls from trees, but is only the remains of eaten sap and other plant parts.  Types of sap  Sap droplets of Sansevieria trifasciata Saps may be broadly divided into two types: xylem sap and phloem sap. =Xylem sap= Xylem sap (pronounced ) consists primarily of a watery solution of hormones, mineral elements and other nutrients. Transport of sap in xylem is characterized by movement from the roots toward the leaves. Over the past century, there has been some controversy regarding the mechanism of xylem sap transport; today, most plant scientists agree that the cohesion-tension theory best explains this process, but multiforce theories that hypothesize several alternative mechanisms have been suggested, including longitudinal cellular and xylem osmotic pressure gradients, axial potential gradients in the vessels, and gel- and gas-bubble-supported interfacial gradients. Xylem sap transport can be disrupted by cavitation‚Äîan \\"abrupt phase change [of water] from liquid to vapor\\"‚Äîresulting in air-filled xylem conduits. In addition to being a fundamental physical limit on tree height, two environmental stresses can disrupt xylem transport by cavitation: increasingly negative xylem pressures associated with water stress, and freeze-thaw cycles in temperate climates. =Phloem sap= Phloem sap (pronounced ) consists primarily of sugars, hormones, and mineral elements dissolved in water. It flows from where carbohydrates are produced or stored (sugar source) to where they are used (sugar sinks). The pressure flow hypothesis proposes a mechanism for phloem sap transport, although other hypotheses have been proposed. Phloem sap is thought to play a role in sending informational signals throughout vascular plants. According to Annual Review of Plant Biology, Leafhoppers feeding on sap, attended by ants Many insects of the order Hemiptera (the half-wings), feed directly on phloem sap, and make it the primary component of their diet. Phloem sap is \\"nutrient-rich compared with many other plant products and generally lacking in toxins and feeding deterrents, [yet] it is consumed as the dominant or sole diet by a very restricted range of animals\\". This apparent paradox is explained by the fact that phloem sap is physiologically extreme in terms of animal digestion, and it is hypothesized that few animals take direct advantage of this because they lack two adaptations that are necessary to enable direct use by animals. These include the existence of a very high ratio of non-essential/essential amino acids in phloem sap for which these adapted Hemiptera insects contain symbiotic microorganisms which can then provide them with essential amino acids; and also insect \\"tolerance of the very high sugar content and osmotic pressure of phloem sap is promoted by their possession in the gut of sucrase-transglucosidase activity, which transforms excess ingested sugar into long-chain oligosaccharides.\\" A much larger set of animals do however consume phloem sap by proxy, either \\"through feeding on the honeydew of phloem-feeding hemipterans. Honeydew is physiologically less extreme than phloem sap, with a higher essential:non- essential amino acid ratio and lower osmotic pressure,\\" or by feeding on the biomass of insects that have grown on more direct ingestion of phloem sap. Human uses Maple syrup is made from reduced sugar maple xylem sap. The sap often is harvested from the sugar maple, Acer saccharum. In some countries (e.g., Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Belarus, Russia) harvesting the early spring sap of birch trees (so called \\"birch juice\\") for human consumption is common practice; the sap can be used fresh or fermented and contains xylitol. Certain palm tree sap can be used to make palm syrup. In the Canary Islands they use the Canary Island date palm while in Chile they use the Chilean wine palm to make their syrup called miel de palma.

It may have a neurological, psychological or psychosomatic cause. A person with functional constipation may be healthy, yet has difficulty defecating. Symptoms and diagnosis Chronic idiopathic constipation is similar to constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C); however, people with CIC do not have other symptoms of IBS, such as abdominal pain.Americal College of Gastroenterology: Fuinctional Bowel Disorders Diagnosing CIC can be difficult as other syndromes must be ruled out as there is no physiological cause for CIC. Doctors will typically look for other symptoms, such as blood in stool, weight loss, low blood count, or other symptoms. To be considered functional constipation, symptoms must be present at least a fourth of the time. Possible causes are: * Anismus * Descending perineum syndrome * Other inability or unwillingness to control the external anal sphincter, which normally is under voluntary control * A poor diet * An unwillingness to defecate * Nervous reactions, including prolonged and/or chronic stress and anxiety, that close the internal anal sphincter, a muscle that is not under voluntary control * Deeper psychosomatic disorders which sometimes affect digestion and the absorption of water in the colon There is also possibility of presentation with other comorbid symptoms such as headache, especially in children. Treatment Treatment options appear similar and include prucalopride, lubiprostone, linaclotide, tegaserod, velusetrag, elobixibat, bisacodyl, sodium picosulphate, and most recently, plecanatide. Research A 2014 meta-analysis of three small trials evaluating probiotics showed a slight improvement in management of chronic idiopathic constipation, but well-designed studies are necessary to know the true efficacy of probiotics in treating this condition. Children with functional constipation often claim to lack the sensation of the urge to defecate, and may be conditioned to avoid doing so due to a previous painful experience. One retrospective study showed that these children did indeed have the urge to defecate using colonic manometry, and suggested behavioral modification as a treatment for functional constipation.

It was a training base during World War II. From 1951 to 1975, it was a front line Strategic Air Command (SAC) base during the Cold War and Vietnam War. It was Orlando's biggest employer and economic backbone prior to the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971. With McCoy's closure as an active USAF facility in 1975, the site was redeveloped and is known today as Orlando International Airport, which continues to carry the base's original FAA LID airport code of MCO (i.e., McCoy) and ICAO airport code of KMCO. Over the course of its existence the installation had several names, including Orlando Army Air Field #2, Pinecastle Army Airfield, and Pinecastle Air Force Base.  History  McCoy Air Force Base was named for Colonel Michael Norman Wright McCoy (1905‚Äì1957) on 7 May 1958. Col McCoy was killed on 9 October 1957 in the crash of a B-47 Stratojet (DB-47B-35-BW), AF Ser. No. 51-2177, of the 447th Bomb Squadron, 321st Bombardment Wing, which suffered wing failure northwest of downtown Orlando, Florida while taking part in a practice demonstration during the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing Navigation and Reconnaissance Competition at Pinecastle AFB, Florida. McCoy was the aircraft commander during the flight and the mishap aircraft was one of two at Pinecastle that had been modified to carry the GAM-63 RASCAL air-to-surface missile. At the time of his death, McCoy was serving as the commander of the 321st Bombardment Wing, the host wing of Pinecastle AFB. A hugely popular figure in Central Florida, Colonel McCoy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in a funeral that included a flyover of multiple B-47s. = World War II = 1947 aerial photo of Pinecastle Army Airfield The facility originally was built in 1940 as a replacement civilian airport after the takeover and conversion of the Orlando Municipal Airport (present day Orlando Executive Airport) to Orlando Army Air Base by the U.S. Army Air Corps. However, with the expansion of Orlando AAB following establishment of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) in 1942, the new civilian airport was also leased by the now-renamed U.S. Army Air Forces, initially being designated as Orlando Army Air Field #2 and becoming a sub-base of Orlando AAB. On 1 January 1943, it was renamed as Pinecastle Army Airfield. Pinecastle AAF was intended to support the training mission of Orlando AAB. Two bomb squadrons of the 9th Bombardment Group at Orlando AAB, the 5th, equipped with B-24 Liberators and the 99th, with B-25 Mitchells, B-26 Marauders and B-17 Flying Fortresses, operated from Pinecastle during the war. The squadrons had the mission of training future combat aircrews for a wide variety of bombing missions in advanced combat techniques. In addition to the training mission, beginning in 1943, Pinecastle AAF was used as the AAFSAT Technical Center, operating an Air Force General Maintenance and Supply Depot facility. On 1 June 1944, the 901st Army Air Forces Base Unit (Heavy Bombardment), took over the bomber training mission with two squadrons, \\"G\\" and \\"H\\". Records indicate that aircraft from Pinecastle AAF performed test bombing of chemical munitions at one of Pinecastle's numerous bombing and gunnery ranges. It is uncertain whether the chemical warfare materials used in these tests were stored at Pinecastle Army Airfield or transported from the Orlando Toxic Gas and Decontamination Yard at Orlando AAB a few hours before a practice bombing run. With the drawdown and closure of wartime airfields after the German capitulation in May 1945, units from other bases in Florida were consolidated at Pinecastle AAF. On 1 July 1945, jurisdiction of the field was transferred to Air Proving Ground Command at Eglin Field, Florida. The 901st AAFBU was inactivated and replaced by the 621st Base Unit. =Postwar years= In August 1945, under the Proving Ground Command (PGC), the base was used for testing of the B-32 Dominator bomber, although operations in 1945 at the field were severely curtailed due to personnel shortages caused by post-war demobilization. Weapons tests of the VB-6 Felix infrared heat seeking and VB-3 Razon radio-controlled gliding bombs were also carried out. Beginning in January 1946, Bell Aircraft Corporation tested its X-1 supersonic aircraft, originally designated the XS-1, at the airfield because of the area's then-remote location and 10,000-foot runway. In March 1946, the X-1 program was relocated to Muroc AAF, California. The move was a logistics issue as much as anything, as Pinecastle was deemed not suitable for the X-1 project. A move to the remote California desert ensured the X-1 project team could maintain secrecy, an important issue considering the project was highly classified at the time. In addition, Muroc had an expansive landing area, thanks to the surrounding dry lakebeds, and better visibility. The X-1's high sink rate and the problems of keeping the plane in sight amid Florida's frequent clouds also added two more votes in favor of the Army Air Force's decision to go to Muroc. This aircraft, later flown by then- Captain (Brigadier General, USAF, Retired) Chuck Yeager, would be the first aircraft in history to successfully exceed the speed of sound in level flight. With the X-1 project transferred, Pinecastle AAF was closed and the entire site was transferred to the City of Orlando in 1947 with a reversal clause for future military use if deemed to be necessary for national defense purposes. =Cold War= Air Training Command As a result of the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States Air Force's Air Training Command (ATC) reacquired and reactivated the facility, renaming it Pinecastle Air Force Base on 1 September 1951. ATC immediately began a $100 million military construction (MILCON) program at the World War II facility, to include lengthening the existing north/south runway and constructing a parallel north/south runway, both over 12,000 feet in length. Actual flight training operations, however, did not begin until early 1952. The 3540th Flying Training Wing (later redesignated the 4240th Flying Training Wing) was activated at the base for the purpose of training personnel in Strategic Air Command's (SAC) new Boeing B-47 Stratojet medium jet bomber. Eighty-four B-47s were allocated for the training, and SAC transferred thirty experienced aircraft commanders to Pinecastle to serve as instructors. According to the basic plan, ATC would train forty-nine crews by the end of 1952. But from the beginning, mechanical problems with the B-47 and a lack of equipment prevented training. In addition, the base was inadequate at the time with regards to training facilities. The first B-47 class arrived at the base on 6 November 1952 and the first B-47 crew training program started a few weeks later when Class 53-6A entered combat crew training on 22 December 1952. The first trained B-47 crews graduated from training during the first half of 1953. On 1 January 1954, Air Training Command transferred both the B-47 crew training mission at Pinecastle AFB and jurisdiction of the base to the Strategic Air Command.  321st Bombardment Wing and 19th Bombardment Wing Postcard from Pinecastle AFB in the mid-1950s, showing the Pinecastle AFB control tower and a Boeing B-47E-90-BW Stratojet, AF Ser. No. 52-0477, of the 321st Bomb Wing on the ramp. This B-47 was sent to AMARC in November 1964. The control tower would continue to be used by McCoy AFB and as the first control tower for Orlando International Airport. On 15 December 1953, the 321st Bombardment Wing (Medium) was activated at Pinecastle AFB, absorbing all B-47 bombers and KC-97 tankers at the base. The B-47 combat crew training mission was also transferred from ATC to SAC. Colonel Michael N.W. McCoy, previously commander of the 306th Bombardment Wing at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, was appointed commander of the 321st Bombardment Wing on 24 May 1954, having earned the unofficial distinction of being the \\"dean\\" of the Strategic Air Command's B-47 \\"Stratojet\\" aircraft commanders. In July 1954, the 19th Bombardment Wing joined the 321st at Pinecastle AFB and the two units came under the control of the 813th Strategic Aerospace Division.813th Strategic Aerospace Division The 813th was subsequently inactivated in the summer of 1956 when the 19th Bomb Wing moved to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. In November 1957, the base was host to the medium and heavy bombers participating in the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing Navigation and Reconnaissance Competition. During the competition, a B-47 aircraft mishap north of downtown Orlando took the lives of Colonel McCoy, Group Captain John Woodroffe of the Royal Air Force, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Joyce, and Major Vernon Stuff during preparations for the event. Despite this tragedy, the 321st Bomb Wing, under the direction of its new commander, Colonel Robert W. Strong, Jr., won the top honors of the meet, including the coveted Fairchild and McCoy trophies, distinguishing the 321st as the top B-47 Wing in SAC. 76th Fighter Interceptor Squadron Another distinguished unit assigned to Pinecastle AFB in November 1957 was the Air Defense Command's 76th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (76 FIS).[https://web.archive.org/web/20101219051128/http://www.peterson.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4808 A descendant of the famous World War II \\"Flying Tigers,\\" the 76 FIS was commanded by Major Morris F. Wilson and flew the F-89H \\"Scorpion\\" all-weather fighter-interceptor. One of the last squadrons to fly the Scorpion, the 76 FIS was transferred from McCoy to Westover AFB, Massachusetts on 1 February 1961. McCoy AFB On 7 May 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed McCoy Air Force Base in memory of the late Colonel Michael N. W. McCoy. Formal dedication ceremonies were held on 21 May 1958 in conjunction with a mammoth base open house, during which an estimated 30,000 Floridians attended. In the summer of 1961, a complete reorganization of the base began in order to convert the base from the B-47 Stratojet medium jet bomber to the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress heavy bomber. As part of this program, the 321st Bomb Wing began phasing out its operations in June 1961 and was inactivated in October 1961.  4047th Strategic Wing  Postcard from McCoy AFB in the early 1960s, showing the McCoy AFB control tower and base operations building, Boeing B-52D-5-BW Stratofortress, AF Ser. No. 55-5054, and Boeing KC-135A-BN Stratotanker, AF Ser. No. 57-1506, of the 4047th Strategic Wing. On 1 July 1961, the 321st was replaced by the 4047th Strategic Wing (Heavy), which was designated and organized under its first commander, Col Francis S. Holmes, Jr. The 4047th was part of SAC's \\"Strategic Wing\\" concept, which was to disperse its medium and heavy bombers and tanker aircraft over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. All of the Strategic Wings had one squadron of B-52s, containing 15 aircraft, and most also had a squadron of fifteen KC-135 tanker aircraft. Half of the bombers and tankers were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled, armed, and ready for combat, while the remainder were used for training in bombardment missions and air refueling operations. In August 1961, the first B-52D Stratofortresses were assigned to the new wing, and on 1 September 1961 the 347th Bombardment Squadron was reassigned from Westover AFB, Massachusetts to McCoy AFB as the wing's operational flying squadron for the heavy bombers. On 15 September, the 321st Combat Support Group was also organized and on that same date Colonel William G. Walker, Jr., assumed command of the 4047th Strategic Wing.  966th Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron  USAF EC-121D Warning Star, AF Ser. No. 53-0536, of the 551st AEW&CW; at Otis AFB The 966th Airborne Early Warning & Control Squadron was activated on 18 December 1961 and was organized two months later at McCoy AFB as a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing at Otis AFB, Massachusetts. While at McCoy, the squadron flew the propeller-driven EC-121 Warning Star radar surveillance aircraft in its EC-121D and EC-121Q variants. The squadron changed its parent wing on 1 May 1963, coming under the 552nd Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, headquartered at McClellan AFB, California. The mission of the 966th Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron covered a broad spectrum of responsibilities. As an Air Defense Command,(later Aerospace Defense Command) (ADC) unit, the 966th also supported Strategic Air Command and Tactical Air Command (TAC) operations, assisted U.S. Navy P-2 Neptune and P-3 Orion aircraft in anti-submarine and maritime surveillance patrols, and developed weather information. It also furnished airborne radar surveillance and technical control in support of global air defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff contingency operations. 966th aircrews also frequently deployed to distant operational locations including Southeast Asia. The squadron was inactivated on 31 December 1969, although detachments from other EC-121 squadrons would continue to operate at McCoy AFB throughout the early 1970s. Joint Civil-Military Use: McCoy AFB and the Orlando-McCoy Jetport In the early 1960s, the then-Orlando Herndon Airport began to start providing commercial jet service. However, its World War II era 6,000-foot runways were dangerously short to handle the new Boeing 707, Convair 880 and Douglas DC-8 commercial passenger jets. In addition, the air terminal built in 1951 was inadequate to accommodate the increasing number of passengers. McCoy Air Force Base, with its two 12,000-foot runways, was more than capable of safely accommodating the passenger jets. In 1962 an agreement was worked out between the Air Force and the City of Orlando for the joint-use of one of the runways (18L/36R) for airline operations, and the purchase of two former AGM-28 Hound Dog missile storage hangars in the northeast corner of the installation by the City for conversion into a passenger air terminal for use by Delta, Eastern, and National Airlines. The Orlando-McCoy Jetport opened in 1964, with Delta Air Lines being the first airline to offer jet passenger service to the new Orlando-McCoy Jetport with Delta's DC-8 Fanjet aircraft. By 1968, all airline operations had moved from Herndon Airport to the new Orlando-McCoy Jetport. With the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971, the amount of air traffic increased substantially, especially with Boeing 727, Boeing 737 and Douglas DC-9 aircraft. As a result, the agreement with the Air Force was amended to allow for an expansion of the civil airport facilities. Additional acreage was provided to Orlando east of the airfield in 1972 and two modern airport terminals were constructed between 1978 and 1981, along with improved parking and other infrastructure. With the improved civil airport at McCoy, the new wide-body Boeing 747, Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar airliners began scheduled service.Orlando International Airport History  Cuban Missile Crisis  On 14 October 1962, a Lockheed U-2 from the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas piloted by Major Richard S. Heyser, USAF, launched from Edwards AFB, California for a high altitude reconnaissance flight over Cuba. Arriving over the island an hour after sunrise, Heyser photographed the Soviet military installing nuclear armed SS-4 medium range and SS-5 intermediate range ballistic missiles in Cuba, thereby precipitating the Cuban Missile Crisis. Heyser concluded this flight at McCoy AFB and the 4080th subsequently established a U-2 operating location at McCoy AFB, launching and recovering numerous flights over Cuba for the duration of the crisis. On 21 October, Attorney General of the United States Robert F. Kennedy; United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Maxwell Taylor, USA; and General Walter C. Sweeney, Jr., USAF met with President John F. Kennedy concerning a military contingency plan regarding this development. The 4080th's operating location at McCoy AFB, designated OL-X, operated two U-2 aircraft and flew at least 82 missions over Cuba from McCoy AFB from 22 October ‚Äì 6 December 1962. General Sweeney, as Commander of Tactical Air Command (TAC), proposed an operational plan which first called for an air attack on the surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites in the vicinity of known medium range (MRBM) and intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) launchers by eight fighter-bombers per SAM site. Concurrently, each of the Cuban MiG airfields thought to be protecting MRBM/IRBM sites were to be struck by at least twelve fighters. Following the air strikes on SAM sites and MiG fighter airfields, each MRBM and IRBM launch site was to be attacked by at least twelve aircraft. General Sweeney's plan was accepted and, additionally, Cuban Ilyushin Il-28 \\"Beagle\\" medium bomber airfields were added to the target list. To support this plan, the USAF deployed the following TAC units to McCoy AFB while simultaneously dispersing the 4047th Strategic Wing's B-52 and KC-135 aircraft: * 4th Tactical Fighter Wing: 67 F-105Bs (Deployed from Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina) * 354th Tactical Fighter Wing: 63 F-100D/Fs (Deployed from Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina) * 427th Air Refueling Squadron: 20 KB-50Js (Deployed from Langley AFB, Virginia) F-100, AF Ser. No. 56-3869, of the 354 TFW at McCoy AFB, October 1962 On the morning of 27 October, a U-2 piloted by Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., USAF, departed McCoy AFB on yet another Cuban overflight mission. A few hours into his mission, Anderson's aircraft was engaged by a Soviet-manned SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile site in the vicinity of Banes, Cuba. Hit by two of three SA-2 missiles fired, the aircraft was shot down over Cuba, killing Major Anderson. A week following the shoot down, Major Anderson's remains were turned over to a United Nations representative and returned to the United States. Major Anderson became the first recipient of the Air Force Cross, the U.S. Air Force's second highest decoration for valor after the Medal of Honor, which was awarded to him posthumously. The Cuban missile confrontation was ultimately resolved and the air strikes, which would have been followed by an invasion of Cuba, were never launched. However, all of the aforementioned squadrons and detachments except one remained at McCoy until the end of November 1962. The 4080th at Laughlin AFB and its successor unit, the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Davis- Monthan AFB, Arizona, would continue to maintain a permanent operating location at McCoy AFB for U-2 detachment operations monitoring Cuba through 1973, when it relocated to nearby Patrick AFB. In later years, these operations would occasionally be augmented by SR-71 detachments from the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale AFB, California. 306th Bombardment Wing SAC's Strategic Wing concept was phased out in early 1963. In most cases, the aircraft and crews remained at the same base, but the wing (and its bomb squadron) were given new designations. On 1 April 1963, the 306th Bombardment Wing (306 BW), a B-47 Stratojet unit originally scheduled for inactivation, moved on paper from MacDill AFB, Florida to McCoy AFB, converting to a B-52D Stratofortress and KC-135A Stratotanker wing by absorbing the assets and personnel of the 4047th Strategic Wing. With this standup of the 306 BW, the 4074th Strategic Wing was inactivated. KC-135A AF Ser. No. 60-0347 refuels B-52D AF Ser. No. 55-0057 of the 306 BW. This B-52D is now preserved on display at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. In addition to its \\"host wing\\" responsibilities for operating and maintaining the installation, the 306th's primary operational mission at McCoy AFB was deterring nuclear attack on the United States by maintaining constant ground alert and flying frequent cycles of airborne alert. During the 1960s and 1970s, the 306th and McCoy AFB was a frequent host for the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing and Navigation Competition between SAC wings operating B-52, FB-111 and KC-135 aircraft from throughout the Strategic Air Command, competing for the prestigious Fairchild Trophy. Vulcan B.2 bombers and Victor K.2 tankers from the Royal Air Force (RAF) Strike Command would also travel to McCoy AFB from their home bases in the United Kingdom to participate in this multi-week competition. =Vietnam War= In 1966, the 306 BW began preparing and training for deployment to the Western Pacific in support of Projects Arc Light & Young Tiger. In September 1966, the wing deployed to Andersen AFB, Guam and Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. Its mission while in the Western Pacific was to \\"...Conduct bombing raids in support of US and allied ground forces fighting in the Vietnamese War.\\" Later, the wing also operated from U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand as U.S. forces built up in the Vietnam theater. In 1967, the 919th Air Refueling Squadron (919 ARS) was also reassigned to the 306th Bomb Wing. B-52D, AF Ser. No. 55-0100, of McCoy AFB's 306th Bomb Wing while deployed to Southeast Asia. In 1972, it was one of the three final aircraft to bomb North Vietnam during Operation Linebacker II. When not forward deployed for operations over Vietnam, the 306th continued to operate out of McCoy AFB for both training evolutions and in its stateside strategic nuclear alert role. In January 1968, the 306 BW received another Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for this \\"double-duty\\" for combat operations in Southeast Asia while maintaining an alert status for SAC. In 1971, the 919 ARS was inactivated and its personnel and aircraft merged into the 306th Air Refueling Squadron (306 ARS). In 1972, the 306 BW would be part of the heavy bombing raids Linebacker I and Linebacker II over North Vietnam. The 306 BW returned to McCoy AFB from its final Southeast Asia deployment in early 1973 after the Paris Peace Accords ended American involvement in the conflict. From 1971 through 1973 other training activities at McCoy AFB included KC-135Q instruction by the 306 ARS and KC-135A instruction by the 32d Air Refueling Squadron (32 ARS). Whereas KC-135A aircraft typically carried JP-4 jet fuel, KC-135Q aircraft were specifically modified and equipped to offload JP-7 fuel and supported worldwide in-flight refueling requirements for USAF U-2 and SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft. 55th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron In February 1970, following the transfer of Kindley AFB, Bermuda to the U.S. Navy and its redesignation as NAS Bermuda, McCoy AFB briefly became home to the 55th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron (55 ARRS) and its HC-130 Hercules aircraft. Assigned to Military Airlift Command (MAC) and its subordinate sub-command, the Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service, the squadron relocated from McCoy AFB to Eglin AFB, Florida in June 1971.55th Rescue Squadron 42nd Air Division In 1971, the 42d Air Division,http://afhra.maxwell.af.mil/rso/airdivision_pages/0042ad.asp was transferred from Blytheville Air Force Base, Arkansas and headquartered at McCoy AFB. In September 1973, with the force reduction-directed closure of McCoy AFB in progress, the air division headquarters was transferred back to Blytheville (later renamed Eaker AFB). B-52 crash at McCoy AFB On 31 March 1972, a 306th Bombardment Wing B-52D, AF Serial Number 56-0625, sustained multiple engine failures and an engine pod fire shortly after takeoff from McCoy AFB on a routine training mission. The aircraft was not carrying any weapons. The aircraft immediately attempted to return to the base, but crashed short of Runway 18R in a civilian residential area immediately north of the airfield, destroying or damaging eight homes. The crew of 7 airmen and a 10-year-old boy on the ground were killed.McCoy AFB SAC 306 BOMB WINGFIRE DEPTOrlando Plane Crash NBC News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive =Major commands to which assigned= * Army Air Forces Air Training Command, 1 August 1940 * Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics, 1 October 1943 ‚Äì 1 July 1945 * Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command, 1 July 1945 ‚Äì 1947 * Air Training Command, 1 September 1951 ‚Äì 1 January 1954 * Strategic Air Command, 1 January 1954 ‚Äì 1975 : Air Defense Command / Aerospace Defense Command (Tenant activity; attached 1 March 1957 ‚Äì 1 February 1961; 1 February 1962 ‚Äì 31 December 1973) =World War II units assigned= * 5th Bombardment Squadron, 15 April 1943 ‚Äì 7 June 1943; 13 February-9 March 1944 * 99th Bombardment Squadron, 31 October 1942 ‚Äì 5 February 1943; 25 February-9 March 1944 =Major USAF units assigned= * 3540th Flying Training Wing 1 September 1951 : Redesignated: 4240th Flying Training Wing, 1 April 1952 ‚Äì 1 June 1954 * 321st Bombardment Wing, 4 December 1953 ‚Äì 25 October 1961 * 321st Air Refueling Squadron, 1 April 1952 ‚Äì 1 August 1956 * 19th Bombardment Wing, 11 June 1954 ‚Äì 1 June 1956 * 813th Strategic Aerospace Division, 15 July 1954 ‚Äì 1 June 1956 * 76th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (ADC), 8 November 1957 ‚Äì 1 February 1961 * 4047th Strategic Wing, 1 September 1961 ‚Äì 1 April 1963 : Replaced by: 306th Bombardment Wing, 1 April 1963 ‚Äì 1 July 1974 * 306th Air Refueling Squadron, 1 April 1963 ‚Äì 30 September 1973 (Not operational 1‚Äì30 September 1973) * 919th Air Refueling Squadron, 25 March 1967 ‚Äì 30 June 1971 (Not operational 15‚Äì30 June 1971) * 966th Airborne Air Control Squadron, 18 December 1961 ‚Äì 31 December 1973 : Deployed from: 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, Otis AFB, Massachusetts * 42d Air Division, 30 June 1971 ‚Äì 1 September 1973 * Units Deployed to McCoy during Cuban Missile Crisis: : From 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina (TAC), 21 October ‚Äì 29 November 1962 :: 334th Tactical Fighter Squadron :: 335th Tactical Fighter Squadron :: 336th Tactical Fighter Squadron : From 354th Tactical Fighter Wing, Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina (TAC), 21 October ‚Äì 1 December 1962 :: 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron :: 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron : From 4505th Air Refueling Wing, Langley AFB, Virginia (TAC), 21 October ‚Äì 1 December 1962 :: 427th Air Refueling Squadron (Deployed From Robins AFB, Georgia) : Detachment, 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing :: Operating Location XX (OL-XX), October 1962 - February 1966 : Detachment, 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing :: Operating Location LF (OL-LF), February 1966 - o/a June 1974 =Realignment and closure= In April 1973, following the cease fire agreement with North Vietnam, the return of all American prisoners of war, and anticipated reduced defense budgets, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) announced the closure of more than forty (40) bases as part of a post-Vietnam reduction in force (RIF). Included were the major SAC installations of Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico; Westover AFB, Massachusetts; Kincheloe AFB, Michigan; and McCoy AFB, Florida. In making this announcement, SECDEF Elliot Richardson noted that Ramey was on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico and Westover and McCoy near the east coast of the United States and therefore, as a rationale for their closure, were \\"...subject to short warning time attacks by (Soviet) submarine-launched ballistic missiles.\\" Richardson's decision was consistent with earlier SAC guidance, issued in 1954, to avoid basing strategic bomber forces within 250 miles of the Atlantic or Gulf Coasts, although this guidance had never been implemented.http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100928-010.pdf However, the 250 mile rationale had been partially employed (in addition to other factors, ranging from the retirement of SAC B-47s in the early 1960s to the costs of maintaining SAC B-52 units in Southeast Asia in support of the Vietnam War in the late 1960s) in the earlier transitioning of MacDill AFB and Homestead AFB in Florida from SAC bomber/tanker bases to TAC fighter bases, the removal of a tenant SAC bomb wing at Eglin AFB, Florida to also be replaced by a TAC fighter wing, the turnover of Turner AFB, Georgia to the U.S. Navy and its redesignation as Naval Air Station Albany, and the turnover of Hunter AFB, Georgia to the U.S. Army and its redesignation as Hunter Army Airfield.http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100928-010.pdf Westover AFB would transition to Westover Air Reserve Base, an airlift installation under Air Force Reserve control, initially for C-123 Provider and C-130 Hercules aircraft, and eventually for C-5 Galaxy aircraft. Ramey AFB, Kincheloe AFB, and McCoy AFB were destined for civilian airport status, although Ramey would become home to Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen with HH-3F Pelican and continuing today with HH-65C Dolphin helicopters and as a periodic operating location for USAF KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft.https://www.airplane-pictures.net/photo/341225/58-0125-usa-air-force- boeing-kc-135t-stratotanker/ With the announcement of McCoy AFB's closure, it was also announced that the 306th Bombardment Wing would also be inactivated. The 306th Bombardment Wing (Heavy) inactivated in July 1974 as activities at the base were phased down prior to the closure, while its personnel, along with its B-52D and KC-135A aircraft assets, were redistributed to other SAC bomb wings. However, this inactivation was short-lived, when the 306th was reactivated in 1975 as the 306th Strategic Wing at RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom, coordinating SAC KC-135 assets in support of U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) until it was replaced by the 100th Air Refueling Wing in 1992. Today, it operates as the 306th Flying Training Group, an Air Education and Training Command (AETC) unit at the U.S. Air Force Academy and Pueblo Memorial Airport as a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) at Randolph AFB, Texas. EC-121 and U-2 detachment operations at McCoy AFB were also relocated in 1973 and 1974, with ADC's EC-121 aircraft moving 210 miles south to Homestead AFB and the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing's U-2 detachment and associated aircraft Operating Location (OL) moving 45 miles east-southeast to Patrick AFB. Final closure of McCoy AFB was concluded in early 1975. Those portions of McCoy AFB which were not slated for transfer to other U.S. Government activities (primarily the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army) were transferred to the General Services Administration (GSA). The GSA subsequently transferred title of the remaining McCoy AFB property, to include the airfield, to the City of Orlando for the sum of $1.00, a standard amount at the time for the transfer of former military air bases to state and local governments.https://www.faa.gov/airports/resources/publications/orders/compliance_5190_6/media/5190_6b_chap3.pdf This transfer also contained a reversal clause, another standard practice at the time, enabling the Air Force to return to McCoy in the future if national security requirements ever dictated same. The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) was established the following year as a successor to the City of Orlando Aviation Department via an act of the Florida State Legislature. GOAA was charged to operate and maintain both the former McCoy AFB and Herndon Airport, the latter subsequently renamed Orlando Executive Airport. The large hangars and myriad of aircraft maintenance support buildings at McCoy were eventually transferred to other U.S. Government agencies or leased by GOAA to private interests, and today many of them remain supporting the civilian aviation community. The combined former McCoy AFB and extant Orlando-McCoy Jetport was renamed the Orlando International Airport, and was greatly expanded to support the growing tourist industry in Orlando as well as the expanding business and commercial expansion of the area. Today Orlando International Airport is among the busiest commercial airports in the world as measured by annual passenger throughput. Over thirty airlines serve the airport with hundreds of daily flights to destinations across the United States and overseas. Orlando International Airport still retains the ICAO code of KMCO and the FAA and IATA code MCO, a legacy of both the Orlando-McCoy Jetport and McCoy AFB.  Current uses  Today a majority of the McCoy AFB site is operated and maintained by the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) as Orlando International Airport. As a governmental entity chartered by the Florida Legislature and as an enterprise fund of the City of Orlando, GOAA is tasked with the operation, administration, maintenance, and oversight of expansions and enhancements to both Orlando International Airport and the Orlando Executive Airport. GOAA also leases buildings and property to private individuals and companies, primarily for aviation-related activities in support of the respective airports. Redeveloped areas on the former McCoy AFB / current Orlando International Airport include: * The current site for the Orlando International Airport landside and airside terminal complexes and associated support areas. * Two International Arrivals Concourses with customs, immigration, and agricultural inspection facilities administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Of the total 114 airport gates, the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority manages eleven gates with seven additional gates available for international operations. Expansive fixed-base operator, domestic, and charter flight operations facilities are also located on airport property. * The Orlando Tradeport, a master planned integrated cargo center with direct airside access, of cargo ramp, a Foreign Trade Zone, and an ultramodern Plant Inspection Station with several perishable handling facilities. Originally a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) facility, the station was transferred to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 2003.http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/aphis_general/content/printable_version/fs_cbp_08.pdf Concurrently, many of the former USAF hangars and maintenance facilities have been taken over by civilian airlines and other aeronautical and aviation firms. Tributes to Colonel McCoy and McCoy AFB at and near the airport include: * The airport's ICAO, FAA, and IATA airfield identifiers, as well as all airline tickets and baggage tags, continue to read \\"MCO\\" which stands for McCoy. The FAA also has an established standard instrument departure (SID) for aircraft departing MCO known as the MCCOY ONE Departure.http://www.airnav.com/airport/KMCO * A portrait of Colonel McCoy hangs in the airport's main landside terminal near the airport chapel. * One of the restaurants in the airport's Hyatt Hotel is named McCoy's. * The Orange County Public School System operates the Colonel Michael McCoy Elementary School, which is located just north of the airport, while a nearby thoroughfare is called McCoy Road. * McCoy AFB's original military credit union continues to operate throughout Central Florida as the McCoy Federal Credit Union. Over the past 30 years, the majority of the former McCoy AFB has been subjected to extensive modification due to the addition of new structures, taxiways, or runways. In addition, the remaining lands have been subjected to extensive excavation, landfill, and improvement activities. Although several former military structures remain and a new joint military reserve facility added, a significant portion of the former air force base is barely recognizable. A continuing impact of both the former Pinecastle AAF, Pinecastle AFB, McCoy Air Force Base, and the former Orlando AAB is the continued excavation of unspent ammunition, including small practice bombs, aerial rockets, and machine gun rounds from the World War II era in the areas northeast of the current Orlando International Airport and east and southeast of the current Orlando Executive Airport. These formerly remote and uninhabited areas were leased from local landowners at the time and used as bombing and gunnery ranges for Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF when both were Army Air Forces facilities during World War II. At the conclusion of the war, they were returned to the original owners and their previous primarily agricultural purposes. With Central Florida's increasing population in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 21st century, these landowners and/or their descendants sold these properties for private redevelopment, predominantly residential housing and associated support infrastructure such as schools, parks, and retail, often with limited or no knowledge of these properties previous wartime utilization. In recent years, new discoveries of unspent conventional munitions have caused repeated closures of Odyssey Middle School, northeast of Orlando International Airport. =Post-closure military presence= Up until 1980, Strategic Air Command considered retaining the former SAC Alert Facility on the south end of the airfield as either an Operating Location (OL) or as a smaller installation to be called McCoy Air Force Station under control of an air base squadron for occasional dispersal basing of two B-52D/G/H and two KC-135A/E/Q aircraft from other SAC installations. This concept never came to fruition, but the Alert Facility, a nose dock hangar and several buildings on the north end of the McCoy ramp were turned over to the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) for use as the 49th Army Aviation Support Facility for USAR units, specifically the 138th Aviation Company (EW), which operated RU-8D, JU-21A, RU-21A, RU-21B and RU-21C aircraft until replaced by C-12 Huron and RC-12G electronic reconnaissance aircraft, plus the 348th Medical Detachment with UH-1 medical evacuation helicopters. This arrangement permitted USAF access to the remaining military facilities at MCO if and when it became necessary. The USAR aviation units were inactivated in 1999 pursuant to an earlier Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) decision, but most of the Alert Facility still remains under USAR control as a non-flying military facility. A significant portion of the McCoy AFB base facilities were transferred to the United States Navy between 1974 and 1975, primarily base housing, base exchange, commissary, medical clinic, base chapel, and morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) facilities, becoming the Naval Training Center Orlando McCoy Annex. From 1975 to 1999, the Annex supported various tenant command activities at the Annex that included the Army Reserve aviation units, other units of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Naval Reserve, U.S. Army Reserve, Florida Army National Guard, and the U.S. Air Force Liaison Office of the Florida Wing of the Civil Air Patrol. Administrative support and housing area for both McCoy Annex activities and primary command and tenant command activities at the nearby Naval Training Center Orlando were also maintained. In 1984, a B-52D Stratofortress, AF Serial No. 56-0687, on loan from the National Museum of the United States Air Force, was flown to Orlando International Airport from the 7th Bomb Wing at the then-Carswell AFB, Texas for permanent static display at the airport's McCoy AFB / B-52 Memorial Park. It is located north-northwest of the current civilian commercial terminal and just east of and adjacent to the former location of the since dismantled Orlando-McCoy Jetport civilian terminal. McCoy Annex operated until Naval Training Center Orlando's closure in late 1999 pursuant to a 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) decision. The former military family housing area originally constructed by the Air Force and later utilized by the Navy and other military service branches was fully turned over to the City of Orlando in late 1999 and was redeveloped into The Villages at Southport. Housing sales began in 1996 and the complex was awarded a US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) award for outstanding development. With the closure of NTC Orlando in late 1999, The only military activities remaining at the former McCoy AFB today are units of the Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces. The 1LT David R. Wilson Armed Forces Reserve Center hosts the United States Army Reserve 143rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), 912th Human Resources Company, 196th Transportation Company, 146th Transportation Detachment, 520th Transportation Detachment/3rd Team, 174th Judge Advocate General Detachment/10th Team, 174th Judge Advocate General Detachment/11th Team, 174th Judge Advocate General Detachment, the United States Navy Reserve Navy Operational Support Center Orlando (NOSC Orlando) and the United States Marine Corps Reserve Motor Transportation Company, Combat Logistics Battalion 451. The Taft United States Army Reserve Center is located at 9500 Armed Forces Reserve Drive and includes the 689th Engineer Company and 418th Military Police Detachment. The McCoy United States Army Reserve Center is home for the 377th Military Intelligence Battalion, which utilizes McCoy AFB's former SAC bomber and tanker flight crew Alert Facility (e.g., \\"mole hole\\"). The Florida Army National Guard Orlando Armory is located within the grounds of the former McCoy AFB, having converted the former McCoy AFB Officers Club into the 164th Air Defense Artillery Brigade (FL ARNG) Headquarters. The Navy Exchange (to include an NEX MaxiMart grocery facility in lieu of a Defense Commissary Agency commissary) continued operations at the former McCoy Air Force Base. The Navy Exchange facility has a Barber Shop, Optical Shop, Tailor Shop, Subway restaurant and a Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Information, Tours and Tickets office. This is due to the continued presence of Naval Air Warfare Center and Naval Support Activity Orlando, a large National Guard & Reserve Component presence, and the military retiree population in the Orlando/Central Florida area that makes the facility financially self- sustaining.

It is one of the seven islands of Mumbai. It is part of South Mumbai and can be reached by Byculla Station on the Central railway line and Dockyard Road Station on the Harbour Railway line. Located in Mazagaon are maritime companies like the Bombay Port Trust and Mazagaon Dock Ltd., the Mazagaon Court and Anglo-Indian schools including Rosary High School, St. Peters School, Antonio D'Souza High School, Diamond Jubilee High School and St. Mary's School.  History  Former seven islands of Bombay The word Mazagaon has been derived from the Sanskrit Matsya Gram, meaning fishing village. The original inhabitants were speculated to be tribals of Agari (salt-workers) and Koli (fishermen) tribes. However, folk etymology derives Mazagaon from the Marathi Maza Gaon, meaning my village. Another etymological claim suggests Portuguese origin, with the name borrowed from a city and fort of Mazag√£o in Morocco (now El Jadida) established by Portuguese in the beginning of the 16th century who totally evacuated to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1769. One of Mazagaon's oldest claims to fame was a variety of mango trees which fruited twice a year. Apparently a few such trees were extant well into the 20th century. The small island was rocky, with a hill rising at the north, and forming a cliff over the harbour. To see what Mazagaon might once have been, one has to visit any of the tiny rocky islands bearing mango trees and small villages further down the Konkan coast. The first Portuguese settlers were the Jesuits, who established a church in the 16th century. Notwithstanding their claim, in 1572 King Sebastian of Portugal granted the island in perpetuity to the de Lima Souza family, from whom the D'Souzas of Mumbai trace their descent. When the Portuguese ceded the island to the English in 1661, there was a well established population of Roman Catholics, mainly fishermen. Although Eurasians were not uncommon. Some black African slaves brought by the Portuguese, known as Kaffirs, had also entered the ethnic mix. Some of their traditional wooden houses can still be seen, and are now protected heritage structures. The original Gloria church, Nossa Senhora da Gl√≥ria, was built in 1632 from a donation by the de Souza family. It was destroyed in 1911, being replaced two years later by a new Gothic church of the same name built a kilometer. In 1690 Mazagaon was occupied by the Sidi of Janjira, an admiral in the Mughal navy. It is said that he was driven away a year later by the Rustomji Dorabji, who organised the fishermen in Dongri into a fleet. Rustomji was given the title Patel after this feat, and his descendants have remained the only Parsi family of Patels. With the reclamation of Umarkhadi, at the end of the 17th century, Mazagaon became an outlying suburb of Mumbai and a fashionable place of residence. One of the famous houses was the neo-classical Tarala, built by a member of the Wadia family in the late 18th century. Sold to the Jeejeebhoy family about a century later, it became the Sadar Adalat in 1925, when they moved out to Malabar Hill. Later still it was taken over by the army, and then donated to the J.J. Hospital in 1943 after a fire. It was used as a staff hostel for a few years before it was demolished. Other bungalows and plantations also grew up in Mazagaon as the British and the more affluent Indians moved out of the crowded fort. When the Esplanade was cleared in the Fort area, the armoury moved from Bombay Castle to Mazagaon in 1760 and gave its name to Gunpowder Lane. In 1790 the docks at Mazagaon were completed. In 1793, after the construction of the Hornby Vellard, the Bellasis Road was built to join Mazagaon and Malabar Hill. The next century saw a slow decline in Mazagaon's fortunes, as the neighbouring Byculla became the fashionable suburb, and people began moving out. The process accelerated after the docks were reclaimed in the last thirty years of the century on the eastern shore of Mazagaon. Mazagaon was left landlocked, and the fumes from the developing mills drove the last money out of this area. Among others, Tipu Sultan, the Mysore warrior's relative Nawab Ayaz Ali, migrated here after the British defeated the ruler in 1799 and was buried here. Birthplace of Elvisto Savio Euphermiano Rodrigues.  Area  The surrounding area of Mazgaon is known as: * to south side is Wadibunder, Dongri or Noorbaug, J.J. Hospital, * to east side Darukhana area which is especially known for its shoreline, * to north side Reay Road, Ghodapdeo, Jijamata Udyan (previously known as Ranicha Baug or Municipal Zoo or Victoria Gardens - which is one and only place in proper Mumbai) and to West side Byculla again J.J. Hospital. Once very fashionable, Mazgaon lost much of its charm after the more affluent British and Parsi residents relocated to Malabar Hill. Since independence, the area is generally considered to be a Catholic enclave. However, even though Mazagaon is still home to a large population of Catholics, with Catholics, Hindus, Parsis, Jews and other communities also dwell here in Mazagaon. Muslims (particularly Dawoodi Bohras) are taking their place with most Catholics migrating abroad. Bohras are developing many places in Mazagoan. Huge skyscrapers are being constructed. It has virtually become a Bohra-Muslim neighbourhood. A Catholic East Indian village can be found in the Mathar Pakadi area. The migrants from Goa also set up residences. The Goan Clubs are an integral part of this part of town. Nearby lie the Mazagaon Docks, famed as a site of ship building since the 18th century. It still builds warships for the Indian Navy and nearby is the Mazagaon Dock Colony which houses Angre house, Sarine house, Curry house and P & O Terrace. The Harbour Line station of Dockyard Road is the nearest railhead.  Churches  Mazagaon is famous for its churches. Among the more prominent are: * St. Anne's Church (Roman Catholic) (next to St. Mary's School) * Our Lady of the Rosary Church (Roman Catholic) in the East (opposite Dockyard Road Station) * Our Lady of Glory Church (Roman Catholic) up north (in Byculla, opposite Byculla station) * St. Joseph's Church (Roman Catholic) down south (in Umerkhadi, Dongri) * St. Peter's Church (Protestant) (functional for school only) (near Mazagaon Hill) * Holy Cross Church of Church of North India on Ramchandra Bhat Marg * Christ Church (Protestant) in the north * Methodist Churches near Victoria Gardens * Taylor Memorial Methodist Church next to St. Agnes' School, Clare Road * Robinson Memorial Methodist Central Church opposite B-Ward Municipal office * Matharpacady Village Holy Cross Oratory (Matharpacady Village) * Eymard House‚ÄîBlessed Sacrament Chapel (SSS Order) - Mass celebrated 8.00 am daily Monday - Saturday Educational institutes * Diamond Jubilee High School (ICSE) *St. Mary's High School (SSC) *St. Mary's High School (ICSE) *St. Peter's High School (ICSE) *Rosary High School (SSC) *St. Isabelle High School (SSC) *Burhani College *Bombay Institute for Deaf and Mutes  Important landmarks Among the more prominent places are: * Matharpacady Village (or Oart, and also spelled Matharpakhadi; ) one of the prettiest and best preserved Portuguese styled enclaves with well preserved bungalows dating back to the time Mumbai was a Portuguese colony. Originally Matharpacady was a colony of East Indian Catholics but over time came to include many Goan and other families. With passage of time it has become fairly multicultural with different faiths and cultures living peacefully and working to preserve the quiet, the beauty and the cleanliness of the precinct. Preserves an almost 150-year-old tradition of the Cross Feast (1 May) preceded by a Novena commemorating Divine protection from the Plague that ravaged Mumbai approximately 148 years ago. It is believed that through prayer (notably recitation of the Rosary and faith in St Roque, the patron saint for protection against pestilence) residents of Matharpacady were spared and not a single life was lost. Through the generosity of a certain Mrs Buthello and other residents the famous Matharpacady Village Cross was built. This generosity has extended through the decades. The concrete roads themselves are kept in good repair through local initiative and with local funds. And this is not to mention the initiative of the three late Baptista sisters Lily, Daisy and Violet to encourage education especially among women through founding the St Isabel's High School, on whose board residents of Matharpacady continue to selflessly serve. A Heritage precinct which actually boasts of its own village well. Birthplace of famous freedom fighter Kaka Joseph Baptista (close associate of Bal Gangadhar Tilak) and Dr Ubaldo Mascarenhas, Mumbai (Bombay's) very first Indian mayor. It's a unique place where traditional culture is preserved along with the architecture. Was the setting for a scene from Merchant Ivory's The Perfect Murder. Keating, the creator of \\"Inspector Ghote\\" himself visited Matharpacady for the filming of the sequence. Matharpacady is frequently used as a study by architecture and fine art students of the Sir JJ School of Art and other art and architecture institutes. Village walks are being increasingly arranged for foreign and other visitors. *Mahapurush Temple - Surykund CHS (only Hindus allowed in this society).

After the 1962 Sino-Indian War, most Chinese were viewed as traitors, and left the town. Mumbai now has a small ethnic Chinese population of 400 families. The Chinese temple and cemetery are both located at Mazagaon. Kwan Tai Kwon Tucked away behind Dockyard Road Railway Station, Kwan Kung is a small Chinese temple on 12, Nawab Tank Road. It‚Äôs not easy to find, nestled between short buildings now used as godowns and residential homes, Mumbai‚Äôs only temple is painted red and is a peaceful place that plays meditative Chinese music. Adorned with all the requisite paraphernalia of a typical Chinese temple, including fortune scrolls, paper money and incense sticks, the temple pays homage to the Chinese God of protection, justice and courage Guan Gong. Temple caretaker Albert Tham, whose mother also looked after the temple, is building another temple on the ground floor of the building dedicated to Guan Yin, a female deity revered for mercy, peace and wisdom. The temple built in winter months (Oct - Dec) 1953, was then in the center of Mumbai‚Äôs See Yip Koon community. Originally from Canton in Southern China, the community settled in Mumbai as merchants, traders and sailors. As a result of which buildings adjacent to the temple all have See Yup Koon written on them. While the lane wares a deserted look now, with all its 50-60 Chinese residents gone, it sees a swarm of people only during Chinese New Year. Rotated by the lunar calendar, the Chinese new year generally falls at the end of January or beginning of February. Like Nawab Tank Road, Mumbai also had another China town located close to what is today Kamathipura. Prior to the 1962 Sino-Indian war, the street boasted a Chinese restaurant, traditional Chinese medicine store and a grocery store today its bereft of any residents from the middle kingdom. China‚Äôs craftsmen, barbers, chefs and cobblers also earlier sent their kids to the Chinese school which was located in Agripada, behind Maratha Mandir Cinema, however naught remains of the school and there is little chance for revival.

The scheme was begun in 1997 and now covers most of England and Wales. It is primarily focused on private metal detectorists who through their hobby regularly discover artefacts that would otherwise go unrecorded. Members of the public can also report objects they have found and finds of non-metallic objects are also covered by the scheme. Finds that legally constitute treasure are dealt with through the Treasure Act 1996. This however concentrates on precious metals, prehistoric base metal, and finds in association with them. Non-prehistoric base metal and non-metal finds would not be recognised as treasure and therefore be unrecorded. The PAS exists to fill this gap. sixpence of Philip and Mary, recorded via the scheme (FindID 662681) The scheme funds the posts of Finds Liaison Officers (FLOs) at county councils or local museums to whom finders can report their objects. The FLO is qualified to examine the find and provide the finder with more information on it. He or she also records the find, its function, date, material and location and places this information into a database which can be analysed. The information on the findspot can be used to organise more research on the area. Many previously unknown archaeological sites have been identified through the scheme and it has contributed greatly to the level of knowledge of the past. FLOs maintain close links with local metal detecting societies and have contributed to a thaw in relationships between the detectorists and archaeologists who often previously disdained one another. Finds are photographed, often from multiple angles, and a text description is recorded. The photographs are made available under an open licence. The find remains the property of the finder or the landowner who are free to dispose of non-treasure finds. Other activities The PAS engages widely with the professional and amateur archaeological community through conferences, workshops and public activities. It also provides host servers and technical support for the Day of Archaeology. History of the programme bow brooch of the Polden Hill type (FindID 662669) In March 1996, during the run-up to the passing of the new Treasure Act, what was then the Department of National Heritage (DNH) (now the Department for Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS)) published Portable Antiquities. A discussion document. The aim of this document was to complement the impending Treasure Act, address the issue of non-treasure archaeological finds and to propose solutions for dealing with these. The general response to the DNH‚Äôs proposals was that the recording of all archaeological finds was important and that a consistent voluntary scheme to record finds should be established. As a result, in December 1996, the DNH announced that funding would be provided for two years for a programme of six pilot schemes, starting in September 1997. The main aim of the pilot schemes was ‚Äúto enable an accurate estimate to be made of the resources that would be needed to extend the scheme across the whole of England‚Äù (DNH 1997). The essential aim was to advance knowledge of history and archaeology. The project was ultimately overseen by the DCMS and administered by the Museums and Galleries Commission (later Resource, now Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA)) Expressions of interest in hosting the pilot schemes were then invited and host organisations chosen. The schemes were based in museums and archaeology services in Kent, Norfolk, the West Midlands, North Lincolnshire, the North West England and Yorkshire. A Finds Liaison Officer (FLO) was put in place as part of each pilot scheme. The six posts and schemes were co-ordinated by a further post which was based at, and funded by, the British Museum. A Mesolithic Knife (FindID 662570) These six regions were chosen for the pilot schemes in consultation with the Council for British Archaeology (CBA), and were representative of the existing diversity in recording finds systems. Some areas, such as Norfolk, had already established a tradition of recording finds and developed good relationships with finders and in particular among these, metal detectorists. Other areas, such as the North West, did not have systems in place for recording such finds. A database was devised and put on the web in July 1999 to enable wider access to the information collated by the scheme. During the first year of the pilot scheme, over 13,500 objects were recorded. The scheme was very successful, but further funding was needed to extend the scheme nationally. Therefore, bids were successfully put forward to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to fund five more FLO posts plus an Outreach Officer post for eighteen months, starting from January‚ÄìMarch 1999. The DCMS agreed to fund the existing posts during this period. The five new FLO posts were based in museums and archaeology services in Dorset and Somerset (one post covering two counties), Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk and Wales. The Outreach Officer was based at the British Museum, working alongside the Co-ordinator. Shortly after this, further funding was applied for from the HLF to establish a comprehensive national scheme covering the whole of England and Wales. However, before awarding funding to extend the scheme nationally, the HLF required an independent evaluation of the work of the scheme and its impact. This delayed the progression of the application considerably and as an interim measure, while the evaluation was being undertaken, funding was ultimately secured from the DCMS and the HLF for the existing posts until September 2001. The HLF questioned the long-term sustainability of such an ambitious scheme, particularly in consideration of its funding. While a decision was being reached, funding for the existing posts was provided once more by the DCMS as an interim measure until March 2003. A Medieval thimble (FindID 662823) However, in April 2002, the HLF decided to support the bid for three years starting in April 2003, bringing about the scheme as we know it today.

As an ISO-IEC Guide 65:1996 accredited, third-party certifying body, the Greenguard Environmental Institute certifies products and materials for low chemical emissions and serves as a public resource for choosing healthier products and materials for indoor environments. In 2011, UL Environment, a business unit of UL (Underwriters Laboratories) acquired Greenguard Environmental Institute. The UL GREENGUARD Certification Program requires that products undergo independent, scientific testing and ongoing monitoring of their chemical emissions. Only products that meet UL Environment‚Äôs stringent emissions standards qualify for certification. These standards are based on established criteria from key public health agencies. More than 10,000 products on the market today are UL GREENGUARD Certified, representing over 350 manufacturers and 19 industries. The UL Sustainable Products Database, the organization's online database of certified or validated products, helps people identify certified products and is searchable by product category, manufacturer, sustainable credits, product attributes, and certification type. GREENGUARD Certification is broadly recognized and accepted by sustainable building programs and building codes worldwide.  History  The Greenguard Environmental Institute was founded in 2001 by indoor air quality scientist Dr. Marilyn Black. Her vision was to create a third-party product certifier that could educate consumers and industry professionals about the importance of good indoor air quality and low-emitting products. = Greenguard Indoor Air Quality Certification = The Greenguard Indoor Air Quality Certification was Greenguard‚Äôs first certification offering. Products that are Greenguard Indoor Air Quality Certified meet strict chemical emissions limits and are designed for use in office environments and other indoor spaces. Greenguard Indoor Air Quality Certification gives credence to manufacturers‚Äô sustainability claims, backing them with empirical scientific data from an unbiased, third-party organization. = Greenguard Children & Schools Certification (now GREENGUARD GOLD) = In 2005, the Greenguard Children & Schools Certification was launched to address the indoor air quality needs of schools, daycares, and other sensitive environments in which children spend a lot of time. As such, it enforces stricter chemical emissions limits than the original certification. The Greenguard Children & Schools standard is referenced by both the Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) and the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Building Rating System.

A 1998 Radio Times readers' poll voted it the \\"best single television drama\\" and a 2000 industry poll rated it as the second best British television programme ever made. Filmed in a gritty, realistic drama documentary style, it was first broadcast on 16 November 1966 on BBC1. The play was shown in the BBC's The Wednesday Play anthology strand, which often tackled social issues. Plot The play tells the story of a young couple, Cathy (played by Carol White) and Reg (Ray Brooks), and their descent into poverty and homelessness. At the start of the film, Cathy leaves her parents' overcrowded rural home and hitchhikes to the city, where she finds work and meets Reg, a well-paid lorry driver. They fall in love, marry, and rent a modern flat in a building that does not allow children. Cathy soon becomes pregnant and must stop working, and Reg is injured on the job and becomes unemployed. The loss of income and birth of baby Sean force them to leave their flat, and they are unable to find another affordable place to live that permits children. They move in with Reg's mother, until tensions develop between her and Cathy in the crowded flat. A kind elderly landlady, Mrs. Alley, rents to them for a while, during which time Cathy has another son, Stevie. Mrs. Alley even allows them to stay when they fall behind on the rent. However, she dies suddenly and an agent of her nephew and heir appears at the door demanding all the back rent, which they are unable to pay. Again Cathy and Reg go house hunting but are continually turned down as they can find nothing available that permits children. During this time Cathy gives birth to her third child, a girl they call Marlene. Their new landlord takes them to court, and the judge rules against them. The family are evicted by bailiffs. The family then moves to a caravan parked in a camp where several other families are already living in caravans, but the local residents object to the camp and set it on fire, killing several children. Cathy, Reg and their children are forced to illegally squat in a wrecked, abandoned building. They repeatedly try to get decent housing through the local council, but are not helped because of their many moves and the long list of other people also seeking housing assistance. Cathy and Reg decide to separate temporarily so that Cathy and the children can move into an emergency homeless shelter where husbands are not allowed to stay. Reg leaves the area to seek employment. Cathy's loneliness and frustration finally boil over and she becomes belligerent with the shelter authorities, who are often cold and judgmental towards the women living in the shelter. Cathy's allotted time at the shelter expires while Reg is away, and she and her two remaining children (one having been sent to live with Reg's mother) have nowhere to go. They go to a railway station, where Cathy's children are taken away from her by social services. Cast * Carol White as Cathy * Ray Brooks as Reg * Winifred Dennis as Mrs Ward * Wally Patch as Grandad * Adrienne Frame as Eileen * Emmett Hennessy as Johnny * Geoffrey Palmer as Property Agent * Gabrielle Hamilton as Welfare Officer * Phyllis Hickson as Mrs Alley * Barry Jackson as Rent Collector * Ruth Kettlewell as Judge * Kathleen Broadhurst as Landlady * Ron Pember as Mr. Jones * Paddy Joyce as Mr. Acercamber * Lennard Pearce as The Ratepayer * Lila Kaye as a Matron * Andria Lawrence as Inmate: Home Lea * Tim Brooke-Taylor as a Wedding Guest Production The play was written by Jeremy Sandford, produced by Tony Garnett and directed by Ken Loach, who went on to become a major figure in British film. Loach employed a realistic documentary style, using predominantly 16 mm film on location, which contrasted with the vast amount of BBC drama of the time, the bulk of which was entirely shot in a television studio. Union regulations of the time forced about ten minutes of Cathy Come Home to be shot in this way, with the material shot in a studio on electronic cameras being telerecorded and spliced into the film as required. The cinematographer was Tony Imi. Imi's innovative use of a hand-held camera to take moving action shots and close-ups gave Cathy almost a feel of a current affairs broadcast and a realism which was rare in British TV drama at the time. This produced shots some traditionalists thought \\"not technically acceptable\\". Imi commented: \\"I was stuck in a rut after working on Dr Finlay's Casebook and Maigret ‚Äì standard BBC productions. All of a sudden, with The Wednesday Play and Ken, there was a newness that fitted into the way I was thinking at the time.\\" Loach's naturalistic style helped to heighten the play's impact. Many scenes were improvised, and some include unknowing members of the public, such as the final scene in which Cathy's children are taken from her at a railway station (none of the passers-by intervened). The song that is played at the beginning and end of the film is a cover version of \\"500 Miles\\" by Sonny & Cher. Broadcast After the first transmission in 1966, the play was repeated on BBC1 on 11 January 1967, 13 November 1968 and again on BBC2 on 11 August 1976. It was also screened by Channel 4 on 31 March 1993 as part of a season of programmes on homelessness, and by BBC Four in a season on the same subject in 2006. BBC Four also aired this drama on 5 and 11 June 2003 (shown as part of Time Shift). On 31 July 2016 it was repeated on BBC Four as part of a retrospective on 1966 & repeated again on BBC Four on 13 November 2016. Reception The play broached issues that were not then widely discussed in the popular media, such as homelessness, unemployment and the rights of mothers to keep their own children. It was watched by 12 million people ‚Äì a quarter of the British population at the time ‚Äì on its first broadcast. Its hard-hitting subject matter and highly realistic documentary style, new to British television, created a huge impact on its audience. One commentator called it \\"an ice-pick in the brain of all who saw it\\". The play produced a storm of phone calls to the BBC, and discussion in Parliament. For years afterwards Carol White was stopped in the street by people pressing money into her hand, convinced she must be actually homeless. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to determine the BFI TV 100 of the 20th century, Cathy Come Home was voted second (the highest-placed drama on the list), behind the comedy Fawlty Towers. In 2005 it was named by Broadcast as the UK's most influential TV programme of all time. Impact In the light of public reaction to the film, and following a publicity campaign led by Willam Shearman and Iain Macleod highlighting the plight of the homeless, the charity Crisis was formed the following year in 1967. By coincidence, another charity for the homeless, Shelter, was launched a few days after the first broadcast. Though it was not connected to the programme, \\"the film alerted the public, the media, and the government to the scale of the housing crisis, and Shelter gained many new supporters.\\" However, Ken Loach has said that despite the public outcry following the play, it had little practical effect in reducing homelessness other than changing rules so that homeless fathers could stay with their wives and children in hostels. Indeed, housing policy was only considerably reformed over a decade later with the passing of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977.Fitzpatrick, Suzanne, and Hal Pawson. ‚ÄúFifty Years since Cathy Come Home: Critical Reflections on the UK Homelessness Safety Net.‚Äù International Journal of Housing Policy 16, no. 4 (October 1, 2016): 543‚Äì55. Home media In 2003 the play was released on VHS and DVD by the British Film Institute with an audio commentary by Loach, and original production documentation (the BFI has screened the play on numerous occasions, including in a 2011 Ken Loach film festival). In 2011 the play was re-released on DVD by 2 Entertain with audio commentary by Loach. Along with other Loach films, it is available to watch on Loach's YouTube channel. It is also available as a special feature on the 2011 Criterion Blu- ray and DVD release of Kes, another Ken Loach film.

Say swam as a child for the Salmon Arm Sockeye Swim Club with his two brothers and two sisters. At the age of 18, he began attending the University of Victoria and started to swim seriously. Say became a mainstay of the National Swim Team, starting in 1998. His career to date includes 20 national titles and Canadian records in five individual events ‚Äì 100 free, 200 free, 400 free (scm), 200 free and 400 free (lcm) ‚Äì not to mention the vast number of national relay records he has been involved in. He has competed for Canada at three Olympic Games (2000, 2004 and 2008), reaching the finals of the 200 freestyle in 2000 and 2004. He has been to four World Championships (2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007) where he was an integral part of Canada's relays which swam in the finals. At the 2004 World Short Course Championships, Say won three medals ‚Äì a silver in the 200 free, and bronze in both the 100-metre freestyle and 4x100-metre freestyle relay, both in Canadian record time. At the Commonwealth Games (1998, 2002) he earned one silver medal and two bronze medals. He has been to two Pan Pacific Championships (1999, 2002), winning 3 bronze medals, all in relays and placing a career high 4th for the 200-metre freestyle. At the 1999 Pan American Games, he was a dual bronze medalist in the 400-metre freestyle and 4x200-metre free relay. At the 2004 Olympics, Say created a minor controversy after the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay immediately in the post-race interview which was aired live on national television, when he said that he was \\"pissed off at not being able to make up for my teammates' mistakes\\". The other three team members - Brent Hayden, Brian Johns, and Andrew Hurd - expressed disappointment not in the effort, which broke the Canadian record by over 3.5 seconds, but only in the 5th-place finish which was out of the medals. Say's 4x200-metre freestyle relay, however, bounced back to win two silver medals at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal in 2005. Since 2004, Say has been less successful, losing his national 200-metre freestyle title to Brent Hayden, from Vancouver, British Columbia. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, Say swam a world-class time of 1:48, but finished out of the medals in fourth place. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, he was a member of the Canadian teams that finished sixth in the 4x100-metre freestyle relay and fifth in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay.

He is Music Director of Los Angeles Opera and Principal Conductor of the Italian RAI National Symphony Orchestra. He was the long serving director of the two-week Cincinnati May Festival from 1979 through 2016. From 2005 to 2015, he was music director at the Ravinia Festival, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He is known for his efforts in reviving music by composers suppressed during the Nazi regime. Early years Conlon grew up in a family of five children on Cherry Street in Douglaston, Queens, New York City. His mother, Angeline L. Conlon, was a freelance writer. His father was an assistant to the New York City Commissioner of Labor in the Robert F. Wagner administration.The New York Times, January 10, 1987 His siblings were not musically inclined, nor were his parents. When he was eleven, he went to a production of La traviata by an amateur company founded by the mother of a friend (Edith Mugdan, the mother of the young Conlon's best friend, Walter Mugdan, and the founder of the North Shore Opera).The New York Times, October 7, 2001 He asked for music lessons and became a treble (boy soprano) in a children's chorus in an opera company in Queens. He dreamed about being a tenor, then a baritone, and even wanted to sing the role of Carmen at one point. Finally it dawned on him that the only way to do everything in opera was to become an operatic conductor.San Francisco Symphony Education He entered the High School of Music & Art at the age of fifteen and at eighteen he was accepted into the Aspen Music Festival and School conducting program, and in September, 1968 he entered the Juilliard School of music. In 1970, the Juilliard Orchestra took an educational tour to Europe and he was invited to Spoleto the next year as an assistant doing work as a r√©p√©titeur, coach and chorus conductor. During that time, he conducted one performance of Boris Godunov. He recalled that he had fallen in love with this opera at a young age, and had dreamed that it would be the first opera he would conduct. In 1972, at a scheduled Juilliard production of La boh√®me directed by Michael Cacoyannis, conductor Thomas Schippers suddenly pulled out. At the time, Maria Callas was doing a series of master classes at Juilliard and heard Conlon in rehearsal. She suggested to Juilliard's president, Peter Mennin, that Conlon should step in to conduct. Career Conlon received the conducting award of the American National Orchestral Association and in 1974 became the youngest conductor engaged for the New York Philharmonic Orchestra's subscription series. In 1976 he made his Metropolitan Opera debut and his British debut with the Scottish Opera, and in 1979 he debuted at Covent Garden. He was named director of the Cincinnati May Festival in 1979, a position he retained until 2016. After engagements with the Paris Op√©ra, Maggio Musicale in Florence, Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chicago Lyric Opera, Conlon became chief conductor of the Cologne Opera in 1989. In 1996 he was appointed music director of the Op√©ra National de Paris while serving concurrently as Music Director of the city of Cologne, Germany.Boise State University newrelease (2005). Since his New York Philharmonic debut in 1974 at the invitation of Pierre Boulez, Conlon has appeared with virtually every major North American and European orchestra. He has also appeared with many of the world's major opera companies, including Teatro alla Scala (Milan), the Royal Opera at Covent Garden (London), the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (Florence). Associated for almost 30 years with the Metropolitan Opera, where he made his debut in 1976, he has conducted more than 250 performances there, leading a wide range of works from the Italian, German, French, Russian and Czech repertoires. Conlon has held several major European posts, including Principal Conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic (1983‚Äì1991), General Music Director of the City of Cologne, Germany (1989‚Äì2002), where he was simultaneously Music Director of the G√ºrzenich Orchestra and the Cologne Opera, and Principal Conductor of the Paris National Opera (1995‚Äì2004), where his Paris tenure was the longest of any conductor there since 1939.

In an effort to establish a Wagnerian tradition in Los Angeles, Conlon has conducted seven of Wagner's works thus far, including the first ever performances in LA of Der Ring des Nibelungen in 2008/09. In 2013, Conlon, whose lifelong fascination with Benjamin Britten was reflected in a personal three-year performance cycle of the composer's works in America and Europe, spearheaded Britten 100/LA: A Celebration, a Los Angeles countywide collaboration featuring performances, conferences and exhibitions.

Pedagogy Conlon recently completed a two-year artist residency with his alma mater, the Juilliard School. During the residency, Conlon worked with the school's young artists in its three divisions ‚Äì dance, drama, music ‚Äì in an educational project meant to promote growth and historical curiosity in students and audience members alike. The cross-genre project consisted of performances, symposia, master classes, and coaching. In addition to study and performance of the lesser-known repertoire of composers affected by the rise of Nazism and the events of World War II, of which he is an ardent champion, Conlon moderated symposia and spoke about the role of the artist in current times. Composers from the Holocaust era In an effort to raise public consciousness to the significance of works of composers whose lives and compositions were affected by the Holocaust, Conlon has devoted himself to extensive programming of this music in North America and Europe. This includes the works of such composers as Alexander von Zemlinsky, Viktor Ullmann, Pavel Haas, Kurt Weill, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Erwin Schulhoff, and Ernst Krenek. In addition to \\"Recovered Voices\\" at Los Angeles Opera, each summer when he was music director of the Ravinia Festival, Conlon presented a different composer from this group with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He has highlighted works of Viktor Ullmann, Erwin Schulhoff, and Alexander von Zemlinsky thus far.

His work in several Cliburn competitions was taped and aired in a special series on PBS, the most recent of which debuted in spring 2006, and the Final Round concerts comprising the concerti and recital performances, rehearsals, symposia including \\"A Talk with James Conlon\\", and the awards ceremony, were webcast live during the 2009 competition. He is also featured in the final round section of the 2001 Van Cliburn Competition documentary film The Cliburn: Playing on the Edge. Recordings Conlon has recorded extensively for the EMI, Erato, Capriccio and Sony Classical labels. He made his first recording for Telarc of the world premiere of Franz Liszt's St. Stanislaus oratorio, released in January 2004.

Several of these recordings individually have earned prestigious international awards, and in October 2002, the series was awarded the 2002 ECHO Classic Award for \\"Editorial Achievement of the Year.\\" Conlon has also inaugurated a new series of 20th century works with Capriccio, including a CD of works by Erwin Schulhoff with the Bayerischer Rundfunk, and a CD/DVD of the works of Viktor Ullmann with the G√ºrzenich Orchestra, which won the Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik (German Record Critics Award for Excellence).

Humans, as well as a portion of the other animals that utilize -DOPA in their biology, make it via biosynthesis from the amino acid -tyrosine. -DOPA is the precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), which are collectively known as catecholamines. Furthermore, -DOPA itself mediates neurotrophic factor release by the brain and CNS. -DOPA can be manufactured and in its pure form is sold as a psychoactive drug with the INN levodopa; trade names include Sinemet, Pharmacopa, Atamet, and Stalevo. As a drug, it is used in the clinical treatment of Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. -DOPA has a counterpart with opposite chirality, -DOPA. As is true for many molecules, the human body produces only one of these isomers (the -DOPA form). The enantiomeric purity of -DOPA may be analyzed by determination of the optical rotation or by chiral thin-layer chromatography (chiral TLC).J√ºrgen Martens, Kurt G√ºnther, Maren Schickedanz: \\"Resolution of Optical Isomers by Thin-Layer Chromatography: Enantiomeric Purity of Methyldopa\\", Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim) 1986, 319, S. 572‚àí574. (DOI:10.1002/ardp.19863190618) Medical use -DOPA crosses the protective blood-brain barrier, whereas dopamine itself cannot. Thus, -DOPA is used to increase dopamine concentrations in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. Once -DOPA has entered the central nervous system, it is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) is a required cofactor in this reaction, and may occasionally be administered along with -DOPA, usually in the form of pyridoxine. In humans, conversion of -DOPA to dopamine does not only occur within the central nervous system. Cells in the peripheral nervous system perform the same task. Thus administering -DOPA alone will lead to increased dopamine signaling in the periphery as well. Excessive peripheral dopamine signaling is undesirable as it causes many of the adverse side effects seen with sole L-DOPA administration. To bypass these effects, it is standard clinical practice to coadminister (with -DOPA) a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) such as carbidopa (medicines containing carbidopa, either alone or in combination with -DOPA, are branded as Lodosyn (Aton Pharma) Sinemet (Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited), Pharmacopa (Jazz Pharmaceuticals), Atamet (UCB), Syndopa and Stalevo (Orion Corporation) or with a benserazide (combination medicines are branded Madopar or Prolopa), to prevent the peripheral synthesis of dopamine from -DOPA. Inbrija (previously known as CVT-301) is an inhaled powder formulation of levodopa indicated for the intermittent treatment of off episodes in patients with Parkinson's disease currently taking carbidopa/levodopa. It was approved by the United Statee Food and Drug Administration on December 21, 2018 and is marketed by Acorda Therapeutics. Coadministration of pyridoxine without a DDCI accelerates the peripheral decarboxylation of -DOPA to such an extent that it negates the effects of -DOPA administration, a phenomenon that historically caused great confusion. In addition, -DOPA, co-administered with a peripheral DDCI, is efficacious for the short term treatment of restless leg syndrome. The two types of response seen with administration of -DOPA are: * The short-duration response is related to the half-life of the drug. * The longer-duration response depends on the accumulation of effects over at least two weeks, during which ŒîFosB accumulates in nigrostriatal neurons. In the treatment of Parkinson's disease, this response is evident only in early therapy, as the inability of the brain to store dopamine is not yet a concern. Biological role -DOPA is produced from the amino acid -tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. It is also the precursor for the monoamine or catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). Dopamine is formed by the decarboxylation of -DOPA by aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). -DOPA can be directly metabolized by catechol-O-methyl transferase to 3-O-methyldopa, and then further to vanillactic acid. This metabolic pathway is nonexistent in the healthy body, but becomes important after peripheral -DOPA administration in patients with Parkinson's disease or in the rare cases of patients with AADC enzyme deficiency. -Phenylalanine, -tyrosine, and -DOPA are all precursors to the biological pigment melanin. The enzyme tyrosinase catalyzes the oxidation of -DOPA to the reactive intermediate dopaquinone, which reacts further, eventually leading to melanin oligomers. In addition, tyrosinase can convert tyrosine directly to -DOPA in the presence of a reducing agent such as ascorbic acid. Side effects and adverse reactions The side effects of -DOPA may include: * Hypotension, especially if the dosage is too high * Arrhythmias, although these are uncommon * Nausea, which is often reduced by taking the drug with food, although protein reduces drug absorption. -DOPA is an amino acid, so protein competitively inhibits -DOPA absorption. * Gastrointestinal bleeding * Disturbed respiration, which is not always harmful, and can actually benefit patients with upper airway obstruction * Hair loss * Disorientation and confusion * Extreme emotional states, particularly anxiety, but also excessive libido * Vivid dreams or insomnia * Auditory or visual hallucinations * Effects on learning; some evidence indicates it improves working memory, while impairing other complex functions * Somnolence and narcolepsy * A condition similar to stimulant psychosis Although many adverse effects are associated with -DOPA, in particular psychiatric ones, it has fewer than other antiparkinsonian agents, such as anticholinergics and dopamine receptor agonists. More serious are the effects of chronic -DOPA administration in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, which include: * End-of-dose deterioration of function * On/off oscillations * Freezing during movement * Dose failure (drug resistance) * Dyskinesia at peak dose (levodopa-induced dyskinesia) * Possible dopamine dysregulation: The long-term use of -DOPA in Parkinson's disease has been linked to the so-called dopamine dysregulation syndrome. Clinicians try to avoid these side effects and adverse reactions by limiting -DOPA doses as much as possible until absolutely necessary. The long term use of L-Dopa increases oxidative stress through monoamine oxidase led enzymatic degradation of synthesized dopamine causing neuronal damage and cytotoxicity. The oxidative stress is caused by the formation of reactive oxygen species (H2O2) during the monoamine oxidase led metabolism of dopamine. It is further perpetuated by the richness of Fe2+ ions in striatum via the Fenton reaction and the intracellular auto-oxidation. The increased oxidation can potentially cause mutations in the DNA due to the formation of 8-oxoguanine which is capable of pairing with adenosine. History In work that earned him a Nobel Prize in 2000, Swedish scientist Arvid Carlsson first showed in the 1950s that administering -DOPA to animals with drug-induced (reserpine) Parkinsonian symptoms caused a reduction in the intensity of the animals' symptoms. In 1960/61 Oleh Hornykiewicz, after discovering greatly reduced levels of dopamine in autopsied brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, published together with the neurologist Walther Birkmayer dramatic therapeutic antiparkinson effects of intravenously administered -DOPA in patients. This treatment was later extended to manganese poisoning and later Parkinsonism by George Cotzias and his coworkers, for which they won the 1969 Lasker Prize.,Lasker Award 1969 Description, accessed April 1, 2013Tanya Simuni and Howard Hurtig. \\"Levadopa: A Pharmacologic Miracle Four Decades Later\\", in Parkinson's Disease: Diagnosis and Clinical Management (Google eBook).

The neurologist Oliver Sacks describes this treatment in human patients with encephalitis lethargica in his book Awakenings, upon which the movie of the same name is based. The first study reporting improvements in patients with Parkinson's disease resulting from treatment with L-dopa was published in 1968.New England Journal of Medicine [1968] 278 (11) : 630 (Cotzias, G) \\"L-Dopa for Parkinsonism\\" The 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was also related to -DOPA: the Nobel Committee awarded one-quarter of the prize to William S. Knowles for his work on chirally catalysed hydrogenation reactions, the most noted example of which was used for the synthesis of -DOPA. :Synthesis of -DOPA via hydrogenation with C2-symmetric diphosphine. Dietary supplements Herbal extracts containing -DOPA are available; high-yielding sources include Mucuna pruriens (velvet bean), and Vicia faba (broad bean), while other sources include the genera Phanera, Piliostigma, Cassia, Canavalia, and Dalbergia. Marine adhesion -DOPA is a key compound in the formation of marine adhesive proteins, such as those found in mussels. It is believed to be responsible for the water-resistance and rapid curing abilities of these proteins. -DOPA may also be used to prevent surfaces from fouling by bonding antifouling polymers to a susceptible substrate.Mussel Adhesive Protein Mimetics Research = Age-related macular degeneration = In 2015, a retrospective analysis comparing the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) between patients taking versus not taking -DOPA found that the drug delayed onset of AMD by around 8 years. The authors state that significant effects were obtained for both dry and wet AMD.

Provisions The Act is designed to deal with finds of treasure in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It legally obliges finders of objects which constitute treasure (as defined in the Act) to report their find to their local coroner within 14 days. An inquest led by the coroner then determines whether the find constitutes treasure or not. If it is declared to be treasure then the finder must offer the item for sale to a museum at a price set by an independent board of antiquities experts known as the Treasure Valuation Committee. Only if a museum expresses no interest in the item, or is unable to purchase it, can the finder retain it. For the purposes of the Act, 'Treasure' is defined as being: *All coins from the same find, if it consists of two or more coins, and as long as they are at least 300 years old when found. If they contain less than 10% gold or silver there must be at least 10 in the find for it to qualify. *Two or more prehistoric base metal objects in association with one another *Any individual (non-coin) find that is at least 300 years old and contains at least 10% gold or silver. *Associated finds: any object of any material found in the same place as (or which had previously been together with) another object which is deemed treasure. *Objects substantially made from gold or silver but are less than 300 years old, that have been deliberately hidden with the intention of recovery and whose owners or heirs are unknown. The Treasure Act allows for a reward up to the market value of the treasure to be shared among the finder and the tenants and/or owner of the land on which the treasure was found. The amount of the reward and how it is divided among the claimants is determined by the Treasure Valuation Committee.

Initially a socialist and a member of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), he led a breakaway group of right-wing 'Neosocialists' out of the SFIO in 1933. During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany, he founded the collaborationist National Popular Rally (RNP). In 1944, he became Minister of Labour and National Solidarity in Pierre Laval's government in Vichy, before escaping to the Sigmaringen enclave along with Vichy officials after the Allied landings in Normandy. Condemned in absentia for collaborationism, he died while still in hiding in Italy. Early life and politics Marcel D√©at was raised in a modest environment, which shared republican and patriotic values. After brilliant studies, he entered in 1914 the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS) after having been the student of Alain, a philosopher who was active in the Radical Party and who would write a deeply anti-militarist book after World War I. The same year, D√©at joined the SFIO. While he attended the ENS and worked to get a philosophy degree, World War I broke out. He joined the French Army and saw active duty, winning the L√©gion d'honneur and five bravery citations. By the war's end, D√©at had achieved the rank of captain. Under the pseudonym of Ta√´d, he then published Cadavres et maximes, philosophie d'un revenant (approximately translated by \\"Corpses and Maxims, Philosophy of a Ghost\\"), in which he expressed his horror of trenches, strong pacifist views, as well as his fascination for collective discipline and war camaraderie. When the war ended in 1918, he finished his studies at the √âcole Normale and passed his agr√©gation of philosophy, and oriented himself towards sociology under the direction of C√©lestin Bougl√©, a friend of Alain and also member of the Radical Party. In the meanwhile, D√©at taught philosophy in Reims. During the 1920 Tours Congress in which a majority of the SFIO decided to spin off to found the French Communist Party, Marcel D√©at positioned himself at the right wing of the SFIO, taking part in the groupe de la Vie socialiste current, alongside Pierre Renaudel. D√©at was elected municipal counsellor of Rheims in 1925, and then deputy for the Marne during a partial election in 1926. However, he lost his seat after the 1928 elections. In these times, L√©on Blum, the leader of the SFIO, tried to favor youths in the party, and decided to name D√©at secretary of the SFIO parliamentary group. After having been put in charge of the documentary center of the ENS by C√©lestin Bougli√©, D√©at now founded a documentary center for the SFIO deputies.  Neo- Socialist period  Marcel D√©at published in 1930 Perspectives socialistes (Socialist Perspectives), a revisionist work closely influenced by Henri de Man's planisme. Along with over a hundred articles written in La Vie Socialiste, the review of the SFIO's right-wing, Perspective socialistes marked the shift of D√©at from classical Socialism to Neosocialism. D√©at replaced class struggle by collaboration of classes and national solidarity, advocated corporatism as a social organization model, replaced the notion of \\"Socialism\\" by \\"Anti-capitalism\\" and supported an authoritarian state which would plan the economy and from which parliamentarism would be repealed.Zeev Sternhell, \\"Les convergences fascistes\\", pp. 533‚Äì564 in Nouvelle histoire des id√©es politiques (dir. by Pascal Ory), Pluriel Hachette, 1987 During the 1932 elections, he was elected deputy of the 20th arrondissement of Paris, beating the Communist Jacques Duclos ‚Äî who himself had gained the upper hand against L√©on Blum in 1928 in the same electoral district. D√©at and other Neosocialists were expelled from the SFIO at the 5 November 1933 Congress, for their revisionist views and disagreements with L√©on Blum's policies toward Prime Minister √âdouard Herriot, leader of the second Cartel des Gauches (Left-Wing Coalition). The official position of the SFIO was then to support the Cartel without participating in the government, which it considered \\"bourgeois.\\" The same year, D√©at joined the Socialist Party of France ‚Äì Jean Jaur√®s Union (PSdF) created the same year by Planist and Neosocialist elements expelled by the SFIO during the 1933 Congress. The new party's slogan was \\"Order, Authority and Nation\\". The expelled faction was a minority in the SFIO, but represented the majority of the SFIO parliamentary group. They were opposed both by the left wing of the SFIO, represented by Marceau Pivert, and by the SFIO's center, headed by Blum. The Neosocialists wanted to \\"reinforce the state against the economic crisis\\", open themselves to the middle classes and participate in non-Socialist governments. Without the support of the Socialists, D√©at lost his seat in the Chamber. Two years later, he joined the Socialist Republican Union (USR). He became Minister of Air in the \\"bourgeois\\" government of Albert Sarraut (Radical) but he quickly resigned his post over disputes with the Prime Minister. With the increasing threats represented by Nazi Germany, D√©at wanted to maintain peace at any cost. He returned to the Chamber of Deputies in 1936 as a delegate from Angoul√™me, and at first supported the Popular Front led by Blum before denouncing \\"Communist infiltration\\" of it. After Blum's replacement by √âdouard Daladier in 1938, which marked the end of the Popular Front, D√©at participated in the \\"Anti- Communist Rally.\\" The same year, he made explicit his support of the Munich Agreement in an article titled Mourir pour Danzig? (Why Die for Danzig?), published in the newspaper L'≈íuvre(newspaper). There, he argued that France should avoid war with Germany if the latter seized Poland ‚Äì the publication caused a widespread controversy, and propelled D√©at to national fame. D√©at would collaborate with L'≈íuvre during the entire period of Vichy France. Collaborationism A strong supporter of Germany's occupation of northern France in 1940, D√©at took up residence in Vichy France, and was initially a supporter of Philippe P√©tain. He attempted to create a single party to fully realize the aims of the \\"R√©volution nationale\\", the official, reactionary ideology of Vichy. Thereafter, he founded in February 1941 the National Popular Rally (RNP) which advocated Collaboration with Nazi Germany and antisemitism. When Vichy, then headed by P√©tain, did not become the Fascist state D√©at had in mind, he moved to occupied Paris and was funded by the Germans. The Germans forced D√©at at first to merge his new party (RNP) with Eug√®ne Deloncle's MSR (Social Revolutionary Movement), a far-right party, the successor of the Cagoule terrorist group. The merger was a failure and D√©at later expelled MSR elements from his party, before trying to form a unified front of Collaborationist parties. D√©at also founded, along with fellow Collaborationists Jacques Doriot and Marcel Bucard, the L√©gion des Volontaires Fran√ßais (LVF), a French unit of the Wehrmacht (later affiliated with the Waffen-SS). While reviewing troops from the LVF with Vichy figure Pierre Laval in Versailles on 27 August 1941, D√©at was wounded in an assassination attempt‚Äîcarried out by French Resistance member Paul Collette. After recovering, he became a supporter of Pierre Laval, who supported more reactionary policies than P√©tain and had become Prime Minister of the Vichy regime in 1942. Under the suggestion of the Germans, Marcel D√©at became on 16 March 1944, Minister of Labour and National Solidarity in Laval's cabinet. Exile After the Allied landings at Normandy and the fall of the Vichy government, D√©at fled to Germany and became an official of the Vichy government in exile at Sigmaringen. With the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, D√©at fled to Italy in April and assumed a new name, temporarily teaching in Milan and Turin. He was later taken in and hidden by a religious order in the convent of San Vito, near Turin, where he wrote his memoirs and lived undiscovered until his death in 1955. After the war, he had been convicted of treason and sentenced to death in absentia by a French court.

Honest services provides: > For the purposes of this chapter, the term \\"scheme or artifice to defraud\\" > includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of > honest services.. Elements There are three elements to mail and wire fraud: # A mail or wire communication # a scheme and Intent to defraud someone # a material deception Mail fraud applies only to United States domestic mailings and use of interstate carriers (UPS, FedEx) which must originate in one state, and successfully terminate pursuant to the address label inside another state, a transportation that is termed \\"interstate\\" (over which Congress has power to regulate) and does require that the mailing cross at least one state line into another state; wire fraud has been expanded by Congress to include foreign wire communication or interstate connections via (e.g.) an e-mail server or telephone switch or radio communication. Case law In McNally v. United States (1987), the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1341 and 1343 did not reach honest services fraud.McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987). Congress responded by passing 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1346. In Skilling v. United States (2010), the Court construed ¬ß 1346 to apply only to bribes and kickbacks.Skilling v. United States, 30 S. Ct. 2896 (2010). Mail fraud schemes There are many types of mail fraud schemes, including employment fraud, financial fraud, fraud against older Americans, sweepstakes and lottery fraud, and telemarketing fraud. Additional information about these various types of mail fraud schemes can be found on the United States Postal Inspection Service website. In the 1960s and 1970s, Chief Postal Inspector Martin McGee, also known as \\"The Top Sleuth\\" or \\"Mr. Mail Fraud\\", led his department in exposing and prosecuting numerous mail fraud swindles such as land sales, phony advertising practices, insurance ripoffs, and fraudulent charitable organizations that used the mail to facilitate their illegal activities. Abuse and overcriminalization The scope of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1341 and 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1343 is broad. These statutes have been held by the Supreme Court to encompass \\"everything designed to defraud by representations as to the past or present, or suggestions and promises as to the future.\\" Lower courts have progressively expanded this ruling, finding that the law \\"puts its imprimatur on the accepted moral standards and condemns conduct which fails to match the 'reflection of moral uprightness, of fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the general and business life of members of society'\\". As interpreted, these requirements are not difficult to meet; the Justice Department claims to defer federal prosecution for petty local fraud. In 1987, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in McNally v. United States to narrow the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes, ruling that the statute pertained only to schemes to defraud victims of tangible property, including money. In 1988, Congress enacted a new law that specifically criminalized schemes to defraud victims of \\"the intangible right of honest services\\" (honest services fraud).

The Code Book describes some illustrative highlights in the history of cryptography, drawn from both of its principal branches, codes and ciphers. Thus the book's title should not be misconstrued as suggesting that the book deals only with codes, and not with ciphers; or that the book is in fact a codebook.In contemporary English-language jargon, the word \\"code\\" is often used for any sort of secret communication, whether or not that communication is actually performed using a code in the strict sense. Some other languages, e.g., Polish, tend to do the opposite, and refer to both principal types of cryptography as \\"cipher\\", as in \\"Biuro Szyfr√≥w\\" (\\"Cipher Bureau\\"). Contents The Code Book covers diverse historical topics including the Man in the Iron Mask, Arabic cryptography, Charles Babbage, the mechanisation of cryptography, the Enigma machine, and the decryption of Linear B and other ancient writing systems. Later sections cover the development of public-key cryptography. Some of this material is based on interviews with participants, including persons who worked in secret at GCHQ. The book concludes with a discussion of \\"pretty good privacy\\" (PGP), quantum computing, and quantum cryptography. The book announced a \\"cipher challenge\\" of a series of ten progressively harder ciphers, with a cash prize of ¬£10,000 which has since been won.

Reactions AADC catalyzes several different decarboxylation reactions: * L-DOPA to dopamine ‚Äì a neurotransmitter * L-Phenylalanine to phenethylamine ‚Äì a trace amine which functions as a neuromodulator * L-Tyrosine to tyramine ‚Äì a trace amine neuromodulator * L-Histidine to histamine ‚Äì a neurotransmitter * L-Tryptophan to tryptamine ‚Äì a trace amine neuromodulator * 5-HTP to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) ‚Äì a neurotransmitter The enzyme uses pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6, as a cofactor. However, some of these reactions do not seem to bear much or any biological significance. For example, histamine is biosynthesised strictly via the enzyme histidine decarboxylase in humans and other organisms. Human serotonin biosynthesis pathway As a rate-limiting step In normal dopamine and serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter synthesis, AADC is not the rate-limiting step in either reaction. However, AADC becomes the rate-limiting step of dopamine synthesis in patients treated with L-DOPA (such as in Parkinson's disease), and the rate-limiting step of serotonin synthesis in people treated with 5-HTP (such as in mild depression or dysthymia). AADC is inhibited by carbidopa outside of the blood brain barrier to inhibit the premature conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine in the treatment of Parkinson's. In humans, AADC is also the rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of trace amines. Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency is associated with various symptoms as severe developmental delay, oculogyric crises and autonomic dysfunction. The molecular and clinical spectrum of AAAC deficiency is heterogeneous. The first case of AADC deficiency was described in twin brothers 1990. Patients can be treated with dopamine agonists, MAO inhibitors, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Clinical phenotype and response to treatment is variable and the long-term and functional outcome is unknown. To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype‚Äìphenotype correlation and outcome of these diseases their impact on the quality of life of patients, and for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies a patient registry was established by the noncommercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders (iNTD).  Genetics  The gene encoding the enzyme is referred to as DDC and located on chromosome 7 in humans. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and other gene variations have been investigated in relation to neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g., a one-base pair deletion at 601 and a four-base pair deletion at 722‚Äì725 in exon 1 in relation to bipolar disorder and autism. No direct correlation between gene variation and autism was found.

An overlock is a kind of stitch that sews over the edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an overlock sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called sergers in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows overlock machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An overlock sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam. Overlock sewing machines usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to over 9000 rpm, and most are used in industry for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products. Overlock stitches are extremely versatile, as they can be used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction. Overlocking is also referred to as \\"overedging\\", \\"merrowing\\", or \\"serging\\". Though \\"serging‚Äù technically refers to overlocking with cutters, in practice the four terms are used interchangeably. An overlock machine. History Overlock stitching was invented by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881. A Zoje 5 cone industrial overlocker J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements to be used in the mill‚Äôs operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four- thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger. A landmark lawsuit between Willcox & Gibbs and the Merrow Machine Company in 1905 established the ownership and rights to the early mechanical development of overlocking to the Merrow Machine Company. Throughout the early 20th Century, the areas of Connecticut, USA and New York, USA were the centres of textile manufacturing and machine production. Consequently, many overlock machine companies established themselves in the Northeastern United States. In 1964 several engineers and managers at one Japanese manufacturer redesigned the industrial serger they were currently manufacturing as a smaller, lighter model intended for home use. They presented their concept to their employer, and after it was rejected they quit and formed the Juki Corporation. Nick Tacony, founder of Tacony Corporation, introduced machinery for producing the overlock stich (so called \\"baby lock\\") to the United States market. This allowed sewing enthusiasts to produce clothing with finishing seams like those made by industrial garment manufacturers.\\"Baby Lock, the original home serger\\", VDTA Magazine, reprinted from SQE Professional February, 2012. Retrieved on October 21, 2016. Terminology In the United States, the term \\"overlocker\\" has largely been replaced by \\"serger\\". However, in other parts of the world such as Australia and the UK, the term \\"overlocker\\" is still in use. Types Overlock stitches are classified in a number of ways. The most basic classification is by the number of threads used in the stitch. Industrial overlock machines are generally made in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 thread formations. Each of these formations has unique uses and benefits: * 1-thread: End-to-end seaming or \\"butt-seaming\\" of piece goods for textile finishing. * 2-thread: Edging and seaming, especially on knits and wovens, finishing seam edges, stitching flatlock seams, stitching elastic and lace to lingerie, and hemming. This is the most common type of overlock stitch. * 3-thread: Sewing pintucks, creating narrow rolled hems, finishing fabric edges, decorative edging, and seaming knit or woven fabrics. * 4-thread: Decorative edging and finishing, seaming high-stress areas, mock safety stitches which create extra strength while retaining flexibility. * 5-thread: In apparel manufacturing, safety stitches utilizing two needles create a very strong seam. Two- and three- thread formations are also known as \\"merrowing\\" after the Merrow Machine Company. Additional variables in the types of overlock stitches are the stitch eccentric, and the stitch width. The stitch eccentric indicates how many stitches per inch there are, which is adjustable and can vary widely within one machine. Different stitch eccentrics create more or less dense and solid- looking edges. The stitch width indicates how wide the stitch is from the edge of the fabric. Lightweight fabrics often require a wider stitch to prevent pulling. Adding extra variation in stitch types is the differential feed feature, which allows feed to be adjusted; extra-fast feed creates a ruffled or \\"lettuce-leaf\\" effect. Finally, some merrowing machines contain parts to roll the fabric edge into the stitch for added durability. image:Overlock_1-thread.jpg1-thread, 5/8\\" wide, 12 stitches per inch image:merrow 300204.jpeg2-thread, 1/8\\" wide, 20 stitches per inch, with differential feed image:Overlock_4-thread.jpg3-thread, 5/32\\" wide, 17 stitches per inch image:Overlock_3-thread.jpg3-thread, 1/4\\" wide, 7 stitches per inch Formation 200px # When the needle enters the fabric, a loop is formed in the thread at the back of the needle. # As the needle continues its downward motion into the fabric, the lower looper begins its movement from left to right. The tip of the lower looper passes behind the needle and through the loop of thread that has formed behind the needle. # The lower looper continues along its path moving toward the right of the serger. As it moves, the lower thread is carried through the needle thread. # While the lower looper is moving from left to right, the upper looper advances from right to left. The tip of the upper looper passes behind the lower looper and picks up the lower looper thread and needle thread. # The lower looper now begins its move back into the far left position. As the upper looper continues to the left, it holds the lower looper thread and needle thread in place. # The needle again begins its downward path passing behind the upper looper and securing the upper looper thread (the needle goes between the metal and the thread) . This completes the overlock stitch formation and begins the stitch cycle all over again. Uses Overlock stitches are traditionally used for edging and light seaming.

Name DRO is an acronym which stands for Discos Radioactivos Organizados (). In the 1990s, the multinational label Eastwest Records acquired DRO. Following the acquisition the label was renamed DRO EastWest. History DRO Records was founded in Spain in 1982 by members of the band Aviador Dro. The label, which was one of the earliest independent labels in Spain, was created in order to give the band the resources to publish their music after being rejected by major labels. At the time, alternative music was emerging in Spain, especially around Madrid. DRO and other independent labels helped alternative artists distribute their music to wider audiences in the 1980s. Because of its role as a label for important artists during this time, the label has been called a pioneer of Spanish independent music. Many of the most successful Spanish artists of the 1980s were signed to DRO. In 1983, following the collapse of DRO's distributor, Pancoca, the independent label Grabaciones Accidentales (GASA) began handling DRO's distribution. GASA was absorbed into DRO in the following year. DRO also acquired another independent label, Twins, in 1989. The DRO-GASA group was ultimately acquired by Warner Music Group in 1993 due to financial pressures. The label current operates as DRO EastWest, SA.

It is named after Dimitri Pavlovitch Riabouchinsky. Riabouchinsky solids are typically used for analysing the behaviour of bodies moving through otherwise quiescent fluid (examples would include moving cars, or buildings in a windfield). Typically the streamline that touches the edge of the body is modelled as having no transverse pressure gradient and thus may be styled as a free surface after separation. The use of Riabouchinsky solids renders d'Alembert's paradox void; the technique typically gives reasonable estimates for the drag offered by bluff bodies moving through inviscid fluids.

In relation to computing, this includes the setup process of installing and/or performing initial configuration of a piece of hardware or software on a computer. This generally follows the point-of-sale or the interaction of an expert user. Overview The out-of-box experience is typically the first impression a product creates, such as the ease with which a buyer can begin using the product. For hardware products, a positive OOBE can be created with logical easy-to-follow instructions and good quality of manufacturing. For software, this often means easy installation and \\"Welcome\\" or \\"Initial Configuration\\" wizard screens that simplify elaborate set-up. Alternatively, the OOBE may be a preprogrammed set of displays that does not afford user input. The process of installing Microsoft Windows is a common example for OOBE. While the installation is largely automatic, the user must proceed through multiple screens to acknowledge software license terms, specify partition settings for the hard disk, enter the \\"product key\\", select international settings, a time zone, and also configure network settings. After the installation is complete, Microsoft Windows launches the \\"out-of-box application\\" that presents a full- screen wizard to assist the user with critical first steps of using Windows, such as creating a user account, registering the software with Microsoft (optional), configuring Internet connectivity, and product activation. Although this Microsoft application is named after OOBE, the real OOBE began when the user first turned on a new computer and was taken through the initial setup.

Born in Irun, Basque Autonomous Community, Spain, he is the brother of musicians √ç√±igo Muguruza and Jabier Muguruza and is one of the personalities interviewed for the documentary film The Basque Ball, released in 2003. Musical career Fermin Muguruza onstage with Kortatu Muguruza has taken part in more than twenty albums, and is one of the most important artists from the Basque Country. In 1983 he founded a fusion ska punk band called Kortatu with his brother I√±igo and drummer Treku Armendariz, among the first to popularise ska in Spain. They were clearly influenced by The Clash, in fact, Muguruza decided to create the band after seeing Strummer's band in a gig in Donostia on May 2, 1981.https://web.archive.org/web/20111215123947/http://homepage.mac.com/blackmarketclash/Bands/Clash/recordings/1981/81-05-02%20San%20Sebastian/81-05-02%20San%20Sebastian.html His song \\"Sarri, Sarri\\", a Basque cover of Toots & the Maytals' \\"Chatty Chatty\\", grew into a highly popular song during the 80s, where he makes an explicit reference to Joseba Sarrionaindia's artful escape from prison in 1985. In 1988 the group disbanded, but Fermin and I√±igo would come together again in 1990 to create the crossover group Negu Gorriak, along with Kaki Arkarazo, who had produced Kortatu's last records. In 1997 he collaborated with Dut. More recently he has developed a solo career, always defending the use of the Basque language and the need for social justice. Views on society and politics In interviews he has persistently denounced the policies of the Basque, Spanish and French governments and police bodies as well as of Spanish nationalist groups. At an international level, Fermin Muguruza holds acute left-wing views that lead him to criticize the U.S. government, corporations and the globalization process, all of which he denounces as imperialistic and homogenizing. In an interview with Freemuse, Muguruza speaks about his experience as a musician under the democracy of today. He has performed in concerts where fascists would come to his concerts with bombs, threatening him and his Basque hip-hop music. However, he experiences censorship within Spain for his political and social messages, but still performs and makes music, saying \\"authorities are afraid of my music because it is a tool against ignorance. And these authorities want the ignorance so that they can do what they want\\".Muguruza, Fermin. Interview . FreeMuse. 4 Apr. 2007. 20 Apr. 2008. Musically, he has been inspired by the, in his opinion, oppression of Spain over Basque Country. And although most of his lyrics are in Basque, his compositions are a melting pot of different cultures, with a big influence of Jamaican and electronic music (especially drum and bass), which he commonly mixes over Basque instruments. In his track \\"Euskal Herria Jamaika Clash!, Fermin Muguruza mixes Jamaican rhythms with sounds from Basque traditional musical instruments to produce unique musical hybrids that feature Basque heritage and culture.Muguruza, Fermin. \\"Euskal Herria Jamaika Clash\\".

He is also a basketballer, and won national secondary school titles in track and field. With 44 tries in 60 tests, Wilson is ranked twelfth on the list of highest test try scorers in rugby. Wilson is married to Adine Wilson (n√©e Harper), former captain of the New Zealand netball team. Rugby career =Early career= Wilson attended Cargill High School, where in one rugby game against James Hargest College he scored nine tries and a total of 66 points in a game with a final score of 102‚Äì6.http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland- times/news/150-stories-in-150-days/8242106/The-day-Wilson-scored-66-points He played for the national secondary schools side against Australia in 1992. =All Blacks rugby= Wilson was first selected for the All Blacks tour to Britain in 1993, making his debut as an All Black against London and SE Division on 23 October 1993 and his test debut against Scotland on 20 November 1993, scoring three tries in that game. He appeared 71 times for the All Blacks, including 60 tests and played in 1995 and 1999 Rugby World Cup, in the positions of wing and fullback. In Test matches he scored a total of 234 points: 44 tries, 1 conversion, 3 penalty goals, and 1 drop goal. Wilson announced his retirement at the end of the 2000 Super 12 season, but made a comeback in 2001, playing another 6 Test matches before finally retiring in 2002 at the relatively young age of 28. Wilson stated he would have stayed on had John Hart continued to coach the All Blacks. Up until 2002, he held the All Blacks try scoring record, with 44 tries from his 60 Test matches. This was later overtaken by fullback Christian Cullen and then Doug Howlett. In the 2003 New Year Honours, Wilson was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby. =Domestic rugby= Wilson played Super 12 rugby for the Highlanders and NPC rugby for Otago and Southland. He made his Southland debut in 1992, his Otago debut in 1993 and his Highlanders debut in 1996, with whom he remained for his entire career. Wilson made 56 appearances for Otago and 72 for the Highlanders. Cricket career Wilson played his provincial cricket for Otago, as an all-rounder - both a hard-hitting batsman and a right-arm fast-medium pace bowler. His international appearances were in four games of a One Day Internationals (ODI) series against Australia in the 1992‚Äì93 season, and again in an ODI series in 2005. The arrival of the Super 12 rugby competition - which overlaps the cricket season by more than six weeks - forced him to decide early on which international career to pursue, truncating his cricket career. On 22 February 2005, against Australia he played his first ODI match after nearly twelve years, which is a world record for the longest gap between two consecutive ODIs. Also he holds the record for the most consecutive ODI matches missed for a team by a player with 271 ODIS. After his retirement from rugby, Wilson resumed playing cricket at the provincial level and then on 12 January 2005, was again selected for the Black Caps to play a series of one day matches against a World XI in January. Selected later in the season, his form fell away and his last ODI was played against Australia in Wellington on 1 March 2005. Wilson retired from cricket at the end of the 2005 season due to persistent injury.  Post-retirement  After retirement Wilson spent the next few months breeding horses on a farm in Canterbury. In May 2006 he accepted a position with the Otago Rugby Football Union to promote rugby within the Otago-Southland region in a development role. Rugby officials stated that \\"it's a brand new position, essentially it's going to be talent identification, a lot of mentoring and coaching one-on-one stuff.\\" Wilson has since progressed to take on the role of Director of Rugby with the Otago Rugby Football Union, dealing with all aspects of the professional game. Wilson was the assistant coach of the North Harbour team in the ITM Cup between 2009 and 2012.Management In 2011 it was announced he would join the Auckland Blues as a skills coach for the 2012 season. In 2013 he became a Sport Radio Breakfast Host with Ian Smith and Nathan Rarere on LiveSPORT Radios Breakfast of Champions. On 7 September 2013, according to the live pregame commentary between All Blacks vs. Argentina, Jeff Wilson was signed by Sky Sports to commentate full-time for both rugby and cricket. Since then, Wilson has become a regular commentator for the channel.

It is the final resting place of Benjamin Franklin and his wife, Deborah. Four other signers of the Declaration of Independence are buried here, Benjamin Rush, Francis Hopkinson, Joseph Hewes and George Ross. Two more signers (James Wilson and Robert Morris) are buried at Christ Church just a few blocks away. The cemetery belongs to Christ Church, the Episcopal church founded in 1695 and place of worship for many of the famous Revolutionary War participants, including George Washington. The burial ground is located at 5th and Arch Streets, across from the Visitors Center and National Constitution Center. The Burial Ground was started in 1719, and it is still an active cemetery. The Burial Ground is open to the public for a small fee, weather permitting; about 100,000 tourists visit each year. When the Burial Ground is closed, one can still view Benjamin Franklin's gravesite from the sidewalk at the corner of 5th and Arch through a set of iron rails. The bronze rails in the brick wall were added for public viewing in 1858 by parties working at the behest of the Franklin Institute, which assumed the responsibility of defending Franklin's historic ties to Philadelphia after prominent Bostonians criticized the city's maintenance of the grave and erected a Franklin statue there.

He worked for Warren between 1964 and 1967, as head writer and Editor-in-Chief, in which roles he is credited with providing a mythology for Warren's classic Vampirella character, as well as penning her most compelling stories. '' After his departure from Warren in 1967, Goodwin would occasionally contribute stories over the next 15 years and even returned for a short stint as editor in 1974. =Famous name= Archie Goodwin's first prose story was published by Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, which warned him he could not use Archie Goodwin as a pen name because it was a Rex Stout character in the Nero Wolfe books. According to Goodwin's wife Anne T. Murphy, the magazine's editors \\"then were so delighted when he wrote back to say that it was his real name that they used the anecdote as the introduction to the story, which ran in the July 1962 issue.\\"Cooke, Jon B. interview with Goodwin's wife Anne T. Murphy p. 51 =Comic strips and DC Comics= From 1967 to 1980, Goodwin wrote scripts for King Features Syndicate, including the daily strip Secret Agent X-9, drawn by Al Williamson, as well as working on other strips including Captain Kate. His experience ghost writing Dan Flagg inspired \\"The Success Story\\" (drawn by Williamson, who had ghosted on Flagg) for Creepy #1 (1964), famed among comic strip fans for its EC style dark humor in depicting a creator whose only contribution to the strip that made him rich was his signature. Not limited to newspaper strips, he found work at the major comics companies as both writer and editor, working for Marvel Comics on titles including Fantastic Four and Iron Man. Goodwin worked briefly for DC Comics during the 1970s, where he edited the war comics G.I. Combat, Our Fighting Forces, and Star Spangled War Stories, and replaced Julius Schwartz as editor of Detective Comics for one year. Goodwin's collaboration with Walt Simonson on the \\"Manhunter\\" back-up feature in Detective Comics won several awards. Goodwin wrote the Batman lead feature in Detective Comics as well and collaborated with such artists as Jim Aparo, Sal Amendola, Howard Chaykin,Manning \\"1970s\\" in Dougall, p. 117 and Alex Toth.Manning \\"1970s\\" in Dougall, p. 117: \\"Two masters of sequential storytelling, writer Archie Goodwin and artist Alex Toth, joined forces for an unforgettable Batman lead story.\\" =Marvel Comics= Goodwin first worked for Marvel Comics in 1968 and was the original writer on the Iron Man series which launched that year. According to Goodwin, when he entered editor Stan Lee's office to apply for a job with Marvel, Lee was in the middle of writing an Iron Man story and handed him photostats of the pages he was working on for his writer's test. Goodwin speculated, \\"I assume if he had been working on Sgt. Fury, I'd have been writing Sgt. Fury. Thank God he wasn't writing Millie the Model when I walked in.\\" Goodwin and artist George Tuska co-created the supervillain the Controller in Iron Man #12 (April 1969). Luke Cage, the first African American superhero to star in an eponymous Marvel comic book series, was created by Goodwin and artist John Romita Sr. in June 1972.Sanderson, Peter \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 155: \\"In the early 1970s there was a wave of movies about African-American adventure heroes. Marvel responded to this with Luke Cage, Hero for Hire by writer Archie Goodwin and artist John Romita, Sr.\\" While briefly writing The Tomb of Dracula series, Goodwin and artist Gene Colan introduced the supporting character Rachel van Helsing.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 156: \\"Created by writer Archie Goodwin and artist Gene Colan, the blonde vampire slayer Rachel van Helsing debuted in The Tomb of Dracula #3.\\" Goodwin co-created (with Marie Severin) the first Spider-Woman, as well as writing her first appearance in Marvel Spotlight #32 (February 1977). Goodwin also co-designed Marvel's New Universe line and created four of the eight series in the line. He explained, \\"[Marvel editor-in-chief] Jim Shooter keeps saying of me: 'Well, here's this guy, in one meeting, he suddenly spews out half the ideas for the New Universe.' What that doesn't take into account is that for about five or six years I've had these half- formed notions and finally here is a situation where they would all fit in. ...it wasn't like I just went into the meeting and suddenly four concepts sprang full-blown from my brow.\\" Star Wars In 1976, Goodwin replaced Gerry Conway to become the eighth editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, with the understanding that it would only be temporary until a permanent replacement could be found. He ultimately resigned at the end of 1977 and was replaced by Jim Shooter. While Goodwin was editor-in-chief, Marvel secured the rights to publish the Star Wars film's comic adaptation and tie-in series, which then sold phenomenally well (helped by a dearth of other Star Wars merchandise at the time) at a point when the comics industry was in severe decline. Goodwin recalled about the Star Wars comic book, \\"That really worked ... but I can't take any credit for it. Roy Thomas is the one who brought it to Marvel, and he had to push a little bit to get them to do it.\\" He followed Thomas in adapting the Star Wars characters into an ongoing comic book with artist Carmine Infantino, as well as continuing the story (pre-Return of the Jedi) in a daily comic strip. Goodwin wrote the strips under his own name, although many websites and other sources erroneously claim he used the pseudonyms R.S. Helm and Russ Helm. Writer Mark Evanier corrected the matter by stating \\"Archie did write the Star Wars comic strip (as well as other Star Wars material) but only under his own name. Russ Helm was a completely different person writing under his own name.\\" During Goodwin and Infantino's tenure on Marvel's Star Wars series, it was one of the industry's top selling titles. He wrote comic book adaptations for Marvel of the two Star Wars sequels as well as other science- fiction films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Blade Runner. In 1979, Goodwin wrote an adaptation of the first Alien movie named Alien: The Illustrated Story which was drawn by Walt Simonson and published by Heavy Metal. Epic After Marvel Comics passed on publishing the American incarnation of Metal Hurlant (Heavy Metal), Editor-in-chief Jim Shooter was charged with producing an alternate title, which became Epic Illustrated.DeFalco, Tom \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 197: \\"This title was Marvel's attempt to compete with the popular Heavy Metal Magazine, which printed more mature material for the adult market and work by European artists...Former Editor-in-Chief Archie Goowdin oversaw all thirty-four issues.\\" It was initially edited by Rick Marschall, but Shooter approached publisher Stan Lee to urge a replacement: \\"I told Stan, 'There's one guy who could do this. I don't know if we can get him.' He said, 'Who's that?' 'Archie Goodwin.' The reason I didn't think we could get him is because he used to be my boss and I didn't know how he'd feel about coming back and me being his boss.\\"Thomas, Michael. \\"CBR News: Jim Shooter Interview: Part 1\\" Comic Book Resources, October 6, 2000. Accessed August 2, 2008. Shooter on Goodwin: \\"First and foremost, everyone loved Archie. Archie had a manner about him that you just couldn't not like him. While he was tough as nails, and he was probably the best that passed through this business, he managed to do it without offending anyone. He managed to be respected and remain friends with everyone and do his job.\\" Goodwin was at the time still working for Marvel as a writer, and Shooter recalls concocting a plan whereby the company \\"pretended that Archie reported to Stan. In fact, I was doing all the paperwork and all the employee reviews and the budgets\\" so that Goodwin could have the illusion of not working for his successor. In the autumn of 1979, Marschall was fired and Goodwin hired as Epic's editor. Shooter approached Goodwin after the moderate success of the Epic magazine and creator-owned graphic novels to produce a full-fledged line of creator-owned comics, Epic Comics. Goodwin initially balked at the additional workload, and Shooter turned the line over to Al Milgrom before Goodwin ultimately accepted editorship. Goodwin introduced the first English translation of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira and published English translations of the work of Jean Giraud, a.k.a. Moebius. =Return to DC= Goodwin returned to DC Comics as an editor and writer in 1989. He wrote the graphic novel Batman: Night Cries painted by Scott Hampton and published in 1992. Throughout the 1990s, Goodwin edited a number of Batman projects, including the Elseworlds miniseries Batman: Thrillkiller, and the Alan Grant-written/Kevin O'Neill-illustrated parody one-shot Batman: Mitefall, a take-off of the \\"Knightfall\\" saga, filtered through the character of Bat- Mite. Armageddon 2001 was a 1991 crossover event storyline. It ran through a self-titled, two issue limited series and most of the annuals DC published that year from May through October. Each participating annual explored potential possible futures for its main characters. The series was written by Goodwin and Dennis O'Neil and drawn by Dan Jurgens.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 250: \\"Armageddon 2001 was the DC Comics event of the summer...Written by Archie Goodwin and Denny O'Neil, and drawn by penciler Dan Jurgens.\\" Among Goodwin's most notable last editorial projects were Starman, written by James Robinson and first published by DC in 1994 and DC's Batman: The Long Halloween by Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb. Loeb and Sale's first work on Batman appeared in Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight Halloween Special #1 (Dec. 1993) edited by Goodwin.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 261: \\"Editor Archie Goodwin was on to something when he paired Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale on the first holiday special of the popular Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight series.\\" It is a testament to Goodwin that Loeb has said that Goodwin inspired their portrayal of Gotham police chief Jim Gordon in The Long Halloween and its sequel Batman: Dark Victory, while Robinson (who considered Goodwin both a mentor and close personal friend), continued to list Goodwin as a \\"Guiding Light\\" on later issues of Starman. Goodwin edited Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight and Azrael. Goodwin's Creepy work is cited by editor Mark Chiarello as informing the creation of the Batman: Black & White series.Chiarello, Mark. \\"Introduction\\" in Chiarello, Mark and Peterson, Scott (ed.s) Batman: Black and White (DC Comics, 1998) . Chiarello on Goodwin: \\"...probably the very best editor ever to work in comics, probably the very best writer ever to work in comics.\\" =Death= Goodwin died of cancer on March 1, 1998 after battling the disease for 10 years. Awards Goodwin's work won him a good deal of recognition in the industry, including both the 1973 Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division), and the 1974 Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) for the Manhunter series running in Detective Comics #437‚Äì443. In the same years, he also won Shazam Awards for Best Individual Short Story for \\"The Himalayan Incident\\" in Detective Comics #437 and for \\"Cathedral Perilous\\" in Detective Comics #441. In 1974, he also won Best Individual Feature-Length Story for \\"G√∂tterd√§mmerung\\" in Detective Comics #443. All story awards were shared with Walt Simonson for Manhunter episodes). Goodwin's work on Manhunter, in which he both updated an obscure Golden Age hero, and, in the series' last episode, took the daring approach of killing him off (one of the few comic book deaths that has actually \\"taken\\" and not been reversed or retconned away in the decades since it occurred) is very well regarded by both fans and other comics professionals. Goodwin stated in his final interview, \\"I think that Manhunter is one of just several projects that I've worked on that I consider a highlight in my career. It is something that I may never be able to top in a lot of ways. To have done that and for DC to have given me the opportunity to do that was great.\\" He won the 1992 \\"Bob Clampett Humanitarian\\" Eisner Award, and was named Best Editor by the Eisners in 1993. In 1998 he was entered into the Eisner Hall of Fame. In 2008, he was one of two recipients of that year's Bill Finger Award, which annually honors one living and one deceased comics creator. The award was presented July 25, 2008, during the 2008 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards ceremony at Comic-Con International. In 2007, Goodwin was inducted into the Oklahoma Cartoonists Hall of Fame in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, located in the Toy and Action Figure Museum. Appearances within comics He makes a cameo appearance in a crowd scene on the splash page of Ms. Marvel volume 1 #15, with thought balloons showing him trying out various nicknames for himself. In The Batman Adventures ‚Äî the first DC Comics spinoff of Batman: The Animated Series ‚Äî Goodwin appears as Mr. Nice, a super-strong but childishly-innocent super-villain. He is one of a screwball trio of incompetent super-villains that includes The Mastermind (a caricature of Mike Carlin) and The Perfessor (a caricature of Dennis O'Neil). Batman: Gotham Adventures #13 (June 1999) features the last appearance of the characters with Mr. Nice leaving the group to fulfill a prophecy, with the issue being dedicated to Archie Goodwin.Batman: Gotham Adventures #13 at the Grand Comics Database He is name-checked in issues of Marvel's Star Wars comics including in the alien-language words \\"Niwdoog Eihcra,\\" his name in reverse. A character based on him appears in issue #82 of Cerebus. He stands at the foot of the giant, living stone statue Thrunk and repeats everything Thrunk says - as if he is passing Thrunk's commands to the masses. Thrunk kills him when he steps on him. The scene has often been interpreted as an allegory for Goodwin's relationship with Jim Shooter, but Cerebus writer/artist Dave Sim denies this and said \\"I have nothing but the greatest respect for Archie and in no way intended anything but a little 'hello' to one of my favorite New Yorkers.\\" The airport in fictional Gotham City, home of the Batman, is named Goodwin, after Archie. In Marvel Comics' What The--?! #5, Goodwin appears as King Archibald the First in the short story The Alien-Ated Legion, which parodies the mature approach of Epic Comics. In the last panels, King Archibald says that he had never been interested in superhero comics.

He studied in the local public school of his hometown Guateque, in the Department of Boyac√° along his parents. He was son of Justiniano Olaya and Emperatriz Herrera, and had two brothers: Leonidas and Joaqu√≠n. When he was 12 years old, Olaya Herrera became known as the \\"child journalist of Guateque\\" after his foundation of a newspaper called \\"El Patriota\\" (The Patriot) for which he managed to obtain many exchanges with major newspapers like El Espectador based in Medell√≠n. Olaya Herrera studied Law in the Universidad Republicana (later to become the Free University of Colombia), and founded a weekly magazine called \\"El Estudiante\\" (The Student) in a newspaper format and which was written by hand.Luis Angel Arango Library: Enrique Olaya Herrera biography  Political career  Olaya Herrera is considered a member of the \\"Centennial Generation,\\" corresponding to the cohort of political and intellectual leaders prominent at the time of the first century after the independence war, roughly corresponding to the years from 1925 to 1940. Other members of this group were Alfonso L√≥pez Pumarejo, Laureano G√≥mez, Eduardo Santos, Mariano Ospina P√©rez, Roberto Urdaneta Arbel√°ez, Luis L√≥pez de Mesa, Luis Eduardo Nieto Caballero and others. As a journalist for the newspaper \\"El Autonomista\\" (The Autonomist) which was owned by Rafael Uribe Uribe and Ricardo Tirado Macias, Olaya Herrera made a name by criticizing the \\"Regeneration,\\" which was the name of the numerous policies that marked the return of the Country to a unitary state government system, as well as the rise of conservative, authoritarian, and clerical power following the Colombian Constitution of 1886. Back in his hometown of Guateque Olaya Herrera maintained a newspaper called \\"El Soldado Cubano\\" (The Cuban Soldier) in which he showed his admiration for Jos√© Mart√≠. The bipartisan political convulsion between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party had escalated and provoked the thousand days civil war. Most of the centennial generation was pushed into the war to follow their political beliefs. Olaya Herrera was also pushed into active participation in politics along the Liberal Party. Olaya Herrera radicalized and joined the armed liberal militias led by General Cen√≥n Figueredo. Olaya Herrera participated in a confrontation in the village of Nocaima, Cundinamarca. After the war Olaya Herrera continued studying Law and finally graduated with a thesis named \\"La Liberacion Condicional\\" (The Conditional Liberation), which was then published by the University. In 1904 he obtained a doctorate in jurisprudence and in 1906 he traveled to Belgium where he studied diplomacy and sociology at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles focusing on diplomacy, politics and journalism. Politics and constitutional reform Upon his return from Belgium, Olaya Herrera joined the cause against the government of General Rafael Reyes criticizing the treaties between the United States, Colombia and the loss of Panama. On March 13, 1909 Olaya Herrera publicly made a speech during a Liberal Party event against Reyes' dictatorship, in the presence of the most important members of the Liberal Party. This made him officially a part of the political movement against the dictatorship that was initiated by Nicol√°s Esguerra, Jos√© Vicente Concha and Miguel Abad√≠a M√©ndez, a movement that was called \\"Trecemarcismo,\\" from \\"13 de Marzo\\" (March the 13th), after his speech. Once President Reyes had to resign as a result of their action, on March 16, 1909, Olaya Herrera postulated himself for the Constituent Assembly and was later elected. He helped reform the Colombian Constitution of 1886 representing the then-existing Quesada Department. Among his party members participating were Rafael Uribe Uribe, Benjam√≠n Herrera, Gabriel Vargas Santos, Nicol√°s Esguerra, Tom√°s O. Eastman, Carmelo Arango and Tom√°s Quevedo √Ålvarez. The conservative deputies were Carlos E. Restrepo, Jos√© Vicente Concha, Pedro Nel Ospina, Guillermo Valencia, Emilio Forero, Hernando Holgu√≠n, Abel Carbonell, Pedro M. Carre√±o and Guillermo Quintero Calder√≥n. Both sides concluded the constitutional reform and initiated a period of reconciliation, political tolerance and a sense of nationalism. Carlos Eugenio Restrepo assumed the presidency of Colombia from 1910 until 1914 sponsored by the Republican Party which Olaya Herrera supported. President Restrepo appointed Olaya Herrera as the first Minister of Foreign Relations on August 7, 1910 until his resignation on November 23, 1911. During the administration of President Jorge Holgu√≠n, Olaya Herrera was appointed to the same office from 1921 until January 4, 1922, and also served as Minister of Agriculture. During the 1920s Olaya Herrera served also as a diplomat (mainly improving Colombian relations with the United States) and with the Colombian congress.  Presidential candidate  During the 1930s the Liberal leadership considered Olaya Herrera as the most suitable leader to recover the presidency from the Regeneration Movement hegemony. He was appointed by the Liberal party in Bogot√° as presidential candidate after a group of liberal and conservative friends registered him in the candidates list on January 22, 1930 in the town of Puerto Berr√≠o. Olaya Herrera named his political movement \\"Concentracion Nacional\\" (National Concentration). Olaya Herra was elected on February 9, 1930 with 369,962 votes against the other candidates Guillermo Valencia with 213,417 votes and Alfredo V√°zquez Cobo with 213,417 votes. Former conservative president Carlos Eugenio Restrepo adhered to Olaya Herrera among other moderate conservatives. Presidency Olaya Herrera's government was characterized at first by compromise, granting half of his government's public offices (mainly ministries and department governments) to the opposition party led by Laureano G√≥mez, although these party members were gradually pushed out of office. His term was characterized by a profound interest in social problems and reformation: worker's legislation, public assistance, protection to workers and farmers, and others. This agenda was interrupted by the urgent attention required by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and its repercussions all over the world. Olaya Herrera started a cycle of national protectionism, which fostered the development of industry with national capital as the basis for developmental stimuli, emphasizing internal demand. Imports decreased significantly, as did the prices of coffee in the international market. This protectionist trend promoted a nationalist conscience that turned the country further away from the free-trade policies of the nineteenth century. = Economic crisis and War with Peru = After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Olaya Herrera was given special faculties and dictated some economic reforms that developed at some level the industry and manage the debt generated by the war with Peru which originated in 1932 when the Amazonian port of Leticia was taken over by invading Peruvian soldiers. Previously, during the presidency of Jorge Holguin, the Salom√≥n‚ÄìLozano Treaty which defined the Peru-Colombia border was signed under secrecy. Once the treaty surfaced to the public in Peru, it became unpopular and a group of Peruvian citizens took the town of Leticia, which was colonized by both Peruvians and Colombians, and which the treaty had awarded to Colombia. General Alfredo V√°zquez Cobo was entrusted by Olaya Herrera to lead the armed operations in southern Colombia. The war was financed by the government and the solidarity of the citizens, who donated jewelry and money to support the cause. After many battles the war ended with the signing of the Rio Protocol in 1934, Villarica.galeon.com - Presidency of Enrique Olaya Herrera which upheld the Salom√≥n‚ÄìLozano Treaty and officially ended the border conflicts between Colombia and Peru. = Public works = During his government Olaya Herrera tried to develop the Colombian national industry and for this he supported many infrastructure projects mainly highways, maritime and fluvial ports (Barranquilla and Buenaventura) and railroads. He also supported public education and the exploration and exploitation of energy natural resources such as oil, mainly in the northern region of Catatumbo. Olaya Herrera also tried to improve the association between guilds, for which he created a Bank of Agrarian Credit (), the Mortgage Central Bank () to finance low income housing and for the improvement of production and exporting of Coffee products the government of Olaya Herrera also created the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia. He also helped introduce labor law reforms. = Public order issues = During the first two years as president there were two main foci of violence in the country; in Boyaca and Santander initially motivated by political reasons. The towns with most problems were Chiquinquir√°, the towns of western Boyaca, the Garcia Rovira Province in Santander Department and some towns in the areas of Norte de Santander Department, where conservative public employees resisted being in charge of liberals until the end of his government on August 7, 1934.  Post-government and death  After finishing his term as president in 1935 Olaya Herrera was appointed Minister of Foreign Relations during the government of Alfonso L√≥pez Pumarejo and later appointed ambassador of Colombia to the State of the Vatican City in Rome, Italy where he died on February 18, 1937 serving. He was planning to run for a presidential reelection upon his return to Colombia.

A tag team may be made up of wrestlers who normally wrestle in singles competition, but more commonly are made of established teams who wrestle regularly as a unit and have a team name and identity. In most team matches, only one competitor per team is allowed in the ring at a time. This status as the active or legal wrestler may be transferred by physical contact, most commonly a palm-to-palm tag which resembles a high five. The team-based match has been a mainstay of professional wrestling since the mid-twentieth century, and most promotions have sanctioned a championship division for tag teams. America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris, (back) James Storm and valet Gail Kim)), a former tag team that wrestled for TNA History The first \\"World\\" tag team championship was promoted in San Francisco in the early 1950s. Tag matches with three-man teams were developed, and in some territories, a championship division was instituted for these teams, but the concept failed to become widely popular; outside Mexico, multi- man tag matches are seen as a special attraction. Typically, a tag team championship is awarded to and defended by a team of two. However, during the 1970s and 1980s, a dominant trio in the NWA known as The Fabulous Freebirds won several regional tag team championship and were allowed to employ any combination of the group's members in their title defenses. In kayfabe, this made it difficult for challengers to prepare for their upcoming title fights since the challengers didn't know exactly who they were facing. This was an effective gimmick and is still utilized by other wrestling companies. The stipulation has become traditionally known as the \\"freebird rule\\". A common storyline is former tag team partners turning on each other, which will invariably ignite a feud. This can be used when one member is being called on to develop a new gimmick.

However, only one wrestler from each team, called the \\"legal man\\" is allowed in the ring at a time (although heels will often flout this rule in an attempt to gang up on a single opponent). All other members of the team wait outside the ropes (on the ring apron or the floor) in the team's specified corner. Only an active/legal wrestler is allowed to score a fall or have a fall scored against him/her. But any wrestler, legal or outside, may face disqualification for himself or his team for violating rules. Once a tag is made, the wrestler tagging out has a grace period (typically five to ten seconds) to leave the ring before risking disqualification. Offensive cooperation from a team member is allowed during this time window; thus it is rather commonplace for both members of a team, especially heel teams, to milk this grace period and have two men in the ring simultaneously with only one member of an opposing team The following are standard requisites for making a legal tag: * Both feet of the wrestler on the outside must be flat on the apron. * The wrestler outside the ring must be touching the tag rope tied in the corner (or the turnbuckle pad in-rings which have no tag rope) with hand outstretched OVER top rope, not through it. * Tags are legal as long as the two team members touch. * The referee has to see and/or hear the contact between the two wrestlers in order for the tag to be legal. As the ultimate authority over the match, a referee may overlook any of these at his discretion, and during the frenzied action, often will be more lenient with them. In some multi-man tag matches in lucha libre, a wrestler can make himself the team's legal man simply by setting foot in the ring, and his partner then leaves. This allows for action to become nearly continuous. Two referees, one stationed inside the ring and one on the floor, are employed to maintain order for this type of match. Types of tags Tara (right) tags her partner, Gail Kim, into the match while they isolate a Blossom Twin In independent discussion and analysis of matches, certain terms are used to describe specific scenarios involving tag team matches. These are planned and timed to inject drama into a match. One spot common to many tag team match is the hot tag. One member of one team is in the ring, too weakened to move or otherwise impaired, while his partner watches helplessly, struggling to reach him for a tag. The tension builds as the legal man is unable to tag out until something happens (a second wind, miscommunication between the opponents or another stroke of luck) that allows the first team to tag and reverse the momentum of the match in their favor. When done well, this results in a large audience reaction, and was the typical climax of tag matches for decades. WWE employs this tactic in nearly every tag team match to the point that they fired a referee in 2008 after a botched finish that, while the match produced the intended finish, didn't feature a hot tag. A common variation on the hot tag sees both wrestlers from the heel team attacking a face, while his partner protests to the referee about this bending of the rules (and therefore, unintentionally \\"distracting\\" the referee away from the heels). Eventually the weakened face wrestler does make the tag to his partner, who comes in as the fresh man and is able to take on both opponents quite easily. A blind tag is a legal tag made without the legal opponent's knowledge, usually while his back is turned. This allows the team who uses it an opportunity to confuse the legal opponent, who turns to face what he assumes to be his opponent only to be attacked by the true legal man, often from behind. Other terminology A tag team match involving more than two wrestlers per team is often referred to by the total number of people involved (e.g. a six-man tag team match involves two teams of three), while a tag team match involving more than two teams is referred to by normal qualifiers (e.g. a triple threat tag team match involves three teams of two). In lucha libre, the basic tag team match is referred to as Lucha de Parejas (Doubles Fight), a six-man match as a Lucha de Trios, and an eight-man match as a Lucha At√≥mica (Atomic Fight). A \\"bookend\\" tag team is a (sometimes derogatory) term for a tag team where the members look and/or dress alike (e.g., The Killer Bees, the British Bulldogs, Los Conquistadores, the Hart Foundation, etc.). Bookends are common in North America, Europe and Mexico, but not in Japan as the promotion of wrestlers to singles championships in that country is based in part on their work in tag team matches.

The Enzyme commission has catalogued more than 140 PLP-dependent activities, corresponding to ~4% of all classified activities. The versatility of PLP arises from its ability to covalently bind the substrate, and then to act as an electrophilic catalyst, thereby stabilizing different types of carbanionic reaction intermediates. Role as a coenzyme PLP acts as a coenzyme in all transamination reactions, and in certain decarboxylation, deamination, and racemization reactions of amino acids. The aldehyde group of PLP forms a Schiff-base linkage (internal aldimine) with the Œµ-amino group of a specific lysine group of the aminotransferase enzyme. The Œ±-amino group of the amino acid substrate displaces the Œµ-amino group of the active-site lysine residue in a process known as transaldimination. The resulting external aldimine can lose a proton, carbon dioxide, or an amino acid sidechain to become a quinonoid intermediate, which in turn can act as a nucleophile in several reaction pathways. In transamination, after deprotonation the quinonoid intermediate accepts a proton at a different position to become a ketimine. The resulting ketimine is hydrolysed so that the amino group remains on the complex. In addition, PLP is used by aminotransferases (or transaminases) that act upon unusual sugars such as perosamine and desosamine. In these reactions, the PLP reacts with glutamate, which transfers its alpha-amino group to PLP to make pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP). PMP then transfers its nitrogen to the sugar, making an amino sugar. PLP is also involved in various beta-elimination reactions such as the reactions carried out by serine dehydratase and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3-dehydratase (ColD). It is also active in the condensation reaction in heme synthesis. PLP plays a role in the conversion of levodopa into dopamine, facilitates the conversion of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and allows SAM to be decarboxylated to form propylamine, which is a precursor to polyamines.  Role in human body  Pyridoxal phosphate has a plenty roles in human body. A few examples below: * Metabolism and biosynthesis of serotonine. Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of aromatic L-amino acids decarboxylase. This allows for conversion of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) into serotonine (5-HT). This reaction takes place in serotonergic neurons. * Metabolism and biosythesis of histamine. Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of L-histidine decarboxylase. This allows for conversion of histidine into histamine. This reaction takes place in Golgi apparatus in mast cells and in basophils. Next, histamine is stored in granularity in mast cells as a complex with acid residues of heparin proteoglycan while in basophils as a complex with chondroitine sulfate. * Metabolism and biosynthesis of GABA (Œ≥-aminobutyric acid). Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This allows for conversion of glutamate into GABA. Reaction takes place in cytoplasm of termination of GABA-ergic neurons, therefor vitamine B6 deficiency may cause epileptic seizures in children. Pyridoxal phosphate also participates in the oxidative deamination of GABA, where it is a cofactor of GABA aminotransferase. * Metabolizm of ornithine. Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of ornithine carboxylase. * Transamination. Pyridoxal phosphate takes part in decomposition and synthesis of amino acids. Non-classical examples of PLP PLP is also found on glycogen phosphorylase in the liver, where it is used to break down glycogen in glycogenolysis when glucagon or epinephrine signals it to do so. However, this enzyme does not exploit the reactive aldehyde group, but instead utilizes the phosphate group on PLP to perform its reaction. Although the vast majority of PLP-dependent enzymes form an internal aldimine with PLP via an active site lysine residue, some PLP-dependent enzymes do not have this lysine residue, but instead have a histidine in the active site. In such a case, the histidine cannot form the internal aldimine, and, therefore, the co-factor does not become covalently tethered to the enzyme. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3-dehydratase (ColD) is an example of such an enzyme. Human Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 regulates one-carbon transfer reactions required for amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and exists in dimeric and tetrameric forms. The dimeric SHMT2 variant is a potent inhibitor of the BRISC deubiquitylase enzyme complex, which regulates immune- based cell signaling. Recent studies show that SJMT2 tetramerization is induced by PLP. This prevents interaction with the BRISC deubiqutylase complex, potentially linking vitamin B6 levels and metabolism to inflammation. Catalytic mechanism The pyridoxal-5‚Ä≤-phosphate-dependent enzymes (PLP enzymes) catalyze myriad reactions. Although the scope of PLP-catalyzed reactions appears to be immense, the unifying principle is the formation of an internal lysine-derived aldimine. Once the amino substrate interacts with the active site, a new Schiff base is generated, commonly referred to as the external aldimine. After this step, the pathway for each PLP-catalyzed reactions diverge. Mechanistic examples: racemization of alanine and elimination of cysteine. Specificity Specificity is conferred by the fact that, of the four bonds of the alpha-carbon of the amino acid aldimine state, the bond perpendicular to the pyridine ring will be broken (Dunathan Stereoelectronic Hypothesis). Consequently, specificity is dictated by how the enzymes bind their substrates. An additional role in specificity is played by the ease of protonation of the pyridine ring nitrogen. PLP-enzymes PLP is retained in the active site not only thanks to the lysine, but also thanks to the interaction of the phosphate group and a phosphate binding pocket and to a lesser extent thanks to base stacking of the pyridine ring with an overhanging aromatic residue, generally tyrosine (which may also partake in the acid‚Äìbase catalysis). Despite the limited requirements for a PLP binding pocket, PLP enzymes belong to only five different families. These families do not correlate well with a particular type of reaction. The five families are classified as fold types followed by a Roman numeral. * Fold Type I ‚Äî aspartate aminotransferase family * Fold Type II ‚Äî tryptophan synthase family * Fold Type III ‚Äî alanine racemase family (TIM-barrel) * Fold Type IV ‚Äî D-amino acid aminotransferase family * Fold Type V ‚Äî glycogen phosphorylase family Biosynthesis =From vitamers= Animals are auxotroph for this enzyme co-factor and require it or an intermediate to be supplemented, hence its classification as a vitamin B6, unlike MoCo or CoQ10 for example. PLP is synthesized from pyridoxal by the enzyme pyridoxal kinase, requiring one ATP molecule. PLP is metabolized in the liver. =Prototrophy= Two natural pathways for PLP are currently known: one requires deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), while the other does not, hence they are known as DXP-dependent and DXP-independent. These pathways have been studied extensively in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. Despite the disparity in the starting compounds and the different number of steps required, the two pathways possess many commonalities. DXP-dependent biosynthesis The DXP-dependent biosynthetic route requires several steps and a convergence of two branches, one producing 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate from erythrose 4-phosphate, while the other (single enzyme) producing deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate. The condensation product of 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate and deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate is pyridoxine 5'-phosphate. The condensation is catalyzed by PNP synthase, encoded by pdxJ, which creates PNP (pyridoxine 5' phosphate). The final enzyme is PNP oxidase (pdxH), which catalyzes the oxidation of the 4' hydroxyl group to an aldehyde using dioxigen, resulting in hydrogen peroxide. The first branch is catalyzed in E. coli by enzymes encoded by epd, pdxB, serC and pdxA. These share mechanistical similarities and homology with the three enzymes in serine biosynthesis (serA (homologue of pdxB), serC, serB ‚Äî however, epd is a homologue of gap), which points towards a shared evolutionary origin of the two pathways. In several species there are two homologues of the E. coli serC gene, generally one in a ser operon (serC), and the other in a pdx operon, in which case it is called pdxF. center A \\"serendipitous pathway\\" was found in an overexpression library that could suppress the auxotrophy caused by the deletion of pdxB (encoding erythronate 4 phosphate dehydrogenase) in E. coli. The serendipitous pathway was very inefficient, but was possible due to the promiscuous activity of various enzymes. It started with 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (the product of the serA- encoded enzyme in serine biosynthesis) and did not require erythronate-4-phosphate. 3PHP was dephosphorylated, resulting in an unstable intermediate that decarboxylates spontaneously (hence the presence of the phosphate in the serine biosynthetic pathway) to glycaldehyde. Glycaldehyde was condensed with glycine and the phosphorylated product was 4-phosphohydroxythreonine (4PHT), the canonical substate for 4-PHT dehydrogenase (pdxA). DXP-independent biosynthesis The DXP-independent PLP-biosynthetic route consists of a step catalyzed by PLP-synthase, an enzyme composed of two subunits. PdxS catalyzes the condensation of ribulose 5-phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and ammonia, this latter molecules is produced by PdxT which catalyzes the production of ammonia from glutamine. PdxS is a (Œ≤/Œ±)8 barrel (also known as a TIM-barrel) that forms a dodecamer. =Abiotic synthesis= The widespread utilization of PLP in central metabolism, especially in amino acid biosynthesis, and its activity in the absence of enzymes, suggests PLP may be a \\"prebiotic\\" compound‚Äîthat is, one that predates the origin of organic life (not to be confused with prebiotic compounds, substances which serve as a food source for beneficial bacteria). In fact, heating NH3 and glycoaldehyde spontaneously forms a variety of pyridines, including pyridoxal. Under certain conditions, PLP is formed from cyanoacetylene, diacetylene, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, water, and a phosphoric acid. Inhibitors Several inhibitors of PLP enzymes are known. One type of inhibitor forms an electrophile with PLP, causing it to irreversibly react with the active site lysine. Acetylenic compounds (e.g. propargylglycine) and vinylic compounds (e.g. vinylglycine) are such inhibitors. A different type of inhibitor inactivates PLP, and such are Œ±-methyl and amino-oxy substrate analogs (e.g. Œ±-methylglutamate). Still other inhibitors have good leaving groups that nucleophilically attack the PLP. Such is chloroalanine, which inhibits a large number of enzymes. Examples of inhibitors: * Levothyroxine In rats given only 10 ¬µg of D , L-thyroxine daily for 15 days, liver cysteine desulfhydrase activity disappears and serine and threonine dehydrase and alanine glutamate transaminase activities decrease about 40%. Either in vivo feeding of pyridoxal-5-phosphate or in vitro addition of the coenzyme to the liver preparations restores full activity to all these enzymes, and the slight in vitro inhibition in the presence of 10‚àí5 M thyroxine is also reversed by pyridoxal-5-phosphate. * The inactive form pyridoxine competitively inhibits the active pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. Consequently, symptoms of vitamin B6 supplementation in the pyridoxine form can mimic those of vitamin B6 deficiency; an effect which can be avoided by supplementing with P5P instead. * AlaP (alanine phosphonate) inhibits alanine racemases, but its lack of specificity has prompted further designs of ALR inhibitors. * Gabaculine and Vigabatrin inhibit GABA aminotransferase * Canaline and 5-fluoromethylornithine inhibit ornithine aminotransferase * Amino-oxy SAM inhibits ACC synthase  PLP Deficiency and Epilepsy  Inborn errors leading to PLP deficiency can result in Vitamin B6-responsive epilepsy. Two types of epilepsy related to PLP deficiency are pyridoxine dependent epilepsy and pyridoxal phosphate dependent epilepsy. Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy is mainly caused by mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene. Pyridoxal phosphate dependent epilepsy is mainly caused by mutations in the PNPO gene. These conditions are mainly seen in infants, beginning soon after birth or in some cases before birth.

Biography Medem was born on 21 October 1958 in San Sebasti√°n, Basque Country, Spain and showed an interest in movies since childhood, when he would take his father's Super 8 camera and shoot at night, while nobody was paying attention. After college graduation (where he earned degrees in Medicine and General Surgery) he worked as a film critic and later as a screenwriter, assistant director and editor. After a few shorts he directed his first full-length feature, Vacas ('Cows') for which he won a Goya Award. After this film he directed The Red Squirrel and Earth, both receiving good reviews at Cannes. In his next film, Lovers of the Arctic Circle, which has been compared to the works of Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski, his next film was Sex and Lucia. After this film he directed and produced La pelota vasca ('The Basque Ball'), documentary film about the political problems of the Basque Country, which caused a furor amongst some victims of terrorism and far right politicians.

With version 13, Morsch retired, and his engine was first replaced by Gyula Horvath's Pandix, and then with Fritz 15, Vasik Rajlich's Rybka. The latest version of the consumer product is Fritz 17. This version supports 64-bit hardware and multiprocessing by default. History In 1991, the German company ChessBase approached the Dutch chess programmer Frans Morsch about writing a chess engine to add to the database program which they sold. Morsch adapted his Quest program, and ChessBase released it for sale that year as Knightstalker in the U.S. and Fritz throughout the rest of the world. The German player Fritz Baumbach was the world correspondence chess champion from 1983 to 1989, so this may have influenced the naming. In 1995, Fritz 3 won the World Computer Chess Championship in Hong Kong, beating an early version of Deep Blue. This was the first time that a program running on a consumer level microcomputer defeated the mainframes that had previously dominated this event. In 1998, Fritz 5 was released including a Friend mode which would cause the engine to adjust its strength of play over the course of a game based on the level the opponent appeared to be playing. Fritz 5.32 was released soon after replacing the 16 bit architecture with a 32 bit one. In 2002, Deep Fritz drew the Brains in Bahrain match against Vladimir Kramnik 4‚Äì4. Fritz 7, which was released that year, included the ability to play on the Playchess server. In November 2003, X3D Fritz, a version of Deep Fritz with a 3D interface, drew a four-game match against Garry Kasparov. Fritz 8, which appeared around this time, provided a 3D Spanish room setting for games to take place. Fritz 9 added a 3D virtual opponent, the Turk. In 2004, Fritz 8 added a Handicap and Fun mode, allowing players to choose the Elo rating and style that the engine will use. On June 23, 2005, in the ABC Times Square studios, the AI Accoona Toolbar, driven by a Fritz 9 prototype, drew against the then FIDE World Champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov. From November 25 to December 5, 2006 Deep Fritz played a six-game match against Kramnik in Bonn. Fritz was able to win 4‚Äì2.\\"New chess duel Man vs Machine\\", Chessbase, 3 January 2006\\"Kramnik vs Deep Fritz: Computer wins match by 4:2\\", Chessbase, 5 December 2006 In this match, Kramnik blundered away game 2, allowing a mate in one.Susan Polgar: Blunder of the century? Biggest blunder ever? On SSDF's September 2010 rating list, Deep Fritz 12 placed sixth with a rating of 3110, 135 points higher than Deep Junior 10.1, and 103 points lower than no. 1 ranked Deep Rybka 3 x64. Deep Fritz 11 is eighth on the same list, with a rating of 3073. On the December 2010 edition of the CCRL rating list, Deep Fritz 12 placed sixth with an Elo rating of 3088, 29 points higher than Deep Junior 11.1a x64, and 174 points lower than no. 1 ranked Deep Rybka 4 x64. Deep Fritz 11 is also sixth on the same list, with a rating of 3097. Fritz has not kept up with modern advances, attaining only 14th on the 2013 CCRL rating list and not participating in any world championships since 2004. The 2013 release of Deep Fritz 14 switched engines from the original author Frans Morsch's to Pandix, written by Gyula Horv√°th. A long time participant in world computer championships since 1984, Pandix was substantially rewritten in 2009, and has been a strong contender since then. Fritz 15 was released on November 25, 2015 with new features, including switching to Vasik Rajlich's famous Rybka engine. Handicap and Fun mode was dropped, but there is now a function for pawn and piece handicaps (e.g. ceding pawn and move). Fritz 16 was released on November 12, 2017 with a new Easy game mode which provides for assisted calculation marking good moves with a green circle and bad moves with a red one. This version again uses the Rybka engine. Fritz 17 was released on November 12, 2019. The Fritz engine in other companies The American company Viva Media, now a division of Encore, Inc. has been licensed to sell many versions of the Fritz engine and GUI combination. British game publisher Eidos Interactive (now part of Square Enix Europe) published Fritz 6 and 7. In 1998, the German company Data Becker released the program 3D Schach Genie, containing the Shredder engine and Fritz interface. The German company Purple Hills sold Fritz 6 through 12 as Profi Schach 1 through 7. British Excalibur Publishing has published Fritz 9 through 14. American book publisher Simon & Schuster featured the Fritz engine in their Extreme Chess program, as have German game publisher TopWare Interactive in their Battle vs. Chess game.  Fritz and Chesster  Fritz and Chesster is a series of introductory chess programs based on the Fritz engine. Each program provides basic tutorials and games based on one aspect of chess, allowing children to learn the basic rules easily without overwhelming them with too many options at once. Games follow Prince Fritz, the son of King White, and his cousin Bianca, as Chesster the rat (among others) teaches them the fundamentals of chess so that they can defeat King Black. There are three programs available in the series: * Learn To Play Chess With Fritz and Chesster covers all the rules of chess, from basic moves to castling and stalemate. * Learn To Play Chess With Fritz and Chesster 2: Chess in the Black Castle covers chess strategy and tactics, chess openings, and endgames. * Learn To Play Chess With Fritz and Chesster, part 3: Chess for Winners contains opening schemes, tactics, recognizing checkmates, endgame training, and key squares.

It stars Rutger Hauer as a seemingly suicidal and homicidal maniac and C. Thomas Howell as his primary victim. It was released in the United States on February 21, 1986. The film was met with tepid critical response and grossed about $5.8 million. Plot Jim Halsey, a young man delivering a car from Chicago to San Diego, spots a man hitchhiking in the West Texas desert and gives him a ride. The hitcher, John Ryder, is brooding and evasive. When Jim passes a stranded car, Ryder forces his leg down on the accelerator. Ryder states he murdered the driver and intends to do the same to Jim, threatening him with a switchblade. Terrified, Jim asks what Ryder wants. He replies, \\"I want you to stop me.\\" When Jim realizes that Ryder never put on his seat belt and the car's passenger door is ajar, he shoves him out the door. Relieved, Jim continues on his journey. When he sees Ryder in the back of a family car, Jim tries to warn them but becomes involved in an accident. He later comes across the family's blood-soaked car and vomits. At an abandoned gas station, Ryder corners Jim but simply tosses him the keys he took from Jim's car. After Ryder leaves with a trucker, Jim encounters him again at another gas station, where the truck nearly runs him down as it crashes into the pumps. As Jim flees, Ryder causes the station to explode. At a roadside diner, Jim meets Nash, a waitress, and calls the police. He finds a severed finger in his food and realizes Ryder is present. The police arrest Jim, as Ryder has framed Jim for his murders. Though the police doubt his guilt, they lock him up overnight as protocol. When Jim wakes, he finds the cell door unlocked and all the officers dead. He panics and flees with a revolver. At a gas station, he sees two officers, takes them hostage, and speaks to Captain Esteridge, the officer in charge of the manhunt for Jim, on the radio. As Esteridge convinces Jim to surrender, Ryder pulls up and kills the two officers. The patrol car crashes, and Ryder disappears again. After briefly considering suicide, Jim reaches a cafe, where Ryder confronts him. After pointing out Jim's revolver is unloaded, Ryder leaves him several bullets and departs. Jim boards a bus, where he meets Nash and attempts to explain his situation. After a police car pulls over the bus, Jim surrenders, and the furious officers accuse him of killing their colleagues and attempt to kill him. Nash appears with Jim's revolver, disarms the officers, and flees with Jim in their patrol car. As the police chase after them, Ryder joins the chase and murders the officers by causing a massive car accident. Jim and Nash abandon the patrol car and hike to a motel. While Jim is in the shower, Ryder abducts Nash. Jim searches for her and is discovered by Esteridge, who takes Jim to two trucks with Nash tied between them with a gag in her mouth. Ryder is at the wheel of one truck and threatens to tear Nash apart. Esteridge tells Jim that his men cannot shoot Ryder as his foot will slip off the clutch, which would cause the truck to roll and kill Nash. Jim enters the cab with Ryder, who gives him a revolver and tells him to shoot, but Jim is unable to do so. Ryder, disappointed, releases the clutch, killing Nash. Ryder is taken into custody. Esteridge gives Jim a ride, but Jim, believing the police cannot hold Ryder, takes Esteridge's revolver and vehicle to chase down Ryder's prison bus. Ryder kills the deputies and leaps through Jim's windshield as the bus crashes. Jim slams on his brakes, sending Ryder through the windshield and onto the road. Ryder challenges Jim to run him over, which he does. As Jim leaves his car to observe Ryder's body, Ryder jumps up, and Jim shoots him repeatedly with a shotgun.

When no offers came, he moved from New York City to Austin, Texas, taking a drive-away car cross-country. While driving from one city to another, he got the idea for a film from The Doors song \\"Riders on the Storm\\". He found that the \\"elements of the song ‚Äì a killer on the road in a storm plus the cinematic feel of the music ‚Äì would make a terrific opening for a film\\". Red had a lot of time to think about the song and it inspired ideas for the story. During his seven-month stay in Austin, he drove a taxi cab and wrote The Hitcher. In 1983, he sent a letter to several Hollywood producers asking if he could send them a copy of the screenplay for The Hitcher. His letter concluded: \\"It (the story) grabs you by the guts and does not let up and it does not let go. When you read it, you will not sleep for a week. When the movie is made, the country will not sleep for a week\\". Script development executive David Bombyk received a copy of Red's letter and was intrigued by the description of the film. Red sent him a script that was approximately 190 pages in length (one page traditionally equals one minute of screen time). =Screenplay= In the original script, an entire family is slaughtered in their station wagon, an eyeball is discovered inside of a hamburger, a woman is tied to a truck and a pole and then torn in half, two teenagers engage in sex, and there is a decapitation as well as several slashings, shootings and car crashes. In its original form, Bombyk found the script to be \\"extremely brutal and extremely gory\\", but he and personal manager Kip Ohman (who later became co-producers of the film) also saw in it \\"a level of challenge, intensity and poetry\\". Bombyk and Ohman were worried about getting it into good enough shape to show their boss, producer Ed Feldman, and his partner, Charles Meeker, and prove to them that it was more than an exploitation film. Bombyk worked with Red via several long distance phone calls to Texas and eventually the writer moved to Los Angeles. Red agreed to work with Ohman on the script until it was ready to be shown to Feldman and Meeker. They liked the script but wondered, \\"how could we manage to translate it to the screen without making a slasher movie?\\" Meeker said. Feldman and Meeker decided to come on board as executive producers. Ohman and Red spent six months reworking the script, removing most of what Ohman felt was repetitive violence. Once they got it in good enough shape, Ohman gave it back to Bombyk and also to David Madden, a production executive for 20th Century Fox. Within a few days, Madden called back and told them the script was \\"terrific\\". The studio was not comfortable with the subject matter but felt that the writing was unique and interesting enough to give the filmmakers a letter-of-intent to distribute the film. This would allow them to get financing and then, once filming was completed, the studio would reimburse them for the budget. =Casting= The film's producers then went looking for an inexpensive director. Still photographer-turned-cameraman Robert Harmon was given a copy of the script by his agent and early the next morning called his agent and told him that he wanted to do it. In February 1984, Harmon met with the producers to talk about the script. He recalled, \\"even the exact actions that remained in the script were described in much bloodier and gorier detail\\". The producers were impressed with him and the fact that he also envisioned the film as a Hitchcockian thriller. However, Harmon objected to the eyeball in the hamburger scene and never planned to show the girl getting ripped in half. In early drafts of the script, John Ryder had been described as skeletal in nature and so actors like David Bowie, Sting, Sam Shepard, Harry Dean Stanton, and Terence Stamp were mentioned. Harmon was set on casting Stamp and even carried around his picture to pitch meetings. Stamp received a copy of the script but he turned down the role. Sam Elliott was offered the role but an agreement could not be reached on his salary. Michael Ironside was also considered for the role. Singer mentioned Dutch actor Rutger Hauer. While in L.A. for a short visit, Hauer read the script. Even though he was looking for non-villainous roles, the script \\"really got ahold of me ... I thought, 'If I do one more villain, I should do this.' I couldn't refuse it\\". The one reservation Hauer had was with the scene where the girl is torn apart and Feldman told him, \\"you are the bad guy and you'll be the baddest bad guy there ever was!\\" Red mentioned to Hauer that he had Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards in mind when he wrote the part of Ryder. Furthermore, Red felt that the character should have an electronic voice box.Hauer 2007, p. 153. For the role of Jim Halsey, the producers mentioned Matthew Modine, Tom Cruise, and Emilio Estevez. They agreed on C. Thomas Howell and liked his look. At the time, he was being more selective with the roles he took and heard that the script was a generic thriller. Harmon personally gave Howell a copy of the script. He could not put it down and \\"couldn't believe the things that happened to my character in the first 12 pages. I knew I wanted to do it\\". He also wanted to work with Hauer. Unbeknownst to Hauer, Howell found him \\"frightening, intimidating, and that he was in a constant state of fear, almost as if he really was John Ryder and I really was Jim Halsey\\".Hauer 2007, p. 155. Jennifer Jason Leigh agreed to do the film because she wanted to work with Hauer again (they co-starred in Flesh + Blood) and loved the character of Nash because \\"there was a real person there\\". In addition, veteran character actors Billy Green Bush (known for playing ill-fated police officers in Electra Glide in Blue and Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday), Gene Davis (known for playing the naked psychopathic killer Warren Stacy in 10 to Midnight), Armin Shimerman (who would later be the voice of General Skarr in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy), and Emmy-winner Henry Darrow, have supporting roles as police officers who pursue Jim Halsey. =Pre- production= Fox ultimately rejected the project over the budget and saw it as a \\"straight-out horror movie\\". Madden also admitted that he would have \\"argued to soften the movie. There were some people at the studio who thought it was pretty gross\\". Feldman and Meeker optioned the film themselves, paying Red $25,000. Major studios like Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. passed on it, as did smaller ones like Orion Pictures and New World Pictures. Many executives liked the script but balked at the girl being ripped apart scene. At least two studios were willing to consider making it but only if Harmon was replaced. However, the film's producers had faith in their director and stuck by Harmon. Independent producer Donna Dubrow heard about The Hitcher while working on another film and to her it sounded like \\"Duel with a person\\". When she went to work for Silver Screen Partners/Home Box Office, she contacted Feldman, a former employer, and asked for a copy of the script. She submitted it to her boss, HBO senior vice-president Maurice Singer. He liked it and sent it back to New York to be read by Michael Fuchs, HBO chairman and chief operating officer. They needed Fuchs' approval to get the film made. It would not be easy to convince him because it was not the kind of material that he liked and he did not want to make it. However, Dubrow had to go back to New York on other business and met with Fuchs. She mentioned The Hitcher script and pitched the Hitchcockian thriller angle. When she returned to L.A., Singer told her that Fuchs agreed to make the film but with the stipulation that the girl would not be torn apart and the violence would be reduced. The film's budget was set at $5.8 million. Over the next few months, the filmmakers negotiated two key scenes in the script: the girl getting ripped apart and the eyeball in the hamburger. For the latter scene, Harmon just changed the body part to a finger. As for the former, everyone at HBO/Silver Screen, except Dubrow, wanted it changed. Fuchs did not want the girl to die and Dubrow argued that this would change the story significantly. There were arguments about how the girl should die and Dubrow remembers, \\"they were trying to make her death not horrible, when ‚Äì by the nature of the script ‚Äì it had to be\\". The studio even suggested softening her death by having a funeral. The filmmakers refused to back down and Silver Screen executives finally relented at the last minute. Release =In theaters= Contractually, TriStar Pictures was obligated to distribute any film by HBO/Silver Screen. TriStar representatives saw an early screening and studio president David Matalon said, \\"It's the best film that we have for 1986\\". The Hitcher opened in 800 theaters on February 21, 1986, and made $2.1 million during its opening weekend, going on to gross $5.8 million in North America. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Hitcher holds a 61% approval rating based on 36 critic reviews, with an average rating of 5.77/10. The consensus reads: \\"Its journey is never quite as revelatory as it could be, but The Hitcher stands as a white-knuckle vision of horror, bolstered by Rutger Hauer's menacing performance.‚Äù Roger Ebert awarded it no stars, arguing that the identification of the film's hero with the killer is hollow because the killer has no backstory or even a motive. Gene Siskel also gave the film zero stars, calling it \\"a nauseating thriller\\" and \\"a thinly veiled but more gruesome ripoff of Steven Spielberg's 'Duel'\\".Siskel, Gene (February 24, 1986). \\"Thumbs down on a ride with 'Hitcher'\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 5, p. 3. Accessed August 10, 2019. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin criticized the film's lack of intensity and originality, and wrote, \\"Mr. Harmon, making his feature debut, displays a much surer hand for action than for character, though even some of the action footage here looks meaninglessly overblown\\". Variety called it \\"a highly unimaginative slasher ... with a script that has many holes.\\" In his review for The Washington Post, Paul Attanasio wrote, \\"The script (by Eric Red) is laconic in a dull way, much Cain but hardly able. And Harmon and his cinematographer, John Seale, have shot the movie in such brown murk, you can hardly make anything out. By the end, you're willing to forgive Ryder his worst if someone would just change the light bulb\\". In his review for The Globe and Mail, Jay Scott described the film as a \\"slasher movie about gay panic, a nasty piece of homophobic angst for the age of AIDS\\". A rare positive review came from Newsweek magazine's Jack Kroll who called it, \\"an odyssey of horror and suspense that's as tightly wound as a garrote and as beautifully designed as a guillotine\\". Leonard Maltin awarded the film a score of 2 1/2 out of 4 stars (his most frequently used rating), criticizing the film's violence as being \\"genuinely grisly and unappealing\\" while also stating that the film wasn't without interest. While most reviewers criticized the sadistic nature of the film's violence in general and Nash's death in particular, one of the film's producers said that the film's commercial failure was because of a lack of violence and that Nash's death should have been shown: \\"There's other gore in the movie, other killings, but this is the main one. It's the motivation for the hero. You can't show all the killings we showed and then not show the main one. It's cheating the audience\\". Hauer said critics misunderstood the film. According to him, it is an allegory in which Ryder represents evil. However, Ebert wrote that \\"I could see that the film was meant as an allegory, not a documentary. But on its own terms, this movie is diseased and corrupt. I would have admired it more if it had found the courage to acknowledge the real relationship it was portraying between Howell and Rutger, but no: It prefers to disguise itself as a violent thriller, and on that level it is reprehensible.\\" =Home video= The Hitcher has been released on VHS, laserdisc and DVD. Its first DVD release had just the trailer as a special feature, then in 2003, Europe received a two-disc special edition DVD set, which was digitally remastered from the original negative. It also contained a bonus disc with special features that are not found anywhere else and a booklet, containing photos and a mini-essay on the film itself.Hitcher (The) (1986). DVDCompare.net. The first high-definition release occurred in Germany, 2019, when a Blu-ray and DVD Mediabook set was released by Alive Fernsehjuwelen GmbH. Although appearing in 1080p high definition for the first time, this release is transferred and remastered from 35mm film, since the original negative has presumably been lost and therefore this edition suffers from texture loss, warm tint filters and regular white-outs. Hitcher (The) (Blu-ray) (1986). DVDCompare.net. Legacy The film spawned a sequel in 2003, with Howell reprising his role as Jim Halsey in The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting. A remake of the same name, produced by Michael Bay and directed by Dave Meyers, was released on January 19, 2007, which starred Sean Bean as John Ryder, Zachary Knighton as Jim Halsey, and Neal McDonough as Esteridge. The remake added a female protagonist named Grace Andrews, who was portrayed by Sophia Bush. In the film, Andrews survives, while Halsey suffers Nash's fate. The movie was released to generally negative reviews.

The site is the location of the Habitation at Port-Royal. The Habitation at Port-Royal was established by France in 1605 and was that nation's first permanent settlement in North America, as though Fort Charlesbourg-Royal had been built in 1541, it did not last long. Port-Royal served as the capital of Acadia until its destruction by British military forces in 1613. France relocated the settlement and capital upstream and to the south bank of the Annapolis River; the site of the present-day town of Annapolis Royal. The relocated settlement kept the same name - Port-Royal - and served as the capital of Acadia for the majority of the 17th century until the 1710 British conquest of the colony, at which time the settlement was renamed Annapolis Royal. Replica construction in 1939 The replica at Port- Royal National Historic Site On May 25, 1925, the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board recognized the original Habitation at Port-Royal in the community of Port Royal, Nova Scotia for its heritage significance, and the Minister of the Interior designated it Port-Royal National Historic Site. In the 1930s the approximate site of the original Habitation was located in the community and the results of archaeological excavations fed public interest in the period of the original French settlement. This interest had been increasing since the publication of Quietly My Captain Waits, an historical novel by the Canadian novelist Evelyn Eaton set in Port-Royal in the early 17th century. In the early 1900s, chiefly under the leadership of Harriet Taber Richardson, a native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and summer resident of the nearby town of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotian preservationists and historians began lobbying the Government of Canada to build a replica of the Habitation which stood from 1605 until its destruction in 1613. The government agreed, after much persuasion, to have the replica built on the original site. Construction took place from 1939-1941 and was based on a duplicate set of plans for the original Habitation that had been recently discovered in France. This was the first National Historic Site to have a replica structure built. Today, this replica serves as the cornerstone of Port-Royal National Historic Site, and, coupled with nearby Fort Anne National Historic Site in Annapolis Royal, continues to commemorate this important historic region for visitors. Today, the replica of the Habitation is considered a milestone in the national heritage movement. Operated by Parks Canada, it is open to the public as a unit of the national park system, staffed by historical interpreters in period costumes, and is a major tourist attraction. Costumed interpreters provide demonstrations of such historic early 17th-century activities as farming, building, cooking, fur trading and Mi'kmaq life.

He was accompanied by Samuel de Champlain, Louis H√©bert (this is disputed in the French archives which indicate H√©bert did not sail until 1606) and Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just. They decided to move their settlement to the north shore of present-day Annapolis Basin, a sheltered bay on the south shore of the Bay of Fundy which had been recorded by Champlain earlier in the spring of 1605 during a coastal reconnaissance. Champlain would note in his journals, that the bay was of impressive size; he believed it an adequate anchorage for several hundred ships of the French Royal Fleet, if ever necessary. As such, he would name the basin \\"Port-Royal\\", the Royal Port; this was, for many years, the name of both the body of water, and the subsequent French and Acadian settlements in that region. Poutrincourt asked King Henri IV to become the owner of the Seigneurie which encompassed the settlement. Nestled against the North Mountain range, they set about constructing a log stockade fortification called a \\"habitation.\\" With assistance from members of the Mi'kmaq Nation and a local chief named Membertou, coupled with the more temperate climate of the fertile Annapolis Valley, the settlement prospered. Mindful of the disastrous winter of 1604‚Äì05 at the √éle-Saint-Croix settlement, Champlain established l'Ordre de Bon Temps (the Order of Good Cheer) as a social club ostensibly to promote better nutrition and to get settlers through the winter of 1606‚Äì07. Supper every few days became a feast with a festive air supplemented by performances and alcohol and was primarily attended by the prominent men of the colony and their Mi'kmaq neighbours while the Mi'kmaq women, children, and poorer settlers looked on and were offered scraps. Marc Lescarbot's \\"The Theatre of Neptune in New France\\", the first work of theater written and performed in North America, was performed on November 14, 1606. It was arguably the catalyst for the Order of Good Cheer. In 1607, Dugua had his fur trade monopoly revoked by the Government of France, forcing settlers to return to France that fall. The Habitation was left in the care of Membertou and the local Mi'kmaq until 1610 when Sieur de Poutrincourt, another French nobleman, returned with a small expedition to Port-Royal. Poutrincourt converted Membertou and local Mi'kmaq to Catholicism, hoping to gain financial assistance from the government. As a result, Jesuits became financial partners with Poutrincourt, although this caused division within the community. In May, 1613 the Jesuits moved on to the Penobscot River valley and in July, the settlement was attacked by Samuel Argall of Virginia. Argall returned in November that same year and burned the Habitation to the ground while settlers were away nearby. Poutrincourt returned from France in spring 1614 to find Port-Royal in ruins and settlers living with the Mi'kmaq. Poutrincourt then gave his holdings to his son and returned to France. Poutrincourt's son bequeathed the settlement to Charles de Saint-√âtienne de la Tour upon his own death in 1623. Port Royal and Annapolis Basin, 1609 Port-Royal from Samuel de Champlain's diagram, circa 1612. Port-Royal was the capital of Acadia from 1605 to 1710. Initially Port-Royal was located on the north shore of the Annapolis Basin in the present-day community of Port Royal (note the Anglophone spelling), which is the site of the replica reconstruction of the original Habitation at Port-Royal. After its destruction by raiders from Virginia in 1613, Port-Royal was re-established on the south bank of the river upstream. The British renamed Port-Royal at this new location as Annapolis Royal following their conquest of Acadia in 1710. Port-Royal was founded by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons and Samuel de Champlain in 1605. The settlement was the first permanent European settlement north of St. Augustine, Florida. (Two years later, the English made their first permanent settlement in Jamestown, Virginia.) Approximately seventy-five years after Port-Royal was founded, Acadians spread out from the capital to found the other major Acadian settlements established before the Expulsion of the Acadians: Grand-Pr√©, Chignecto, Cobequid and Pisiguit. In the 150 years prior to the founding of Halifax in 1749, Port-Royal/Annapolis Royal was the capital of Acadia and later Nova Scotia for most decades. During that time the British made six attempts to conquer Acadia by attacking the capital at Port-Royal (present day Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. They finally defeated the French in 1710 following the Siege of Port-Royal. Over the following fifty years, the French and their allies made six unsuccessful military attempts to regain the capital. Including a raid by Americans in the American Revolution, Port-Royal (at present-day Annapolis Royal) faced a total of thirteen attacks, more than any other place in North America. Portrait of Captain Samuel Argall Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts built the Habitation at Port-Royal in 1605 as a replacement for his initial attempt at colonizing Saint Croix Island in the Saint Croix River on the boundary between present-day Maine and New Brunswick. The trading monopoly of de Monts was cancelled in 1607, and most of the French settlers returned to France, although some remained with the natives. Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just led a second expedition to Port- Royal in 1610. Port-Royal was the site of a number of North American firsts: the first resident surgeon; first continuing church services; first social club (named the \\"Order of Good Cheer\\"); creation of the first library; first French theatrical performance (titled Neptune); first apothecary; and first weekly Bible class.Harry Bruce, An Illustrated History of Nova Scotia, Nimbus Publishing. 1997.pp.38-34 The author of Neptune, Marc Lescarbot, wrote a popular history of his time in New France, entitled Histoire de la Nouvelle- France (1609). An 1866 English translation is accessible at Internet Archive =Battle of Port Royal (1613)= Almost ten years later, the Admiral of Virginia Samuel Argall led an English invasion force from Virginia to attack Acadia. He began with the Saint-Saveur mission (Mount Desert Island, Maine) and then St. Croix Island. In October 1613, Argall surprised the settlers at Port-Royal and sacked every building. The battle destroyed the Habitation but it did not wipe out the colony. Biencourt and his men remained in the area of Port-Royal (present day Port Royal, Nova Scotia). A mill upstream at present day Lequille, Nova Scotia remained, along with settlers who went into hiding during the battle. Charles La Tour was one of the men who stayed behind. They eventually left Port-Royal and settled by 1620, at Cape Negro- Cape Sable.M. A. MacDonald. Fortune and La Tour. Methuen Press. 1983.p.14). (At this time, future Governor Charles de Saint-√âtienne de la Tour migrated from Port-Royal to establish himself at both Cap de Sable (present-day Port La Tour, Nova Scotia) and Saint John, New Brunswick.

'Peter Racine Fricker', from Contemporary British Composers (1972) Stylistically his music was significantly different from the mainstream English school of the middle 20th century; instead of following in the lyrical, folk-song influenced tradition of Holst, Vaughan Williams and others, he wrote music which was chromatic, contrapuntal, and acerbic‚Äîmore akin to Schoenberg, Bart√≥k, and Hindemith than to any of his English contemporaries.Scholes, Percy. The Oxford Companion to Music (1970) Unlike Schoenberg, however, he never abandoned tonality altogether, preferring to work in a dissonant idiom which retained a tonal basis‚Äîa position considered to be conservative in the musical milieu of the 1950s and 1960s.France, John.

It is located on the M18 Road, just west of Kitwe. Municipal (district) population 75,806 at the 2000 Census. There is a famous story of the origin of the name Kalulushi. The story goes like this. Two gentlemen went hunting for rabbits. Rabbits, in Zambia's main local language, are referred to as \\"kalulu.\\" During their hunt they eventually spotted one rabbit. One of the gentlemen in excitement called out \\"kalulu!\\". The other gentlemen quietly told his friend, \\"shhhh\\" in order to avoid alarming the rabbit and prevent the rabbit from running away. So that's how the name Kalulushi came about. And so the story goes. Kalulushi was established in 1953 as a company town for workers at the nearby Chibuluma copper and cobalt mine, and it became a public town in 1958. It is located 14 km (9 mi) west of Kitwe, the nearest rail station, at an altitude of 1,260 m (4,130 ft). The city's major employer is Chambishi metals.

She was the first ship to be named for William Sims, an Admiral who pushed for the modernization of the Navy. Sims was laid down on 15 July 1937 by Bath Iron Works Corporation, Bath, Maine; launched on 8 April 1939; sponsored by Mrs. William S. Sims; and commissioned on 1 August 1939, Lieutenant Commander William Arthur Griswold in command.  Service history  = Inter-War Period = After shakedown training in the Caribbean and post-shakedown availability in the Boston Navy Yard, Sims joined the Atlantic Squadron at Norfolk, Virginia on 2 August 1940. The destroyer operated with the Neutrality Patrol in Caribbean and South Atlantic waters. In November‚ÄìDecember 1940, Sims patrolled off Martinique. On 28 May 1941, the ship arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, and began operating from there. She sailed for Iceland on 28 July with an American task force. In August, the destroyer patrolled the approaches to Iceland. In September‚ÄìOctober, the ship made two North Atlantic patrols. Sims had been attached to Destroyer Squadron 2 (DesRon 2) since she began making Neutrality Patrols. = World War II = With the outbreak of war on 7 December 1941, DesRon 2 became part of Task Force 17 (TF17) formed around . The task force sortied from Norfolk on 16 December 1941 for San Diego, California. From there, it sailed as part of a convoy taking Marines to Samoa, arriving on 23 January 1942. At the time, it was believed that the Japanese would attack Samoa to sever Allied communications with Australia. To thwart such a move, a carrier raid against Japanese bases in the Marshall Islands was planned. The Yorktown task force was to strike the islands of Mili, Jaluit, and Makin, while another force centered on was to hit Kwajalein, Wotje, and Maloelap. TF 17 departed Samoa on 25 January, with Sims in the screen. At 1105 on 28 January, she sighted an enemy bomber. At 1114, a stick of four bombs fell approximately 1,500 yards astern, straddling the wake of the destroyer. The next day, the two carrier forces and a bombardment group attacked the islands and withdrew. Sims, with TF 17, sailed from Pearl Harbor on 16 February to attack Wake Island. Shortly after departing, their sailing orders were changed, and they proceeded to the Canton Island area. Canton is a small island on the Honolulu-New Caledonia air route, and it was thought to be endangered by the Japanese. By early March, the Japanese had occupied Lae and Salamaua on the north coast of New Guinea. To check this drive, a carrier strike was launched on 10 March from and Yorktown. Sims remained near Rossel Island in the Louisiade Archipelago with a force of cruisers and destroyers to protect the carriers from enemy surface ships. Sims next operated in the New Caledonia-Tonga Islands area.  Battle of The Coral Sea  In late April 1942, a Japanese task force was assembled to begin operations in support of Japanese moves towards Australia. This consisted of a covering group to protect landing forces on Tulagi and Port Moresby and a striking force to eliminate Allied shipping in the Coral Sea. was attached to the covering force, and and were the striking force under command of Admiral Takeo Takagi. The American ships were divided into task forces centered on Lexington and Yorktown. Sims was ordered to escort USS Neosho. The task force refueled on 5‚Äì6 May and then detached Neosho and Sims to continue to the next fueling point. On the morning of 7 May, a search plane from the Japanese striking force sighted the oiler and destroyer and reported them to Admiral Takagi as a carrier and a cruiser. Takagi ordered an all-out attack. At 0930, 15 high level bombers attacked the two ships but did no damage. At 1038, 10 attacked the destroyer, but skillful maneuvering evaded the nine bombs that were dropped. A third attack against the two ships by 36 Val dive bombers was devastating. Neosho was soon a blazing wreck as the result of seven direct hits and one plane that dived into her. Sims was attacked from all directions. The destroyer defended herself as best she could. Three bombs hit the destroyer. Two exploded in the engine room, and within minutes, the ship buckled amidships and began to sink, stern first. As Sims slid beneath the waves, there was a tremendous explosion that raised what was left of the ship almost 15 feet out of the water. Chief R. J. Dicken, in a damaged whaleboat, picked up 15 other survivors. They remained with Neosho until they were rescued by on 11 May. Sims was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 June 1942.  Awards  Sims received two battle stars for World War II service.

It was the first Waterboys record with Karl Wallinger as part of the band and also includes Roddy Lorimer's first trumpet solo for the band on the track \\"A Pagan Place\\". The album shares a title with the book A Pagan Place, written by Irish novelist Edna O'Brien. According to a post at the official Waterboys forum, Mike Scott, who chose the album name, has never read the book, and neither the album nor the title track share any other similarities with the novel. Production history Recording for A Pagan Place was begun before either the band's first single, \\"A Girl Called Johnny\\", or album, The Waterboys, were released. The album comprises two recording sessions. The first, in November 1982 at Redshop Studio in London, involved Mike Scott, Anthony Thistlethwaite and Kevin Wilkinson. The second session, held September 1983 at Rockfield Studio in Wales, included contributions from Wallinger, who had joined the band that year. The four, the early band's core membership, were joined by Lorimer, Tim Blanthorn, and Eddi Reader, among others, for later overdubbing of the sessions to add full instrumentation to the recordings.  Reception  The album was released in June 1984 (see 1984 in music). Peter Anderson, writing in Record Collector, asserts that there was \\"unanimous critical acclaim\\". A Pagan Place was reissued in 2002 by Chrysalis Records, having been remastered. The reissue included both new tracks from the recording sessions for both A Pagan Place and from The Waterboys, along with extended versions of tracks from the original release. Songs single of \\"The Big Music\\", the title of which would define The Waterboys' early sound. A Pagan Place expanded The Waterboys' treatment of spiritual themes beyond the Christian beliefs of \\"December\\" from The Waterboys. \\"A Church Not Made With Hands\\" is an ode to a woman who \\"is everywhere and no place / Her church not made with hands\\". Both \\"All the Things She Gave Me\\" and \\"The Thrill is Gone\\" discuss the end of a romantic relationship. \\"Rags\\" and \\"Somebody Might Wave Back\\" discuss despair and optimism in loneliness. Scott's songwriting has been criticized as being overly introspective, and all four tracks contain some element of self- reflection. \\"The Big Music\\" was released as a single, and became a descriptor of the sound of the album, the preceding debut The Waterboys and the following album This Is the Sea. Waterboys chronicler Ian Abrahams described the song as the album's defining track, with New Music Express' Andrew Collins stating, \\"What a concept and what an albatross. A lilting anthem with grand cymbal slashes, soulful backing... a lazy, meandering essay.\\" \\"Strange Boat: Mike Scott & The Waterboys (2007) by Ian Abrahams p. 54 For The Waterboys' gig at London's Town & Country Club in 1985, backing vocals to the song were provided by Sinead O'Connor, marking her first UK live appearance. \\"Strange Boat: Mike Scott & The Waterboys (2007) by Ian Abrahams p. 84 Usage of the term \\"The Big Music\\" spread to include other bands with a similar sound. The single included \\"Bury My Heart\\" and \\"The Earth Only Endures\\". \\"Bury My Heart\\", a reference to \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\", is described by Anderson as \\"a lament to the decimated American Red Indians\\". \\"The Earth Only Endures\\" is a traditional Sioux song arranged by Scott. \\"Red Army Blues\\" first appeared on the twelve- inch single for \\"December\\" from The Waterboys. The song is a first-person narrative of the life of a young Soviet soldier in World War II who participates in the Battle of Berlin. The soldier, along with many others, is sent to the Gulag by Joseph Stalin. The songs are based upon the book The Diary of Vikenty Angorov. The final track of the original release, \\"A Pagan Place\\", featuring a trumpet solo from Lorimer, is an ambiguous questioning of the process of Christianising a Pagan culture. The song \\"Cathy\\", included on the album's re-issue, was originally a Nikki Sudden song. Sudden writes about an evening in 1982 when he was staying in Scott's apartment: \\"Late that night ‚Äì around midnight ‚Äì Mike recorded a lead vocal to the backing track for my song, Cathy. We did a quick mix and that was that until twenty years ago [sic] when he includes the number on the reissue of his A Pagan Place album\\". This 2002 reissue credits Sudden as the song's author.

Biography Searle was the son of Humphrey and Charlotte Searle and, through his mother, a grandson of Sir William Schlich. He was born in Oxford where he was a classics scholar before studying‚Äîsomewhat hesitantly‚Äîwith John Ireland at the Royal College of Music in London, after which he went to Vienna on a six-month scholarship to become a private pupil of Anton Webern, which became decisive in his composition career. Searle was one of the foremost pioneers of serial music in the United Kingdom, and used his role as a producer at the BBC from 1946 to 1948 to promote it. He was General Secretary of the International Society for Contemporary Music from 1947 to 1949. He accepted this post with the encouragement of the new president, Edward Clark. For Clark, he composed the Quartet for Clarinet, Bassoon, Violin and Viola, Op. 12, a musical palindrome.classical- composers.org Searle wrote his Piano Sonata, Op. 21 for a recital at the Wigmore Hall on 22 October 1951, given by the Australian pianist Gordon Watson to celebrate the 140th anniversary of the birth of Franz Liszt. (Watson also performed the complete Transcendental √âtudes on that occasion.Music Web International, Quadrille With a Raven: Memoirs by Humphrey Searle, Chapter 11, \\"Lesley and Rosie's Pub\\") The Sonata was loosely based on Liszt's Sonata in B minor and has been described as \\"probably, both the finest and most original piano work ever produced by a British composer\\".David C F Wright, \\"Humphrey Searle\\" Other works of note include a Poem for 22 Strings (1950), premiered at Darmstadt, a Gogol opera, The Diary of a Madman (1958, awarded the first prize at UNESCO's International Rostrum of Composers in 1960), and five symphonies (the first of which was commercially recorded by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult). Searle also contributed humorous compositions to some of the Hoffnung Music Festivals, including a setting of Young Lochinvar and a parody of serialism, Punkt Kontrapunkt.Humphrey Searle, Quadrille with a Raven (memoirs), accessed 5 September 2012 Searle wrote the monographs Twentieth Century Counterpoint and The Music of Franz Liszt.

Since its meaning is \\"crown\\", it is interpreted as both the \\"topmost\\" of the Sephirot and the \\"regal crown\\" of the Sephirot. It is between Chokhmah and Binah (with Chokhmah on the right and Binah in the left) and it sits above Tiferet. It is usually given three paths, to Chokhmah, Tiferet and Binah. Keter is so sublime, it is called in the Zohar \\"the most hidden of all hidden things\\", and is completely incomprehensible to man. It is also described as absolute compassion, and Moses ben Jacob Cordovero describes it as the source of the 13 Supernal Attributes of Mercy. Keter is invisible and colorless. Description According to the Bahir: \\"What are the ten utterances? The first is supreme crown, blessed be His name and His people.\\" Arthur Green. Guide to the Zohar The first Sephirah is called the Crown, since a crown is worn above the head. The Crown therefore refers to things that are above the mind's abilities of comprehension. All of the other Sephirot are likened to the body which starts with the head and winds its way down into action. But the crown of a king lies above the head and connects the concept of \\"monarchy\\", which is abstract and intangible, with the tangible and concrete head of the king. This first Sefirah represents the primal stirrings of intent in the Ein Soph, or the arousal of desire to come forth into the varied life of being. But in this sense, although it contains all the potential for content, it contains no content itself, and is therefore called 'Nothing', 'The Hidden Light', 'The air that cannot be grasped'. Being desire to bring the world into being, Keter is absolute compassion.Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah The name of God associated with Keter is Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh (Hebrew: ◊ê◊î◊ô◊î ◊ê◊©◊® ◊ê◊î◊ô◊î), the name through which he revealed himself to Moses from the burning bush.Aryeh Kaplan. Meditation and Kabbalah \\"It is from the name Ehyeh that all kinds of sustenance emanate, coming from the source, which is the infinite\\". Keter, although being the highest Sephirah of its world, receives from the Sephirah of Malkuth of the domain above it (see Sephirot). The uppermost Keter sits below no other Sephirah, although it is below Or Ein Soph which is the source of all Sephirot. Qualities =Ethical behaviour= Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, in The Palm Tree of Devorah, discusses ethical behaviour that man should follow, related to the qualities of the Sephirot, in order that man might emulate his Creator. Humility is the first, because although Keter is the highest, it is ashamed to look at its cause, and instead gazes at those below it.Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, The Palm Tree of Devorah. One's thoughts should be pure, one's forehead should display no harshness, one's ears should always turn to hear good, one's eyes should distance themselves from noticing evil, always looking at the good, one's nose should be free from the breath of anger, one's face should always shine, and his mouth should express nothing except good. = 13 Supernal Attributes of Mercy = Through discussion of a line in the Michah, 13 attributes are associated with the Sephirah Kether: > Who is God like you, who pardons iniquity and forgives the transgressions of > the remnant of his heritage? He does not maintain His anger forever, for He > delights in kindness. He will again show us compassion, He will vanquish our > iniquities, and You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. > Show faithfulness to Ya'akov, kindness to Avraham, which You have sworn to > our fathers from days of old. (Michah, 7:18-20) Accordingly, the 13 attributes are derived from this and are described in great detail. Additionally, the \\"Thirteen Attributes of Mercy\\" were described by Rabbi Chizkiyah in an allegorical depiction of a lily among thorns. The metaphor in whole is known and taught as \\"The lily amongst the thorns,\\" a phrase found in Shir Hashirim 2:2. A summary: > The secret of spiritual protection is revealed through a richly metaphorical > discourse given by Rabbi Chizkiyah. The Rabbi explains that the spiritual > forces that protect and watch over us are called the 13 Attributes of Mercy. > They are transmitted into our physical world through the first 13 words of > the Torah.

Non-Jewish practices  In The Mystical Qabalah Dion Fortune describes Keter as pure consciousness, beyond all categories, timeless, a point that crystallises out of the Ein Soph, and commences the process of emanation that ends in Malkuth. The name of God given to it is Eheieh, the archangel that presides over it is Metatron, the order of angels that resides in it are the Holy Living Creatures (the Chaioth ha Qadesh, Hebrew: ◊ó◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ß◊ì◊©), and its mundane chakra is said to be the First Swirlings of the cosmos (Primum Mobile, Rashith ha Gilgalin). A.E. Waite made mention that Rabbi Azariel ben Menachem, a student of Isaac the Blind, in his Commentary on the Sephiroth granted a particular colour to each Sephira, yet these do not agree with the colours given in the Zohar, where Kether (which, according to him, is also correlated to Yechidah) is called colourless, Tiphareth purple, and Malkuth sapphire- blue.A.E. Waite, The Holy Kabbalah As pure formless consciousness, it is often compared with the Sahasrara chakra, which resides above the crown of the head, in Indian Shakta Tantra. In Aleister Crowley's Liber 777, Keter is associated with the Four Aces of the Tarot deck, White Brilliance, Poseidon, Brahma, Wodan, Zeus, The Trinity, Almond in flower, Diamond, Elixir Vitae, Dao, and Death (not a complete list of the 777 associations). It is said to have a negative aspect, the Qliphothic order of demons called Thaumiel ruled by the Archdemons Satan and Moloch. Keter is also identified with the planets Neptune or Pluto, the Atma in Theosophy and Raja Yoga, and the Khabs am Pekht in Egyptian mysticism.David Rankine, Climbing the Tree of Life: A Manual of Practical Magickal Qabalah In popular culture In the SCP Foundation mythos and related games, \\"Keter\\" is one of four major classifications for anomalous objects or entities (Safe, Euclid, Keter, Thaumiel). Specifically, \\"Keter\\" classification denotes entities or objects that are exceedingly dangerous and difficult to contain consistently or reliably, with containment procedures often being extensive and complex. In Tales of the Abyss, the \\"Sephiroth\\" are described as physical pillars keeping the world from sinking into a poisonous mud. Each major town has a Sephiroth supporting it, and one such town is Keterburg, the northernmost town. Swiss metal band Samael have released a song titled \\"From Malkuth to Kether\\" on their Exodus EP. In both the anime Fate/Apocrypha and the mobile game Fate/Grand Order, the Servant Solomon ibn Gabirol/Avicebron possesses a Noble Phantasm named Golem Keter Malkuth. In David Bowie's \\"Station to Station\\", he refers to \\"one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth\\".

It is the administrative seat of Gmina Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka. The old town of Bystrzyca is famous for its many historical buildings and is a popular tourist destination. Geography Old town and Nysa river Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka lies in the K≈Çodzko Valley near the confluence of the Eastern Neisse (Nysa K≈Çodzka) and Bystrzyca ≈Åomnicka rivers, at the feet of the Bystrzyckie Mountains, a range of the Central Sudetes. Part of the K≈Çodzko Land historical region, it is located about south of K≈Çodzko. History The area of today's Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka has been inhabited at least for six millennia. During the times of the Roman Empire the Celts established numerous permanent settlements in the area of K≈Çodzko along the ancient Amber Road. There are also numerous archaeological excavations of Lusatian culture remnants in the area. =Middle Ages= The town of Habelschwerdt was founded in the mid-13th century by German colonists on estates held by the Bohemian noble Havel of Markvartice, husband of Saint Zdislava Berka. They settled next to the older Slavic village of Byst≈ôice, located on the important trade route leading along the Neisse river from Wroc≈Çaw in Silesia through the Sudetes to Prague. The citizens were granted town privileges according to the so-called Western Law (a variant of Magdeburg rights). On 4 July 1319, the Luxembourg king John of Bohemia granted the settlement the vast autonomy of an immediate royal city and the right to construct city walls. Until the mid-14th century the town changed its affiliation several times, passing with the K≈Çodzko Land between Polish and Bohemian rulers. Defensive walls The first noted mayor of Habelschwerdt was Jakob R√ºcker. The town was constructed almost from scratch and started to grow rapidly. First the city walls were erected with three gates and several towers. Then the market square was planned on a slope and the town hall was constructed. Most of the Gothic architecture was preserved and the town is now considered one of the classical examples of mediaeval architecture. City rights were confirmed by King John's son, Charles IV in 1348 and Habelschwerdt was granted with several other privileges, among them the right to trade with salt, spices and fabric. The town was incorporated into the County of Kladsko in 1459, an immediate fief of the Bohemian Crown and shared the fate of the nearby city of K≈Çodzko (Kladsko, Glatz). It developed rapidly until the advent of the Hussite Wars in the early 15th century. The wars left the town depopulated by plagues, partially burnt and demolished by several consecutive floods. It was plundered by the forces of the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus on his 1469 campaign against King George of Podƒõbrady. In 1475 a great fire destroyed the town completely. =Modern times= City hall After the Lands of the Bohemian Crown had passed to the Habsburg Monarchy, the area became a fief of the ruling Habsburg dynasty in 1567, though the local counts retained their powers. Habelschwerdt and the surrounding villages were gradually repopulated, mostly with settlers from Central Germany and Lesser Poland. It was not until the 16th century when the local economy went back on tracks, while the Protestant Reformation led to a strengthening of radical movements such as Schwenckfelder and Anabaptist groups. Because of major Lutheran influences it became one of the regional centres of Protestantism. In the late 16th century a new city hall was built and many of the town houses were rebuilt in a Renaissance style. The town also built several facilities like paved roads and a sewer system. However, the Thirty Years' War and stern measures of the Counter-Reformation damaged the city and ended the period of prosperity. During the Second Silesian War, Hungarian troops and Pandurs again devastated the town. On 14 February 1745, Prussian troops under General Hans von Lehwaldt defeated the Austrian Habsburg forces of Georg Oliver von Wallis nearby. After the Silesian Wars, Habelschwerdt, together with the County of Kladsko and most of Silesia, came under Prussian rule according to the 1763 Treaty of Hubertusburg. In the War of the Bavarian Succession, skirmishers from Austrian army commanded by Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser fought there against the Prussian garrison, and one of the blockhouses caught fire, resulting in the destruction of most of the town in mid-January 1779. Oscar Criste. Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser. Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie. Herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 44 (1898), S. 338‚Äì340, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in Wikisource. (Version vom 24. M√§rz 2010, 3:18 Uhr UTC). During the Napoleonic Wars, the town was occupied by French forces and housed a garrison of the Grande Arm√©e until 1813. St Michael Archangel Church By 1818 the County of Kladsko was formally dissolved and Habelschwerdt was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Silesia. Although it was made the administrative seat of a rural district (Landkreis), comprising the southeastern parts of the former county, it was also struck by high taxes. It was not until the mid-19th century when the town fully recovered. The city hall was yet again rebuilt, the city moat and parts of the walls were leveled and the settlement expanded into new areas. After 1877, Habelschwerdt was connected to Glatz and Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) by a railroad. In 1885, Habelschwerdt had a population of 5,597, while by 1939 it rose to 6,877. Its population was overwhelmingly Catholic.S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom I, Warszawa, 1880, p. 510 (in Polish) The end of the 19th century saw the whole K≈Çodzko Valley (Glatzer Kessel) turned into one of the most popular tourist regions. Countless hotels, sanatoria and spa were opened to the public in the nearby towns of Glatz, Bad Reinerz (present-day Duszniki-Zdr√≥j) and Bad Landeck (LƒÖdek-Zdr√≥j), as well as in the town itself. The area of former Kladsko county became a popular place among the rich bourgeoisie of Breslau, Berlin, Vienna and Krak√≥w. During World War II Habelschwerdt was spared the fate of many other cities and did not suffer great damage. There were no important industrial centres in the area, and most of the K≈Çodzko Valley was not captured by the Red Army until after the capitulation of Germany. After the war the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union. Most of the remaining German population fled or was expelled and replaced with Poles, including many expelled from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. It was renamed to its historic Polish name Bystrzyca, and the adjective K≈Çodzka was added to distinguish it from other Polish settlements of the same name. In 1961 the town limits were expanded by including Nied≈∫wiedna as a new district. In 1964, the only Phillumenist Museum (Muzeum Filumenistyczne) in Poland was founded in Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka. On 28 June 1972 the Catholic parishes of Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka were reassigned from the traditional Hradec Kr√°lov√© diocese (est. 1664; Ecclesiastical Province of Bohemia) to the Archdiocese of Wroc≈Çaw.Paulus VI, Constitutio Apostolica \\"Vratislaviensis - Berolinensis et aliarum\\", in: Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 64 (1972), n. 10, pp. 657seq. Between 1975 and 1998 Bystrzyca belonged to Wa≈Çbrzych Voivodeship. It continues to be one of the principal mountain resorts of the area. Thanks to its historical landmarks as well as virgin landscapes, Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka remains one of the most popular centers for tourism and winter sports in Lower Silesia.

W. Bush on the Nunn‚ÄìLugar legislation As the collapse of the Soviet Union appeared imminent, the United States and their NATO allies grew concerned of the risk of nuclear weapons held in the Soviet republics falling into enemy hands. The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program was an initiative housed within the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The CTR program is better known as the Nunn‚ÄìLugar Act based on the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991 which was authored and cosponsored by Sens. Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Richard Lugar (R-IN). This Act was created in 1986 in a congressional meeting. According to the CTR website, \\"the purpose of the CTR Program is to secure and dismantle weapons of mass destruction and their associated infrastructure in former Soviet Union states.\\" An alternative explanation of the program is \\"to secure and dismantle weapons of mass destruction in states of the former Soviet Union and beyond\\". CTR provides funding and expertise for states in the former Soviet Union (including Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to decommission nuclear, biological, and chemical weapon stockpiles, as agreed by the Soviet Union under disarmament treaties such as SALT I. This funding totaled $400 million a year for a total of four years. After the nuclear warheads were removed from their delivery vehicles by the post-Soviet successor militaries, Nunn-Lugar assistance provided equipment and supplies to destroy the missiles on which the warheads had been mounted, as well as the silos which had contained the missiles. The warheads themselves were then shipped to and destroyed in Russia, with the highly-enriched uranium contained within made into commercial reactor fuel; which was purchased by the United States under a separate program. In recent years, the CTR program has expanded its mission from securing WMDs at the root source to protecting against WMD \\"on the move\\", by enhancing land and maritime border security in the former Soviet Union.  Objectives and programs  According to the CTR website, CTR has four key objectives:https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215354/http://www.dtra.mil/oe/ctr/programs/ * Dismantle Former Soviet Union (FSU)'s Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and associated infrastructure * Consolidate and secure FSU WMD and related technology and materials * Increase transparency and encourage higher standards of conduct * Support defense and military cooperation with the objective of preventing proliferation These objectives are pursued and achieved through a variety of programs.http://www.dtra.mil/oe/ctr/org_chart_ctr.cfm Briefly, these include: * The Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP; formerly the Biological Threat Reduction Program [BTRP]) * Chemical Weapons Elimination Program * Nuclear Weapons Storage Security Program (NWSS) * Strategic Offensive Arms Elimination Program (SOAE) * Weapons of Mass Destruction-Proliferation Prevention Initiative (WMD-PPI) The CTR program is authorized by Title 22 of the United States Code, chapter 68a. ‚Äî Cooperative Threat Reduction With States Of Former Soviet Union The FY 2007 CTR Annual Report to Congress provides a status update on the program as a whole and individual initiatives. It also details future planned endeavors in each area.http://www.dtra.mil/documents/oe/ctr/FY07%20CTR%20Annual%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf  Contributions  The Cooperative Threat Reduction Act was a major contributor to De-Escalation of nuclear weapon arsenals. This program was used for \\"the transportation, storage, safeguarding and destruction of nuclear and other weapons in the Soviet Union‚Ä¶ and to assist in the prevention of weapons proliferation\\". One contribution by the Nunn-Lugar program has been the \\"delivery of equipment to accelerate the dismantlement of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles\\" to the Soviet Union. This program made important contributions in the disarmament of nuclear warheads in many counties. The Nunn-Lugar program eliminated former strategic weapons outside of Russia. This was most evident in the removal of these weapons in Ukraine. There were many countries that had Soviet Union nuclear weapons. Two others included Belarus and Kazakhstan. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Act helped Russia move the nuclear arsenals in these countries back to Russia or dismembering these weapons in these countries. The United States sent \\"nearly 700 emergency response items to help guarantee safe and secure transportation of nuclear weapons\\" to Belarus for the aid of the elimination of nuclear power in this country. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Act played a major role in a huge decrease in the quantity of nuclear weapons that had been stockpiled during the nuclear escalation period. Another important contribution was when the United States sent storage containers to Russia to store fissionable material under their control. The United States provided \\"10,000 fissile material storage containers by the end of 1995 and a total of nearly 33,000 containers by early 1997\\". These containers aided in Russia's ability to store nuclear material from dismantled warheads. Another contribution from the United States to Russia was \\"75 million dollars to help Russia build a new fissile material storage facility at Chelyabinsk for plutonium \\"pits\\" from dismantled warheads\\". The Nuclear Threat Reduction program was not just used to remove everything fissionable from Russia; it also included ideas for safe storage and transportation of fissionable material in Russia built up during the Cold War and nuclear escalation.  Outcome  Disassembling of a Soviet Oscar- class submarine in Severodvinsk, 1996 Under CTR, the U.S. and recipient states have made considerable advancements in global security against the threat of WMD. For example, weapons deactivated and destroyed under this program include: * 537 ICBMs * 459 ICBM silos * 11 ICBM mobile missile launchers * 128 bombers * 708 nuclear air-to-surface missiles * 408 submarine missile launchers * 496 submarine-launched missiles * 27 nuclear submarines * 194 nuclear test tunnels Other milestone results include: * 260 tons of fissile material received security upgrades * 60 nuclear warhead storage sites received security upgrades * 35 percent of Russian chemical weapons received security upgrades * 49 former biological weapons facilities were converted to joint U.S.‚ÄìRussian research * 4 biological weapons sites received security improvements * 58,000 former weapons scientists employed in peaceful work through International Science and Technology Centers (of which the U.S. is the leading sponsor) * 750 projects involving 14,000 former weapons scientists and created some 580 new peaceful high-tech jobs; The International Proliferation Prevention Program has funded * Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons freehttp://nunn-lugar.com  Russian initiatives  = Pavlograd site (Ukraine) = One Nunn‚ÄìLugar site, Pavlograd, has dedicated itself beginning in June 2004 to the decommissioning of nuclear missiles without burning their solid rocket fuel, thus preventing dioxins from threatening the local environment and human population. The Pavlograd missile factory PMZ has been converted to an advanced astronautics \\"Space Clipper\\" program. = Shchuchye chemical weapons decommission plant = In May 2009, Russia announced the opening of a major facility to decommission its chemical weapons reserves. Built near vast reserves of ex-Soviet weaponry at Shchuchye, Kurgan Oblast, in the Ural Mountains, the site is expected to destroy some 5,500 tons of chemical agents, including Sarin and VX. About one-third of the funding to build the plant, roughly $1 billion, was provided by CTR. In 2012, Russia declared that they would not extend the agreement.\\"Russia Will Not Renew Arms Deal With US.\\" by VOA News, 11 October 2012. In June 2013, the United States and the Russian Federation signed a new bilateral framework on cooperative threat reduction intended to supersede the CTR. The new agreement is intended to reinforce the longstanding partnership on nonproliferation between these two nations and their activities in Russia and the Former Soviet Republics (FSR). \\"This new framework builds upon the success of the 1992 Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning the Safe and Secure Transportation, Storage and Destruction of Weapons and the Prevention of Weapons Proliferation, commonly known as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Umbrella Agreement that expires today. This new bilateral framework authorizes the United States and the Russian Federation to work in several areas of nonproliferation collaboration, including protecting, controlling, and accounting for nuclear materials.\\"\\"United States and the Russian Federation Sign New Bilateral Framework on Threat Reduction\\" by White House Press Release, 17 June 2013 In January 2015, Russian Federation representatives told their US counterparts that Russia would no longer accept US assistance in securing stored weapons- grade nuclear material but said they would continue the program on their own. Joint security work at numerous Russian sites and facilities was halted on 1 January 2015.\\"Russia ends US nuclear security alliance\\" The Boston Globe, 19 January 2015.  Today  Secretary of Defense Ash Carter with 25th anniversary Nunn-Lugar Trailblazer Award recipients Dr. Gloria Duffy, Ms. Laura Holgate, Dr. Susan Koch and Ms. Jane Wales Nuclear threat reduction is still an issue, even for current presidents. Subsequent programs have built on the Cooperative Threat Reduction, including the Proliferation Security Initiative, initially launched by President Bush in cooperation with Poland in 2003, and built on by multilateral efforts, and then by President Obama. Although the budget for the Cooperative Threat Reduction program has been cut every year since the Obama administration began, the United States still faces many issues when it comes to agreements with Russia in nuclear arms reduction. President Obama had his own ideas for nuclear threat reduction. His plan was to reset nuclear relations with Russia. This plan included a plan to further reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, which would further reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world today. This plan was the result of the impending expiration of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I). START was set to expire in December 2009. In President Obama's second term, work on the nuclear threat reduction was said to be more bleak because of relations with Ukraine. This is verified in the quote \\"the crisis in Ukraine probably has ruined prospects for another formal Russian-U.S. arms control agreement during the Obama administration‚Äôs second term\\". As far as reducing nuclear weapons in other countries, besides Ukraine, there is more of a chance of an agreement. This idea is explained in \\"countering nuclear weapons proliferation to states and to nonstate actors, the prospects are somewhat better, given mutual Russian and U.S. concerns in that area\\". There are still many agreements that have been proposed that can be passed between the United States and Russia as far as nuclear weapons and the control and elimination of them are concerned. As time progresses, the threat of nuclear weapons and the money needed to spend on the elimination of them diminishes. The Cooperative Threat Reduction program has faced many budget cuts since its beginning in 1986 because the program was \\"created to deal with yesterday‚Äôs strategic weapons and yesterday‚Äôs threats have largely diminished\\".

In the United States, although very few high schools officially offer a two-semester course in nanotechnology, ‚Äúnano‚Äù concepts are bootstrapped and taught during traditional science classes using a number of educational resources and hands-on activities developed by dedicated non-profit organizations, such as: * The National Science Teacher Association, which has published a number of textbooks for nanotechnology in K-12 education, including a teacher's guide and an activity manual for hands-on experiences. * Nano-Link, a notable program of the Dakota County Technical College, which has developed a variety of nanotech-related hands-on activities supported by toolkits to teach concepts in nanotechnology throughout direct lab experience. * Omni Nano, which is developing comprehensive educational resources specifically designed to support a two-semester high school course, both online and in classrooms. Omni Nano also discusses issues in nanotechnology education on its dedicated blog. * Nano4Me, which has a good amount of resources for K-12 education, although their program is intended for higher education. Their K-12 resources include introductory level modules and activities, interactive multimedia, and a collection of experiments and hands-on activities. * Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE), which has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology. NISE also organizes Nano Days, a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future. In Egypt, in2nano is a high school outreach program aiming to increase scientific literacy and prepare students for the sweeping changes of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology education outside of school * Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE) has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology available at www.nisenet.org and a site for the public at www.whatisnano.org. The NISE Network also organizes Nano Days, a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

MCAD currently enrolls approximately 800 students.http://mcad.edu/ MCAD is one of just a few major art schools to offer a major in comic art.  History  MCAD was founded in 1886 by the trustees of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts and originally named the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts. Douglas Volk (1856‚Äì1935), an accomplished American portrait painter who studied in Paris with renowned French painter and sculptor Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me (1824‚Äì1904), became the school's first president. Its inaugural class was held in a rented apartment in downtown Minneapolis and had an enrollment of 28 students, 26 of whom were women. In December 1889, the school found a more permanent home on the top floor of the just-finished Minneapolis Public Library at 10th Street and Hennepin Avenue. In 1893, noted German-born painter and educator Robert Koehler (1850‚Äì1917) moved from New York to Minnesota to become president of the school. Over the next ten years, he developed much of the curriculum that is known today as the art education field. By the turn of the century, the school had two instructors and had instituted a summer term, in addition to night classes for people in the community. In 1910, the School of Fine Arts changed its name to the Minneapolis School of Art to reflect the new emphasis on applied arts. In 1915, the school moved to its present location one mile south of downtown Minneapolis, and set up its classrooms and studios within the newly constructed Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The site for the art museum and school was donated to the City of Minneapolis in 1911 by prominent local banker and businessman Clinton Morrison (1842‚Äì1913). It was formerly occupied by Villa Rosa, the home and estate of Morrison's parents Dorilus Morrison (1814‚Äì1897), the first mayor of Minneapolis, and Harriet Putnam Whitmore Morrison (1821‚Äì1880). The site of the Morrison's former estate is today held in the public trust under the jurisdiction of the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board and is officially known as Dorilus Morrison Park. In 1916, the school moved into its own nearby facilities in the new Julia Morrison Memorial Building, which was built with funds provided to the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts by Dr. Angus Washburn Morrison (1883‚Äì1949) and his sister, Ethel Morrison Van Derlip (1876‚Äì1921), as a memorial to their mother, Julia Kellogg Washburn Morrison (1853‚Äì1883), the wife of Clinton Morrison. Designed by prominent Minneapolis architect Edwin Hawley Hewitt (1874‚Äì1939), a former Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts president, the Morrison Building featured three large painting studios with skylights, administrative offices, workshops and an auditorium. In 1970, the School was renamed the Minneapolis College of Art and Design to reflect the broadening of its fine arts and liberal arts curricula. By this time, with enrollment of nearly 600 students, the college had outgrown its facilities, and in 1974 expanded into a building designed by Pritzker Prize‚Äìwinning modernist architect Kenzo Tange (1913‚Äì2005) as part of the new \\"arts complex\\" that included the Children's Theatre Company and a major addition to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. On July 1, 1988, MCAD became a wholly independent institution, no longer governed by the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts.  Academics  MCAD offers several degree programs. Bachelor of Fine Arts: The BFA program offers majors in Animation, Comic Art, Drawing and Painting, Filmmaking, Fine Arts Studio, Furniture Design, Graphic Design, Illustration, Web And Multimedia Environments, Photography, Print Paper Book, Product Design, and Sculpture.MCAD: Bachelor of Fine Arts Bachelor of Science: The BSc program offers a major in entrepreneurial studies. Students have the opportunity to meet with real clients and take on real projects for a contextual study from the moment they step inside MCAD's doors. This allows students to network with industry professionals by becoming a part of the industry themselves, giving them not only an education but also real-world experience. By the time they graduate, students already have a leg-up on graduates from other colleges and universities.

Initially notable as a musician and founder of 1970s ensemble Blerta, he went on to well-regarded roles in several major films. His television work included starring in 1990s era Australian satirical series Frontline. Early life Born David Charles Lawrence in Worthing, West Sussex, England, he moved with his family to New Zealand in 1946. The family settled in New Plymouth before relocating to Wellington in 1948.  Music  Lawrence spent most of his life in New Zealand, but also worked extensively in Australia. He was a jazz and rock drummer in many bands, including two years with Max Merritt & The Meteors in Sydney, Quincy Conserve, Blerta, and The Crocodiles. His last recording was with Bernie McGann, Larry Gales and Jonathan Crayford on \\"Jazz at the St. James\\" in 1989. A remarkable show, it was repeated in 1990, this time with Vince Jones on vocals, Dave Addis on saxophone, Jonathan Crayford on piano, Rolf Stube on bass and added the New Zealand String Quartet. In the early 1970s, Lawrence founded Blerta (\\"Bruno Lawrence's Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition\\"). The multi and theatrical co-operative toured New Zealand and in parts of Australia. Blerta saw him performing alongside many people he would work with later as an actor, including director Geoff Murphy, and actors Martyn Sanderson and Ian Watkin. Acting roles Lawrence began acting in short films in the late 1960s. He won his first acting award, for television play Time Out, in 1971, although at this point music took up the majority of his time. By the late 1980s he had become one of New Zealand's most recognised actors on his own soil. Between 1981 and 1986 he was a much loved feature of many local films; he continued to act in occasional NZ productions through until 1993. Lawrence's breakthrough movie role was relationship drama Smash Palace (1981). Playing the former race car driver who leaves with his daughter after the breakdown of his marriage, Bruno won an award at the Manila Film Festival, and acclaim from American critic Pauline Kael. Further acclaim came with his leading role as the lone scientist in Geoff Murphy's end-of-the-world tale, The Quiet Earth (1985), for which Bruno also helped write the script. He had earlier acted in Murphy's Utu (1983), about the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s, and cameoed in his breakthrough film Goodbye Pork Pie (1981). The Los Angeles Times compared his work in 1984 drama Heart of the Stag to that of \\"a young Brando\\". Bruno's Australian roles included Anthony Hopkins movie Spotswood (aka The Efficiency Expert), Colleen McCullough adaptation An Indecent Obsession (playing a blind man), and 1986 miniseries The Great Bookie Robbery (playing gun-loving robber Cracka Park). In 1990, he portrayed John Peterson in the film, The Rogue Stallion. His last and, at least in Australia, best-known screen role was as devious, golf-loving TV producer Brian Thompson in 1990s satirical TV series Frontline. Death In 1994 while enjoying the success of the Australian television series Frontline, Lawrence was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He died in Wellington, New Zealand, on the 10th of June 1995 at the age of 54. A biography, Bruno: The Bruno Lawrence Story by Roger Booth, and television documentary Numero Bruno (2000, directed by Steve La Hood), cover his life and work. Lawrence is also featured in compilation documentary Blerta Revisited (2001, directed by Geoff Murphy).

Most of its operations are based in Scandinavia, and the company is the second largest retail company in the Nordic countries. The company was owned by the participating retailers until 2000 when half of the company was sold to the Dutch retailer Ahold. It acquired a further 10% in 2004. Ahold is prevented by contractual obligation from exercising majority control over ICA. In 2013 Ahold sold its shares to Hakon for $3.1bn.In 2019, Hemtex was sold to Norwegian home textile chain Kid ASA.

As of Mid January 2015 512 commercials have aired.ICA Stig quit In Swedish Since 2007 it is listed at the Guinness World Records as the longest running television advertising drama. =ICA meat repackaging controversy= In December 2007, a meat repackaging fraud scheme was revealed when a whistleblower spoke to Sveriges Television's flagship investigative programme Uppdrag granskning. Hans Hall√©n, a former quality control manager for the supermarket chain, revealed that the company was aware that meat was being illegally repackaged as early as 2003. Hall√©n, who monitored ICA stores in southern Sweden 2003‚Äì2005, said he informed the company's managers of the practices. According to Hall√©n, many stores engaged in practices such as repackaging meat to change the expiry date. = ICA Offers = ICA Sweden's industries have a large number of stores in which and each is offered weekly offers that provide opportunities for customers to buy cheaper goods online or in physical stores. Each can also offer some extra specific items in the store depending on their own policy. Norway ICA Norge AS runs about 600 stores in Norway as of 2009. Store sales were at approximately 21 billion SEK (excluding VAT). Formerly known as Hakongruppen and owned by Stein Erik Hagen, it operated solely RIMI discount stores until ICA bought the chain, and transformed many of the stores to the ICA brand. After the take-over ICA has been losing market shares in Norway. ICA Norway is divided into four different stores: * Matkroken * ICA N√¶r (closed 2014) * ICA Supermarked (closed 2015/2016) * ICA Maxi (closed 2012) * RIMI (a chain of food stores) In 2014 ICA stores was sold to Coop Norge.

Sales amounted to 612 MSEK in 2010. ICA Real Estate ICA Real Estate's mission is to satisfy the Group's need for the right properties in the right locations in Sweden and Norway.

History =Statoil= Until the mid-1990s, Statoil and ICA jointly operated Statoil Detaljhandel AB (Statoil Retail Ltd) which ran approximately 1,300 petrol stations in Scandinavia, many branded under the name ICA Express. ICA has since sold its 50 percent share of the business back to Statoil and the ICA name was removed from the petrol stations during 2007. =Denmark= ICA previously had a 50 percent stake in the ISO chain of supermarkets in the Copenhagen region, Denmark. In 2004, ICA sold its entire holding in ISO. =Netto Sweden= The Swedish operation of Danish supermarket chain Netto was founded in 2002 as a joint venture between Dansk Supermarked and ICA. The joint venture was named Netto Marknad AB. At the end of 2006, ICA announced it was pulling out of the joint venture, reducing its stake from 50 to 5 percent. Twenty-one of the Netto stores in the Stockholm and V√§stmanland regions were transferred to ICA's ownership and rebranded to ICA's own formats or closed during 2007.

Dawes is also notable as being the first African-American woman to win an individual Olympic medal in artistic gymnastics, and the first black person of any nationality or gender to win an Olympic-gold-medal in gymnastics. She is also one of only three female American gymnasts, along with Muriel Grossfeld and Linda Metheny- Mulvihill, to compete in three Olympics and was part of their medal-winning teams: Barcelona 1992 (bronze), Atlanta 1996 (gold), and Sydney 2000 (bronze). She is also the Olympic bronze medalist on floor exercise from the Atlanta games. Dawes is the first female gymnast to be a part of three Olympic-medal- winning teams since Ludmilla Tourischeva won gold in Mexico City (1968), Munich (1972), and Montreal (1976). Since Dawes, Svetlana Khorkina is the only gymnast to accomplish this feat, winning silver in Atlanta (1996) and Sydney (2000), and bronze in Athens (2004). Early life Dawes was born in Silver Spring, Maryland on November 20, 1976, to Don and Loretta Dawes of Takoma Park, Maryland. She enrolled in gymnastics at age 6 with coach Kelli Hill and won her first competition at age 9. In high school, she moved to Gaithersburg, Maryland to be closer to her coach's gym.\\"Catching up with Dominique Dawes\\" Mary Buckheit, ESPN, February 13, 2008 Gymnastics career =Junior career= Dawes was competing as a junior elite by the age of 10. She placed 17th in the all-around junior division at her first U.S. National Championships in 1988. In 1989, at the age of 12, she was sent to Australia to compete in her first international meet, the Konica Grand Prix. By the early 1990s, Dawes was achieving success both nationally and internationally. She placed 3rd in the all-around in the junior division at the 1990 U.S. National Championships.Official Bio at USA Gymnastics At the 1992 USA vs. Japan dual meet, the 15-year-old Dawes received a standing ovation, after an energetic floor routine in which she revived the back-to-back tumbling revolutionized by Soviet star Oksana Omelianchik. The judges were equally impressed, and gave her a perfect 10. Though she was not part of the 1991 World Championship team, Dawes continued to move up on the national and international scene throughout 1991 and 1992. =1992‚Äì1995= The crowd pleasing athlete placed 4th at the 1992 Olympic trials and was awarded a place on the United States Olympic team. Despite battling very painful tendinitis in both ankles and Osgood-Schlatter disease during pre-Olympic training, Dawes performed respectably throughout the competition, even having the boldness to try a brand-new move in her balance beam routine during team competition - back handspring to three layout stepouts. She also won over the crowd with a solid optional floor exercise routine and, with a mark of 9.925, tied with Kim Zmeskal for the highest score for the American team on the event.Scores by gymnast for the 1992 Olympics team competition Gymn-Forum The team won bronze, and Dawes and teammate Betty Okino became the first African American females to win an Olympic-gymnastics medal. Dawes only competed in the team competition in 1992, not breaking through as an all-around gymnast until 1993. She is probably best known for her performances at the 1993 and 1994 World Championships. In 1993, Dawes led the competition after three events, even beating her more famous teammate Shannon Miller. However, she decided to try her harder vault (1¬Ω twisting layout Yurchenko) worth a 10.00 instead of simply a full-twisting layout Yurchenko, which had been devalued to a 9.8. She made the first vault, but slipped and fell on the second, immediately bursting into tears. With the new rule that both vaults were averaged in all-around competition, her fall dropped her to 4th overall while Miller won the title. Famously, after the vault fall Dawes's coach Kelli Hill exhorted her to be proud of her performance anyway, stating: \\"When did you ever think you would be in that position? You have to be happy with yourself. Come on. Be happy. Stand up and wave\\". Dawes did so and earned a standing ovation from the crowd.Eurosport coverage of the 1993 World Championships After this disappointment she rebounded in the event finals, winning two silver medals on bars and beam. The same fate befell her in at the 1994 Worlds. Leading after three events, she again came to vault with a chance of winning the title. This time her mistake came on the first vault where Dawes over-rotated and hurled forward into a somersault. Her low score dropped her to 5th. Her mistakes continued throughout the event finals and left the championships without winning a single medal. Dawes would finish her year on a positive note, however. She dominated the National Championships placing first in the all-around and all four event finals at the expense of rival Shannon Miller. It was the first year since 1969 that a gymnast had swept the competition. She went on to lead the American team to a silver medal at the World Team Championships in Dortmund, Germany posting the third highest all-around score in the process. =1996= Dawes struggled through a difficult 1995 riddled by wrist and ankle injuries. She finished fourth at nationals and was forced to sit out the World Championships that year. At the 1996 World Championships, Dawes missed out on a medal on the uneven bars but tied Liu Xuan for a bronze medal on the balance beam.\\"Team Gold for Dawes Was Only Part of Plan\\" Christopher Clarey, The New York Times, July 28, 1996\\"Competitors Keeping Olympic Test in Mind\\" Christopher Clarey, The New York Times, April 21, 1996 At the 1996 U.S. National Championships Dawes sweep all four event finals for the second time in her career making her the only gymnast ever to accomplish this feat twice. Dawes also finished first at the Olympic trials, earning a berth on the 1996 Olympic team at the age of 19. Dawes planned to attend Stanford University in fall 1995 but could not receive an athletic scholarship as she turned pro to train for the 1996 Olympics. =1996 Olympic Games= The team, later nicknamed Magnificent Seven, dominated the team competition. A key member of the team, Dawes performed without serious error and was the only team member to have all eight of her scores count towards the total. Along with Shannon Miller, Jaycie Phelps, Dominique Moceanu, Amanda Borden, Amy Chow and Kerri Strug, Dawes claimed her gold medal as part of the first American team to take the Olympic title. Another first, she became the first black woman of any nationality to win an Olympic gold in gymnastics. Later in the week, however, Dawes lost yet another opportunity to win a major all-around title. Going into the competition, she was considered one of the heavy favorites to medal. She was ranked sixth overall among all competitors after the team event, and her scores from team optionals were the highest on the American team and the second highest overall.Scores by gymnast for the team optionals at the 1996 Olympics Gymn-ForumWomen's all-around qualifiers Gymn-Forum Dawes led the competition after two rotations, with Shannon Miller right behind her. Both gymnasts were on Floor Exercise for the 3rd rotation. Miller had a substantial mistake in her routine, knocking her out of the medals. On the middle tumbling pass of Dawes's floor routine, she under-rotated for fear that she might step out of bounds; she sat down the tumbling pass (and went out of bounds anyway) causing her position to plummet in the standings. NBC cameras zoomed in on Dawes, sitting in tears as her score from floor exercise was announced (it was an even 9.000), which led to numerous boos from the audience. She managed to pull out a decent Vault score, but finished 17th overall. In the Event Finals, she placed sixth on Vault and just out of the medals on Uneven Bars, but redeemed herself by winning Bronze in Floor Exercise finals, her first World Championship or Olympic medal in what had long been considered her best event.Event finals notes USA Gymnastics, 1996 =2000 Olympics= Between 1996 and 1998 Dawes competed in various professional meets but retreated from elite competition. She returned briefly in 1998 to participate in the Goodwill Games where she placed 19th in the Mixed Pairs event with Chainey Umphrey. However, she placed 9th all-around at 2000 U.S. Nationals and 7th at the Olympic Trials, and earned a spot on her third Olympic team.\\"Miller Out, But Dawes And Chow Make Team\\" Selena Roberts, The New York Times, August 21, 2000 In team preliminaries at the Sydney Olympics, Dawes posted the second highest score of the American team on uneven bars but the lowest on beam.Scores by gymnast for team prelims at the 2000 Olympics Gymn-Forum In the team finals, she performed well on three events, contributing their highest beam score and 3rd highest bars score (a very high 9.7), and contributed to the team's bronze medal awarded April 28, 2010 when the International Olympic Committee stripped China of its 2000 team medal for an underage competitor.IOC strips 2000 Games bronze medal from China Yahoo! Sports News, April 28, 2010 Education and life after gymnastics Dawes attended Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland and Gaithersburg High School in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where she was the 1994 prom queen. She graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2002. Pursuing a career in acting, modeling, and television production, she has appeared in Prince's music video \\"Betcha By Golly Wow\\" and Missy Elliott's 2006 video \\"We Run This\\" in the role of Missy's gymnastics coach. Dawes also briefly appeared on Broadway in a revival of the musical Grease, playing cheerleader Patty Simcox.\\"Hopelessly Devoted\\" Kimberly Wong, Sports Illustrated, December 30, 1996 Dawes speaking at a physical fitness rally Dawes served as President of the Women's Sports Federation from 2004‚Äì2006; she was the youngest President in the Foundation's history.\\"Ex-Gymnast's Next Routine Is Getting Girls Off Couch\\" Frank Litsky, The New York Times, May 21, 2004 She was the first spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of the USA's \\"Uniquely Me\\" self-esteem campaign in 2002.\\"Olympic Champion Dominique Dawes Teams Up With Girl Scouts & Unilever To Empower Girls Through Progressive New Self-Esteem Program\\" Market Wire, September 2002 Dawes, whose younger brother has autism, has also supported events for autism awareness, such as the 2001 Power of One rally in Washington D.C..\\"The Power of One\\" 2001 She is presently on the Advisory Board of Sesame Workshop's \\"Healthy Habits for Life\\" program and also works as a motivational speaker, concentrating on youth issues.Speaker profile at The American Program Bureau In June 2010, President Obama appointed Dawes to be co-chair of the newly renamed President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, along with New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.\\"Michelle Obama jumps rope, emphasizes nutrition\\", USA Today, June 24, 2010. She provided commentary for Yahoo's coverage of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and for the 2010 Winter Olympics. On October 28, 2010, Dawes was working for Yahoo Weekend News when she met with Center for Inquiry (CFI)'s investigative partner IIG to test Power Balance Bracelets for their claim that they improve balance, flexibility and strength. She states \\"The fact is, all athletes know that nothing can replace good old- fashioned hard work ‚Äì practice, practice, practice...Can a silicone wristband with a hologram sticker really give you an added edge?\\" In the trial four bracelets were taped so no participant knew if the bracelet they were wearing contained the Power Balance hologram. One bracelet was the control with no hologram, another contained only a PEZ candy. From Wendy Hughes report \\"The claim was that if the hologram worked, the speed of the participants would increase, and it would show on the graph. But it didn't. Out of 64 heats, 16 participants using 4 bracelets in 4 random heats, the results were almost flat. The main result was that if there was any change, the familiarity with the course caused a slight increase in efficiency. The Pez didn't make a difference either.\\" Dawes's conclusion is that superstition makes the Power Bracelet work.

ALTA promotes literary translation through its annual conference, which draws hundreds of translators and literary professionals from around the world; the National Translation Awards in Poetry and Prose, an annual $5,000 prize (divvied $2,500 each) for the best book-length translation into English of poetry and prose; the Lucien Stryk Asian Translation Prize, which awards $5,000 each year for the best book-length translation of an Asian work into English; the Italian Prose in Translation Award (IPTA), which awards $5,000 each year for the best book- length translation of a work of Italian prose into English; the Cliff Becker Prize, which is given to an unpublished book-length manuscript of poetry in translation and includes a $1,000 prize and publication by White Pine Press (suspended for 2019); and the ALTA Travel Fellowships, which are $1,000 prizes awarded annually to 4-6 emerging translators for travel to the annual conference. Starting in 2016, in addition to the ALTA Travel Fellowships, one fellowship, the Peter K. Jansen Memorial Fellowship, is awarded to an emerging translator of color or translator from a stateless or diaspora language. History The American Literary Translators Association (ALTA) was co- founded by Rainer Schulte and A. Leslie Willson in 1978 at The University of Texas at Dallas. ALTA's own scholarly journal, Translation Review, was also founded in 1978 and has been published regularly ever since. The ALTA Annual Conference has convened every year since 1978 in various locations throughout North America. From 1978 until 2014, ALTA was administratively housed at the University of Texas at Dallas. From 2014 to 2018, ALTA functioned as an independent, non-profit arts organization. In 2018, ALTA affiliated with College of Humanities at the University of Arizona, with ALTA relocating to UA in January 2019. Annual conference The annual ALTA conference is a four- day gathering of professional literary translators, translation students and scholars, publishers of literature in translation, and others interested in the study, practice, and promotion of literary translation. Conference events include: panel presentations on a wide range of topics related to literary translation; roundtable discussions of issues relevant to literary translators, scholars, and publishers; bilingual readings of recently published translations or translations in progress (The Annual Alexis Levitin Bilingual Reading Series); and interactive workshops on translating specific texts. In addition, each conference features keynote presentations by invited speakers; readings by the ALTA Fellows; a book exhibit of recently published literature in translation; announcements of the National Translation Awards in Poetry and Prose, the Lucien Stryk Asian Translation Prize, and the Italian Prose in Translation Award; a multilingual performance of poetry recitation known as Declamaci√≥n; special events such as film screenings or play stagings; and abundant opportunities for connections among translators, students, scholars, and publishers dedicated to fostering literary translation. In recent years, ALTA conference organizers have selected a conference theme to guide panel, workshop, and roundtable proposals in the direction of a broadly defined aspect of literary translation studies. Themes may address geographies, genres, literary elements, or other angles for approaching literary translation theory and practice. =Recent conferences= * September 29-October 18, 2020 (virtual conference): ALTA43: \\"In Between\\" * November 7-November 10, 2019 in Rochester, New York: ALTA42: \\"Sight and Sound\\", featuring a keynote by Peter Cook and Kenny Lerner, Flying Words Project * October 31-November 3, 2018 in Bloomington, Indiana: ALTA41: Performance, Props, and Platforms, featuring a keynote by Caridad Svich * October 5-8, 2017 in Minneapolis, Minnesota: \\"Reflections/Refractions,\\" featuring keynotes by Lydia Davis and Tim Parks * October 6-9, 2016 in Oakland, California: \\"Translation & Crossings,\\" featuring a keynote by Don Mee Choi * October 28-31, 2015 in Tucson, Arizona: \\"Translation & Traffic,\\" featuring a keynote by Jerome Rothenberg * November 12‚Äì15, 2014 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin: \\"Politics & Translation,\\" featuring a keynote by Christopher Merrill * October 16‚Äì19, 2013 in Bloomington, Indiana: \\"The Nexus of Translation,\\" featuring keynotes by Maureen Freely, Karen Kovacik, and Cole Swensen * October 3‚Äì6, 2012 in Rochester, New York: \\"The Translation of Humor, or, the Humor of Translation,\\" featuring a keynote by David Bellos * November 16‚Äì19, 2011 in Kansas City, Missouri: \\"Translating Voices: Where the Great Plains Meet the World,\\" featuring keynotes by Paul Vangelisti and Douglas Hofstadter * October 20‚Äì24, 2010 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: \\"Drama in Translation,\\" featuring keynotes by Phyllis Zatlin and Lawrence Venuti Awards =National Translation Award= The National Translation Award (NTA) in Poetry and Prose is awarded annually for the book-length translations of fiction, poetry, drama, or creative non-fiction that, in the estimation of the panel of judges, represents the most valuable contribution to the field of literary translation each in poetry and prose made during the previous year.

V-star  The V-Star 650 (and even the 1100) bikes come in three trims: *V-Star Custom (650) XVS650 - Base version for long-distance cruising. *V-Star Classic (650) XVS650A - The same frame as the V-star Custom but with wider front wheel, metal fenders, longer bodywork, less chromed styling, dragged handlebars, wider seat and numerous styling differences. *V-Star Silverado (650) - Much as the V-Star Classic with saddlebags and a few other touring additions *Some V-Star motorcycles come in what others may know as deepish purple (Raven) with flames. There were 2 editions made of this. The XVS65T-F and the XVS65TC-F (CA edition). CA edition is for California Only and is equipped with a canister to prevent the discharging of fuel vapor into the atmosphere. There are 3 lines to this canister. One to the fuel tank, one to the carburetor and a vent hose. Both of these models when the VIN is decoded will show up either XVS650 and XVS650A mostly because their parts are identical to these 2 models with very few exceptions if any. All these are the base versions of the RoadStar. The RoadStar and RoyalStar generally refers to the class of bikes which are made and fine-tuned for touring performance  2009  There were no spec changes between 2008 and 2009 models. *V-Star Classic available from June 2008 *V-Star Custom available from June 2008; CA model from August 2008 *V-Star Silverado available from June 2008http://www.starmotorcycles.com  2008  *V-Star Classic available from September 2007 *V-Star Custom available from September 2007 *V-Star Silverado available from March 2008  See also  *Star Motorcycles full range * Yamaha DragStar 1100 - XVS1100/XVS1100A  References   External links  *Yamaha Motor Co. global site Grupo de propriet√°rios:https://chat.whatsapp.com/J6p8dv0PMX1IMQsEGjMRxO DragStar 650 Category:Cruiser motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1997 ","title":"Yamaha DragStar 650"},{"id":"905335","text":"Death Unlimited (with Faux Cyrillic and Capitals: DE–îTH U–òL–ÜMITED) is the third full-length studio album by the Finnish melodic death metal band Norther.

This church on Arran uses Molios of Leighlin, also Laisr√©n or Laserian (died ca. 639), was an early Irish saint and abbot of Lethglenn or Leithglenn, now Old Leighlin in Co. Carlow, who is supposed to have lived in the 6th and 7th centuries. Life Born in Ireland and raised in Scotland as a young man, he lived the life of a hermit on Holy Isle (off the Isle of Arran). He later visited Rome as a pilgrim and was subsequently said to have been ordained a bishop there. He later entered the monastery at Old Leighlin in Ireland where he became abbot and possibly bishop. He adapted Church discipline in accordance with the practices of Rome. He is credited with introducing or advocating the Roman method of dating the celebration of Easter.Chadwick, Studies in the Early British Church, p. 53 According to Kuno Meyer, he is the Laisr√©n who is depicted in the Old Irish prose narrative The Vision of Laisr√©n, one of the earliest vernacular pieces of vision literature in Christian tradition.Meyer, Otia Merseiana, p. 114. The extant fragment shows him leaving the monastery of Cl√∫ain (possibly Clonmacnois or Cloyne) to 'purify' the church of Cl√∫ain Ch√°in (unidentified) in Connaught. After a three nights' fast, his soul is taken up by two angels, who escort him to Hell to show him the horrors that await unredeemed sinners. The angels explain to one devil eager to take Laisr√©n from them that their guest is granted the vision in order that \\"he will give warning before us to his friends.\\"The Vision of Laisr√©n, ed. and tr.

ITI is affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT). History ITI was founded in 1986, as a breakaway group from the Institute of Linguists (now the CIoL) and successor to the IOL's Translators' Guild. As the principal professional association of translators and interpreters in the United Kingdom, it has become one of the primary sources of information on translation and interpreting to government, industry, the media and the public. It was one of the bodies consulted regarding the creation of the EN 15038 European quality standard for the provision of translation services. Aim The Institute of Translation & Interpreting aims to promote the highest standards in the translation and interpreting professions. It achieves this through the publication of a bimonthly bulletin and pamphlets, the organization of regular conferences and courses linked to Continuing Professional Development, rigorous criteria for full membership including examinations and peer assessment, and a mentoring scheme for newcomers to the profession. The institute also worked together with the CIoL on the establishment and administration of the new designation of Chartered Linguist,http://www.nakedtranslations.com/en/2005/institute-of- linguists-chartered-status-frequently-asked-questions as well as collaborating with numerous other UK-based interpreting organizations in the umbrella body Professional Interpreters for Justice (PI4J/PIJ), to campaign against the new Ministry of Justice framework agreement for public service interpreting. ITI's four most recent chairs Membership Although most of its members are based in the United Kingdom, ITI has members from across continental Europe and other countries where English is commonly used. The main grades of individual membership are Fellow, Qualified Member, Associate, Affiliate and Student, and there are categories for individual Supporters and Academics, with some Corporate Members, classified into Corporate - Language Services Business, Corporate Education and Corporate Affiliate. In November 2007 the numbers at each level were 30 Fellows, 1421 Members, 987 Associates, 85 Students and 77 Corporates, with a further 7 honorary and 35 concessionary members, making a total of 2642. Members are bound by the institute's Code of Professional Conduct. Fellows and Qualified Members are entitled to use the postnominals FITI and MITI; the equivalent AITI for Associates was abolished when the precise definition of 'Associate' changed several times in around 2005, but was reinstated in 2013. Bulletin Magazine The bulletin is published bi- monthly and has an estimated readership of 7000. As well as publicising ITI events, including conferences, workshops etc., it contains articles relating to translating and interpreting. Some editions include interviews with authors and articles on world issues running alongside regular features on the pitfalls of poor translation, reviews of translation software, taxation, money matters, and the many uses of translation and interpreting. Conference On of the highlights in the ITI Calendar is its conference, held every two years at different venues across the UK. The most recent event held at Cutlers' Hall in Sheffield in May 2019 was attended by 375 people, while previous editions in recent years were held in cities such as Cardiff, Newcastle, Gatwick Airport, Birmingham and London. In years when there is no conference, the Institute organises a one-day event, most recently in London in 2018. It was planned to hold the next event in Bristol in June 2020, but this had to be postponed due to Covid-19. Covid-19 During the Covid-19 pandemic, the ITI continued to work to support its members by moving events online. During the early part of the UK lockdown, an online coffee morning was held weekly, along with other online webinars offering training in a range of subjects. These were supplemented by online activities and events offered by regional groups and networks. Regional groups and networks From the beginning, ITI members have sought to form groups based on regional, language and specialist lines. ITI has regional groups that span the United Kingdom, such as the ITI Scottish Network and ITI London Regional Group. Language groups such as the German Network, French Network and Japanese Network (J-Net), as well as subject-based networks such as STEP and infotech, maintain internet-based groups for purposes such as the clarification of terminological queries, discussion of best practice, sharing work, and organizing social events.

In contrast to other coherent digital phase modulation techniques where the carrier phase abruptly resets to zero at the start of every symbol (e.g. M-PSK), with CPM the carrier phase is modulated in a continuous manner. For instance, with QPSK the carrier instantaneously jumps from a sine to a cosine (i.e. a 90 degree phase shift) whenever one of the two message bits of the current symbol differs from the two message bits of the previous symbol. This discontinuity requires a relatively large percentage of the power to occur outside of the intended band (e.g., high fractional out-of- band power), leading to poor spectral efficiency. Furthermore, CPM is typically implemented as a constant-envelope waveform, i.e., the transmitted carrier power is constant. Therefore, CPM is attractive because the phase continuity yields high spectral efficiency, and the constant envelope yields excellent power efficiency. The primary drawback is the high implementation complexity required for an optimal receiver.  Phase memory  Each symbol is modulated by gradually changing the phase of the carrier from the starting value to the final value, over the symbol duration. The modulation and demodulation of CPM is complicated by the fact that the initial phase of each symbol is determined by the cumulative total phase of all previous transmitted symbols, which is known as the phase memory. Therefore, the optimal receiver cannot make decisions on any isolated symbol without taking the entire sequence of transmitted symbols into account. This requires a maximum- likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE), which is efficiently implemented using the Viterbi algorithm.  Phase trajectory  Minimum-shift keying (MSK) is another name for CPM with an excess bandwidth of 1/2 and a linear phase trajectory. Although this linear phase trajectory is continuous, it is not smooth since the derivative of the phase is not continuous. The spectral efficiency of CPM can be further improved by using a smooth phase trajectory. This is typically accomplished by filtering the phase trajectory prior to modulation, commonly using a raised cosine or a Gaussian filter. The raised cosine filter has zero crossings offset by exactly one symbol time, and so it can yield a full-response CPM waveform that prevents intersymbol interference (ISI).  Partial response CPM  Partial-response signaling, such as duo- binary signaling, is a form of intentional ISI where a certain number of adjacent symbols interfere with each symbol in a controlled manner. A MLSE must be used to optimally demodulate any signal in the presence of ISI. Whenever the amount of ISI is known, such as with any partial-response signaling scheme, MLSE can be used to determine the exact symbol sequence (in the absence of noise). Since the optimal demodulation of full-response CPM already requires MLSE detection, using partial-response signaling requires little additional complexity, but can afford a comparatively smoother phase trajectory, and thus, even greater spectral efficiency. One extremely popular form of partial-response CPM is GMSK, which is used by GSM in most of the world's 2nd generation cell phones. It is also used in 802.11 FHSS, Bluetooth, and many other proprietary wireless modems.  Continuous-phase frequency- shift keying  Continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) is a commonly used variation of frequency-shift keying (FSK), which is itself a special case of analog frequency modulation. FSK is a method of modulating digital data onto a sinusoidal carrier wave, encoding the information present in the data to variations in the carrier's instantaneous frequency between one of two frequencies (referred to as the space frequency and mark frequency). In general, a standard FSK signal does not have continuous phase, as the modulated waveform switches instantaneously between two sinusoids with different frequencies. As the name suggests, the phase of a CPFSK is in fact continuous; this attribute is desirable for signals that are to be transmitted over a bandlimited channel, as discontinuities in a signal introduce wideband frequency components. In addition, some classes of amplifiers exhibit nonlinear behavior when driven with nearly discontinuous signals; this could have undesired effects on the shape of the transmitted signal. = Theory = If a finitely valued digital signal to be transmitted (the message) is m(t), then the corresponding CPFSK signal is :s(t) = A_c \\\\cos\\\\left(2 \\\\pi f_c t + D_f \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{t} m(\\\\alpha) d \\\\alpha\\\\right)\\\\, where Ac represents the amplitude of the CPFSK signal, fc is the base carrier frequency, and Df is a parameter that controls the frequency deviation of the modulated signal. The integral located inside of the cosine's argument is what gives the CPFSK signal its continuous phase; an integral over any finitely valued function (which m(t) is assumed to be) will not contain any discontinuities. If the message signal is assumed to be causal, then the limits on the integral change to a lower bound of zero and a higher bound of t. Note that this does not mean that m(t) must be continuous; in fact, most ideal digital data waveforms contain discontinuities. However, even a discontinuous message signal will generate a proper CPFSK signal. See also *MSK  References  Notation for the CPFSK waveform was taken from: *Leon W.

The webs are built by the larger females who hang head down in the center of the web or remain hidden in nearby foliage, with one claw hooked to a signal line connected to the main orb waiting for a disturbance to signal the arrival of prey. Prey is then quickly bitten and wrapped in silk before being stored for later consumption. The initial bite serves to paralyze the prey and minimize the danger of the spider herself being stung or bitten, and the enzymes thus injected serve to begin liquefaction of the prey's internal structures. Alongside the use of the web to capture other prey, the spiders are also cannibals and prey on each other. However, this only happens before, during or after sexual activity. They attack based on their size, sexual experience and hunger levels. A. diadematus is a reclusive creature and only bites humans if cornered or otherwise provoked. It responds to a disturbance by vibrating rapidly in its web until it becomes a blur, a reaction that is assumed to confuse potential predators.

Source: U.S. Department of Energy Automobile accessory power can be transferred by several different means. However, it is always ultimately derived from the automobile's internal combustion engine, battery, or other \\"prime mover\\" source of energy. The advent of high-powered batteries in hybrid and all-electrical vehicles is shifting the balance of technologies even further in the direction of electrically powered accessories. An engine has one or more devices for converting energy it produces into a usable form, electricity connection through the alternator, hydraulic connections from a pump or engine system, compressed air, and engine vacuum; or the engine may be directly tapped through a mechanical connection. Modern vehicles run most accessories on electrical power. Typically, only 2% of a vehicle's total power output has gone towards powering accessories.TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD SPECIAL REPORT 286 TIRES AND PASSENGER VEHICLE FUEL ECONOMY Fig 3-1, p.63 of pdf, p.40 of report Electrical and hybrid vehicles may use a larger proportion of energy for accessories, due to reduced inefficiencies in the drive train, especially the elimination of engine idling. Mechanical Some automobile accessories are connected directly to the engine through gears or belts. These usually require large amounts of power. The air conditioning compressor has been a familiar example, though new all-electric refrigerant compressors are starting to be used in production vehicles. Electrical Early automobiles used a magneto for ignition, which provided no accessory power. The first electrical accessory connection was supplied by a DC generator. Voltage varied with engine speed and because of technological limitations, complicated mechanical devices were used to regulate it. Even so, voltage at idle was too low to be useful. A lead-acid battery was used to provide proper voltage when the generator could not, and was recharged at higher engine speed or lower electrical load. The automobile self starter was an early engine system to use this. Lighting, which had previously been provided by kerosene lamps or gas lamps, was one of the first common electrical accessories. Early systems used 6 volts, but 12 volts became the standard because it provided greater power with less current. The original DC generator was replaced by an alternator controlled by a voltage regulator.first introduced on the 1960 Plymouth Valiant Due to mechanical and electrical properties, it is more efficient to first produce alternating current and then immediately convert it to direct current. By regulating the current sent to the alternator's rotor and thus the strength of the magnetic field, a stable voltage can be produced over a wider range of engine speeds. Starting, lighting and ignition systems of most gasoline- powered vehicles remain as 12 volt systems. Diesel-powered vehicles, including mobile construction equipment and heavy trucks use 24 volt electrical systems, as do many military vehicles. Research is ongoing into adopting a 42-volt electrical system standard for automotive electricity, but the entire electrical system will have to be redesigned and new components manufactured to work with the higher voltage. The main advantage of higher voltage is that electrical components can be made with less metal, saving weight and cost, and improving energy efficiency. Most modern systems, such as power windows, power seats, and power door locks, are electrically powered. Electrically driven power steering systems have been developed and are used in numerous models. High-efficiency all-electric refrigerant compressors for air conditioning are starting to be used, especially in hybrid or all-electric vehicles. The cigarette lighter receptacle serves as a de facto standard for use of portable 12 volt equipment in or near an automobile. Hydraulic The engine generally has a hydraulic pump mechanically driven by the engine, but there may also be electrically driven pumps. In passenger cars, the most common use of hydraulic power has been the steering system. Convertible tops may be raised and lowered using hydraulics. Windshield wipers were sometimes hydraulically driven, although this use mostly ceased after the late 1960s. On vehicles with little or no engine vacuum, hydraulic systems are generally adopted in place of vacuum systems. The French company Citro√´n devised a high-pressure hydraulics system for cars which was used for all manner of systems, even power- adjustable seats. The 1999‚Äì2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee had a hydraulically driven radiator fan, powered by the SUV's power steering pump. In vehicles such as heavy trucks and tractors, hydraulic systems are much more common. Hydraulic rams are used for accessories such as dump truck beds, cranes, loaders, and three-point hitches. Vacuum A commonly available source of power from an internal combustion engine is the partial vacuum available at the intake manifold. The piston engine is fundamentally an air pump, and it produces suction and partial manifold vacuum. Manifold vacuum varies depending on engine load and throttle position, and automobiles use vacuum reservoirs or \\"vacuum canisters\\" to provide a usable source under varying conditions. Turbo charged and super charged engines do not always produce vacuum; the intake manifold is actually pressurized when the turbo is spinning above a certain speed. Reservoirs and devices connected to the engine through check valves allow pressure to reduce when the engine is generating a lot of vacuum, but do not allow air back in. Vacuum canisters only allow vacuum accessories to be operated for a very short time, and air will leak in after the engine turns off. The most ubiquitous vacuum-powered accessory is the booster for the power brake system. The vacuum is only an assist and the brakes can still function, requiring greater force, if the booster vacuum is used up. Many older vehicles used vacuum-powered windshield wipers. Loss of manifold vacuum when the engine was working hard, or at wide open throttle, necessitated using a vacuum booster pump which was usually part of the fuel pump. Automotive vacuum systems reached their height of use between the 1960s and 1980s. During this time a huge variety of vacuum switches, delay valves and accessory devices were created. As an example, a 1967 Ford Thunderbird used vacuum for: * Power brakes * Transmission shift control * Doors for the hidden headlamps * Remote trunk latch release * Rear cabin vent control * Power door locks * Ventilation air routing * Control of the heater core valve * Tilt-away steering wheel release Such systems tend to be unreliable with age as the vacuum tubing becomes brittle and susceptible to leaks. Pneumatic Pneumatic (compressed air) systems are rarely found in passenger cars. Larger vehicles often use air brakes and the pressure may be used to drive other systems. Windshield wipers, automatic gear boxes, and other common hydraulic or vacuum powered accessories are often adapted. On buses where the engine is often at the rear of the vehicle, compressed air may be used for the throttle and clutch. Bus doors are typically air powered, as well as the steps and the suspension, allowing the bus to lower itself or \\"kneel\\" at stops to allow passengers on or off.

Krk is the largest Adriatic island, with an area of ,Vitale, Ksenija, Miroslava Vaclava-Kova, Georgios P. Gallios (2009), Water Treatment Technologies for the Removal of High-Toxity Pollutants, Springer, 1st ed. p. 20. Krk is the most populous island in the Adriatic Sea, with multiple towns and villages that contain a total of 19,383 (2011) inhabitants.  History  = Prehistory = Map Archeological finds show that the island has been inhabited without interruption since the Neolithic, although not much about the earliest people is known. In later periods, Greek and Latin sources refer to ŒöœçœÅŒπœÉœÑŒ± (Ancient Greek) or Curicta (Latin) as one of the Apsyrtidian or Electridian islands held by the Liburnians, an Illyrian tribe. The Liburnians called the island \\"Curicum\\", which is assumed to be an illyrized name given the island by its original inhabitants. There are the remains of prehistoric settlements near Draga Ba≈°ƒáanska and Bronze Age and Iron Age earthworks near Malinska, Dobrinj, Vrbnik and Ba≈°ka. Krk Bridge = Roman era = Krk came under Roman rule once they defeated the Liburnians. The Town of Krk (Curicum) became a town with Italic law whose status evolved to give it the rights of a municipality. Nothing is known about the internal organizations of the town of Krk during this time. Near the present day Franciscan monastery, the remains of thermal baths have been found. The defensive walls of Roman Curicum were among the most secure of all the towns on the Eastern Adriatic fortified by the Romans. Work began on their construction during the Civil War in Rome (50 BCE) and they were further strengthened in the 60s of the 2nd century CE, to enable them to withstand attacks by the Quadi and the Marcamanni who were at that time threatening the Adriatic. Not far from Krk in 49 BCE there was a decisive sea battle between Caesar and Pompey, which was described impressively by the Roman writer Lucan (39‚Äì65 CE) in his work Pharsalia.Naklada Naprijed (1999). The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pp. 111‚Äì112, Zagreb, When the Empire was divided, Krk came under the Eastern Roman Empire. = Migrations of the nations = The walls of the town of Krk could not withstand attacks by the Avars (7th century), but in contrast to Salona, Scardona and Aeona, life in Krk quickly returned to normal. The Croats penetrated into the town on several occasions. They retained many of the Roman names they found there and so it is said that Krk has a \\"mosaic dialect\\". Following the Treaty of Aachen (812) the entire island was ceded to the Byzantine Empire and was governed according to the norms of that Empire. During the reign of Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus (10th century), Krk was known as Vekla, of which the Romanized variant, also used by the Venetians, was Veglia. = Time of the Croatian Counts and Kings = There are no extant documents showing when Krk became part of the Croatian state. It is known that from around 875 the Byzantine town paid the Croatian rulers 110 gold pieces a year to be able peacefully to keep their hold there. While the Croatian state was being established, Krk found itself on the Venetians' route to the Mediterranean. The Venetians conquered the town for the first time in 1001, and from then Krk's history was closely linked with the history of the Republic of Venice for seven centuries. During the reign of Peter Kre≈°imir IV the Croatian rulers regained their power, but the Venetians took Krk for the second time in 1118. = Reign of the Krk Counts (from 1430, the Frankopan family) = Krk When the Venetians conquered Krk for the second time in 1118, the local noble family, the unknown Dujams,Also called Demjen, Duimo or more generally Duym. received Krk as part of a pact with Venice, and they became Counts. When Dujam died in 1163, Venice allowed his sons to make their position hereditary, after a payment of 350 Byzantine gold pieces as tax. In a short time the Krk Counts became so strong that at one time from 1244 to 1260, Venice rescinded their authority. This failed to impede their rise, however. They increased economic exploitation, but they also endeavoured to strengthen old traditions and rights with various statutes (the Vinodol Code 1288 and the Vrbnik Statute, 1388). Dujam's youngest son, who died in 1209, succeeded in extending his authority to the mainland, began to serve the Croatian-Hungarian King and received the district of Modru≈°. Due to his economic strength and social standing, his opponents fought each other for his favour. The Counts became so strong that no power could threaten them (until the Turks). Members of his family were leaders in Split, Trogir and Senj, and from 1392 one of them (Ivan V), became a Croatian-Dalmatian Ban. In 1430 they took the surname Frankopan (Frangipane), claiming to have Roman origins. That year they adopted a coat of arms showing two lions breaking a piece of bread (Latin: frangere panem, break bread). From 1449, the descendants of Nikola IV founded eight branches of his family, and together with the Zrinski Counts were the ruling feudal family in the whole of Croatia right up to 1671. The Frankopans produced seven Croatian Bans, and many of them were patrons of Croatian artists. = Under the Venetians (1480‚Äì1797) = Krk was the last Adriatic island to become part of the Venetian Empire. Due to its location, closest to the Uskoks of Senj, it served as a lookout point and the first line of defence against the Uskoks. From that time the ruler was a Venetian noble, but the Small and the Large Councils both had a certain autonomy. The doge controlled the clergy but public documents were written in Glagolitic which was adopted here more than anywhere else. At the beginning of the 16th century the inhabitants of inland Croatia began to settle on Krk in their flight from the Turks, but Krk suffered a decline like all other Venetian property. In 1527 the town had 10,461 inhabitants and in 1527 it had 8,000. = Under the Austrians = Vrbnik Austrian rule began with the fall of Venice in 1797 and was briefly (1806‚Äì1813) interrupted by Napoleon's Illyrian Provinces. In 1822 the Austrians separated the island from Dalmatia and linked it to Istria, so that Krk, Cres and Lo≈°inj came under direct rule from Vienna. This link contributed to the Croatian National Revival and together with Kastav, the town of Krk played a leading role in the spread of Croatian education and culture. = 20th century = The Italian Occupation (1918‚Äì1920) was brief, and Krk was handed over to Croatia, then in Yugoslavia, by the Treaty of Rapallo, Italy took Krk again in the Second World War (1941‚Äì1943), and German occupation followed from 1943‚Äì1945. The post-war development of Krk was led by tourism. The building of an airport and then a bridge over to the mainland ensures the future of the development of tourism on this island. In Omi≈°alj there has also been industrial development. The bridge is at the north end of Krk island and uses the small island of Otoƒáiƒá Sveti Marko (St. Mark's Islet) as a mid-support.  Economics and infrastructure  Beach Haludovo in Malinska. The view includes the island Cres and mountain Uƒçka in the distance across the Bay Kvarner. Krk is located rather near the mainland and has been connected to it via a two-arch concrete bridge since 1980, one of the longest concrete bridges in the world. Due to the proximity to the city of Rijeka, Omi≈°alj also hosts the Rijeka International Airport as well as an oil terminal representing a part of the Port of Rijeka and a petrochemical plant. Krk is a popular tourist destination, due to its proximity to Slovenia, southern Germany, Austria, and northern Italy. Since the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, many tourists have appeared from Hungary, Romania, and other former Eastern Bloc countries.  Geography  Krk is like many Croatian islands, it is rocky and hilly. The rock is mostly karst. The southeast portion of the island is mostly bare as a result of the bora winds. Some prominent features include: * Obzova, the highest point at 568 msl http://www.krk.hr/en/the_island_of_Krk * Vela Luka a harbor on the southeastern end of the island =Fiber access network= In 2009 the municipality started the project of building a fiber- optic network on the whole area of the city (the town of Krk and 14 neighboring villages) as part of the town infrastructure. Thereby the focus is on building the passive part of the network, which is the most expensive one and the prerequisite for service providers being able to provide ultra-fast Internet connections and new e-Services. The project is covering 6,243 inhabitants and 6,000 households. The first issue was the elaboration of a cost-benefit analysis Town of Krk: projects, city fiber network in 2009/2010 followed by a preliminary network planning. At the beginning of 2013 the building authority issued the relevant approval. The next step is the elaboration of the main project which is the condition for getting the building permission and by which the project can apply for EU structural funds.  Culture and religion  Krk has historically been a center of Croatian culture. Various literature in the Glagolitic alphabet was created and in part preserved on Krk (notably the Ba≈°ka tablet, one of the oldest preserved texts in Croatian). A monastery lies on the small island of Ko≈°ljun in a bay off the coast of Krk. Krk belonged to the Republic of Venice during much of the Middle Ages until its dissolution, when its destinies followed those of Dalmatia. It became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later called Yugoslavia) after World War I, in 1920. After that date, the village of Veglia/Krk remained the only predominantly Italian-speaking municipality in Yugoslavia. After World War II, most of the Italians left. The island of Krk is a participant in the 2020 European Capital of Culture project. Through the program \\"27 neighborhoods\\", the city of Krk, Malinska and Vrbnik will be involved in different events during the entire year.  Language  Krk is well known for its historical language diversity. The Middle Chakavian dialect of Croatian is the primary dialect used on the island. Up to 1898 (the day the last speaker of Dalmatian language, Tuone Udaina died in 1898), five languages were spoken on the island: Venetian, Italian, Croatian, Dalmatian, Istro-Romanian.

At the age of seven the Soul Imperial sound system allowed him to assist them at a local club called Bamboo Lawn. He auditioned for Joe Gibbs as a singer but was unsuccessful. He began appearing as a deejay under the name Cat-A-Rock, but soon switched to the name Super Cat.Moskowitz, David V. (2006) Caribbean Popular Music, Greenwood Press, , p. 283-4 He also appeared as 'Wild Apache'. His first single \\"Mr. Walker\\", produced by Winston Riley, was released in 1981 and established his recording career. He went on to record for Jah Thomas (\\"Walkathon\\", on which he was billed as 'Super Cat the Indian'), but his career was interrupted by a period of incarceration. After his release he began working with Early B on the Killamanjaro sound system in 1984,Lesser, Beth (2008) Dancehall: The Rise of Jamaican Dancehall Culture, Soul Jazz, , p. 84 and his debut album, Si Boops Deh!, was released in the mid-1980s, and included the hit singles \\"Boops\\" (which was based on Steely & Clevie's updated \\"Feel Like Jumping\\" rhythm and sparked a craze for songs about sugar daddies), and \\"Cry Fi De Youth\\", establishing his style of dancehall with conscious lyrics. He started his own Wild Apache Productions label and began producing his own recordings, including the 1988 album Sweets for My Sweet. He featured on the album Cabin Stabbin in 1991 along with Nicodemus and Junior Demus. He had been scheduled to perform at the One Love concert in the UK in 1991, but his appearance was cancelled after the shooting death of Nitty Gritty, for which Super Cat was initially suspected but cleared in 1992.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p. 286 Continuing success saw him move to the United States and sign a contract with Columbia Records, releasing one of the first dancehall albums on a major label, Don Dada (1992). The following year, Sony Music issued The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, and the Crazy, teaming Super Cat with Nicodemus, Junior Demus and Junior Cat. Super Cat had a number of hit singles in the early 1990s, including \\"Don Dada\\", \\"Ghetto Red Hot\\" and \\"Dem No Worry We\\" with Heavy D. In 1992, he was featured on the remix of \\"Jump\\" with Kris Kross, and he also collaborated with them in 1993 for their song \\"Alright\\". These hits made him The Source magazine dance hall artist of the year in 1993. He was also an early collaborator with The Notorious B.I.G., featuring the then unknown artist (along with Mary J. Blige, 3rd Eye and Puff Daddy) on the B-side remix of \\"Dolly My Baby\\" in 1993. The title song, \\"Don Dada\\" was a reply to many jabs made by Ninjaman. His version of Fats Domino's \\"My Girl Josephine\\", performed with Jack Radics, was included in the soundtrack to the film Pr√™t-√†-Porter in 1994. In 1997 he was featured on the number one hit \\"Fly\\" by Sugar Ray from their platinum album Floored. He collaborated with India.Arie on her hit song \\"Video\\" in 2001, and with Jadakiss and The Neptunes on \\"The Don of Dons\\" in 2003. Also in 2003, he collaborated with 112 for their song \\"Na Na Na Na\\". Following the death of his longtime road manager Fred 'The Thunder' Donner in 2004, Super Cat released a multi-cd tribute album entitled Reggaematic Diamond All-Stars that featured contributions from Yami Bolo, Michael Prophet, Linval Thompson, Nadine Sutherland and Sizzla among others. Super Cat reappeared on the national reggae scene in 2009 for a show at Madison Square Garden with Buju Banton and Barrington Levy.

Composition The song has been said to be musically reminiscent of the Beatles' hit single \\"Penny Lane\\". It moves forward by way of regular chords, produced by Lennon and George Harrison's electric guitar. George Martin plays Pianet and piano, on the latter bypassing the keyboard and directly striking the strings . These heavily accented and repetitive lines cause the song to sound as if it is based on a drone. Harrison added an Indian tambura part to the final verse, which further accentuates this impact. The sound of the percussion introduced in this section combines with the tambura to create an Indian mood. McCartney's bassline, in counterpoint to this droning, was described by music critic Ian MacDonald as \\"dreamy\\" and \\"well thought out as a part of the production by McCartney\\". It was recorded after the main track was completed, as were many of the bass lines on Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Starting out in the verse with a pedal on the root note (G) that leaps two octaves, McCartney moves to a marching quarter-note (walking) bass line for the first (and only the first) chorus. In stark contrast, all subsequent choruses are played using a fluid, swing feel, full of anticipated notes that propel the song forward despite the quarter-note droning of the guitar and keyboard. According to Beatles biographer Hunter Davies and MacDonald, the initial idea for the song's title came from a phrase often spoken by Jimmie Nicol, the group's stand-in drummer for the Australian leg of their 1964 world tour. The title and music suggest optimism, but some of the song's lyrics have a more negative tone. In this sense, it reflects the contrasting personas of the two songwriters. In response to McCartney's line, \\"It's getting better all the time\\", Lennon replies, \\"Can't get no worse!\\" In a December 1983 interview, McCartney praised this contribution as an example of things he \\"couldn't ever have done [him]self\\". In a 1969 interview, Lennon cited \\"Getting Better\\" as an example of \\"pure Beatles\\" music, whereby, with the four band members developing a song, \\"we've all written it and we've all turned it into sort of pure Beatle.\\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Referring to the lyric \\"I used to be cruel to my woman/I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved/Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene/And I'm doing the best that I can\\", Lennon admitted that he had done things in relationships in the past that he was not proud of. In a 1980 interview in Playboy with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Lennon, when asked about the song, said that the song's lyrics came personally from his own experience abusing women in relationships in the past. He states: \\"It is a diary form of writing. All that 'I used to be cruel to my woman / I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved' was me. I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically ‚Äì any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace, you see. It is the most violent people who go for love and peace. Everything's the opposite. But I sincerely believe in love and peace. I am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence. I will have to be a lot older before I can face in public how I treated women as a youngster.\\" Incident One of the recording sessions for \\"Getting Better\\" is infamous for an incident involving Lennon. During the 21 March 1967 session in which producer George Martin added a piano solo to \\"Lovely Rita\\", Lennon complained that he did not feel well and could not focus. He had accidentally taken LSD when he meant to take an upper. Unaware of the mistake, Martin took him up to the roof of EMI Studios for some fresh air, and returned to Studio Two where McCartney and Harrison were waiting. They knew why Lennon was not well, and upon hearing where Lennon was, rushed to the roof to retrieve him and prevent a possible accident.

The city is mid-way between Bordeaux and the Pointe de Grave, along the Gironde, the largest estuary in western Europe.http://medoc-tourisme.com/en/mondes/close-to-estuary/ Population Access The town is situated on the famous \\"Route des ch√¢teaux\\" or road \\"D2\\" which runs through the centre of the prestigious wine appellations. It stretches from Blanquefort in the South (close to Bordeaux) to the northern tip of the M√©doc. The Pauillac railway station stands on the line from Bordeaux-Ravezies to the Pointe de Grave. It is served by the TER Nouvelle- Aquitaine regional rail network and operated by the French national railway company SNCF. Ports Marina of Pauillac SNSM next to a giant bottle of wine at the marina entrance channel In 1872, one of the first sailing clubs in France, still active today, was created in Pauillac, followed by the International UCPA sailing school. In 1896, the French Line Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique built a terminal at Pauillac, Trompeloup, on which four cruise ships could dock at a time. A direct connection allowed passengers to join the railway line running between Bordeaux and Soulac. Many companies used this Port for their cruise ships crossing the Atlantic to South America and the Antilles until the mid-20th century. After WWII, the Port was converted into a petroleum terminal and today it is a transfer point for plane parts of the Airbus A380. The parts are manufactured in Broughton in the UK, and Germany. The barges take them through Bordeaux to a dock at Langon and then by oversize road convoy to the assembly plant at Blagnac, Toulouse. A new cruise terminal, the \\"Terminal M√©doc\\", will be built in Trompeloup and should be operational in 2021, allowing cruise ships carrying up to 6,000 passengers. The marina La Fayette was built in 1977 south of this. It has a fisherman pontoon and moorings for about 150 boats. Many services are available including masting and demasting.https://www.pauillac-medoc.com/fr/pauillac- tourisme/estuaire/port-de-pauillac/ Sailors and boaters may have to wait for a couple of hours before entering or leaving the port due to the tide and its high coefficients. A closed and secured area with video surveillance is available for long term parking of boats and trailers.https://www.pauillac- medoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mag_2019_WEB.pdf The marina is also home to the lifeboat Pichon Baron from the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer (SNSM), a French voluntary organisation founded in 1967 to save lives at sea around the French coast, \\"so that salt water never taste of tears.\\" History Plaza La Fayette In 1777, Lafayette, a French aristocrat and military officer, arrived in Bordeaux and set sail from Pauillac to America. There, his role was decisive in the American War of Independence, commanding American troops in several battles, including the Siege of Yorktown. To commemorate his legacy, a bronze stele representing his ship La Victoire is erected on the edge of the marina on the Plaza La Fayette. On the stele can be read in French: \\"From here on March 25, 1777, embarked Marie Joseph Paul Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, with the hope of joining the Americas.\\" After returning to France, he was a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830, also known as the Second French Revolution. In December 1917, the United States Navy established a naval air station to operate seaplanes during World War I. The base closed shortly after the First Armistice at Compi√®gne. In May 1940, an interim occupation authority was established by Nazi Germany in France's so-called zone occup√©e, so that Pauillac was occupied like most parts of the western half of Aquitaine along the Atlantic coast. Main sights The town is mainly known for its vineyards that produce some of the best wines in Bordeaux. The Tourist Office and Wine House (French: Maison du Tourisme et du Vin) is a very informative resource for all things wine related in the area. There are wine tastings, video screenings, wine sales and seminars. Some castles offer art exhibitions (Ch√¢teau P√©desclaux for example) or a museum (Mouton Rothschild castle and its museum of wine in Art). The Village de Bages, a small renovated village next to the Ch√¢teau Lynch-Bages, is dedicated to the wines and tastes of the Pauillac region. It offers a bistro, fine bakery and grocery store, shops and bike workshop arranged around the central square. Cellars tours but also many events are held throughout the year. Cruises operate from the port of Pauillac along the estuary of the Gironde. Western facade of the Saint Martin's church, on Marshal Joffre Square The choir of Saint-Martin's church, covered by a semi-dome The warship Saint Clement, an ex-voto hanging in Saint-Martin's church The Saint Martin's church is situated in the heart of Pauillac on Marshal Joffre Square. In November 1824 were laid the foundations before it would be delivered to worship in May 1828 and completed in 1829. The church was partly built out of the materials from the former church which had become too small. The Bordeaux architect Armand Corcelles was inspired by Greek art. The western fa√ßade is topped by a huge pediment which supports an octagonal tower made of two superimposed towers. The first tower houses three bells. Two of them date from 1784 and come from a former church. The third bell, cracked by too brisk and cheerful ringing during the Liberation in 1945, was melted again, baptized and named Edouard-Jeanne-Victoire in 1946. Inside, the nave has eight doric columns. In the choir, the white marble baroque style main altar is covered by a semi-dome. A canopy just above the altar lights it perfectly. An oculus, on a baroque piece of sculpture background, illuminated by the rising sun, represents the triangle of the Divine Trinity. This church also has an ex-voto: a small replication of the warship Saint Clement, hanging from the vault in the centre of the nave. It was offered in 1836 by the pilots and coastal pilots of Pauillac: \\"To honor the memory of Pope Saint Clement, the patron saint of Pauillac naval station sailors, pilots, coastal pilots and aspirants, all Catholics.\\" The model was restored in 1996. The back of the church is occupied by a large organ loft supported on iron columns. It consists of fifteen stops and was made of wood from Onega, Russia, and northern oak for the organ facade. On the left side of the nave is a wooden pulpit built right up against a pillar surrounded by a double spiral staircase. Facing the pulpit is a Christ on the Cross. On the three walls around the church is a Way of the Cross, fourteen paintings that reproduce the Passion of Christ.https://www.pauillac-medoc.com/fr/pauillac- tourisme/patrimoine/leglise-saint-martin/ Sponsoring and twin cities Pauillac is the sponsor city of the schooner \\"Belle Poule\\", training ship of the French Navy and the Medoc Squadron of Air Force Base 106. Pauillac is twinned with the city of Pullach in Bavaria (Germany) and Paulhac in Haute- Garonne (France).

It is considered \\"the longest Marathon in the world\\" because the race is interspersed with several activities such as wine tasting stops and orchestras scattered around the course. Most of the 8,500 participants, representing more than 50 nations, run in costume. Reed beds Reed bed in Pauillac Extending over several kilometres alongside the estuary, reed beds have flourished and constitute a natural habitat for many plant and animal species. In the more urbanized areas in Pauillac, the reed beds are mown once a year to allow local inhabitants to enjoy the view over the estuary. The mowing period is chosen carefully so as to minimize disturbance of the natural biotope. Some of the reeds are protected by the Natura 2000 legislation. Since 2015, they are part of the Gironde estuary and Pertuis sea Marine Nature Park. Wine Vineyards of Pauillac Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild, awarded First Growth status in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 The wines of Pauillac are often considered the quintessence of Bordeaux wines.Rowe, p250; Johnson(1994), p88; Clarke, p48 British author and expert on wine Hugh Johnson has said, \\"If one had to single out one commune of Bordeaux to head the list, there would be no argument. It would be Pauillac.\\"Johnson(1994), p88 The commune consists of only of vineyards in the Haut-M√©doc between the villages of Saint-Julien to the south and Saint-Est√®phe to the north, but is home to 18 Grands Crus Class√©s (classification of 1855) including three of Bordeaux's five first- growth wines: Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild, Ch√¢teau Latour, and Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild. =Selection of Pauillac estates= * Ch√¢teau d'Armailhac * Ch√¢teau Clerc-Milon * Ch√¢teau Duhart-Milon-Rothschild * Ch√¢teau Grand-Puy- Ducasse * Ch√¢teau Grand-Puy-Lacoste * Ch√¢teau Haut-Bages-Liberal * Ch√¢teau Haut-Batailley * Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild * Ch√¢teau Latour * Ch√¢teau Lynch- Bages * Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild * Ch√¢teau Pedesclaux * Ch√¢teau Pichon Longueville Baron * Ch√¢teau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande * Ch√¢teau Pontet-Canet See also * French wine * Bordeaux wine * Bordeaux wine regions * Communes of the Gironde department References *INSEE  Category:Communes of Gironde ","title":"Pauillac"},{"id":"905397","text":"Kalyn Free is an American attorney, former political candidate, and a tribal citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.

By the 2004 election cycle, according to the Political Money Line, it was the 13th largest Political Action Committee (PAC) in the United States raising nearly $7 Million.

Biography Jansen was a founding member of the band Japan, along with his brother David Sylvian (vocals, guitars and keyboards), Mick Karn (bass guitar), Richard Barbieri (keyboards), and Rob Dean (guitar), having all met in Catford. Japan began as an amateur band in 1974, while their first studio album entitled Adolescent Sex was released in 1978, followed by Obscure Alternatives the same year. Both albums saw polarized reviews and poor sales domestically in the UK, but were commercially successful overseas. The band's third album Quiet Life marked a significant departure from their original alternative glam rock style, with the change in sound causing them to be unintentionally associated with the New Romantic movement by critics, though this was repeatedly refuted by the members themselves. Virgin Records released Japan's final studio albums, Gentlemen Take Polaroids and Tin Drum, while the band had their last live performance on 16 December 1982. Japan suffered from personal and creative clashes and decided to split during a period when they were beginning to experience significant commercial success both in their native UK and internationally. The band briefly reunited in 1991 under the name Rain Tree Crow and released a self-titled album. After Japan's break up, Jansen recorded with bandmate Richard Barbieri under the name Jansen/Barbieri and released an instrumental album Worlds in a Small Room and later (Catch the Fall) as the Dolphin Brothers, with Jansen handling lead vocals as well as drums and percussion. In 1991, Jansen, Barbieri, and Karn formed Medium Productions as a venue for releasing their own music, as well as releases by other artists. Jansen has worked as a session musician and in collaboration with a wide range of international artists, such as Yukihiro Takahashi and Italian singer- songwriter Alice. He collaborated with David Sylvian and Burnt Friedman on the Nine Horses project, which has given birth to one album and one extended play CD released through Sylvian's record label Samadhi Sound. Jansen performed with Sylvian during his live tours, playing drums and percussion. He released his first solo album, entitled Slope in 2007. Regarding the creative process behind the album, Jansen stated that he \\"approached composition attempting to avoid chord and song structures and the usual familiar building blocks. Instead I wanted to piece together unrelated sounds, music samples, rhythms and 'events' in an attempt to deviate from my own trappings as a musician.\\" The album was released on Samadhi Sound, and features Sylvian in a \\"bluesy\\" duet with Joan Wasser, and contributions by Anja Garbarek, Sweet Billy Pilgrim, Thomas Feiner and Nina Kinert. On 15 April 2016 Jansen released a second solo album entitled Tender Extinction via Bandcamp and other digital music retailers. Jansen has continued to work on new compositions, some of which he has released as standalone tracks, and continues to be in demand as a producer and collaborator, working with musicians across a range of genres. A recent re-release of the 1995 Jansen/Barbieri album Stone to Flesh includes a new track entitled \\"Map of Falling,\\" composed by the two musicians in 2015. During his time with Japan, Jansen dabbled in photography, documenting the band and their transient lifestyle. He held small-scale photographic exhibitions in Tokyo and London during 1982 and 1983, respectively. A selection of these images are available on his website. In October 2015, Steve released a book of his photography entitled Through a Quiet Window through the Japanese publisher Artes Publishing. Jansen maintained a Tumblr blog under the username of \\"Sleepyard\\" as an additional avenue to publish his photography and answer fan questions, but wrote a post on in April 2016 stating that he would no longer maintain it, citing his displeasure with the platform as a whole. Later in the same month, Jansen re-launched his blog through WordPress. 2014 Jansen formed a new musical project, EXIT NORTH, with 3 Swedish musicians Charlie Storm, Ulf Jansson and Thomas Feiner. They worked together in Gothenburg, and the album was released 1 October 2018, called Book of Romance and Dust. EXIT NORTH played live in Tokyo 27 September 2019.

The film had a sequel, The Iron Mask (1929), also starring Fairbanks as d'Artagnan and DeBrulier as Cardinal Richelieu. Production The Three Musketeers (1921) The athletic Douglas Fairbanks's one-handed handspring to grab a sword during a fight scene in this film is considered as one of the great stunts of the early cinema period. Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance enthuses, \\"The Three Musketeers was the first of the grand Fairbanks costume films, filled with exemplary production values and ornamentation. Indeed, one ornament extended beyond the film: Fairbanks wore d'Artagnan's moustache‚Äîcultivated for The Three Musketeers‚Äîto the end of his life.

In a Star Wars Tales comic entitled Apocalypse Endor, an Imperial veteran of Endor refers to the moon being devastated by the impact of falling debris from the Death Star, which was blown up while in orbit around the moon. However, another character dismisses this as a myth, saying that most of the Death Star's mass was obliterated in the explosion, and that the Rebels \\"took care of the rest\\". The Rise of Skywalker depicts the wreckage of the second Death Star in a watery location, named Kef Bir, an ocean moon featured in the film that orbits the same gas giant as the forest moon.

Parts of an English Saddle (All-Purpose style) English saddles are used to ride horses in English riding disciplines throughout the world. The discipline is not limited to England, the United Kingdom in general or other English- speaking countries. This style of saddle is used in all of the Olympic and International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) equestrian disciplines, except for the newly approved FEI events of equestrian vaulting and reining. Most designs were specifically developed to allow the horse freedom of movement, whether jumping, running, or moving quickly across rugged, broken country with fences. Unlike the western saddle or Australian Stock Saddle, there is no horn or other design elements that stick out above the main tree of the saddle. Construction The English saddle is based on a solid tree, over which webbing, leather and padding materials are added. Traditionally, the tree of an English saddle is built of laminated layers of high quality wood, reinforced with steel underneath the front arch, and around the rear underside of the tree from quarter to quarter. The sides of the tree that run horizontally along the horse's back are known as bars. Many modern trees are made with spring steel running from front to rear between the bars. These trees are somewhat flexible and are known as \\"spring trees,\\" with the degree of flexibility varying from saddle to saddle. More recently, saddle manufacturers are using various materials to replace wood and create a synthetic molded tree (some still using spring steel and a steel gullet plate). Synthetic materials vary widely in quality. Polyurethane trees are often very well-made, but some very cheap saddles are made with fiberglass trees that are not so durable. Leather is added on all sides of the tree to create the seat, flaps and panels. Cowhide is usually used, though pigskin and other leathers are also seen. The panels on the underside of the saddle traditionally are stuffed with wool flock, which is still preferred and used on the highest quality saddles. Synthetic materials, including foam and fiberfill materials, are used on more moderately priced saddles, and one company currently sells a design that uses airtight sealed panels that are inflated with air. Parts of the English saddle A saddle with most leather removed, showing tree and seat padding Underside of a Dressage saddle, showing panels, gullet, sweat flaps and tips of the billets Stripped-down saddle, showing spring tree structure that underlies the panels Billets, sweat flap, buckle guard, and knee rolls. These are under the flap of the saddle *Tree: the base on which the rest of the saddle is built, usually based on wood or a wood-like synthetic material, with metal elements added, such as the stirrup bar and, in some cases, the gullet. It is eventually covered in leather or synthetic material as the saddle is built. *Panels: the part of an English saddle which provides cushioning between the horse's back and the saddle, and allows adjustment in fitting the saddle to the horse. Also important in keeping the saddle balanced for the rider. Often stuffed with wool or foam flocking, or maintained by sealed air pockets. The panels under the cantle are called the \\"rear panels.\\" Those at the front of the saddle are called the \\"front panels.\\" However, the rear and front panels are one continuous unit, which can be seen if the saddle is flipped over. The saddle has two panels total, one on each side of the horse's spine. *Gullet: The space between the bars of the saddle which provides clearance for the horse's spine so the saddle does not place pressure on it. The gullet width of the saddle is dictated by the front arch of the tree. In some models, the angle (and thus the width) of the front arch can be adjusted on an individual saddle by use of interchangeable elements. Though imprecise terminology, the gap between the stuffed panels is colloquially referred to as the gullet. *Seat: the dip in the saddle where the rider's seatbones rest, it is the lowest part of the saddle's topline. The deeper the seat, the more security is provided for the rider. *Pommel: the front of the saddle, which is raised higher than the seat both to provide security for the rider and to give the horse's withers clearance. *Cantle: the back of the saddle, which is raised higher than the seat to give security. *Waist or Twist: the part of the saddle between the seat and the pommel, on which the rider's pelvic bone rests. The width of the waist has a great effect on rider's comfort, especially for women riders. *Skirt or Jockey: piece of leather that goes over the stirrup bar, to help prevent the rider's leg from rubbing on the buckle of the stirrup leather (which is adjusted so it is right against the stirrup bar). It also helps to keep the buckle of the stirrup leather from unbuckling and sliding down. The skirt is small to allow easy access to the stirrup leather. *Saddle flap: The large piece of leather on the exterior of an English saddle that goes between the rider's leg and the billets and girth buckles. The shape and length of the saddle flap is directly related to the intended use of the saddle, as it must mirror the rider's leg position. *Sweat flap: The large piece of leather on the underside of the saddle that goes between the billets and the horse. It helps to protect the rest of the saddle from the sweat of the horse, and the horse's skin from being pinched by the girth straps and buckles. In monoflap saddles it is lightweight and sewn to the saddle flap, with extended girth points enabling the girth to be buckled below the flap. *Billets or points: Straps which are secured over the saddle tree on stout webbing and hang down, to which the girth is buckled. They have several holes in them to adjust the tightness of the girth. There are generally three billets, allowing a spare in the event one billet is torn or frayed. Some saddles have very long billets to buckle the girth below the saddle flap to reduce the bulk underneath the rider's leg, allowing for closer contact with the horse. The foremost point is usually attached to a narrow web, and the rear two to a wider web. *Girth Buckle guard: the billets are threaded through the Girth buckle guard, which protects the saddle flap from getting worn away by the buckles of the girth. These are not always present on saddles with long billets, which are intended to be buckled below the saddle flap. *Knee roll: the padded part at the front of the English saddle's panel and sweat flap, helping to give the rider more leg support. It may be very wide and thick, very thin (a pencil-roll), or not present at all. Additional padding on the outside flap of the saddle is sometimes added for extra grip. *Thigh roll: the padded part at the rear of the panel's sweat flap, which lies behind the rider's thigh and can give extra stability in the saddle. Very common in dressage saddles but much less so in jumping saddles as it may interfere with freedom of movement of the rider's leg. *Calf block: padding that falls behind the rider's lower leg, helps to keep it in place and stabilize the rider. It is only seen on a few saddle models. *Stirrup: part of the saddle in which the rider's feet rest, provides support and leverage to the rider. **Stirrup Bar: part of the tree of the saddle which allows stirrups to be attached. It is made of strong metal and riveted to the tree. The stirrup bar is often kept in the \\"open\\" position, so that, should the rider fall and start to be dragged, the stirrup leather can release off the saddle, freeing the rider. There are only a few instances in which the bar should be kept in the \\"closed\\" position, and some stirrup bar designs cannot be closed. **Iron: The metal part of a stirrup, in which the foot of the rider rests. It provides support and leverage. It is usually made of stainless steel, not iron. **Leather: The part of the stirrup which attached the stirrup iron to the stirrup bar of the saddle. It can be adjusted to change the lengths of stirrups. Leathers is correct plural usage. *Stirrup leather keeper: keeper sewn onto the saddle flap, through which the extra stirrup leather is passed. Keeps it neatly out of the way so it doesn't get under the rider's leg. Some saddles simply have a slot cut into the saddle flat, through which the leather is passed. *D-ring or Staple: a metal ring with rounded or squared corners on the front of an English saddle, to which certain pieces of equipment, such as breastplates, can be attached. May be of stand-up or centrally hinged design. Some are stitched into leather and can be pulled out of the saddle when under stress. Some are fixed through the front arch of the tree for greater strength. History of the English saddle The traditional hunting saddle, with a low pommel and cantle, and no padding. Note the long stirrup and the rider's seat, his feet pushed forward, which was the common position of the time. During the 18th century, most riders in Europe used high-pommel and cantle saddles, with a wooden frame for classical dressage. This saddle was based on a model used for bull fighting, cattle work, long-distance travel, and mounted combat, as its high pommel and cantle helped to provide the rider with support. This saddle is still used today, most notably by the Spanish Riding School, and also in Iberia and eastern Europe. In England, foxhunting grew in popularity (as the usual quarry of deer had dwindled following the English Civil War, when they were hunted for food). This required a new type of riding, as horse and rider now had to tackle fences, hedges, ditches, and banks straight on if they wished to keep up with the hounds and witness the kill. The old saddle was cumbersome while hunting. Its cantle would get in the way of the riders as they tried to lean back over the fence (a practice that was common until Caprilli developed the \\"forward seat\\"), and the high pommel created pain as the rider went over jumps. The resulting saddle developed for foxhunting had a very low pommel and cantle with a flat seat, and no padding under the leg, therefore providing the rider with little, if any, support. The stirrup bars were protruding, and placed more forward than modern saddles, which made it nearly impossible for the rider to keep his legs underneath his body. However, the usual practice was to ride with longer stirrups, and the feet pushed out in front, so this was not a problem. The English hunting saddle is the predecessor of all English-type riding saddles. As the sports of show jumping and eventing became more popular, saddle shape changed. Caprilli, Santini, and Toptani developed the \\"forward seat,\\" in which the rider uses shorter stirrups and keeps his legs under him as he rode in two-point, with his seat bones hovering above the saddle. The shorter stirrup required a more forward flap, to match the greater knee angle of the rider. The protruding stirrup bars were uncomfortable in this new position, so they were recessed. The waist of the saddle was also made narrower. Additionally, padding was placed under the knee rolls, for extra security. Differences from Stock saddles A western saddle. Note the lack of panels and addition of prominent pommels and cantle, the difference in stirrups, and the traditional horn. The term English saddle encompasses several types, including those used for show jumping and hunt seat, dressage, Saddle seat, horse racing and polo. To non-horsemen, the major distinguishing feature of an English saddle is its lack of a horn. However, some Western saddles, such as those used to ride rough stock in rodeos and certain types of western-influenced saddles used in endurance riding, lack a horn as well. These saddles can still be classified as western-influenced, however, due to the deep seat, high cantle, prominent pommels, wide fenders (stirrup leathers) and large, leather-covered stirrups. In addition, saddles used for working cattle in nations other than the United States, such as the Australian Stock Saddle and the Charro Saddles of South America, often share stock saddle features such as a deep seat and extra leather to protect horse and rider, but lack a horn. The other major characteristic which defines an English saddle is that it has panels: these are a pair of pads attached to the underside of the seat and filled with wool, foam, or air. Although some modern saddlers have developed alternative models, the English saddle is usually constructed on a framework known as a tree. The tree is made of wood, spring steel, or composite, and it supports the rider on a sling of webbing between the firm pommel (front of the saddle) and cantle (back of the saddle). On either side of the tree, a steel hook known as the \\"stirrup bar\\" is affixed. It is upon this hook that the rider hangs the stirrup leather, which is a very strong leather or nylon loop supporting the stirrup. More very strong leather or nylon straps known as billets (or girth points/straps - UK) are attached to stout webbing which is tacked across the top of the tree, to which will eventually buckle the girth--the beltlike strap which holds the saddle onto the horse. The tree and its various parts are upholstered with a covering made of leather, nylon or microfiber and shaped to form the seat above and the panels below. In addition to the seat and panels, English saddles feature leather flaps on either side; the underside flap is called the sweat flap, and the upper flap is called the saddle flap (or, simply and appropriately, the \\"flap\\"). The flaps sit between the rider's leg and the horse's side and protects the horse from being pinched by the stirrup leather or girth, and the rider's leg from being chafed by the girth buckles. On some saddles it is also specially padded to protect or support the rider's knee. Styles of English saddles The differences between the styles of English saddle are small but significant. The most important distinctions are the location and therefore the balance of the seat, and the flap length and shape. A saddle used for a discipline where the rider sits more upright with a longer leg, such as in dressage, has a flap that is longer to accommodate the leg, and less inclined forward (as the knee does not need to go forward). The seat will also be closer to the withers, to keep the rider's center of gravity in the correct spot. However, in disciplines where the rider needs shorter stirrups for better balance and security, such as in the jumping disciplines, the saddle flap is moved proportionately forward and shortened, and the seat is moved further back. A jumping saddle will have a shorter and more forward flap than a dressage saddle, with the seat slightly more towards the cantle. If the flap was not inclined forward, the rider‚Äôs knee would hang over the flap, and the flap would constantly push the leg out of position (usually backward), so that the rider would become unstable and interfere with his horse. If the seat was not moved rearward, the rider would be forced ahead of the saddle over a fence. A racing saddle, where jockeys ride with incredibly short stirrups, will have an extremely forward and short saddle flap (almost more horizontal than vertical), and the seat will be extended well back from the pommel to keep the rider‚Äôs center of gravity correctly situated. Supportive padding in the seat, size and shape of knee rolls and the use of additional blocks behind the leg is also considered when developing a saddle. While a polo saddle is constructed with a minimum of padding so as to allow the polo player great freedom to twist and reach for his shot, a saddle used for jumping or eventing may have more padding to help give the rider support over fences. Another development is the monoflap saddle, in which both the sweat flap and saddle flap are made of lighter weight leather, stitched together around the edges leaving only a passage point for the girth straps, thus reducing the thickness of leather between the rider and the horse, and giving a closer feel, while still protecting the horse's skin from straps. =All-Purpose or Eventing saddle= All-purpose or eventing saddle, crossing a deeper seat and long flap with a more forward flap placement. The \\"all-purpose\\" or \\"eventing\\" saddle (also sometimes called a \\"general purpose\\" saddle) was developed to allow riders to use one saddle both over fences and on the flat. This type of saddle has a deep seat with a long, but somewhat forward flap. The flaps usually have padding under the leg, for support while jumping. The design is intended to be a compromise between the flatter \\"close contact\\" jumping saddle with a forward flap, and deep-seated dressage saddle with a long, straight flap. This style of saddle is most commonly seen in amateur-owner or lower-level junior competition. The less-expensive \\"all-purpose\\" models are often marketed as beginner's saddles. More expensive models are usually labeled \\"eventing\\" saddles. Manufacturers insist that there is a significant design difference between an eventing saddle and an all-purpose saddle. However, while eventing saddles usually do have better balance and higher quality materials and workmanship, a fundamental design difference is otherwise difficult to discern. Many manufacturers create two models, one with a slightly straighter dressage-oriented flap that still allows a rider to jump low fences, and another with a more forward flap that allows a rider to jump somewhat more challenging fences, but still permit a deep seat for flat work. One company manufactures a design with a flap that can be adjusted to be straighter or more forward, as the rider prefers. Due to the deep, secure-feeling seat, the design is also used by some people when starting young, unpredictable horses, and is quite popular for trail riding, endurance riding, and casual hacking. Many top-level endurance riders find this design superior to an \\"endurance\\" style saddle for distance competition because it allows them to get off the horse's back and move quickly over rough or mountainous terrain, yet provides greater security to the rider. On the other hand, this compromise design also means that an advanced rider may find the saddle limits his or her ability to obtain a correct position at higher levels of competition, either in show jumping or dressage. For this reason, some English riding instructors and coaches do not particularly encourage their riders to use these saddles. Quality and balance are very critical factors to consider when purchasing an all-purpose saddle. Many cheap models are designed with a too-forward cut flap that is not properly aligned with the seat, which prevents the rider from getting into a correct position on the flat and sometimes gives the rider the uncomfortable sensation of feeling like they are constantly sliding backwards. Also, when the stirrups are adjusted correctly for jumping, the rider's knees are not always placed properly in relation to the flap. Some models also are too high in the cantle, which can hit a rider in the buttocks and push the seat too far forward when jumping all but the smallest fences. =The Jumping saddle= Jumping or \\"close contact\\" saddle, with more forward flap and design placing rider closer to horse The jumping saddle, sometimes called a \\"forward seat\\" or \\"close contact\\" saddle, is designed for show jumping, hunt seat equitation, foxhunting, and the show jumping and cross-country phases of eventing. Its most distinctive feature is a forward-cut flap that allows for a shorter stirrup length (although not as short as racing stirrups). The flap often has supportive padded knee rolls, especially for show jumping and cross- country, less so for equitation. The balance of the seat is further back and comparatively flat, with the cantle and pommel low so that they do not interfere with the rider's jumping position (and variations known as \\"two- point position\\" or \\"half-seat\\"). Like the All-Purpose saddle, the jumping saddle usually has three short billets. However, other styles (such as monoflap jumping saddles) have longer billets that mirror the dressage saddle, so that the rider no longer has to ride with extra bulk under the leg. It is important that the rider's leg fit appropriately into the flap of the jumping saddle when the stirrups are shortened. If the knee is too far forward or back, the rider's balance will be incorrect and the saddle becomes a hindrance rather than an advantage while jumping obstacles. =Dressage saddle= Dressage saddle, showing a long, straight flap. Dressage saddles have a very straight-cut flap, much longer than a jumping saddle, which accommodates the longer leg position of a dressage rider, who works only on the flat and does not need to jump fences. The pommel is a bit higher and the deepest point of the saddle's seat more forward, all to allow for this longer leg position. The seat is usually much deeper in a dressage saddle than a jumping saddle, and allows the rider to sit comfortably and relax to best influence the horse. The stuffing of the panels is often kept to a minimum in a dressage saddle, to allow a closer feel with the horse. It often has a wider bearing surface than a jumping saddle. Some designs feature an exaggerated amount of padding in front of the knee, much more than in a jumping saddle, said to assist the rider in keeping the knee down and thigh back. However, there is usually little padding behind the calf, as the rider needs to be able to freely move the lower leg to give aids to the horse. The billets of most dressage saddles are very long, to allow the girth to be buckled near the horse's elbow rather than underneath the rider's leg (which would get in the way of giving effecting leg aids). However, some dressage saddles come with shorter billets. =The Saddle seat saddle= :see also Saddle seat A \\"Saddle seat\\" style English saddle The saddle seat saddle, also sometimes called a \\"Park,\\" \\"Lane Fox\\" or \\"cutback,\\" is a variation on the English show saddle. It is seen most often in the USA and Canada, but also on occasion in South Africa and other parts of the world. It is used most often on the high-action and gaited horses of the Americas. Gaited breeds using this saddle include the American Saddlebred, Tennessee Walking Horse, and Missouri Foxtrotter. Non-gaited but action-oriented breeds such as the Morgan and the Arabian, are commonly shown in saddle seat style, though these breeds also have hunt seat divisions. The seat of this saddle is longer and flatter than that of a forward seat or dressage saddle. The seat places the rider's center of balance farther back on the horse than in other English riding disciplines, though correct saddle seat equitation still demands that the rider's legs and feet be balanced under the horse. The pommel is always cut back to allow greater freedom of the front legs and shoulder, as well as to accommodate the higher set neck and higher withers typical of the saddle seat breeds. The flap is wide front-to-back, with no blocks or rolls beneath, and ends closer to the cantle than any other English saddle so that the rider's leg (whose thigh is further back than in other styles because the seat is also farther back) is protected. Riders use very long stirrups, usually at least as long as those of dressage riders. The saddle seat was developed from two sources. The first was a flatter European saddle developed to sit the rider further back to show off the high front leg action of flashy horses, often seen quite literally during Sunday rides in city parks. (See English Show Saddle, below.) The second source was the plantation saddle developed in the southern United States that allowed riders to sit back comfortably on a gaited horse as they covered large areas of land on a daily basis. =Endurance saddle= The Endurance saddle, originally based on a military or police saddle, is used for the long-distance competition of endurance riding. Its major task is to provide the horse and rider with the comfort and balance needed to cover long distances over rough terrain, sometimes for multiple days. For the rider, the seat is often quilted or padded, and the stirrups are designed with a wide foot tread to reduce fatigue. For the horse, the panels of the saddle are extended to provide a larger area of contact with the back, thus reducing fatigue linked to the pounds per square inch of saddle contact. The saddle has many dee rings along the pommel and cantle that allow the rider to attach various items. Modern endurance saddle manufacturers have been innovative in methods to lighten weight and provide additional comfort for the horse, and several of these techniques have gone on to influence other saddle types. The panels are stuffed with different types of material, all designed to spread pressure evenly and disperse sweat. Most endurance saddles may have extended panels (called \\"fans\\" or \\"blazers\\"), which increase bearing area. Others may have \\"floating\\" panels, which are particularly useful since endurance riders often ride with their seat out of the saddle (releasing pressure from the back, but increasing the amount felt on the stirrup bars where they attach near the point of the tree). There is also an endurance saddle design based on the western saddle that is a bit larger and heavier, but is designed with similar goals. =English showing saddle= A modern English showing saddle with a dressage-like straight-cut flap, designed to show off the horse's shoulder This saddle is used in the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere, for showing on the flat or over low fences, and is a direct descendant of the English hunting saddle. The show saddle is designed to show off the horse's conformation, most notably the shoulder, and is therefore a minimal saddle with a close fit and straight-cut flap. The seat is very flat, and there are no knee or thigh rolls, so the saddle offers little support to the rider. Like the American Saddle Seat saddle, the English showing saddle has a stirrup bar set farther forward and a cutback pommel that falls behind rather than over the withers, though the seat is less flat and the rider's center of balance is closer to that of a dressage saddle. Many show horses are also presented in fatter condition than in more athletic disciplines, so the billets are placed to help keep the saddle properly placed on a rounder animal, with the foremost billet on show pony saddles frequently being attached directly to the point of the front arch of the tree; this is known as a \\"forward point\\". The traditional position of the old style show rider was to ride with the feet placed forward, and the seat pushed back, which was once thought to encourage more action and to make the horse look as if it has a longer front end. Modern competitors are starting a trend to a more classical position, with the leg placed underneath their body and their hips over their heel, a position more forgiving on the horse's back that encourages better movement. The traditional English showing saddle is not used by these riders, and instead a more modern dressage-like saddle is used, with a more vertically cut flap. There sometimes is slight padding in these saddles, providing extra support, and the horses themselves are often shown in leaner, more athletic condition. The American- style Saddle Seat position, set behind the horse's center of balance, somewhat resembles the old-style show position, though the modern rider remains balanced over the stirrups. =Sidesaddle= Sidesaddle, with 2 pommels. The sidesaddle was used by women from approximately the 14th through 19th centuries, when a combination of long skirts and social mores discouraged women from riding astride. Today the saddle is still widely used for specialty purposes in shows, parades, and other exhibitions. It has use for practical purposes by some riders who have injuries that make it difficult to ride astride. A smaller number of riders feel that sidesaddle riding is a skill and riding art worth preserving and thus continue to practice the style, working to achieve greater skill and refinement. Sidesaddles may be used in almost every discipline, including show jumping. In the USA, the four main divisions in modern horse shows are Western, Hunt seat, Saddle seat (the two English divisions use the same basic style of saddle but different bridles and rider appointments), and \\"historical,\\" which may depict any culture or period, but must be fully researched and correctly utilized. Although sidesaddles are still manufactured today, it is a small niche market, and a new sidesaddle is quite expensive. Thus most riders who wish to ride sidesaddle are often found hunting for older saddles at antique shops, estate sales, and in dusty barn lofts. It is difficult to find a sidesaddle that not only fits the rider and horse but also is in good condition. The sidesaddle has only one stirrup leather, and two pommels: the fixed pommel (sometimes called a \\"horn\\" or \\"head\\") and the \\"leaping horn\\" or \\"leaping head\\". Although there are some sidesaddles that lack a leaping horn, they are not considered safe by modern standards. Both pommels allow the rider to stay in place, even when jumping. In fact, it may be difficult for the rider to be thrown free should the horse fall. The vast majority of sidesaddles are designed so riders sit with both legs on the near (left) side of the horse, though occasionally a sidesaddle is found that is reversed and allows the rider to sit with their legs to the off (right) side. In spite of having both legs to the side of the horse, properly positioned riders sit on the horse facing forward, with their spine centered in the saddle perpendicular to that of the horse, with weight balanced equally on both buttocks. The seat must be wide enough to accommodate the rider's offside thigh as well as buttocks. A sidesaddle is comparatively flat from front to rear. Many have a small curved pommel and a long, raised cantle on the off side to support the offside thigh and to help riders keep their spine squared on the horse's back. On some designs, the seat of the sidesaddle is angled away from the side on which the legs lie to help the weight of the rider remain centered over the horse's back. The near-side flap is commonly cut forward to keep the rider's right leg and foot from touching the horse's left shoulder. The girthing of an English sidesaddle is usually a three-buckle system, with a usual full-length girth and an additional balancing girth. The stirrup of a sidesaddle is much shorter than in a conventional saddle, so that the rider's knee is placed close to the leaping horn, and it buckles midway down the leather rather than close to the tree. =Racing saddle= Racing saddle. See also: Horse racing, Steeplechase The flat racing saddle is designed to not interfere with a running horse and to be as lightweight as possible (including the stirrup irons). The racing saddle has a very long seat without a dip to it, combined with extremely forward flaps that accommodate the very short stirrups and extreme forward seat used by jockeys. It also has a flat pommel and cantle so nothing interferes with the rider. Flat-racing saddles are built on a half-tree to reduce weight; because the rider spends most of the time up over the horse's withers, there is no need for the protection to the horse's spine that a full tree provides. The stirrups, instead of being looped over stirrup bars, are generally looped directly over the wooden bars of the half tree to prevent the loss of a stirrup during a race and to reduce bulk. This saddle provides very little security, placing the rider in a position that allows a horse the freedom of movement needed to achieve maximum speed, but at the cost of giving the rider less leverage to control the horse, and less protection for the horse's back from a sitting rider. Therefore, racing saddles are not suited for general equestrian riding. Most flat racing saddles weigh less than 1¬Ω pounds; the lightest saddles weigh as little as 8 ounces. They generally have only one billet to attach the girth, and so an overgirth is usually added to keep it secure. Saddles used in steeplechases are generally slightly heavier and more substantial, usually being built on a full tree. Exercise saddles are usually larger and heavier, with a more prominent pommel and cantle to provide more security to the rider. Though these features add pounds, weight does not matter as it would in a race. =Polo saddle= Polo saddle The polo saddle is designed specifically for the mounted game. It has a relatively flat seat and the saddle flaps are long and fairly straight to accommodate the longer leg position, although more forward than the dressage saddle. One of the defining features of the polo saddle is that there is very little or no padding under the leg, allowing the rider to have maximum freedom of movement. If the saddle had thigh or calf blocks, the leg would not be allowed to swing forward or back as needed. Fitting the English saddle There are many factors to consider when fitting a saddle, and a professional saddle maker may be consulted to fit a saddle properly to a horse's back. Incorrectly fitting saddles cause pressure points, which may result in bruising, soreness, and behavior problems under saddle. The saddle must also fit the rider, as security on the horse can be compromised when a saddle is the wrong size. =Correct saddle placement= Before fitting the saddle, it must be positioned correctly on the horse's back. The points of the saddle tree at the front arch should give a full three-fingers width of clearance behind the shoulder blade when the horse is standing straight, or a hand's width with the foreleg fully extended. This can be done by having someone on the ground pull each of the horse's forelegs as far forward as possible, holding the leg at the knee, while another person checks the shoulder blade. The rider's weight should be carried on the muscles that are over the horse's ribs (from behind the shoulder blades to the last rib). The last rib of the horse should be found, and the saddle should not come behind it. Many riders put their saddles too far forward, especially those that use jumping saddles. A properly fitting saddle will \\"find its own place\\" when put on over the withers, and then slid back until it will not easily slide further. Even a well-fitting saddle will cause discomfort to the horse and position problems for the rider if it is placed too far forward, creating problems that include: * Interference with the horse's shoulder blades as it extends the forelegs, folds the legs over fences, or when the leading leg in canter or gallop is in the most rearward position (the top of the shoulder blade can move a full one and a half inches backwards from the standing position during canter and gallop). This also is damaging to the saddle, as it causes the tree to twist. * Incorrect angle of the seat. When the saddle is too far forward the pommel rises up, tilting the cantle down and moving the seat back, so it is impossible for the rider to maintain a correct balanced position. This not only makes it extremely difficult for the rider to stay balanced, as they are constantly trying to scramble \\"uphill,\\" but also places the majority of weight close to the cantle, and hence on the horse's loins. * Harmful pressure areas because the tree points are more likely to dig into the withers. This causes extreme discomfort for the horse, and can produce bald spots and sores. * Improper positioning of the girth too far forward, which can result in rubbing behind the elbows and lead to girth sores. * The stirrup bars are placed forward of the natural drop of the stirrups, causing pressure from the rider's feet to push them to go too far forward, resulting in a \\"chair seat\\" \\" position, so that correct balance is very difficult. Saddles that are placed too far back (a common error made by inexperienced riders first learning to saddle a horse), or saddles with a tree that is too long (for example, a horse-sized saddle placed on a pony) also cause problems for horse and rider, including: * High risk the saddle will slip sideways. The horse's barrel becomes wider and rounder the farther back it goes, and the withers also become lower before blending into the back altogether, leaving nothing to prevent the saddle from sliding. * Pressure on the horse's loins, which is not only uncomfortable for the animal, but may cause damage to the spinal column, particularly the lumbar vertebrae, which are not supported by the ribs. * Pinching and pain in the loins and hips. * Lack of balance by the rider in the saddle, as the rider will be perpetually behind the motion of the horse. * Misbehavior by the horse due to discomfort. * The pommel of the saddle will drop downwards, making the rider 'slide downhill' in the saddle and increasing the risk of a fall over the shoulder. =Fitting the horse= A saddle must be measured for width, length, and front arch height (clearance over the withers). In ideal circumstances, the saddle is tried on the horse prior to purchase, or is purchased with a return option if it does not fit. When saddle shopping, or if having a saddle custom-made, one method of sizing the horse is known as a \\"wither tracing.\\" To create this, an artist's flexicurve or a piece of coat hanger wire is placed up over the withers about two inches behind the horse's shoulder blade, then shaped to fit across the withers. The shape is then traced onto heavy paper or cardboard. An average horse can be fitted with just this measurement by comparing the angle of the wither tracing to the angle of the piping at the front arch of the saddle. However, horses with an unusual shape are measured in three locations, the second measurement approximately two inches behind the first one, and the last measurement nine inches behind the withers. Often for accurate measurements, a professional saddle fitter may need to be consulted. Tree width The tree width, which dictates the width of the saddle and height of the gullet, is one of the most important factors when fitting the saddle, and can be tested easily by looking at the sweat pattern on the animal's back after work. A tree that is too narrow is more of a threat than one too wide, as it pushes the points of the saddle tree into the horse's back. This will often result in a hollowing if it persists for long periods of time. The sweat pattern will have even sweating along the panels, except for the points of the tree, which will cause round dry spots in the area of sweat, as a result from the pressure. A saddle that is slightly too wide will not be as much of a problem. However, a saddle that is much too wide will not have adequate wither clearance, especially on a high-withered horse, causing pressure in this area. Too much pressure in the short term can lead to rubs and saddle sores, long- term problems may include damage to the thoracic vertebrae that make up the withers. Panels The panels need even pressure. The bearing surface of the panels should be as large and even as possible, within the confines of the saddle design. Poor flocking (stuffing) or pressure points from the saddle tree will decrease the bearing area. Uneven fit increases the pounds per square inch in a given area of the back, which can lead to soreness or even injury. Distribution of flocking can be tested by running the hands down the panels while applying slight pressure. If the panels are stuffed unevenly (one panel higher than the other, or stuffing that is hard and lumpy rather than smooth), the saddle will have pressure points and could cause soreness. A saddle fitter can check to make sure see if the panels are correctly stuffed for the horse. The front panels should have pressure evenly distributed down their front, which can be tested by saddling the horse, tightening the girth, running the hands down the front panels to feel for even pressure. The back panels should not rise off the horse's back when it is ridden. Height of the gullet The saddle should provide adequate clearance for the spine and withers. With the horse's heaviest rider sitting on the saddle, there should be at least three fingers width between the pommel and the withers, and when girthed up with a thin pad or no pad, it should be possible to look down the gullet and see light at the other end. The gap between the panels should also be about three inches wide all the way down, pommel to cantle, though heavily built animals may need four or more inches of width here to avoid pressure on the ligament over the spine. =Fitting the rider= Saddle properly fitted to rider Saddle too large for rider Saddle too small for rider The fit of the saddle to the rider is also critical, as a poorly fitting or badly designed saddle will disrupt the rider's balance by either pushing the rider backwards, behind the horse's center of balance, or lead to incorrect form as a way to compensate for a lack of balance in the saddle. Just as an athlete cannot perform their best if they have shoes that do not fit, even excellent riders have a difficult time riding well in a poorly balanced or ill-fitting saddle. Therefore, it is best to find a model that is comfortable and allows the rider to easily maintain the correct position. All English saddles are measured from the nailhead below the pommel to the center of the cantle. In the USA, English saddles, other than saddle seat styles, are manufactured in standard sizes for adult riders ranging from 16¬Ω to 18 inches. Standard Saddle Seat sizes range from 19 inches to 21 inches. Most styles also manufacture proportionately smaller saddles for children. However, seat measurement is not a hard and fast way to determine if a saddle will fit a given rider. No two saddles are identical; there can be 1/4\\" variation between saddles of different brands with the same size designation. Length of thigh often plays a greater role in selecting a proper seat size than does rider weight or hip width. As a rough rule of thumb, sizes 16¬Ω and below (19\\" for Saddle Seat) are generally for youth riders and smaller women. 17 and 17¬Ω inch saddles are usually suitable for adult women of average size, with the 17 inch seat more suitable for shorter riders and the 17¬Ω for those with a longer thigh (20\\" and 21\\" for Saddle Seat). 18 inch saddles are the most common size for adult men and larger women. (21\\" for Saddle Seat, with larger custom sizes sometimes available). Saddles are also manufactured with different flap lengths to accommodate riders of different sizes. Factors in saddle fit for a rider include the following: * Pommel/Cantle height: the cantle should be slightly higher than the pommel, so the seat is not too far back (which would tip the rider backward and force the lower legs forward). * Seat: the lowest part of the seat should also be the narrowest part of the saddle, the waist or twist, in order to balance the rider over the horse. When the rider is centered in the saddle, the length of the seat should allow about one hand's width both behind the rider's seat and in front of the pelvis. A saddle that is too small is uncomfortable to ride in and does not allow the rider the security provided by sitting deep in the saddle. A saddle that is too big does not provide any support for the rider and allows the seat to slide around too much. However, flap size and length of the rider's thigh bone also influence the length of seat needed. * Twist or Waist: the narrowest part of the saddle needs to fit the rider's pelvic structure so that the seat bones properly support the rider. This varies by age, weight and gender. If either too wide or too narrow, considerable discomfort may result. Some saddle twists are designed more for the pelvic structure of men than for women and thus may be uncomfortable for the other gender. * Saddle flap: with the stirrups at the appropriate riding length (which will differ according to experience and riding discipline), the knee should not come too far behind the flap (so the flaps do not provide any support), or too far in front (which will force the lower leg back and severely disrupt the balance of the rider. * Position of the stirrup bars: The bars must be properly balanced under the saddle so that the rider is not put off balance when rising in the stirrups (such as when posting or jumping) Riders also should check that the stirrup bars are properly recessed and do not stick out in such a way that the buckles of the stirrup leathers will cause bruising or rubs on their legs. Finally, particularly with used saddles, the rider must verify that the safety release mechanism works properly to release a stirrup leather in the event a rider falls and is tangled in the stirrups. =Consequences of poor fit= Long term, poor saddle fit may cause multiple back problems for the horse. It is possible for the horse's topline muscles to deteriorate, or for the horse to develop the wrong muscles. The muscles of the back just rear of the withers may atrophy, causing hollows right behind the shoulders, giving the withers the appearance of being higher and sharper. Horses may also lose muscle tone from traveling with a hollowed back, leading to increased risk of lordosis (\\"swayback\\"), kissing spines, or pinched nerves. For riders, spending long hours in a poorly fitting saddle may result in lower back pain as a consequence of incorrect pelvic angle. Saddles that are too small may also cause discomfort if the rider's seat is pushed into contact with the pommel. Evidence of a saddle with a poor fit include: * Sore back or \\"cold\\" back * Hollowing of the back, raising the head, and tensing the jaw against the bit while under saddle * General stiffness or one-sidedness, shown by a reluctance to take one lead over the other at the canter or reluctance to turn in one or both directions * Shortness of stride * Unwillingness to work, including \\"napping\\" or \\"balking\\" (refusal to go forward), Bucking, rearing, bolting, or overall sour attitude * Uneven wear on the hooves * Reluctance to be saddled, exhibited by fidgeting, tooth grinding, biting or kicking). * Intermittent or unexplained lameness * Uneven sweat or dirt pattern under the saddle after a workout, particularly dry spots in an area that should normally be sweaty. For example, two dry spots just behind the withers on either side of the back are indicative of either excess pressure causing reduced circulation. Dry spots in the center of the back may indicate \\"bridging\\" of the saddle - no contact with the back in a location where the saddle should be in contact. Riding with a white cloth under the saddle is used as a diagnostic tool to make uneven patterns more visible. * Rub marks under the saddle. The hair may become sweaty, but shouldn't be roughed up to the point it lays sideways or backwards to its direction of growth. Roughened hair may indicate either rubbing and instability due to poor fit, or it may be due to improper saddle placement (particularly putting the saddle on too far back and pushing it forward, pulling the hair the wrong direction). * In extreme cases, open sores or patches of white hairs (from death of cells due to abnormal pressure) sometimes called \\"saddle marks.\\" Places of manufacture English saddles are made in many places around the world. A traditional manufacturing centre is in Walsall, England. Other countries that produce fine English saddles are Ireland, France, Germany, Australia, Italy, Switzerland, Canada and the United States. Argentina produces many English saddles, particularly for the polo market, as well as a large number of brands that are in the mid-range of prices for other disciplines. The least expensive saddles are usually manufactured in India and can vary tremendously in quality of both workmanship and leather.

The show's new set was done in pastel colors with a modern flair, separating its look from other similar shows, including rival Entertainment Tonight. The new look also included a brand-new graphics package. Access Hollywood is taped at Studio 1 at The Burbank Studios (formerly NBC Studios) in Burbank, former home of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

He quit the band after a short time because he was assigned the clarinet while he wanted to play the trumpet. After this, he concentrated on guitar and in 1981 formed the band Saber Tiger. A year after their founding, they started playing shows at live houses in Yokosuka, such as Rock City. Their live performances featured shock elements such as mannequins and raw meat. In April 1983 he started studying cosmetology and fashion at the Hollywood University of Beauty and Fashion in present-day Roppongi Hills, from which he graduated in 1984. Later that year he took a nationwide examination and successfully obtained a beautician license. In July 1985 Saber Tiger released their self-titled EP, which included two songs, \\"Double Cross\\" and \\"Gold Digger\\". In November, the band contributed the song \\"Vampire\\" to the Heavy Metal Force III sampler, which also included songs by X. In 1986 the group changed its name to Saver Tiger to avoid confusion with a similarly named band from Sapporo (see Saber Tiger). Their first appearance with the new name was on the sampler Devil Must Be Driven out with Devil, with their songs \\"Dead Angle\\" and \\"Emergency Express\\". They continued to perform in live houses and night clubs such as Meguro Rokumeikan, Omiya Freaks and Meguro Live Station until January 28, 1987, when Hide became tired of changing members and decided to end the band (vocalist Kyo and drummer Tetsu would both go on to D'erlanger), around the same time he was invited to join X. In 2001, Nippon Crown issued a three-volume release titled Origin of hide, with the band credited as \\"Yokosuka Saver Tiger\\". Volumes 1 and 2 were live CDs, with some rehearsal recordings, while volume 3 was a concert VHS. =1987‚Äì1997: X Japan= Hide joined X Japan (then called X) in February 1987, becoming the band's lead guitarist and occasional songwriter. After that he contributed the songs \\"Celebration\\", \\"Joker\\", and the single \\"Scars\\". X Japan released their first album Vanishing Vision through drummer Yoshiki's own Extasy Records on April 14, 1988, and toured extensively in support of the record. They would become one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, and were later widely credited as one of the pioneers of visual kei. X Japan's major label debut album, Blue Blood, was released on April 21, 1989 and debuted at number six on the Oricon chart. Its success earned the band the \\"Grand Prix New Artist of the Year\\" award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards in 1990. Their third album Jealousy was released on July 1, 1991 and debuted at number one, selling over 600,000 copies. It was later certified million by the RIAJ. Shortly after the release of Art of Life, which also topped the Oricon, the members of X Japan took a break, to start solo projects. Around that time, the group also dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics, except Hide who would still perform in wildly colorful outfits and with his trademark red, later pink, hair.As seen on the Dahlia Tour Final 1996 video release. Dahlia, which would become the band's final album to date, was released on November 4, 1996 and once again, it reached the number one spot. In September 1997 it was announced that X Japan would disband, they performed their farewell show, aptly titled \\"The Last Live\\", at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997. =1993‚Äì1998: Solo career= In early 1993, Hide recorded the song \\"Frozen Bug\\" with Inoran and J of Luna Sea, under the band name M*A*S*S, it was included on the sampler Dance 2 Noise 004. He also starred in an art film titled Seth et Holth, along with Tusk of Zi:Kill. In 1994, he recorded and released his first solo album Hide Your Face, which reached number 9 on the Oricon chart. The album's musical style differed significantly from the speed metal anthems and power ballads of X Japan, leaning more towards alternative rock. He then went on the Hide Our Psychommunity Tour, for which a live band was hired that would later become his primary project, Hide with Spread Beaver. In 1996, Hide oversaw the production of the first release on his own record label LEMONed, an album from the band Zeppet Store. Prior to starting his own label, he would introduce bands he liked to Yoshiki, who then signed them to his own Extasy, as he had done with Zi:Kill, Luna Sea and Glay. His second solo album Psyence was released on September 2, it topped the Oricon and was followed by the Psyence a Go Go tour. He also formed a new band named Zilch in 1996, which apart from him and Spread Beaver programmer and percussionist I.N.A., was composed of American and British artists, such as Joey Castillo (Queens of the Stone Age), Paul Raven (Killing Joke) and Ray McVeigh (ex-The Professionals). After X Japan disbanded in 1997, he formally titled his solo project Hide with Spread Beaver, with his backing band considered full members. On August 26, 1997, he produced the Mix LEMONed Jelly event at four different Tokyo nightclubs on the same night. Several artists performed, including Hide backed only with I.N.A. as DJ. Death Hide's grave Hide died at age 33 on the morning of May 2, 1998. After a night out drinking, he was found hanged by a towel tied to a doorhandle in his apartment in the Minami-Azabu district of Tokyo. He had returned to Japan just five days earlier, after a three-month stay in Los Angeles. On May 1, he and the members of Spread Beaver recorded for television shows and went out drinking, with his brother driving him home at roughly 6:30am the following morning. When found unconscious at around 7:30am, he was taken to a hospital in Hiroo, where he was pronounced dead at 8:52am. Authorities officially deemed Hide's death a suicide, and it was reported in the media as such. Within one week, three teenage fans had died in copycat suicides. At the wake on May 6, 10,000 people attended, a 19-year-old girl slit her wrists after laying flowers at the temple, and a car crash caused by sleep-deprived fans travelling from Osaka caused one death and seven serious injuries on a motorway. His remains were buried in Miura Reien in Miura, Kanagawa during a Buddhist memorial service. Approximately 50,000 people who attended his funeral at Tsukiji Hongan-ji on May 7, where 56 people were hospitalized and 197 people received medical treatment in first aid tents due to a mixture of emotional exhaustion and heat, with the funeral taking place on the warmest day of the year at that point, at 27 degrees Celsius (about 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Meanwhile, several of Hide's friends and colleagues stated that they believed the auto-strangulation to have been an accident, among them X Japan co-founder Yoshiki and former X bassist Taiji. No suicide note was left and Taiji theorizes in his autobiography, that on the night of his death, Hide may have been practicing a technique to relieve upper back and neck pains which guitarists can suffer from continuous use of a shoulder strap. The technique involved was practiced by the X Japan members during their touring days and required the use of a towel and a doorknob or handle. According to Taiji, Hide may have fallen asleep in his intoxicated state, becoming caught and strangling himself. Zilch bassist Paul Raven said \\"I saw him a few days before he passed away, and I had no indication from him that anything was wrong other than that he was exhausted\\", but commented that Hide was \\"under a lot of stress\\", due to the recording schedule for the Ja, Zoo album. He went on to question the ultimate degree of Hide's involvement in the finished record, remarking that only three songs had been completed before he died. However, Hide's brother and manager stated in his 2010 book that six songs were completed by the time of his death. This is supported by the fact that I.N.A is credited with additional arrangement on four of the album's ten tracks.Ja, Zoo liner notes, 1998-11-21. Retrieved 2013-03-08 Posthumous =1998‚Äì2010= The Hide museum Later that month after his passing, the single \\"Pink Spider\\" was released, entering the Oricon chart at number one. The song was also named \\"Song of the Year\\" at the 13th Japan Gold Disc Awards and received the MTV Video Music Award in the category \\"Japan Viewers Choice\\". Sales were also strong for the follow-up single \\"Ever Free\\" which took its number one spot, while those of the single released prior to his death \\"Rocket Dive\\" would also see a substantial increase. American Journalist Neil Strauss commented on the trend saying that: \\"In just a few weeks, pop culture in Japan had gone from mourning Hide's death to consuming it.\\" Zilch's debut album 3.2.1. was released in July and reached number 2 on the Oricon chart, the group would continue to perform and record for several years. While they never achieved mainstream success in the United States one of their songs was included on the soundtrack for Heavy Metal 2000. Ja, Zoo was released in November of that year with the artist listed as 'hide with Spread Beaver', formally crediting his backing band, also reached the number 2 position and sold over a million copies by the end of the following year. Despite Hide's death, Spread Beaver went through with the 1998 Tribal Ja, Zoo Tour from October through November, performing live with the addition of recordings, drawing an audience of 50,000 people. Footage from the tour was later released on DVD in 2005. On May 1, 1999, a tribute album was released, titled Tribute Spirits. It features covers of Hide's songs by several bands such as Buck- Tick, Luna Sea and Oblivion Dust, and solo artists including Tomoyasu Hotei and Cornelius. The album was released to coincide with the first anniversary of his death. A Hide museum was opened in his hometown of Yokosuka on July 20, 2000. It has been reported that Japan's Prime Minister at the time, Junichiro Koizumi, was influential in getting it built as he is a big fan of X Japan. The museum remained open, past its original three-year plan, for five years, before closing its doors on September 25, 2005 with an estimated 400,000 people visiting. Prior to his death, Hide and Yoshiki talked about restarting X Japan with a new vocalist in the year 2000. The surviving members of X Japan eventually reunited in 2007 and recorded a new song, \\"I.V.\\". It contains a previously unused guitar track by hide. Their first concert was held at the Tokyo Dome on March 28, 2008, during the performance of \\"Art of Life\\" a hologram of Hide (taken from footage of an \\"Art of Life\\" performance at the Tokyo Dome in 1993) played alongside the band. X Japan still considers Hide a member, and have introduced him at every concert they have performed since reuniting. X Japan performing in 2009 with an image of Hide in the background. Despite his death, they still consider him a member of the band. As far back as July 8, 2007, Yoshiki announced to be in talks with several musicians regarding a Hide tribute concert set for 2008, in order to commemorate the tenth anniversary of his former bandmate's death. The Hide memorial summit was held on May 3 and 4 2008 at Ajinomoto Stadium, with X Japan, Dir en grey, D'espairsRay, Versailles and many others performing, Luna Sea and Phantasmagoria even reunited for one day to perform. Hide with Spread Beaver also performed, using studio and live recordings for Hide's vocals. Organizers planned for an estimated 100,000 fans to attend the two shows. Prior to the summit, there had been tribute shows held every year since 2000, where bands performed on Hide's birthday and this continues to this day. As with many other deceased musicians, re-issues, remixes, compilations and previously unreleased portions of Hide's work continue to be published. One of the most recent being \\"The Devolution Project\\", a release of his original eleven singles on picture disc vinyl, throughout 2010. On the 12th anniversary of his death, also in 2010, a memorial service was held at Tsukiji Hongan-ji with an estimated 35,000 people attending. In August 2010, Hide's management company Headwax Organization, which includes his brother Hiroshi, filed a lawsuit against Yoshiki's management Japan Music Agency, for using images of the former X Japan guitarist without a formal agreement in place. The claim states that in 2000 the two companies signed an agreement allowing Yoshiki and X Japan to use visual images of Hide during concerts. However, images were used at X Japan's August 14 and 15 shows at Nissan Stadium, when apparently the contract had expired. =2011‚Äìpresent= On March 8, 2011, a jukebox musical based on and featuring Hide's music debuted, named Pink Spider after his song of the same name. Hide had previously expressed his desire to make a\\"rock opera\\", and said that the story of Pink Spider is not finished in the single, it remains open, and the musical aims to follow this thought thread. The show stars both Nao Minamisawa and Hitomi Takahashi as Meru, a girl who likes rock music, struggling between the real world and a fictional one called Psychocommunity. Other cast members included Taka (defspiral) and J, with the backing band being the rest of defspiral. The production ran from March 8 to the 27 at the Tokyo Globe Theater and was then brought to Fukuoka, Kobe, Nagoya, Niigata, Sendai, and Sapporo in April. The musical production was overseen by I.N.A. A compilation album of the songs used in the musical (the original versions by hide) was released on March 2 and is titled \\"Musical Number\\" -Rock Musical Pink Spider-. At the end of 2012, a special project titled Hide Rocket Dive 2013~2014 ~20th Solo Works & 50th of Birth Anniversary was announced. It includes films shown in several locations on May 2, including some overseas, the re-opening of the Hide museum and plans to hold another Hide memorial summit festival. Two tribute albums, following the first in 1999, were released on July 3, 2013 and contain twenty-five tracks covered by newer visual kei acts such as heidi., Sadie, Matenrou Opera and Screw. Two more tribute albums were released on August 28, the first being covers of Hide's songs in a classical music theme, and the latter his song's remixed by Spread Beaver member INA. Two additional tribute albums were released on December 18 as the final installments, one composed of covers by female recording artists such as Koda Kumi and Kanon Wakeshima, and the other by rock acts including D'erlanger and Kinniku Sh≈çjo Tai. The Hide Museum 2013 was in Odaiba from June 27 to July 28, when it moved to Universal Studios Japan in Osaka for August 7 to September 8. The exhibition include life size wax dolls of hide. The new live concert film hide Alive the Movie -hide Indian Summer Special Limited Edition- was shown in theaters throughout Japan. Special limited tickets to see the movie came with a thirteen-track live CD of songs from the depicted concert, which was recorded on September 8, 1996 at Chiba Marine Stadium. In March 2013, Headwax Organization announced that Hide's grave site at Miura Reien was vandalized when unknown suspect(s) scratched the gravestone with a sharp object. They stated that if additional acts occur, the grave would be temporarily closed to the public. Hide \\"performed\\" with Super Band, a one-off band whose lineup altered per song, at Sodegaura Kaihin Koen on September 14, 2013 as part of Kishidan Banpaku 2013 hosted by Kishidan. Its members included J on bass, Hisashi Imai and Hisashi on guitar, Ken Morioka on keyboards, and Tetsu (D'erlanger) on drums. A previously unfinished song by Hide called has been completed by Yamaha and INA utilizing vocaloid technology to mimic the deceased musician's voice. The song was originally written and demoed for Ja, Zoo in 1998, took two years to finish and was included on an album by Universal Music released on December 10, 2014. Junk Story, a theatrical documentary on Hide that includes interviews with friends, staff and fellow musicians who knew him, entered theaters across Japan on May 23, 2015. Hide with Spread Beaver performed on October 15, 2016 at Makuhari Messe alongside X Japan and Glay as part of the second day of the Visual Japan Summit. A special Hide 20th Memorial Super Live Spirits was held at Tokyo Otaiba Yagai Tokusetsu Stage J Chikuon on April 28 and 29, 2018. In addition to Hide with Spread Beaver on both nights, other acts that performed over the two days included Buck-Tick, Oblivion Dust, Mucc and Tomoyasu Hotei. A multimedia box set titled hide 1998 ~Last Words~ and containing five CDs, a DVD and two books was released on May 2. All conducted within the last few months of his life, the CDs contain radio interviews Hide gave on Nippon Broadcasting System and Bay FM 78, the DVD contains footage shot in Los Angeles while recording Ja, Zoo, and the books republish interviews he gave to magazines such as Rockin'On Japan and Fool's Mate. On May 26, a documentary film titled Hurry Go Round was released in theaters. Another tribute album titled Tribute Impulse was released on June 6 and features acts such as Dragon Ash, Takanori Nishikawa and Miyavi. Personal life Hide's younger brother Hiroshi was his chauffeur and manager until his last days. He took some of Hide's ashes with him to throw in the Santa Monica Bay, along with a bottle of wine. Hiroshi has a son whom, during the Hide Our Psychommunity Tour, Hide would bring onstage and sing to. Hiroshi is the president of Hide's management company Headwax Organization, and also appears on Ja, Zoo reading an excerpt on \\"Pink Cloud Assembly\\". During an interview for the television show Rocket Punch!, recorded on May 1, 1998, Hide said he had a girlfriend. The identity of this girlfriend was never confirmed, as Hide died the following day. Equipment Burny MG-130S hide signature guitar Hide was a fan of Bow Wow guitarists Kyoji Yamamoto and Mitsuhiro Saito, and played the Mockingbird style guitar, which Saito used. Hide was rarely seen performing without a Fernandes guitar. He has many signature models with the company and owned a large repertoire of guitars by other manufacturers. His numerous signature models are still available for purchase today. One of his guitars, a 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard, was once owned by Mick Mars of M√∂tley Cr√ºe. Songwriting and influence Hide was influenced by hard rock bands such as Iron Maiden, AC/DC and Bow Wow as well as punk rock acts such as The Clash and The Sex Pistols. However, Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley was his idol and biggest influence. He preferred guitarists who make playing look \\"effortless\\" and who have \\"the skill, the looks and the attitude\\", naming Frehley, Jimmy Page and Joe Perry. He also cited Iron Maiden's self-titled debut album for teaching him how to arrange twin guitar parts. In X Japan, Hide is the second most credited songwriter and the only member other than Yoshiki to pen one of their singles. He appears to have been the most experimental as well, with the song \\"Xclamation\\" from 1989's Blue Blood, co-composed with Taiji, including traditional Indian percussion,Blue Blood LP lyrics sheet insert, 1989-04-21. Retrieved 2013-03-08 and the single, \\"Scars\\", being progressive metal. According to Alexey Eremenko of AllMusic, \\"Scars\\" and \\"Drain\\" from 1996's Dahlia were a glimpse into Hide's future experiments in industrial rock. The Japan Timess Philip Brasor commented that when Hide died, \\"Japanese metal lost its greatest practicing innovator.\\" At the outset of his solo career, Hide experimented with instrumentations very different from what he usually had access to in X Japan. The Hide Your Face opening track \\"Psychommunity\\", for example, has four guitar tracks and employs a full string section. As another example, \\"Blue Sky Complex\\" features guitars in drop C tuning, a trumpet section, and an organ. His music is also of genres uncharacteristic of X, with the bulk of his catalog being considered alternative rock or hard rock. The title track of his second album Psyence is a big band/jazz composition with full brass, however, most songs on the record are clearly industrial rock with varying uses of guitar effects. Of note is that most bass guitar tracks on the album were played by Hide himself. Instrumentation and songwriting are less experimental on Ja, Zoo, with most songs featuring a fairly conventional two guitars, bass, drums, and keyboards. Traditional piano and violins, and a Hammond B-3 organ do, however, make an appearance. His lyrics were often dark, with one TV host saying \\"A lot of what Hide did was grotesque. He's talked about suicide in his records for five years. But the fans who followed him always knew there was a Hide behind that who was a very solid character. He was very outspoken about freedom and doing what you want\\". His compositions \\"often set the tone of alienation and frustration for which X Japan was revered.\\" Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained \\"In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase\\", \\"they all talk about how [hide] gave them something to live for.\\" Japanese DJ Maki Yanai believes fans saw in him the rebel society would not allow them to be. Hide is regarded as very influential to not only contemporary Japanese musicians, but also to his generation. X Japan is considered one of the founders of visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam, and subsequently are influences to many newer bands. When they disbanded, Hide was the only member to carry on with the look and had the most successful solo career. As such, acts that cite him specifically as an influence include D'espairsRay, Miya of Mucc, Nightmare's Hitsugi, Syu of Galneryus, Hizaki and Teru of Versailles, members from heidi., Naoto of Deathgaze, DuelJewel's Shun, Kouichi of Laputa, Jui from Vidoll, Reo of lynch., Dir en grey vocalist Kyo and guitarist Kaoru, each member of DaizyStripper, Kohshi from Flow, members of MarBell, Head Phones President frontwoman Anza, DJ Ozma, Ami Suzuki, Silver Ash leader Ling, Chiemi Ishimoto from Mass of the Fermenting Dregs, Marilyn Manson and Minami Momochi. Ryuichi stated that Hide was a big influence on Luna Sea. Hide has been compared to Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix with regards to his impact on Japanese youth, having been \\"elevated to a 'guitar god' status.\\" According to Josephine Yun, Hide's \\"stage persona was insolent, in your face, taunting and belligerent, and it thrilled Japanese youth while horrifying older generations. Many Japanese felt stifled by convention and identified with his naughty rebelliousness; he became a cult figure.\\" Neil Strauss claims Hide \\"despised the music business and wanted to change it\\" and that he said he felt \\"trapped in the image of a pop star.\\" According to Strauss, he \\"represented a generation of fans who felt alienated, and his death represented the end of a genre.\\" Billboards Steve McClure concurred; his \\"death means the end of an era\\", adding \\"X were the first generation of visual kei bands[...] For the next generation of bands, it's like: That's it. The torch has been passed to us.\\" Spread Beaver Hide's backing band for his solo career: * ‚Äì percussion, programming, backing vocals 1993‚Äì1998, 2008, 2016, 2018 (Zilch, Dope HEADz, Sonic Storage) * ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals 1994‚Äì1996 (Blizard, X-Ray, Twinzer) * ‚Äì bass, acoustic guitar, backing and lead vocals 1994‚Äì1998, 2008, 2016, 2018 (Debonair, Madbeavers, Chirolyn & The Angels) * ‚Äì drums 1994‚Äì1998, 2008, 2016, 2018 (44Magnum, Ziggy, Madbeavers, Rider Chips) * ‚Äì keyboards, piano, guitar, backing and lead vocals 1994‚Äì1998, 2008, 2016, 2018 (Loopus, Ra:IN, Minimum Rockets) * ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals 1996‚Äì1998, 2008, 2016, 2018 (Jewel, Virus, Media Youth, R, machine, Madbeavers, Lucy) * ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals 1998, 2008, 2016, 2018 (Oblivion Dust, Spin Aqua, Sonic Storage, Vamps) X Japan guitarist Pata made numerous live appearances with the band and also appears on a couple studio recordings.

Fedele served as CEO and co- chairman from 1998 to 2004. Prior to FreshDirect, Fedele was CEO and president of Fairway Market on West 132nd Street in Manhattan from 1993 to 1998.Frank Kammel (1996), Supermarket Business, May 1996, pg. 179Michael Carry (1996), Progressive Grocer, April 1996, pg. 39 He helped the conversion of the business from Fairway to Fairway (\\"Like No Other Market\\"). During that period, the company disintermediated its supply chain for perishable and specialty products and introduced just-in-time inventory stocking. Early life Fedele was born in Brooklyn, New York and attended Hofstra University, acquiring a BBA in Accounting, Finance, Economics and Mathematics in 1975. Career =PFI= In 1982, he founded PFI, one of the largest protein and perishable trading companies in the US with customers such as Marubeni, Komatsu Gosho, Sumitomo, Price Club, Walmart, and others. =By Choice= By Choice was a Harlem supermarket opened by Fedele and his partners\\"Other partners in By Choice said ...\\" in February 1994 that closed \\"before the year was out.\\" The New York Times wrote that \\"Fedele got his second chance when the owners of the Fairway Market at Broadway and 74th Street signed on as partners.\\" =Fairway market(s)= Fairway Market was founded in 1933. Fedele's involvement came when the founder's grandson Howard Glickberg's flagship store (Broadway/West 74th Street) helped restart the failed By Choice. In 1991 Fedele had helped found the \\"Business Process\\" that later converted Fairway from its small format original single store on 74th and Broadway to the new Fairway (\\"Like No Other Market\\"). This independent store in Harlem was attracting more than 20,000 customers a week within two months of opening. A combination of variety, quality, and low prices in a marketplace atmosphere, attracted shoppers from all over the New York City area, from the Upper Manhattan to the then-inner-city neighborhood where it was located. Fairway achieved high quality products at low prices by cutting out all middle distributors. The store bought from \\"the guy who takes it from the land, takes it from the sea, puts it in a can or slaughters it. This way, it's four to five days fresher and 30% cheaper,\\" said Fedele. Fedele, who calls himself a food technologist, believes that direct buying ensures quality. Perishables that go through layers of distribution experience temperature fluctuations and inevitably suffer from adulteration. Quality is also reinforced through selectivity. \\"Our expertise is to pick the best quality grades in meat, fish and produce,\\" he said. =FreshDirect= In 1998, Fedele launched FreshDirect. He initially raised $120 million and leveraged a no-store concept to develop a better plan: start by dealing directly with farmers, fishermen, and slaughterhouses and build a single super-efficient manufacturing and distribution facility to hold down costs. That kept gross margins high enough to cover the added costs of reliable delivery, offered in densely packed neighborhoods. Kenneth Boyer, an associate professor at Michigan State University's business school who studies online grocers, says a visit to the company \\"really blew me away.\\" Controversies =Harlem Fairway Certificate of Occupancy= At the reopened/retitled Fairway facility in Harlem, as of early 1996 they lacked a Certificate of Occupancy. Co-owner Dave Sneldon claimed to have \\"a temporary certificate of occupancy to operate a wholesale business.\\" Fedele said \\"we don't charge retail prices.\\" A NYC commissioner claimed that they didn't apply. =Fairway/FreshDirect: Fedele's role(s)= After selling his interest in Fairway (to Glickberg and his partners) to start FreshDirect in 1998, Fedele became embroiled in a series of disputes with Fairway's owners, who accused him of over-representing his role in the creation of Fairway's Harlem branch. In response, Fedele says that his description of himself as the branch's \\"co-founder\\" is an understatement. He was quoted saying, in response to Glickberg, \\"my former partners at Fairway did business in the traditional retail way for 30 years before we became partners, having multiple distributors between them and the products that they sold. I guess after I became their partner they had this epiphany of totally disintermediating of supply chain which resulted in the \\"highest value proposition possible to the consumer. Getting them better, fresher food at 30 percent savings and giving us a sustainable, competitive and differentiated advantage.\\" Fairway began hanging signs in its aisles attacking Fedele's credibility and the quality of FreshDirect's produce. New York Magazine wrote (May 17, 2004): > The FreshDirect posters blaring that the company was BROUGHT TO YOU BY A CO- > FOUNDER OF FAIRWAY UPTOWN and featuring a photo of Fedele made [Fairway > owner Howie] Glickberg furious.

Richard Craig Harwood (born 8 August 1979) is a British cellist.  Biography  Richard Harwood was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire and began learning to play the piano, aged four (teachers included Diana Bell and Joyce Rathbone) and the cello, aged five. He attended Ditcham Park School. He achieved his Associated Board Grade 8 in cello, aged 8 and in piano, aged 11. After beginning cello studies with two local teachers, Richard studied with Joan Dickson from 1988 until her death in 1994, before continuing with Steven Doane and David Waterman (1994‚Äì1999), Heinrich Schiff (1999-2003 at the University of Music and Dramatic Art, Vienna) and Ralph Kirshbaum (2003-2005 at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester). He complemented his studies by taking master classes and lessons with Mstislav Rostropovich, J√°nos Starker, Steven Isserlis, Boris Pergamenschikow, Mikl√≥s Per√©nyi, Bernard Greenhouse, Valentin Erben (Alban Berg Quartet), William Pleeth, Zara Nelsova, and Ferenc Rados. Richard made his concerto debut at the age of ten (playing the G minor Kabalevsky Concerto at the Adrian Boult Hall, Birmingham) and, since then, has gone on to perform concerti and recitals in major venues including the Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Wigmore Hall, Musikverein, Concertgebouw, Alte Oper, Thomaskirche, and the Auditorium du Louvre. As concerto soloist, Richard has collaborated with conductors such as John Wilson, Okko Kamu, Marko Letonja, Douglas Bostock, En Shao, Shuntaro Sato, David Parry and Yehudi Menuhin, and with numerous orchestras including The Philharmonia, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, RT√â Concert Orchestra, Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, and the Ural Philharmonic Orchestra.

He has also given performances for Radio France, MDR, RT√â, and Radio New Zealand. Richard's discography include a critically acclaimed debut disc for EMI Classics, recorded with pianist Christoph Berner, and Composing Without The Picture, a 2013 solo album of concert works written by film composers, on Resonus. In addition, Richard can be seen and heard in Phil Grabsky's 2009 documentary In Search of Beethoven which received its theatrical premiere at the Barbican Theatre, London, was broadcast on Sky Arts, and shown in cinemas worldwide. Contemporary music plays an important role for Richard. This started in 2002 when he took part in the Park Lane Group Young Artists' Series on the South Bank and premiered solo works written for him by Dominic Muldowney and Martin Butler. He has also worked with Philip Grange, giving the London premiere of his Nocturnal Image and given the European premiere of David Horne's Zip with the composer at the piano. For his solo album Composing Without the Picture, Richard premiered works written for him by Christopher Gunning, Alex Heffes, Fernando Vel√°zquez, and Benjamin Wallfisch. Richard has won numerous awards including the 2004 Pierre Fournier Award for 'cellists. In 1992, he became the youngest ever winner of the Audi Junior Musician Award. In addition, he won the Worshipful Company of Musicians Maisie Lewis Young Artists Award in 2001 and, in 2004, Richard became the first British 'cellist ever to be awarded the title \\"Bachpreistr√§ger\\" at the International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition, Leipzig. Among many other accolades, he received the special \\"mention\\" prize from the jury at the Concours de violoncelle Rostropovitch, Paris in 2005. In 1997, BBC Music Magazine selected him in their worldwide \\"Who's Who\\" edition and, in 2000, Richard was entered into the \\"International Who's Who in Music\\" as an 'up and coming talent on the brink of worldwide recognition.' Richard plays a cello by Francesco Rugeri, dated 1692.

The highway, originally known as the Anchorage-Fairbanks Highway, was completed in 1971, and given its current name in 1975. Hurricane The highway, which mostly parallels the Alaska Railroad, is one of the most important roads in Alaska. It is the main route between Anchorage and Fairbanks (Alaska's two largest metropolitan areas), the principal access to Denali National Park and Preserve and Denali State Park, and the main highway in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. The route's Interstate designation is not signed; rather, its entire length is signed as Alaska Route 3. It is a common misconception that the name \\"Parks Highway\\" comes from the road's proximity to the Denali state and national parks; it is in fact in honor of George Alexander Parks, governor of the Territory of Alaska from 1925 to 1933. However, the aptness of the name was recognized when it was chosen. Mileposts along the Parks Highway do not begin with 0 (zero). Instead, they begin with Mile 35 (km 56), continuing the milepost numbering of the Glenn Highway where the two highways intersect near Palmer. The 0 (zero) mile marker for the Glenn Highway is at its terminus in downtown Anchorage at the intersection of East 5th Avenue and Gambell Street. Thus mileposts along the Parks Highway reflect distance from Anchorage, which is not actually on the Parks Highway. There are two sections of the highway that are built to freeway standards. These include an area near the highway's intersection with the Glenn Highway in Palmer and a stretch known as the Robert J. Mitchell Expressway in Fairbanks leading to the highway's junction with the Richardson Highway (AK 2).

She is in the top 20 of most widely read British novelists with sales topping 100 million, while retaining a relatively low profile in the world of celebrity writers. Her books were inspired by her deprived youth in South Tyneside, North East England, the setting for her novels. With more than 103 titles written in her own name or two other pen- names, she is one of the most prolific British novelists. Early life Cookson, registered as Catherine Ann Davies, was born on 20 June 1906 at 5 Leam Lane in Tyne Dock, South Shields, South Tyneside, England. She was known as \\"Kate\\" as a child. She moved to East Jarrow, which would become the setting for one of her best-known novels, The Fifteen Streets. The illegitimate child of an alcoholic named Kate Fawcett, she grew up thinking her unmarried mother was her sister, as she was brought up by her grandparents, Rose and John McMullen. Biographer Kathleen Jones tracked down her father, whose name was Alexander Davies, a bigamist and gambler from Lanarkshire, Scotland. She left school at 14 and, after a period of domestic service, took a laundry job at Harton Workhouse in South Shields. In 1929, she moved south to run the laundry at Hastings Workhouse, saving every penny to buy a large Victorian house, and then taking in lodgers to supplement her income. In June 1940, at the age of 34, she married Tom Cookson, a teacher at Hastings Grammar School. After experiencing four miscarriages late in pregnancy, it was discovered she was suffering from a rare vascular disease, telangiectasia, which causes bleeding from the nose, fingers and stomach and results in anemia. A mental breakdown followed the miscarriages, from which it took her a decade to recover. Writing career She took up writing as a form of therapy to tackle her depression, and joined Hastings Writers' Group. Her first novel, Kate Hannigan, was published in 1950. Though it was labelled a romance, she expressed discontent with the stereotype. Her books were, she said, historical novels about people and conditions she knew. Cookson had little connection with the London literary circus. She was always more interested in practising the art of writing. Her research could be uncomfortable‚Äîgoing down a mine, for instance, because her heroine came from a mining area. Having in her youth wanted to write about 'above stairs' in grand houses, she later and successfully concentrated on people ground down by circumstances, taking care to know them well. Cookson wrote almost 100 books, which sold more than 123 million copies, her novels being translated into at least 20 languages. She also wrote books under the pseudonyms Catherine Marchant and a name derived from her childhood name, Katie McMullen. She remained the most borrowed author from public libraries in the UK for 17 years, up until four years after her death, losing the top spot to Jacqueline Wilson only in 2002. Books in film, television and on stage Many of Cookson's novels have been adapted for film, radio, and the stage. The first film adaptation of her work was Jacqueline (1956), directed by Roy Ward Baker, based on her book A Grand Man. It was followed by Rooney (1958), directed by George Pollock, based on her book Rooney. Both starred John Gregson. For commercial reasons, the action of both films was transferred from South Shields to Ireland. In 1983 Katie Mulholland was adapted into a stage musical by composer Eric Boswell and writer-director Ken Hill. Cookson attended the premi√®re. It was on television, however, that she had her greatest media success, with a series of dramas that appeared over the course of a decade on ITV and achieved huge ratings. Eighteen books were adapted for television between 1989 and 2001. They were all produced by Ray Marshall from Festival Film & TV who was given permission by Cookson in 1988 to bring her works to the screen. The first film to be made, The Fifteen Streets starring Sean Bean and Owen Teale, was nominated for an Emmy award in 1990. The second production, The Black Velvet Gown, won an International Emmy for Best Drama in 1991. The mini series regularly attracted audiences over 10 million and are still showing in the UK on Drama and the Yesterday Channel. Philanthropy In 1985, she pledged more than ¬£800,000 to the University of Newcastle. In gratitude, the university set up a lectureship in hematology. Some ¬£40,000 was given to provide a laser to help treat bleeding disorders and ¬£50,000 went to create a new post in ear, nose and throat studies, with particular reference to the detection of deafness in children. She had already given ¬£20,000 towards the university's Hatton Gallery and ¬£32,000 to its library. In recognition of this generosity, a building in the university medical faculty has been named after her.Advance: Philanthropy at Newcastle University Her foundation continues to make donations to worthy causes in the UK, particularly those offering services to young people and cultural ventures, such as the Tyneside Cinema. Honours She was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1985 and was elevated to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1993. Cookson received the Freedom of the Borough of South Tyneside, and an honorary degree from the University of Newcastle. The Variety Club of Great Britain named her Writer of the Year, and she was voted Personality of the North East. She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1982 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Later life and death In later life, Cookson and her husband Tom returned to the North East and settled first in Haldane Terrace, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne. They then moved to Corbridge, a market town near Newcastle, and later to Langley, Northumberland, a small village nearby. As her health declined, they moved for a final time, back to Jesmond in 1989 to be nearer to medical facilities. For the last few years of her life, she was bed-ridden and she gave her final TV interview to North East Tonight, the regional ITV Tyne Tees news programme, from her sickbed. It was conducted by Mike Neville. Catherine Cookson died at the age of 91, sixteen days before her 92nd birthday, at her home in Newcastle. Her novels, many written from her sickbed, continued to be published posthumously until 2002. Tom died just 17 days later, on 28 June 1998.Hastings Chronicle page dedicated to Catherine Cookson He had been hospitalised for a week and the cause of his death was not announced. He was 86 years old. Legacy In March 2008, the Dame Catherine Cookson Memorial Garden was unveiled in the grounds of South Tyneside District Hospital in South Shields, based on the theme of a serpentine symbol, commonly used to symbolise health and caring. The hospital occupies the site of the Harton Workhouse, where Cookson worked from 1924 to 1929. The project was partly funded by the Catherine Cookson Trust.STHCT.nhs.uk Tom and Catherine, a musical about the couple's life, was written by local playwright Tom Kelly. It played to sell-out crowds at the Customs House in South Shields.

The film stars Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter.. It was screened at the Venice Film Festival in 1953. In 2018, Pickup on South Street was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Plot On a crowded New York City subway train, pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) steals Candy's (Jean Peters) wallet. Unbeknownst to Skip or Candy, in the wallet is microfilm of top-secret government information. Candy was delivering an envelope as a final favor to her ex-boyfriend, Joey (Richard Kiley). Joey has told her that it contains stolen business secrets and she believed him, unaware that Joey is actually a communist spy. Government agent Zara (Willis Bouchey) had Candy under surveillance, hoping she would lead him to the top man in the spy ring. He seeks police help to identify the thief. Police Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye) has professional informant Moe Williams (Thelma Ritter) brought in. She asks Zara several questions about the pickpocket's technique, and after she and Tiger agree on a price, she gives him a list of eight names; Zara quickly identifies Skip from his mug shot. Zara tries to get Skip to give up the film, revealing its importance and appealing to his (non-existent) patriotism, but Skip denies everything. Meanwhile, Joey persuades a reluctant Candy to track down the thief using her underworld connections. The trail leads to Moe, who is delighted to be able to sell the same information a second time, knowing that her good friend Skip will not mind. Candy searches Skip's waterfront shack that night while he is out. When he returns, he spots her flashlight, sneaks in and knocks her out. When she comes to, she tries to get the film from him without success. The second time she visits, she is puzzled when he calls her a \\"commie\\" and demands $25,000 for the film. Despite his rough treatment, however, she finds herself falling in love with him. Skip thinks she is only acting. When she returns to Joey, his superior gives him a day to get the film back, and leaves him a gun. Candy finally realizes the truth. She turns to Moe for help, since Skip will not believe it if she tells him he is in danger. Moe tries, but fails, to convince Skip to give the film to the government. Moe goes home, and finds Joey waiting for her. Knowing that her strength is failing, and that she doesn't have long to live in any event, Moe refuses to reveal Skip's address for any amount of money and taunts Joey for being a turncoat and a rat until he shoots her dead. The next morning, Skip returns home to find Candy there. She blames herself for Moe's death, but to her dismay, Skip is still willing to deal with Joey. When he starts to leave with the film, she knocks him out with a bottle and takes it to Zara and Tiger. Zara asks her to give Joey the film, so he can lead them to his boss. Candy does, but Joey notices that there is a frame missing. He beats Candy in an attempt to get Skip's address, then shoots her as she tries to leave. In her purse, Joey finds the address. Skip visits Candy in the hospital and comforts her. Joey and an associate go to the shack, but Skip hears them coming and hides underneath. When Joey is ordered to deliver the portion of film he does have, Skip follows him to a subway station. He watches as the film is exchanged in a restroom, then knocks out the ringleader and chases after and beats up Joey. Later, at the police station, Tiger predicts Skip will return to his criminal ways, but he and a recovered Candy depart to start a new life.

Zanuck showed Fuller, who was then under contract to 20th Century Fox, a script by Dwight Taylor called Blaze of Glory about a woman lawyer falling in love with a criminal she was defending in a murder trial. Fuller liked the idea but knew from his previous crime reporter experience that courtroom cases take a long time to play out. Fuller asked Zanuck if he could write a story of a lower criminal and his girlfriend that he originally titled Pickpocket but Zanuck thought the title too \\"European\\". Fuller had memories of South Street from his days as a crime reporter and came up with his new title. Fuller met Detective Dan Campion of the New York Police Department to research the background material of his story to add realism, with Fuller basing the role of Tiger the police detective on Campion who had been suspended without salary for six months for manhandling a suspect.Fuller, Samuel. A Third Face, p.298. Alfred A Knopf, 2002. Fuller turned down many actresses for the lead role including studio favorites Marilyn Monroe; Shelley Winters; Ava Gardner, who looked too glamorous; Betty Grable, who wanted a dance number written in; and initially Jean Peters, whom he did not like when he saw film of her in Captain from Castile. With only a week to go before the film started production, Fuller saw Peters walk into the studio's commissary while having lunch. Fuller noticed Peters walked with a slightly bow-legged style that many prostitutes also had. Fuller was impressed with Peters' intelligence, spunkiness, and different roles at the studio when he tested her the Friday before shooting started on the Monday. When Betty Grable insisted on being in the film and threatened to cause problems, Fuller promised to walk off the film. Peters was restored.Fuller, Samuel. Page 303, ibid. In August 1952, the script was deemed unacceptable by the Production Code, by reasons of \\"excessive brutality and sadistic beatings, of both men and women\\". The committee also expressed disdain for the vicious beating of the character \\"Candy\\", on the part of \\"Joey\\". Although a revised script was accepted soon after, the studio was forced to shoot multiple takes of a particular scene in which the way Jean Peters and Richard Kiley frisk each other for loot was considered too risqu√©. The French release of the movie removed any reference to spies and microfilm in the dubbed version. They called the movie Le Port de la Drogue (Drug's harbour). The managers of 20th Century Fox thought that the theme of communist spies was too controversial in a country where the Communist Party was an influential and legitimate part of public life. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had lunch with Fuller and Zanuck, and said how much he detested Fuller's work and especially Pickup on South Street. Hoover objected to Widmark's unpatriotic character especially his line \\"Are you waving the flag at me?\\", the scene of a Federal agent bribing an informer and other things. Zanuck backed Fuller up, telling Hoover he knew nothing about making movies, but removed references to the FBI in the film's advertising.Fuller, Samuel. Page 308, ibid. Adaptations In June 1954, Ritter co-starred alongside Terry Moore and Stephen McNally in a Lux Radio Theatre presentation of the story. 20th Century Fox remade the picture in 1967 as The Cape Town Affair, directed by Robert D. Webb and starring Claire Trevor (in the Thelma Ritter role), James Brolin (in his first leading role), and Jacqueline Bisset.

Film review, June 17, 1953. Accessed: December 3, 2009. In recent years, critical appraisals of Pickup have warmed considerably. The movie has a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 7.82/10.

The cast also features Eric Portman, James MacArthur, Martin Balsam and Wally Cox, as well as early appearances by Donald Sutherland and Ed Bishop. The screenplay by James Poe is based on the 1963 book by Mark Rascovich, which borrowed from the plot of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick; at one point in the film, the captain is advised he is \\"not chasing whales now\\". The film was directed by James B. Harris, who, until then, had been best known as Stanley Kubrick's producer. Plot The American destroyer USS Bedford (DLG-113) detects a Soviet submarine in the GIUK gap near the coast of Greenland.Specifically, they are in Greenland territorial waters at the entrance to the J.C. Jacobsen Fjord, which is due northwest from Iceland. Although the U.S. and the Soviet Union are not at war, Captain Eric Finlander mercilessly harries his prey while civilian photojournalist Ben Munceford and NATO naval advisor Commodore Wolfgang Schrepke look on with mounting alarm. Finlander exploits the fact that the Russian sub has to surface periodically to replenish air and recharge batteries because it is not nuclear-powered; knowing full well it will make the Soviets more desperate. Also aboard the Bedford are Ensign Ralston, an inexperienced young officer constantly being criticised by his captain for small errors and Lieutenant Commander Chester Potter, the ship's new doctor, who is a recently recalled reservist. Munceford is aboard to photograph life on a Navy destroyer but his real interest is Finlander who recently was passed over for promotion to rear admiral. Munceford is curious whether a comment made by Finlander regarding the American intervention in Cuba is the reason for his lack of promotion. This prompts the captain to become openly hostile to Munceford, who he sees as a civilian who is interfering into military matters for questioning the risks involved in continually harrying the Soviet submarine. The crew becomes increasingly fatigued by the unrelenting pursuit as the captain continually demands full attention to the instruments. At the same time, Finlander becomes intolerant of anyone who questions his tactics including the ship's doctor who advises him that crew are feeling the pressure but the captain will not relent. When the submarine is found, it ignores Finlander's order to surface and identify itself. The captain, angered by this defiant act, orders the Bedford to run over its snorkel, ordering that it be logged as an \\"unidentified floating object\\". He then orders the Bedford to arm weapons and withdraw to a distance to wait for the submerged sub to run out of air and be forced to surface. Confidently he reassures Munceford and Schrepke that he is in command of the situation and that he will not fire first but \\"If he fires one, I'll FIRE ONE\\". A tired Ensign Ralston mistakes Finlander's remark as a command to \\"fire one\\". He launches an anti-submarine rocket which destroys the submarine. Sonar then detects four Soviet nuclear-armed torpedoes targeting the destroyer. Finlander initially gives basic orders to evade but then silently steps outside the bridge. Munceford follows frantically pleading with him to do something. But the captain has realised his actions have sealed the fate of everyone on board as the ship cannot evade the nuclear torpedoes. The film ends with still shots of various crewmen \\"melting\\" as if the celluloid film were burning as the Bedford and her crew are vaporised in an atomic blast. The film's final image is a mushroom cloud.

In the novel, the Soviet submarine does not fire back at Bedford before being destroyed. The shocked Finlander then receives word of his promotion to admiral. Commodore Schrepke, realising that World War III will begin once the events are known, sabotages one of the remaining ASROCs and destroys the ship. Munceford, the sole survivor, is found by Novosibirsk, the submarine's mothership. Unlike the book, the film version ends with the vessels being destroyed by one another. The plot reflects several Cold War incidents between the NATO and Soviet navies, including one in 1957 when USS Gudgeon, a submarine, was caught in Soviet waters and chased out to sea by Soviet warships. Although none ended as catastrophically as the Bedford incident, the story illustrated many of the fears of the time. =Filming= The Bedford Incident was mostly filmed at Shepperton Studios in the UK, although some shots at sea were used. \\"USS Bedford\\" was a fictitious guided missile destroyer and the role of Bedford was mostly played by a large model of a Farragut-class destroyer. Interior scenes were filmed in the British Type 15 frigate ; British military equipment can be seen in several shots, including a rack of Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles and Troubridge's novel, forward-sloping bridge windows. Sidney Poitier's initial flypast and landing from a Whirlwind helicopter were filmed aboard another Type 15 frigate, , whose F159 pennant number is clearly visible. The vessel portraying a Soviet intelligence ship has the name \\"Novo Sibursk\\", written on the hull at the bow in the Latin alphabet, not the Russian language's Cyrillic alphabet; \\"Novosibirsk\\" is a more accurate English rendering. Actual Cold War incident In October 1962, shortly before the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Soviet submarine B-59 was pursued in the Atlantic Ocean by the U.S. Navy. When the Soviet vessel failed to surface, the destroyers began dropping training depth charges. Unlike in The Bedford Incident, the Americans were not aware that the B-59 was armed with a T-5 nuclear torpedo. The Soviet captain, believing that World War III might have started, wanted to launch the weapon but was over-ruled by his flotilla commander, Vasili Arkhipov, who, by coincidence, was using the boat as his command vessel. After an argument, it was agreed that the submarine would surface and await orders from Moscow. It was not until after the fall of the Soviet Union that the weapon's existence and how close the world came to nuclear conflict was made known.

His successor was 27-year IBM executive Joe M. Henson, although Prime's president, Kenneth G. Fisher, had briefly been the interim top executive. Minicomputer products The initial offerings by Prime, whose main competitors were Digital Equipment Corporation, Data General and Hewlett-Packard., were clones of Honeywell's DDP 316 and 516 minicomputers. *1972: Prime 200 :The first Prime system was similar to the 16-bit DDP 516, but was a 32-bit machine with paging. It ran an operating system called DOS, also referred to as PRIMOS 2 (not to be confused with MS-DOS, PC DOS, etc.). *1973: Prime 100 :The Prime 100 was a stripped down version of the Prime 200 (no memory parity or floating point). *1974: Prime 300 :The Prime 300 had a main store of 32 KB to 512 KB and from 6 MB of Pertec disc storage. It ran DOSVM operating system, also referred to as PRIMOS 3, but still used earlier DOS for booting. One of the first minicomputers with microcode-supported virtual memory capability. The virtual memory was simpler than used in later systems. Addresses were 16 bits, with each of up to 32 time-sharing (time slice) users, receiving a virtual 64 K-word address space. It had S-mode and R-mode instructions. :An example of the Prime 300 was installed in the mathematics department of the University of Aston in Birmingham, UK and at the Medical University of Hannover, Germany. *1976: Prime 400 :The Prime 400 ran at 0.5 MIPS, had a main store of up to 8 MB and 160 MB of disc storage. The name PRIMOS was now used for the operating system, and the P400 ran PRIMOS 4. It ran a V-mode instruction set, along with the S-mode and R-mode instructions. It had a segmented virtual memory architecture, somewhat similar to Multics. *1979: Prime 450, 550, 650, 750‚Äîthe beginning of the 50 series nomenclaturealthough some 50-numbered machines had a 55-ending followupA 9955-II followed the high-end 9955 :The Prime 550 was an upgrade in performance over the Prime 400. It ran at 0.7 MIPS, had up 2 MB of memory and 500 MB of disc storage and a 9-track tape unit.It didn't have to come from Prime; some tape drive vendors sold them to Prime customers :The Prime 750 was a major upgrade. It ran at 1.0 MIPS, had 2‚Äì8 MB of memory and 1200 MB of disc storage and a 9-track tape unit. This was very competitive with a similarly priced DEC VAX-11/780 and was one of the first 32-bit superminicomputers. Prime 750 systems were installed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), University of Paisley, Leeds University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), University of Rhode Island, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), and the CADCentre in Cambridge. PRIMENET and a local area networking software product named RINGNET were announced. *1980: Prime 150 and 250 *1981: Prime 850 (dual CPU machine) Prime also marketed MEDUSA CAD software.

A \\"new line of Unix-based EXL-7000 computers\\" was announced in late 1990. The company was successful in the 1970s and 1980s, peaking in 1988 at number 334 of the Fortune 500. In 1985 the company was the 6th largest in the minicomputer sector, with estimated revenues of US $564 million Much of this was based on the US Banking industry where the Prime Info database was widely accepted. As of later 1989, Surrey University had the largest Prime Site in Europe, having multiple copies of virtually every 50 series machine (mostly running Primos 20.x, but some still running 19.x). CAD efforts Prime was heavily involved with Ford‚Äôs internal computer-aided design (CAD) product, Product Design Graphics System (PDGS). Design engineers used PDGS for auto body design, and finite element analysis using NASTRAN. It used a vectorscope from Lundy for a display. At one time in the 1980s, it was the world largest integrated CAD system, spanning the US, Japan (Mazda was Ford's subsidiary/partner), (Cologne) Germany, (Dunton) England and (Geelong) Australia. The creators of PDGS, located in building #3 of Ford's Dearborn design headquarters, began working on the concept of parametrically driven geometry, which led to a PRIMEDesign system. The company also had marketing rights to the MEDUSA CAD system, produced in England by Cambridge Interactive Systems (CIS), and having experience in the domain, the company explored transitioning to a CAD company. It embarked on a project headed by Vladimir Geisberg to build a CAD-CAM system of its own called PRIMEDesign. This product was to compete with the industry leader at that time, CADDS4 from Computervision. RISC processors from MIPS Technologies and graphics processors from Silicon Graphics created the platform for PRIMEDesign as well as being the genesis of modern-day SGI. During this period, in 1985, Sam Geisberg left Computervision to found Parametric Technology Corporation and produce a supposedly parameter driven CAD system called ProEngineer. Computervision acquired Cambridge Interactive Systems in 1983, and Prime independently developed their own version of MEDUSA. Prime subsequently purchased Computervision and Vladimir Geisberg, then VP for CAD, tried to merge back together the Prime and Computervision versions of the Medusa CAD system, and to launch Prime Design. As time passed it became clear that Prime Design, while leading edge in theory, was totally unsuitable for real engineering design work, and Prime Design was ended. Decline and end By the late eighties, the company was having problems retaining customers who were moving to lower-cost systems, as minicomputers entered their decline to obsolescence. Prime was failing to keep up with customers' increasing need for raw computing power. By the end, not a single Prime computer was subject to COCOM export controls, as they were insufficiently powerful for the US Government to fear their falling into the hands of hostile powers. In 1988, financier Bennett S. LeBow attempted a hostile takeover of Prime, leveraging his much smaller MAI Basic Four company. To stave off LeBow, Prime management organized a $1.3 billion \\"white knight\\" leveraged buyout by J.H. Whitney & Company. Various problems dogged this project, the holding company organized by Whitney went bankrupt, and the resulting severe financial distress made it much harder for Prime to deal with the accelerating downturn in its core business. Prime's 1991 revenues of $1.2 billion were 25% lower than their 1988 revenues of $1.6 billion. Its computer sales were down by more than half ($377 million in 1989, $170 million in 1991), and by 1992 no new Prime Computers were being sold, portending a decline in its lucrative business of servicing computers made by Prime (and other manufacturers), a significant contributor to its already- declining revenues. A planned 1989 layoff of 1,200 employees became much more: over 6,000, thus Prime's workforce dropped by over half, from 12,386 employees in 1988 to 5,900 by the end of 1991. After the computer design and manufacturing portions of the company were shut down, the only viable business that remained was the Computervision subsidiary, an early pioneer in CAD/CAM, which was acquired in a hostile takeover 1988. Prime was renamed to Computervision, which in 1992 sold the declining remnants of its Prime Information subsidiary to Vmark Corporation. Computervision was subsequently successfully acquired by Parametric Technology Corporation in 1998, a company founded in 1985 by a former Prime employee. Operating system The company operating system, PRIMOS was originally written mostly in the Fortran IV programming language with some assembler. Subsequently, the PL/P and Modula-2 languages were used in the Kernel. A number of new PRIMOS utilities were written in SP/L which was similar to PL/P. Phantom, CPL and ED \\"Phantoms\\" were a form of unattended background processes that immediately began to run in the background when initiated by the PHANTOM command. \\"Conventional\\" batch jobs were initiated via the JOB command, including the ability to schedule them for a particular time. CPL, the PRIMOS Command Processing Language was the shell scripting language. The PRIMOS text editor ED was a line editor. It could record a command sequence and replay it on different files. EMACS, a full screen editor, was also available.\\"I learned Emacs first on PRIMOS and it took me a couple of years to later feel ...\\"\\"I'm a long-time user of Prime EMACS for the Prime 50 Series under PRIMOS, and\\" Prime 300 specification * A microprogrammed 16-bit central processor with floating point hardware, error detection and system integrity checking features. * 128 KB, 600 nanosecond access MOS main memory. * 6 MB cartridge disk. 165 cps character printer. * System software including a disk operating system and FORTRAN, BASIC and assembler for assembly language. * Support for up to 31 users for a total purchase price of about US$165,000. Specialised software =General business= Advent Online Knowledge Advent Online Knowledge, Inc. was a Schaumburg, Illinois-based producer of software for Prime computers. Marc Software Marc Software International, Inc. of Palo Alto, California produced WordMARC word processing software for Prime computers. Computer Techniques (Queo) While Prime's PRIMOS operating system supported one or more compilers/interpreters for COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, RPG and 2 Assemblers, Queo was a step up: a procedural language more compact than COBOL, and with additional capabilities.\\".. nonprocedural methods for adhoc inquiry\\" It was offered by Computer Techniques, Inc. of Olyphant, Pa. Queo later was reimplemented for PCs. Office Automation System Prime acquired the OAS application from its developer, ACS America Inc., a now- defunct New York City software house. It competed in the UK DTI Office Automation Pilot, but did not win. OAS included electronic mail and word processing. Electronic mail use was initially restricted to a single minicomputer. Much later, Prime released email that worked with multiple Prime computers in a network, and a synchronised global directory system. Word processing was available either on dumb terminals like the PT25, PT45 and PST100, or on the partially intelligent PT65 terminal. The PT65 had to download the word processing software from the host minicomputer whenever the terminal was turned on. The terminal allowed the user to work on one page at a time, which was periodically saved to the minicomputer. This \\"intelligent workstation\\" concept for word processing was similar to the functions of popular systems from rival Wang Laboratories. Prime's intelligent workstation for word processing was faster because it used RS232C cabling runs instead of the coaxial links that Wang's systems used. Nonetheless, the word processing was not of the highest quality, and the PT65 was subject to software errors that scrambled the documents being worked on. OAS also had a bilingual language lookup feature, sometimes marketed as machine translation. Recognising the drawbacks of the downloadable WP workstation, Prime formed an agreement with Convergent Technologies for their AWS which Prime named the \\"Prime Producer 100\\" (launched in mid 1983) and later for Convergent's modular NGEN, clip together system, the \\"Prime Producer 200\\" (launched in 1984), each of which had far superior WP to the initial Prime offering, and were document- based. In the UK, Prime had a very active OAS User Group whose suggestions were acted upon in new product development. UK Pioneers of the system included the London Docklands Development Corporation and Oxford Polytechnic, now Oxford Brookes University. Prime Information Both the Pick environment and Prime Information were based on the Generalized Information Retrieval Language System (GIRLS), developed by Richard Pick for the American Department of Defense. Devcom, a Microdata reseller, wrote a Pick-style database system called INFORMATION in FORTRAN and assembler in 1979 to run on Prime Computer 50-series systems. INFO/BASIC, a variant of Dartmouth BASIC, was used for database applications. It was then sold to Prime Computer and renamed Prime INFORMATION. Unlike the Pick operating system, a complete operating system, Prime Information was not an operating system, but a 4GL system that ran from the Prime PRIMOS operating system. Prime Information was a re-implementation which deliberately left out some features and added others. Prime Information allowed rapid 4GL or 4GL-like development of applications around relational or quasi-relational database structures. After a series of evolutions and acquisitions Prime Information is now an obsolete part of the Rocket U2 software suite. Prime Information Connection In , Prime developed a system to conflict with OAS and confuse the market. Prime Information Connection added word processing to Prime Information, giving the company two office oriented suites to offer in a marketplace dominated by Wang Laboratories. =CAD/CAM= Prime originally entered the CAD industry through Ford. At the time, Ford was using Control Data Corporation (CDC) stand-alone computers. Data was shared via reel tape and stored in \\"Data Collector\\" rooms at each facility. Ford began looking for a small computer that had all the advantages of the CDC computers, but could also connect to a network. Prime‚Äôs 2250 (\\"Rabbit\\") offered the combination Ford was looking for in a package smaller than the original CDCs. In addition, the PRIMOS operating system would run unaltered across all Prime platforms; from the 2250 up to 750 (what would be considered today as a server). As a result, the Data Collector (rooms) would contain several 750 class machines, each with rows of CDC 300 or 600 MB drives. Primenet (token ring) network connected all CAD stations in a building with its Data Collector. Ford pushed PDGS out to its suppliers and engineering contractors throughout the northern Midwest. Prime gained expertise over the years with its collaboration with Ford and continued to expand into the CAD market with its Medusa product. With the acquisition of ComputerVision, Prime appeared to be a formidable force in the CAD/CAM industry. Prime Medusa versions 5 and CV Medusa 7 were merged/recombined into a product that was called Medusa version 12. Prime also picked up Calma CAD systems from GE. Electronic messaging Electronic messaging was developed on relay.prime.com, which was the hub that relayed global electronic mail for Prime Computer. The software used on this computer system, PDN Mail, developed by Robert Ullmann, was designed to use the encoding header field that was later explained in a Request for Comments.RFC1154 PDN Mail was years ahead of its time and was also used by Microsoft Corporation until MIME was introduced. Before MIME existed, PDN Mail was able to perform the same functions and was used to send software updates as well as all sorts of attachments between systems. In August 1993, Robert Ullmann, David Robinson and Al Costanzo wrote RFC 1505. This RFC, documented the Encoding Header Field for Internet Messages that PDN mail used and was published by the RFC editor, Jon Postel that same year. Marketing Promotional paperclip A series of memorable advertisements created by Australian artist Rone Waugh from 1980 featured actors Tom Baker and Lalla Ward as their characters from the TV series Doctor Who. All four of these adverts have since been included on the DVD release of the 1979 serial Destiny of the Daleks in which both actors appear. Another series of advertisements featured a C-3PO-like robot called Albert EinPrime.

For example, convalescent serum, passive antibody transfusion from a previous human survivor, used to be the only known effective treatment for ebola infection with a high success rate of 7 out of 8 patients surviving. Antisera are widely used in diagnostic virology laboratories. The most common use of antiserum in humans is as antitoxin or antivenom to treat envenomation. Serum therapy, also known as serotherapy, describes the treatment of infectious disease using the serum of animals that have been immunized against the specific organisms or their product, to which the disease is supposedly referable.  History  The first therapies for the treatment of diphtheria and tetanus came into use in the mid-1890s and had a major impact on the development of the history of medicine. Emil Behring (1854‚Äì1917) had pioneered the technique, using guinea pigs to produce serum. Based on his observation that people who survived infection with the diphtheria bacterium never became infected again, he discovered that the body continually produces an antitoxin, which prevents survivors of infections from being infected again with the same agent. It was necessary for Behring to immunize larger animals in order to produce enough serum to protect humans, because the amount of antiserum produced by guinea pigs was too little to be practical. Horses proved to be the best serum producer, as the serum of other large animals is not concentrated enough, and horses were not believed to carry any diseases that could be transferred to humans. Due to the First World War, a large number of horses were needed for military purposes. It was difficult for Behring to find enough German horses for his serum facility. He chose to obtain horses from Eastern European countries, mostly Hungary and Poland. Because of Behring's limited financial resources, most horses he selected had been intended for slaughter; however, the usefulness of the animal to others had no influence on the production of serum. Serum horses were calm, well-mannered, and in good health. Age, breed, height, and color were irrelevant. Horses were transported from Poland or Hungary to the Behring facilities in Marburg, in the west-central part of Germany. Most of the horses were transported by rail and treated like any other freight load. During the interminable border crossing, horses were left at the mercy of the weather. Once the horses arrived in Marburg, they had three to four weeks to recover in a quarantine facility, where data on them was recorded. They had to be in perfect medical condition for the immunization, and the quarantine facility ensured that they were free of microbes which could infect the other horses. In the Behring facilities, the horses were viewed as life savers; therefore, they were well treated. A few of the individual horses used for serum production were named, and celebrated for their service to medicine, both human and non-human. At the end of the 19th century, every second child in Germany was infected with diphtheria, the most frequent cause of death in children up to 15 years. In 1891 Emil Behring saved the life of a young girl with diphtheria by injecting antiserum for the first time in history. Serum horses proved to be saviors of diphtheria-infected people. Subsequently, treatment of tetanus, rabies, and snake venom developed, and proactive protective vaccination against diphtheria and other microbial diseases began. In 1901, Behring won the first Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work in the study of diphtheria. Modern use During the early stages of the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, reliable treatment options had not been found. In reaction, convalescent blood plasma was considered as a possible and is used as a treatment option at least for severe cases.https://ec.europa.eu/health/blood_tissues_organs/covid-19_enhttps://www.pei.de/EN/newsroom/press- releases/year/2020/07-pei-approves-first-covid-19-therapy-study-with- convalescent-plasma.htmlhttps://www.uscovidplasma.org/ How it works Antibodies in the antiserum bind the infectious agent or antigen.de Andrade, F√°bio Goulart, et al. \\"The Production And Characterization Of Anti-Bothropic And Anti-Crotalic Igy Antibodies In Laying Hens: A Long Term Experiment.\\" Toxicon 66.(2013): 18‚Äì24. The immune system then recognizes foreign agents bound to antibodies and triggers a more robust immune response. The use of antiserum is particularly effective against pathogens which are capable of evading the immune system in their unstimulated state but are not robust enough to evade the stimulated immune system. The existence of antibodies to the agent depends on an initial survivor whose immune system, by chance, discovered a counteragent to the pathogen or a host species which carries the pathogen but does not suffer from its effects.Mortimer, Nathan T., et al. \\"Parasitoid Wasp Venom SERCA Regulates Drosophila Calcium Levels And Inhibits Cellular Immunity.\\" Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America 110.23 (n.d.): 9427‚Äì32. Biological Abstracts 1969‚ÄìPresent. Further stocks of antiserum can then be produced from the initial donor or from a donor organism that is inoculated with the pathogen and cured by some stock of pre-existing antiserum. Diluted snake venom is often used as an antiserum to give passive immunity to snake venom itself.O'Leary, M.A., K. Maduwage, and G.K. Isbister. \\"Use Of Immunoturbidimetry To Detect Venom‚ÄìAntivenom Binding Using Snake Venoms.\\" Journal of Pharmacological & Toxicological Methods 67.3 (2013): 177‚Äì81.Vogel, Carl-Wilhelm, Paul W. Finnegan, and David C. Fritzinger. \\"Humanized Cobra Venom Factor: Structure, Activity, And Therapeutic Efficacy In Preclinical Disease Models.\\" Molecular Immunology 61.2 (2014): 191‚Äì203. Horses that were infected by a pathogen were vaccinated thrice in increasing sizes of the dose. The time between each vaccination varied from each horse and its health condition. Normally the horses needed a few weeks to produce the serum in the blood after the last vaccination. Even though they tried to empower the immune system of the horses during this immunization with painstaking care, most of the horses suffered appetite loss, fever, and in worse cases shock and dyspnea. The highest immunization risk for horses was the production of antiserum for snake venom. The horse was immunized with all types of snake poison at the same time because it was not always possible to know by which snake species a person had been bitten. Therefore, the serum had to immunize the subject against the venom of every snake species. In order to find the moment when most antitoxins in the blood cells of the horses is produced, frequent blood samples were taken from the horses. At the point when the highest amount of antibodies were produced, five liters of blood, a tenth of the blood volume of a horse, were taken through a cannula. The blood was collected in a glass cylinder and brought to the laboratory in the Behring facilities. Above the rouleaux formation which contained the red blood cells, the serum was visible. The color of the serum varied from milky to brown. Concentration and sterility of the serum were checked carefully, and the serum was filtered many times. Protein content was decreased in order to use the serum for humans. After the blood sampling, the horses could rest for three to four weeks and received extra food to recover the blood loss. In this period the horses were especially weak and prone to disease and infection. Within a few years, with experience and observation of the horses, a rouleaux formation of the blood sample was placed back into the animal's body. This procedure is called plasmapheresis.

His military career included the Chitral Expedition of 1895 and the 1898 Occupation of Crete, between and after which he was posted in Sudan serving with Lord Kitchener in the Mahdist War (1898‚Äì99). In 1899 he took part in the final defeat of the Khalifa as brigade major to the Infantry Brigade with the flying column, and was mentioned in despatches. He next served in the Second Boer War, then suppressing the Boxer Rebellion (1900) and in Somaliland (1903‚Äì04), where he commanded a unit of the Somaliland Camel Corps. Turkish Revolution Colonel Doughty-Wylie was the British consul in Mersina, Ottoman Empire, during the Young Turk Revolution of 1909. Richard Bell-Davies (later a VC recipient, then a lieutenant on the battleship ) met him at the time and gives an account in his autobiography Sailor in the Air (1967). Massacres of Armenians in Mersina started along with the revolution, and Bell-Davies says that it was largely due to the efforts of Doughty-Wylie that these were halted. Doughty-Wylie then went to Adana, forty miles away, where he persuaded the local Vali (Governor) to give him a small escort of Ottoman troops and a bugler; with these he managed to restore order. Mrs. Doughty-Wylie (nee Lilian Adams-Wylie) turned part of the dragoman's house into a hospital for wounded Armenians. Bell-Davies says that by the time an armed party from Swiftsure arrived, Doughty-Wylie had again almost stopped the massacre single-handedly. Newspaper reports of the period record that Doughty-Wylie was shot in the arm while trying to prevent the Adana massacres. Charles Hotham Montagu Doughty-Wylie was the recipient of the Order of the Medjidie from the Ottoman Government. He was awarded the Medjidie because of his work during the Balkan Wars when he served with the British Red Cross helping the Ottoman Military. First World War Doughty-Wylie was 46 years old, and a lieutenant colonel in The Royal Welch Fusiliers, British Army when, \\"owing to his great knowledge of things Turkish\\" according to Bell-Davies, he was attached to General Sir Ian Hamilton's headquarters staff of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force during the Gallipoli Campaign. On 26 April 1915, following the landing at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula of the SS River Clyde, Lieutenant Colonel Doughty-Wylie and Captain Garth Neville Walford organised and made an attack through and on both sides of the village of Sedd-el-Bahr on the Old Fort at the top of the hill. The enemy's position was very strongly entrenched and defended, but mainly due to the initiative, skill and great gallantry of the two officers the attack was a complete success. However, both Doughty-Wylie and Walford were killed in the moment of victory, Doughty-Wylie being shot in the face by a sniper and died instantly. Doughty-Wylie is buried close to where he was killed, immediately north of Sedd-el-Bahr, opposite the point at which the SS River Clyde came ashore. His grave is the only solitary British or Commonwealth war grave on the Gallipoli peninsula: The Turkish authorities moved the graves of all other foreign soldiers to the \\"V Beach\\" graves except for his. His Victoria Cross, posthumously awarded for bravery during a beach landing at Gallipoli in April 1915, is displayed at the Royal Welsh Fusiliers Museum in Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales. Damaged plating from the River Clyde can be seen in the Hampshire Regimental Museum in Winchester, England. Personal life Doughty- Wylie, a married man, had an unconsummated affair with Gertrude Bell with whom he exchanged love letters from 1913‚Äì1915 until his death. Bell was an eminent English writer, traveller, political officer, administrator, and archaeologist who explored, mapped in the region of Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and Arabia.Liora Lukitz, pp. 14‚Äì17 Doughty-Wylie was a member of the Naval and Military Club from 1900 until his death. His wife, Lilian, was the only woman on the Allied side to visit Gallipoli during the campaign, when she went to lay a wreath on his grave on 17 November 1915. Doughty-Wylie is commemorated outside St. Peter's Church in Theberton, Suffolk where his name is recorded on the war memorial. Inside the church he is depicted in a stained glass window as St. George. A road in the village is named Doughty-Wylie Crescent.

Isaac gave it the name Rehoboth, which means \\"open spaces\\". Isaac's servants had dug two wells before Rehoboth and the herdsmen of Gerar quarrelled with Isaac's herdsmen. So when they dug the third well and there were no quarrels Isaac named it Rehoboth saying \\"Now the Lord has given us room and we will flourish in the land.\\" * An ancient city from which came Saul, an Edomite king (; ), \\"Rehoboth by the river\\". Since \\"the River\\" in the Bible generally is used about Euphrates, scholars have suggested either of two sites near the junction of the Khabur River and the Euphrates. However, this would be a place far outside the Edomite territory. The river mentioned could be a river in the land of Edom, such as Wadi Zered (also known as Wadi al-Hasa). Rehoboth could possibly be identical with a site southeast of the Dead Sea. * Rehoboth-Ir was a biblical town named in Genesis as among those founded by Nimrod. Its exact geographic location is unknown. Rehoboth-Ir may possibly have been in the vicinity of the town of Nineveh. However, its name is identical to the Hebrew phrase \\"rehovot ir, meaning \\"streets of the town\\" or \\"public square of the town\\", which may refer to Nineveh itself, rather than the name of a distinct town. Nabatean and Byzantine town in the Negev See Hebrew-language article here. The town's ruins, called in Arabic Khirbet Ruheibeh, are located in the Wadi er-Ruheibeh area, where Isaac's well was (latitude 31¬∞1'N, longitude 34¬∞33'E). This was a thriving city in Byzantine times. In Israel today it is called \\"Rehovot ba-Negev\\" (Rehovot-in-the-Negev). It was apparently founded in the first century AD by the Nabateans. It grew to more than 10,000 people by the fifth century, thanks to its being on the Incense Route.

The Gaelic name of the village was recorded by Diack using his own transcription method as fanna- guchti, which is of unclear meaning. One of the earliest references to Findochty is in 1440, when the king granted Findachtifeild to John Dufe, son of John Dufe. The lands passed from the Duffs to the Ogilvies of Findlater, and subsequently, in 1568, the Ord family acquired the manor, port, custom, and fishers' lands of Findochty, and later built the House of Findochty, known as Findochty Castle, now a ruin, which stands to the west of the village. In 1716 the Ords brought 13 men and 4 boys from Fraserburgh under contract to fish from Findochty, and for a time the harbour was busy with landings of herring and white fish. Findochty expanded as a fishing port through the 1700s and 1800s, and by 1850 was home to 140 fishing boats. But the expansion in the late 1800s of nearby Buckie provided a better harbour, and some of the fishing fleet had left Findochty by 1890. Findochty harbour is now used mostly by pleasure craft and is a good sun spot when the tide is out. A local artist, Correna Cowie, created a statue in 1959 of a seated fisherman, known as The Mannie, who watches over the harbour. In addition to characteristic painted cottages, a white-painted Church of Scotland church, and a scenic harbour overlooked to the west by the local war memorial, the village has basic amenities including a pub, a small supermarket, a pharmacy and a post office. There is a caravan site at the west of the village, behind The Admirals pub. The caravan park looks out onto a rock formation known as Edindoune and a bay past which schools of Moray Firth dolphins can sometimes be seen. For sailors, there is a marina and pontoons. The harbour is well protected from the elements by sturdy quays, one of which is topped with a small disused lighthouse. The people of Findochty speak in the Scots dialect of Doric and the accent can be thick and hard to understand for outsiders. In 1901, old animal bones taken to be made into implements, were discovered in a cave found in the cliff near the present bowling green. Horn spoons and needles without eyes and even a broken lignite armlet were found. The bones were dated as possibly prehistoric to middle age, but they have since been lost. The cave was destroyed within a few months of discovery by subsequent quarrying for rock to build local houses and roads. To the east of the village the cliffs rise toward Tronach Head, honeycombed with caves and inlets. Clifftop paths link Findochty with the neighbouring village of Portknockie and West to Strathlene on the outskirts of Buckie in the other direction. The cliffs are the home to myriad seabirds. There are substantial rock formations such as the Priest Craigs, and the Horses Head. West of the village lies the 18 hole Strathlene golf course, bounded to the north by coastal footpaths and low cliffs, making the errant drive from some tees particularly costly. At the south side of the course lies the road linking Findochty to Portessie and Strathlene. Adjacent to this can be seen the remains of Findochty castle. Access to the castle is not normally permitted as it is located in the midst of a working farm. Many of the villagers work in the oil and gas industry - as is true of much of the surrounding area - due mainly to the downturn in the Scottish fishing industry over the last 30 ‚Äì 40 years and the area's relative proximity to Aberdeen. It is said that the original fishermen came from Fraserburgh which is known as \\"The Broch\\". In 1716 The Broch was Burghead. The harbour at Burghead was ruined by the sea just before then. 1716 is also the year after the 1st Jacobite uprising. Maybe some of the folk were hiding from King George's army. Churches There are a number of churches in this small village, including Church of Scotland, Salvation Army, & Methodist congregations. There are also the Christian Brethren at Chapel Street, and at the Station Road Hall -which has an annual Bible Conference every September drawing Christians from all parts of the British Isles and many overseas countries.

Accessed 12 April 2007 the most recent issue was published in 2005.Shanda Fantasy Arts, SFA: Albedo , Shanda Fantasy Arts. Accessed 12 April 2007 Albedo was started by Steve Gallacci (pronounced /…° åÀàl…ëtÕ° Éi/), who produced its main feature, Erma Felna: EDF‚Äîa sophisticated science fiction military series set in a sector of space populated by sapient and predominantly humanoid versions of mammal and avian species. The focus of the series is Erma Felna, a young feline officer who eventually plays a central role in the complex political conflicts that consume her universe.Sanguine Productions, ALBEDO: Platinum Catalyst, Sanguine Productions. Accessed 12 April 2007 Gallacci was a technical illustrator for the United States Air Force and one feature of Albedo is well thought-out and illustrated vehicles. His experience also shows in the realistic treatment of military life and operations. The series was used as inspiration for the Albedo role-playing game, which has had three editions and multiple supplements. Features =Erma Felna: EDF= Erma Felna: EDF was set in a futuristic period in a sector of civilized outer space populated by sapient and predominantly humanoid versions of over 150 various mammalian and avian species. Although the civilization has advanced technical skills and political structure, the residents of this region have realized that they have no knowledge of their origins or past, nor any culture or arts to speak of beyond the structures necessary to maintain operational systems. The title character is Erma Felna, a young cat who is an officer of the Extraplanetary Defense Force (EDF), the main military of the Interstellar Confederacy or ConFed for short. The series follows her adventures in part as she fulfills a career that would make her a revered name as \\"The Protector of the Rim\\", in the region's history despite sexist opposition. The ConFed is challenged by a rival and ruthless enemy called the Independent Lapine Republic (ILR) which is populated by a species of supremacist rabbits who favor taking colonies and settled areas by force. To defeat their militarily stronger enemy, the ILR is engaging in socio-political warfare intended to undermine the ConFed citizenry's confidence in their government's stability and ability to protect them. This strategy is made evident in the opening battle of the series when the ILR invades the ConFed planet of Derzon. Once the Republic seizes the planet, they deliberately deploy their troops in such a manner that defeating them requires the EDF inflict the maximum unavoidable amount of collateral damage and civilian casualties, intending to increase ConFed civilian resentment of their own government's actions. In addition, there are internal and growing ConFed corruption and attacks by nihilistic terrorists who commit acts of violence for their own sake to shake societal complacency. A derelict ship that contains a body of a human is eventually discovered which reveals vital clues about the civilization. Reception The series drew considerable attention for its unique use of funny animals which featured characters engaged in sophisticated stories with a highly political nature, like novels such as A Very British Coup. For instance, after an action scene, the characters would often discuss the socio-political ramifications of the events in question and struggle to decide what to do in response. Characters *Erma Felna: The main character of Albedo. Female officer in the EDF, born SD 171-01-22 (30 years old), Annianport, Annah (Dornthant II). Fur color is a light gold-brown, slightly paler in the front, scalp hair is dark red-brown, and eyes green gold. She shares her family's rare female genetic trait of vaguely humanlike head hair. Erma joined the EDF mainly because her father, Kanoc, was seriously tortured by the ILR. *Toki: a Danetti (from the planet Danet) mouse femme is a friend and confidant to Erma Felna.

The train, which has operated continuously since Amtrak's formation in 1971, was the first to offer direct service between Seattle and Los Angeles. Its name is a combination of two prior Southern Pacific (SP) trains, the Coast Daylight and the Starlight. During fiscal year 2019, the Coast Starlight carried 426,029 passengers, an increase of 2.0% from FY2018.https://media.amtrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FY19-Year-End- Ridership In FY2016, the train had a total revenue of $40,534,262, a decrease of 1.4% from FY2015.http://media.amtrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Amtrak- FY16-Ridership-and-Revenue-Fact-Sheet-4_17_17-mm-edits.pdf History =Background= Before the formation of Amtrak, no passenger train ran the entire length of the West Coast. The closest equivalent was the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP)'s West Coast, which ran via the San Joaquin Valley from Los Angeles to Portland from 1924 to 1949, with through cars to Seattle via the Great Northern Railway (GN). By 1971, the SP operated just two daily trains between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area: the Los Angeles‚ÄìSan Francisco Coast Daylight via the Coast Line, and the Los Angeles‚ÄìOakland San Joaquin Daylight via the Central Valley. The SP also operated the tri-weekly Cascade between Oakland and Portland, Oregon. The Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) and Union Pacific Railroad ran three daily round trips between Portland and Seattle. The Santa Fe ran the San Diegan between Los Angeles and San Diego. =Amtrak era= The Coast Starlight at Tacoma in 1974 The Coast Starlight in the Cuesta Hills above San Luis Obispo in 1985 The Seattle‚ÄìSan Diego route was initially left out of plans for Railpax (later Amtrak) until protests from politicians in California, Oregon, and Washington. With the start of Amtrak operations on May 1, 1971, a single train began running between Seattle and San Diego. The unnamed train (#11/12) ran three days a week; on the other four days, another unnamed train (#98/99) ran between Oakland and Los Angeles. On November 14, Amtrak extended the Oakland‚ÄìLos Angeles train to San Diego, renumbered it to #12/13, and renamed it Coast Daylight. The Seattle‚ÄìSan Diego train became the Coast Daylight/Starlight (#11-12) northbound and Coast Starlight/Daylight (#13-14) southbound. Both trains were cut back from San Diego to Los Angeles in April 1972, replaced by a third San Diegan. On June 10, 1973, Amtrak began running the combined Coast Daylight/Starlight daily for the summer months. Positive response led to Amtrak to retain this service, and the Coast Daylight name was dropped on May 19, 1974. An additional train, the Spirit of California, ran the section of the route between Sacramento and Los Angeles on an overnight schedule from October 25, 1981 to September 30, 1983. From November 10, 1996 to October 25, 1997, through coaches were transferred between the Coast Starlight and San Diegan at Los Angeles. The Coast Starlight originally used the Southern Pacific West Valley Line between Tehama and Davis. That route included a stop at Orland, but bypassed Sacramento. On April 26, 1982, the train was rerouted via Roseville on the Southern Pacific Valley and Martinez Subdivisions, with stops added at Sacramento, Chico, and Marysville, per request from the state. In 1999, the Coast Starlight was rerouted onto the more direct ex-Western Pacific Sacramento Subdivision between Marysville and Sacramento, with the Marysville stop closed. Ridership declined by 26% between 1999‚Äì2005 as freight congestion and track maintenance on the Union Pacific Railroad reduced the Coast Starlights on-time performance to 2%, which Amtrak characterized as \\"dismal.\\" By mid-summer in 2006 delays of 5‚Äì11 hours were common. Critics dubbed the train the Star-late. During early summer 2008, the Coast Starlight was relaunched with new amenities and refurbished equipment. In July 2008, refurbished Pacific Parlour cars returned to service as part of the relaunch. This was much anticipated, due to the success of Amtrak's relaunch of the Empire Builder. Between FY2008 and FY2009, ridership on the Coast Starlight jumped 15% from 353,657 passengers to 406,398 passengers. Operating conditions on the UP improved as well; by May 2008 on-time performance had jumped to 86%. Service was suspended north of Sacramento for a month in 2017 after a freight derailment damaged a bridge near Mount Shasta, California. On February 24, 2019, the southbound Coast Starlight struck a fallen tree near Oakridge, Oregon after a rare heavy snowstorm. The train was stranded for 36 hours before tracks could be cleared for a Union Pacific locomotive to tow the train back to Eugene‚ÄìSpringfield. =Future improvements= Amtrak has reduced the Coast Starlight frequency from its long running daily service to 3 times per week in either direction effective October 1, 2020 as part of its customer service improvement plan. They have also limited seat sales to 50% of those physically available onboard to promote social distancing. The 2018 California State Rail Plan, prepared by Caltrans, outlines a number of planned improvements to rail infrastructure in the state of California. These proposals include near-term plans to create additional stops on the Coast Subdivision at Soledad and King City for use by the Coast Starlight. There is also a proposal in the Capitol Corridor Vision plan to improve the right-of- way shared by the Capitol Corridor and Coast Starlight between Oakland and Martinez. The proposal would re-route the train from along the coastline to a new tunnel through Franklin Canyon and a right-of-way next to California State Route 4 that would reduce the trip time by several minutes.  Route  Amtrak Coast Starlight Except for two sections, most of the Coast Starlight route is on former Southern Pacific lines now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. The Coast Starlight runs over the following lines: *BNSF Seattle Subdivision (ex- NP, later ex-BN): Seattle to Portland, Oregon *UP Brooklyn Subdivision: Portland to Eugene, Oregon *UP Cascade Subdivision: Eugene to Klamath Falls, Oregon *UP Black Butte Subdivision: Klamath Falls to Dunsmuir, California *UP Valley Subdivision: Dunsmuir to Marysville, California *UP Sacramento Subdivision (ex-WP): Marysville to Sacramento, California *UP Martinez Subdivision: Sacramento to Oakland *UP Niles Subdivision: Oakland to Elmhurst *UP Coast Subdivision: Elmhurst to San Luis Obispo *UP Santa Barbara Subdivision: San Luis Obispo to Moorpark, California *UP/Metrolink (SCAX) Ventura Subdivision: Moorpark to Taylor Yard, Los Angeles *Metrolink (SCAX) River Subdivision: Taylor Yard to Los Angeles Union Station The Coast Starlight is occasionally diverted between Oakland and Los Angeles via the Tri-Valley, Central Valley, and Tehachapi Pass due to track work or service disruptions on the Coast Line. These rerouted trains are popular with railfans because they use the Tehachapi Loop, which passenger trains have otherwise been prohibited from using since 1971.  Equipment  The train uses double- decker Superliner I & II equipment, including a Sightseer Lounge car that has floor-to-ceiling windows to view the passing scenery. Baggage is placed in one of Amtrak's new Viewliner II single-level baggage cars or in designated coach- class cars. The Coast Starlight typically uses two GE P42DCs for locomotive power. Secondary locomotives that are occasionally utilized are the older GE P32-8BWHs and GE P40DCs. While the length of the train varies, in 2020 the consist comprised a baggage car, Transition sleeper, two sleeping cars, dining car, Sightseer Lounge, one Superliner coach car with Business Class seating, and three standard coaches cars. Prior to February 2018, the Coast Starlight was unique in that it included a first-class lounge car called the \\"Pacific Parlour Car\\". The cars were Budd Hi-Level Sky Lounge cars, built in 1956 for the Santa Fe's El Capitan service. Called a \\"living room on rails\\", the Parlour car offered several amenities to first-class sleeping car passengers including wireless Internet access, a full bar, a small library with books and games, an afternoon wine tasting, and a movie theater on the lower level. Sleeping car passengers could also make reservations to dine in the Parlour car, which offered a unique menu not offered in the standard dining car. In January 2018, in a cost-cutting measure, Amtrak announced the discontinuation of the Pacific Parlour Cars, citing the move as \\"part of Amtrak's ongoing work to modernize its fleet of equipment.\\" The last day of service was February 2 for northbound train 14 and February 4 for southbound train 11.

ESP LTD KH202. James Hetfield's Eet Fuk Guitar. \\"Iron Cross\\" model. TA-200 bass guitar. In 1975, Hisatake Shibuya opened a shop called Electric Sound Products (ESP) in Tokyo, Japan, which provided custom replacement parts for guitars. At this time, ESP also began making guitars under the ESP and Navigator brand in the Japanese market. ESP replacement parts were first introduced into the US in 1983 and began crafting custom instruments for local New York artists between 1984 and '85. Among these artists were Page Hamilton (Helmet), Vernon Reid (Living Colour), Vinnie Vincent and Bruce Kulick (KISS), Sid McGinnis of Late Night with David Letterman and Ronnie Wood (The Rolling Stones). At this time, ESP also introduced the 400 Series as the first production line to be distributed in the US. During this same period, ESP began making the bodies and necks for Kramer Guitars and other manufacturers were using ESP as an OEM such as Robin Guitars, Schecter Guitar Research and DiMarzio. Many traits of the Kramer line are still visible including neck construction and body bevels. ESP tooled up for Tom Anderson's shaved bolt on neck heel on the Schecter bodies and this has since become a feature of their house brand. In 1985, George Lynch discovered ESP while on tour in Tokyo. Lynch walked into an ESP shop looking for a replacement neck and learned that ESP also built custom guitars. As a result, his famous ESP Kamikaze was made and ESP released George Lynch's Kamikaze as its first signature model. ESP soon introduced the M1 Standard, MI Custom, Horizon Custom, and the Surveyor bass. At this time, ESP based its headquarters in a loft in downtown New York City on 19th Street. In 1989, the headquarters were moved to 48th Street near other music stores. Between 1990 and 1992, ESP expanded its Signature Series as well as its standard product line. The US replacement parts business was discontinued in order to focus solely on their guitar and bass line, as well as the Custom Shop series. There are about 41 signature series guitars. In 1993, ESP moved its headquarters again but this time to Los Angeles, on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood. In 1995, the LTD series was created to produce ESP's high-quality products at a more affordable price. Soon after the introduction of the Korean and Indonesian- made LTD lines, ESP stopped selling the majority of its Japanese made flagship guitars in the United States, due to the high prices involved in exporting to the Americas. The lone exception was ESP's artist signature series, which remained ESP (rather than LTD) models. In the early 2000s (decade), ESP resumed exporting the standard Japanese made lines to the United States (where they are popular among heavy metal and hard rock players), though at greatly increased prices compared to the early 1990s. Similarly to Ibanez, ESP's chief competitor in Japan, ESP was initially known for making high quality and customized replicas of famous American guitars, including hot rodded Strats and Teles, as well as Gibson Explorers. The Explorer model, (known as the EXP/MX), shot to fame when avid ESP user James Hetfield's band Metallica rose to popularity in the late 80s/early 90s. Models similar to Hetfield's black ESP even today sell for thousands of dollars beyond the original retail price. However, just like with Ibanez, when the Gibson company realized the extent to which ESP was denting into sales of its own guitars, it filed a suit to prevent sales of these guitars in the Americas. ESP redesigned its lines to be less similar to the American models. In 2002, ESP was ranked among the music industry's fastest growing companies. This is largely due to the Fender buyout of Jackson Guitars, who ESP had struggled to compete with throughout the 1980s and 1990s. After the buyout, many Jackson endorsers switched over to ESP (this has ignited a feud between players, with Jackson players pointing out that ESP became known for copying popular instruments, including Jackson's Soloist and Gibson's Explorer models famously used by Jeff Hanneman and James Hetfield respectively, while ESP players cite the Fender buyout as casting a shadow on Jackson's metal image and hail ESP as the new king). Some of these artists who left Jackson for ESP included Dave Mustaine (Megadeth, now using Dean Guitars, who at one point had expressed interest in buying out Jackson), as well as Adam Darski (Behemoth), Alexi Laiho and Roope Latvala (Children of Bodom), Jeff Hanneman (Slayer), Galder and Silenoz (Dimmu Borgir). ESP introduced its Xtone line, beginning with the semi-hollow Paramount Series. In 2005, ESP celebrated its 30th Anniversary and released James Hetfield's \\"Truckster\\" into its Signature Series. In 2006, ESP showcased 22 of its newest Signature Series and Standard Series models at Winter NAMM 2006. The Standard Series included models such as the ESP LTD EC-500 and the ESP LTD B-500. Among the signature artists showcasing their newest ESP models and signing autographs at the ESP booth were Dave Mustaine, George Lynch, Stephen Carpenter (Deftones), Michael Wilton and Page Hamilton. As of March 2015, ESP began distributing Takamine Guitars in the United States.  Manufacturing operations  Original Series and Custom Shop ESPs are handcrafted in Japan while the Standard Series ESPs are factory made in Japan. In 1996, ESP started its \\"LTD\\" series. These guitars are similar to lower-end ESP guitars, but are more affordable and cater mainly for markets outside Japan. The 1000 series LTDs are made on an assembly line in Korea whereas the 401 series and below are made in Indonesia. Likewise, LTD basses are instruments mainly aimed at beginners. Over the years manufacturing has moved between various locations, including Vietnam, China and Indonesia. Intermediate models were manufactured in Korea in the early 2000s (decade). The quality from these has led to continued demand for the LTD series. Additionally, ESP has two separate Japan-only lines of guitars, the Grassroots (lower end) and Edwards (Mid-range). The Grassroots line is manufactured in Korea and are the equivalent or better than the Sub-400 series LTDs and can be considered a budget line. The Edwards guitars, on the other hand, are made in Japan and boast similar hardware as their higher-end ESP counterparts but are not handcrafted. In terms of quality, in contrast to the USA lines (i.e. ESP Standard & LTD), the Edwards line generally lies in between the more upmarket LTDs and ESP Standards. ESP guitars cater for a wide range of players. There are a variety of models including Superstrat-styled guitars, Les Paul-styled guitars, Flying V-styled, Star-shaped and others. ESP technically has two lines, one for USA and Japan, but there are slight differences. The ESP USA line doesn't include the Strat-like Snapper, the Forest GT, as well as some of the Japanese rock artist models but their custom line has been known to produce some of the most unusual designs such as a Gundam Beam-rifle replica guitar, as well as the \\"ESP Machinegun\\" used by the Japanese band Alfee. ESP not only make guitars, they also produce various hardware parts themselves, like bass bridges or the ESP Flicker tremolo, ESP Labs Pickups, as well as sustainers, equalizers, etc. Usually these parts are only available for OEM use and not to the ordinary customer.  Popularity  ESP found fame by making and endorsing guitars for guitarists who went on to become leading exponents of thrash metal in the 1980s, along with other guitar manufacturers Jackson and Dean, with bands Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth. As a result of these endorsements, ESP has become one of the most popular suppliers of guitars for heavy metal. ESP instruments are endorsed by musicians numbering in the hundreds. A complete list of them can be found on the Artists section of ESP Guitars' website.  Guitars and bass series  Luna Sea and X Japan guitarist Sugizo's signature ESP Eclipse S-VIII Brilliant MixedMedia guitar Dependent of target market (i.e. Asia, US, Europe) and brand (ESP, LTD or Xtone), various models are organized in marketing series. The ESP Original series has three other lines of guitars, the Edwards, Grassroots and Navigator series and are largely based on these models as well as some ESP Standard series Models. ESP Edwards Series produces mid-to-high range guitars, at a quality near the ESP Standard series, whilst ESP Grass Roots Series cater towards a more value-oriented segment of the market and are more akin to the 200s series of LTDs, however these can vary. The ESP Navigator Series on the other hand is a line which produces replicas of Gibson and Fender guitars and basses. ESP USA features the ESP Standard line (which was replaced in 2014 by E-II), as well as the lower end LTD and Xtone series. ESP USA's standard series generally caters more towards to metal players, with characteristics such as active pickups. Another line of guitars, called LTD Elite, was introduced in 2013 for overseas markets, as the ESP Standard line was slowly being phased out. LTD Elite guitars are made in Japan, and initially offered alongside the ESP standard replacement brand E-II in the export market in 2013 while a limited range of ESP Standards were sold in the US to be phased out for E-II in 2014. The ESP Standard line had been completely discontinued by this time. E-II guitars initially resembled several Edwards designs, however in 2015 many new models and finishes not available to Edwards were released. In 2016, E-II receives many new and first-time models, including Eclipse guitars with a sculpted neck joint similar to Gibson's Axcess heel to improve playability. According to ESP, E-II is the direct successor to ESP Standard with no difference between the two except the name. ESP Custom series ESP also builds custom guitars and basses, made to the specifications of the customer and the quality of such custom guitars exceed that of the Original series. These can be ordered from ESP USA but they are made in Japan. Generally speaking custom guitars cost as much, or even more than Navigators depending on the choices of the consumer and are considered to cater for the top-end of the market. There is flexibility with the orders, as the guitars produced, do not have to be based on existing lines of guitars and basses. ESP Artist series The ESP Artist, or Signature series guitars are mass-produced versions of artist's personal guitars and basses. The quality of the ESP Artist/Signature models lie between Navigator/Custom Shop and the ESP Original series. The Edwards, Grassroots and LTD artist models are in the higher-end segments of the respective lines of guitars and basses.

Identification According to the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, the biblical valley of Gerar () was probably located in the area of a valley known in Arabic as Wady Sheri'a,Gerar -- International Standard Bible Encyclopedia at biblehub.com and in Modern Hebrew as Nahal Gerar.'Gerar' in the Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Zondervan Academic, 2011, p. 520 Most commentators see the mound of Tel Haror (Hebrew) or Tell Abu Hureyra (Arabic) as representing the ancient Gerar. Some older commentaries, such as Smith's Bible Dictionary,Smith's Bible Dictionary published 1884 stated simply that Gerar was located \\"south of Gaza\\". Also, a ninth century rabbinical source (Saadia Gaon) identified Gerar with Haluza, located along the Besor River in the Negev.Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Judeo-Arabic Translation of the word Gerar (Judeo-Arabic: ◊ê◊ú◊õ'◊ú◊ï◊• = al-Khal≈´·π£) in the Pentateuch (Tafsir), s.v.

Naor, Gerar ‚Äî Tell el Far'a, Bulletin of the Israel Exploration Society (1955), pp. 99‚Äì102 (Hebrew) However, according to recent archaeological research, Haluza only dates to the Nabatean period. Biblical accounts Biblically, the town features in two of the three wife-sister narratives in Genesis. These record that Abraham and Isaac each stayed at Gerar, near what became Beersheba, and that each passed his wife off as his sister, leading to complications involving Gerar's Philistine king, Abimelech. (, and ) The Haggadah identifies the two references to Abimelech as two separate people, the second being the first Abimelech's son, and that his original name was Benmelech [\\"son of the King\\"], but he changed his name to his father's, meaning \\"my father is king\\". In 2 Chronicles 14:12-15, Gerar and its surrounding towns figure in the account of King Asa's defeat of Zerah's vast Cushite forces.

She was a member of the gold-medal-winning United States women's gymnastics team (the \\"Magnificent Seven\\") at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Moceanu trained under Marta and B√©la K√°rolyi, and later Lumini»õa Miscenco and Mary Lee Tracy. She earned her first national team berth at age 10 and represented the United States in various international competitions at the junior level. She was the all-around silver medalist at the 1992 Junior Pan American Games and the 1994 junior national champion. In 1995, at the age of 13, she became the youngest gymnast to win the senior all-around title at the U.S. National Championships. She was the youngest member of both the 1995 World Championships team and the gold-medal-winning 1996 Olympics team, and was the last gymnast to compete legally in the Olympics at the age of 14. Moceanu's last major success in gymnastics was at the 1998 Goodwill Games, where she became the first American to win the all-around gold medal. Family problems, coaching changes, and injuries derailed her efforts to make the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, and she retired from the sport in 2000. Since then, she has worked as a coach, studied business management, and written a memoir, Off Balance. Early career Moceanu was born in Hollywood, California, to two Romanian immigrants, Dumitru Moceanu (1954‚Äì2008) and Camelia Moceanu (n√©e: Staicu; b. 1961). She has two younger sisters: Jennifer Bricker, born October 1, 1987, and Christina Moceanu Chapman, born August 24, 1989.Moceanu's profile at USA Gymnastics Her parents, who were both gymnasts in Romania, had early aspirations for her gymnastics career. When she was a toddler, they tested her strength by allowing her to hang from a clothesline. Moceanu began gymnastics classes in Illinois when she was 3 years old and later trained at LaFleur's in Florida. In 1991, when she was 10, her family moved to Houston, Texas, where she became one of the last gymnasts to be trained by legendary Romanian coaches Marta and B√©la K√°rolyi.\\"IG Online interview: Dominique Moceanu\\". International Gymnast. 2015. She began competing internationally at a young age, earning her first U.S. National Team berth in 1992. That spring, she earned five medals‚Äîgold in the team event, uneven bars, vault, and floor exercise; silver in the all-around‚Äîat the Junior Pan American Games.\\"Chatting with Jennie and Dominique\\" Nancy Raymond, International Gymnast, March 1993 Under the K√°rolyis' tutelage, Moceanu became the junior national champion in 1994. In 1995, she repeated her success as a senior, becoming the youngest gymnast ever to win the USA Gymnastics National Championships. She was also the youngest member of the American team at the 1995 World Championships in Sabae, Japan, where she was the top American finisher in the all-around competition and the only American to win an individual medal, a silver on the balance beam. Moceanu's national and international successes, combined with her bubbly attitude, earned her attention and a wide fan base both in and out of the gymnastics community. In the months leading up to the 1996 Olympics, she was one of the most recognizable faces of USA Gymnastics, eclipsing more decorated teammates such as Shannon Miller and Dominique Dawes. Before the Olympics, she was featured in Vanity Fair and wrote an autobiography, Dominique Moceanu: An American Champion, with Steve Woodward.Dominique Moceanu: An American Champion. Dominique Moceanu, as told to Steve Woodward. BT/Yearing, 1995, . The book reached No. 7 on The New York Times Best Seller list.  1996 Olympics  Moceanu was expected to be a major medal threat at the Olympics. However, after the 1996 U.S. Nationals, where she placed third in the all-around, she was diagnosed with a stress fracture in her right tibia. Her injury forced her to sit out the Olympic Trials, but she was petitioned onto the team on the strength of her Nationals scores. At the Olympics, still struggling with her injury and sporting a heavily bandaged leg, Moceanu contributed to the team gold medal with performances good enough to qualify her for the event finals on balance beam and floor exercise. However, she faltered in the last rotation of team optionals, falling on both vaults. Her teammate Kerri Strug vaulted next and clinched the gold for the U.S., but injured her ankle in the process. Moceanu took Strug's place in the all-around finals, but made a mistake on the balance beam and placed ninth. In the beam final, she fell when she missed a foot on a layout and crashed into the balance beam on her head. She finished the exercise and went on to a strong performance in the floor finals later that day, finishing fourth and just missing a medal. Post-Olympics career After the 1996 Olympics, Moceanu participated in professional gymnastics exhibitions, including a 34-city tour, before returning to competition. With the retirement of the K√°rolyis, she began training with other coaches at Moceanu Gymnastics, a gym built and run by her family. Out of peak form, Moceanu placed ninth at the 1997 U.S. Nationals. She then led a mostly inexperienced U.S. team at the 1997 World Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she qualified for the all- around final but did not medal. In 1998, however, she returned to top form. Under her new coach, Lumini≈£a Miscenco, she adjusted to a significant growth spurt and developed a more mature style. She was selected to compete at the 1998 Goodwill Games, where she became the only American to win the all-around title. In doing so, she defeated the reigning world all-around champion, Svetlana Khorkina, and the world silver and bronze medalists, Simona Am√¢nar and Yelena Produnova. She outscored the second-place finisher, Maria Olaru‚Äîwho would become the 1999 world all-around champion‚Äîby 0.687 points. Two years later, training with Mary Lee Tracy at Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy, Moceanu placed eighth at the 2000 U.S. Nationals. She qualified for the Olympic Trials but was forced to withdraw with a knee injury. In the fall of 2000, Moceanu participated in a post-Olympics national exhibition tour. She also participated in the post-Olympics Rock N' Roll Gymnastics Championship Tour in 2004. After a five-year hiatus from elite gymnastics, Moceanu announced in 2005 that she was returning. An injury kept her from competing that year, but she continued to train on floor and vault, and in the summer of 2006, she was invited to attend the USA Gymnastics national training camp. Moceanu competed at the 2006 U.S. Classic, where she successfully performed a full-twisting Tsukahara vault. On floor, however, she went out of bounds on her tucked full- in tumbling pass and fell on her double pike, posting one of the lowest scores of the meet. In a decision that proved controversial, she did not qualify to the 2006 National Championships. She stated that USA Gymnastics officials had told her she would qualify if she attended the national training camp and competed at least one event at the U.S. Classic. But after the Classic, she was told that she had needed a combined score on two events of 28.0 or higher to qualify; her combined score on vault and floor was 27.1. She appealed the decision, but it was upheld. She now coaches part-time at Gymnastics World in Broadview Heights, Ohio, and conducts clinics and private lessons around the country.CBB Exclusive: Going for (baby) gold with Olympic gold medalist Dominique Moceanu Jennifer Parris, Celebrity Baby Blog, 2007 Moceanu runs the Dominique Moceanu Gymnastics Center and Carmen Yoga Studio in Medina, Ohio, USA; where her son Vincent Canales also trains. Personal life Moceanu was raised Romanian Orthodox, and has said her faith was a source of comfort in her career as a gymnast. In late 1998, when she was 17, Moceanu left home and sued for emancipation from her father in order to regain control of the money she earned as a professional gymnast. In the resulting court case and television interviews, she stated that her father squandered her sizable earnings and had an abusive, controlling nature. The court approved her petition for emancipation and control of her finances. She eventually reconciled with her father. On November 4, 2006, Moceanu married Dr. Michael Canales, a podiatrist and former Ohio State gymnast. On December 25, 2007, she gave birth to a daughter, Carmen Noel Canales. Her second child, a son named Vincent Michael Canales, was born on March 13, 2009. In May 2009, Moceanu graduated from John Carroll University with a business management degree. In her memoir Off Balance, Moceanu revealed that she has a younger sister, Jennifer Bricker, who was born without legs and was given up for adoption at the hospital at birth. Bricker is an acrobat and aerialist who idolized Moceanu before finding out they were sisters. In Off Balance, Moceanu also alleged that B√©la and Marta K√°rolyi were abusive and manipulative when she trained under them. Moceanu, Jamie Dantzscher and Jessica Howard testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on March 28, 2017 about the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal. In 2020, her son Vincent, an aspiring gymnast, appeared on American Ninja Warrior Junior. Her son is hoping to compete at the 2028 Summer Olympics in gymnastics.

The dish is named after Zuo Zongtang (also romanized Tso Tsung-t'ang), a Qing dynasty statesman and military leader, although there is no recorded connection to him nor is the dish known in Hunan, Zuo's home province. Name and origins The dish has been associated with Zuo Zongtang (Tso Tsung-t'ang) (1812‚Äì1885), a Qing dynasty statesman and military leader from Hunan Province, but Zuo could not have eaten the dish or known of it. Text available at WiredNewYork.com The dish is found neither in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, nor in Xiangyin County, where Zuo was born. Moreover, Zuo's descendants, who are still living in Xiangyin County, when interviewed, say that they have never heard of such a dish. There are several stories concerning the origin of the dish. Eileen Yin-Fei Lo states in her book The Chinese Kitchen that the dish originates from a simple Hunan chicken dish and that the reference to \\"Zongtang\\" was not a reference to Zuo Zongtang's given name, but rather a reference to the homonym \\"zongtang(ÂÆóÂ†Ç)\\", meaning \\"ancestral meeting hall\\". Consistent with this interpretation, the dish name is sometimes (but considerably less commonly) found in Chinese as Â∑¶ÂÆóÊ£†Èõû (Chung tong gai is transliterated from Jyutping; Zu«í Z≈çngt√°ng jƒ´ is transliterated from Hanyu Pinyin). The dish or its variants are known by a number of greatly variant names, including: =Peng Chang-kuei claim= Fuchsia Dunlop argues that the recipe was invented by Taiwan-based Hunan cuisine chef Peng Chang-kuei,\\"The Curious History of General Tso's Chicken\\" , Salon who had been an apprentice of Cao Jingchen (), a leading early 20th-century Chinese chef. Peng was the Nationalist government's banquet chef and fled with Kuomintang forces to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. There he continued his career as official chef until 1973, when he moved to New York to open a restaurant. That was where Peng started inventing new dishes and modifying traditional ones. One new dish, General Tso's chicken, was originally prepared without sugar and subsequently altered to suit the tastes of \\"non-Hunanese people\\". The popularity of the dish has led to it being adopted by local Hunanese chefs and food writers. When Peng opened a restaurant in Hunan in the 1990s introducing General Tso's chicken, the restaurant closed without success, as the locals found the dish too sweet. Peng's Restaurant on East 44th Street in New York City claims that it was the first restaurant in the city to serve General Tso's chicken. Since the dish (and cuisine) was new, Peng made it the house speciality in spite of the dish's commonplace ingredients. A review of Peng's in 1977 mentions that their \\"General Tso's chicken was a stir-fried masterpiece, sizzling hot both in flavor and temperature\\". Peng died from pneumonia in November 2016 at 98 years old. =Wang claim= New York's Shun Lee Palaces, located at East (155 E. 55th St.) and West (43 W. 65th St.), also claims that it was the first restaurant to serve General Tso's chicken and that it was invented by a Chinese immigrant chef named T. T. Wang in 1972. Michael Tong, owner of New York's Shun Lee Palaces, says \\"We opened the first Hunanese restaurant in the whole country, and the four dishes we offered you will see on the menu of practically every Hunanese restaurant in America today. They all copied from us.\\" It has also been argued that the two stories can be somewhat reconciled in that the current General Tso's chicken recipe ‚Äî where the meat is crispy fried ‚Äî was introduced by Chef Wang but as \\"General Ching's chicken\\", a name which still has trace appearances on menus on the Internet (the identity of its namesake \\"General Ching\\" is, however, unclear); whereas the name \\"General Tso's chicken\\" can be traced to Chef Peng, who cooked it in a different way. These competing claims are discussed in the 2014 documentary film The Search for General Tso, which also traces how the history of Chinese immigration into the USA parallels the development of a unique Chinese-American or American Chinese cuisine. Recipes General Tso's chicken Close-up view of General Tso's chicken Traditional basic ingredients include: * Sauce: soy sauce, rice wine, rice-wine vinegar, sugar, cornstarch, dried red chili peppers (whole), garlic. * Batter / breading: egg, cornstarch. * Dish: broccoli, chicken dark meat (cubed). =Regional differences= The Taiwanese restaurant Peng Chang-kuei also serves the dish and is credited by some sources as the inventor of the dish. Differences between this Taiwanese dish and that commonly encountered in North America are that it is not sweet in flavor, the chicken is cooked with its skin and that soy sauce plays a much more prominent role.

There are many different types of memory biases, including: * Availability bias: greater likelihood of recalling recent, nearby, or otherwise immediately available examples, and the imputation of importance to those examples over others * Boundary extension: remembering the background of an image as being larger or more expansive than the foreground * Childhood amnesia: the retention of few memories from before the age of four. * Choice-supportive bias: remembering chosen options as having been better than rejected options (Mather, Shafir & Johnson, 2000) * Confirmation bias: the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses. * Conservatism or Regressive bias: tendency to remember high values and high likelihoods/probabilities/frequencies lower than they actually were and low ones higher than they actually were. Based on the evidence, memories are not extreme enough. * Consistency bias: incorrectly remembering one's past attitudes and behaviour as resembling present attitudes and behaviour. * Context effect: that cognition and memory are dependent on context, such that out-of-context memories are more difficult to retrieve than in-context memories (e.g., recall time and accuracy for a work-related memory will be lower at home, and vice versa). * Cryptomnesia: a form of misattribution where a memory is mistaken for imagination, because there is no subjective experience of it being a memory. * Egocentric bias: recalling the past in a self-serving manner, e.g., remembering one's exam grades as being better than they were, or remembering a caught fish as bigger than it really was. * Fading affect bias: a bias in which the emotion associated with unpleasant memories fades more quickly than the emotion associated with positive events. * Generation effect (Self-generation effect): that self-generated information is remembered best. For instance, people are better able to recall memories of statements that they have generated than similar statements generated by others. *Gender differences in eyewitness memory: the tendency for a witness to remember more details about someone of the same gender. * Hindsight bias: the inclination to see past events as being predictable; also called the \\"I-knew-it-all-along\\" effect. * Humor effect: that humorous items are more easily remembered than non-humorous ones, which might be explained by the distinctiveness of humor, the increased cognitive processing time to understand the humor, or the emotional arousal caused by the humor. * Illusion-of-truth effect: that people are more likely to identify as true statements those they have previously heard (even if they cannot consciously remember having heard them), regardless of the actual validity of the statement. In other words, a person is more likely to believe a familiar statement than an unfamiliar one. * Illusory correlation: inaccurately seeing a relationship between two events related by coincidence. * Lag effect: see spacing effect. * Leveling and sharpening: memory distortions introduced by the loss of details in a recollection over time, often concurrent with sharpening or selective recollection of certain details that take on exaggerated significance in relation to the details or aspects of the experience lost through leveling. Both biases may be reinforced over time, and by repeated recollection or re-telling of a memory. * Levels-of-processing effect: that different methods of encoding information into memory have different levels of effectiveness (Craik & Lockhart, 1972). * List-length effect: a smaller percentage of items are remembered in a longer list, but as the length of the list increases, the absolute number of items remembered increases as well. * Memory inhibition: that being shown some items from a list makes it harder to retrieve the other items (e.g., Slamecka, 1968). * Misattribution of memory: when information is retained in memory but the source of the memory is forgotten. One of Schacter's (1999) seven sins of memory, misattribution was divided into source confusion, cryptomnesia and false recall/false recognition. * Misinformation effect: that misinformation affects people's reports of their own memory. * Modality effect: that memory recall is higher for the last items of a list when the list items were received via speech than when they were received via writing. * Mood congruent memory bias: the improved recall of information congruent with one's current mood. * Next-in-line effect: that a person in a group has diminished recall for the words of others who spoke immediately before or after this person. * Peak-end rule: that people seem to perceive not the sum or average of an experience, but how it was at its peak (e.g. pleasant or unpleasant) and how it ended. * Persistence: the unwanted recurrence of memories of a traumatic event. * Picture superiority effect: that concepts are much more likely to be remembered experientially if they are presented in picture form than if they are presented in word form. * Placement bias: tendency to remember ourselves to be better than others at tasks at which we rate ourselves above average (also Illusory superiority or Better-than-average effect) and tendency to remember ourselves to be worse than others at tasks at which we rate ourselves below average (also Worse-than-average effect).Kruger, J. (1999). Lake Wobegon be gone! The \\"below-average effect\\" and the egocentric nature of comparative ability judgments\\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 77(2), * Positivity effect: that older adults favor positive over negative information in their memories. * Primacy effect, Recency effect & Serial position effect: that items near the end of a list are the easiest to recall, followed by the items at the beginning of a list; items in the middle are the least likely to be remembered. * Processing difficulty effect * Reminiscence bump: the recalling of more personal events from adolescence and early adulthood than personal events from other lifetime periods (Rubin, Wetzler & Nebes, 1986; Rubin, Rahhal & Poon, 1998). * Rosy retrospection: the remembering of the past as having been better than it really was. * Saying is Believing effect: Communicating a socially tuned message to an audience can lead to a bias of identifying the tuned message as one's own thoughts. * Self-reference effect: the phenomena that memories encoded with relation to the self are better recalled than similar information encoded otherwise. * Self-serving bias: perceiving oneself responsible for desirable outcomes but not responsible for undesirable ones. * Source confusion: misattributing the source of a memory, e.g. misremembering that one saw an event personally when actually it was seen on television. * Spacing effect: that information is better recalled if exposure to it is repeated over a longer span of time. * Stereotypical bias: memory distorted towards stereotypes (e.g. racial or gender), e.g. \\"black- sounding\\" names being misremembered as names of criminals. * Subadditivity effect: the tendency to estimate that the likelihood of a remembered event is less than the sum of its (more than two) mutually exclusive components. * Suffix effect: the weakening of the recency effect in the case that an item is appended to the list that the subject is not required to recall (Morton, Crowder & Prussin, 1971). * Suggestibility: a form of misattribution where ideas suggested by a questioner are mistaken for memory. * Telescoping effect: the tendency to displace recent events backward in time and remote events forward in time, so that recent events appear more remote, and remote events, more recent. * Testing effect: that frequent testing of material that has been committed to memory improves memory recall. * Tip of the tongue: when a subject is able to recall parts of an item, or related information, but is frustratingly unable to recall the whole item. This is thought to be an instance of \\"blocking\\" where multiple similar memories are being recalled and interfere with each other. * Verbatim effect: that the \\"gist\\" of what someone has said is better remembered than the verbatim wording (Poppenk, Walia, Joanisse, Danckert, & K√∂hler, 2006). * Von Restorff effect: that an item that sticks out is more likely to be remembered than other items (von Restorff, 1933). * Zeigarnik effect: that uncompleted or interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones.

They are the \\"cowboy\\" saddles familiar to movie viewers, rodeo fans, and those who have gone on trail rides at guest ranches. This saddle was designed to provide security and comfort to the rider when spending long hours on a horse, traveling over rugged terrain. The design of the Western saddle derives from the saddles of the Mexican vaqueros‚Äîthe early horse trainers and cattle handlers of Mexico and the American Southwest. It was developed for the purpose of working cattle across vast areas, and came from a combination of the saddles used in the two main styles of horseback riding then practiced in Spain‚Äîla jineta, the Moorish style which allowed great freedom of movement to the horse; and la estradiota, later la brida, the jousting style, which provided great security to the rider and strong control of the horse. A very functional item was also added: the saddle \\"horn\\". This style of saddle allowed vaqueros to control cattle by use of a rope around the neck of the animal, tied or dallied (wrapped without a knot) around the horn. Today, although many Western riders have never roped a cow, the western saddle still features this historical element. (Some variations on the Western saddle design, such as those used in bronc riding, endurance riding and those made for the European market, do not have horns.) Another predecessor which may have contributed to the design of the Western saddle was the Spanish tree saddle, which was also influential in the design of the McClellan saddle of the American military, being used by all branches of the U.S. Army, but being particularly associated with the cavalry. The Western saddle is designed to be comfortable when ridden in for many hours. Its history and purpose is to be a working tool for a cowboy who spends all day, every day, on horseback. For a beginning rider, the western saddle may give the impression of providing a more secure seat. However, this may be misleading; the horn is not meant to be a handle for the rider to hang onto, and the high cantle and heavy stirrups are not for forcing the rider into a rigid position. The development of an independent seat and hands is as critical for western riders as for English riders. Construction Parts of a Western saddle The modern western saddle begins with a \\"tree\\" that defines the shape of the bars, the seat, the swells, horn, and cantle. Traditional trees are made of wood covered with rawhide, coated with varnish or a similar modern synthetic coating. In some cases, the core of the horn may be of metal. Modern synthetic materials of various types have also been used instead of wood, but while lighter and less expensive, are generally considered weaker than traditional materials, some, such as fiberglass, dangerously so. A high-quality tree is at the heart of a good saddle, particularly those used for sports such as steer roping, where the equipment must withstand considerable force. The tree is usually covered with leather on all visible parts of the saddle. The seat may have foam rubber or other materials added between the tree and the top layer of leather to provide additional comfort to the rider, and leather or foam padding may be used to slightly alter the contours of the seat. Sheepskin is placed on the underside of the saddle, covering both the tree and the underside of the skirts. The cinch rings, made of metal, are attached to the tree as described under \\"Rigging,\\" below. For decoration, metal conchos, lacing, and small plates, usually silver or a silver-like substitute, are added. The leather parts of the saddle are often tooled into designs that range from simple to complex. The finest-quality saddles often have hand-carved tooling that itself is considered a work of art. Western saddles compared to English saddles The Western saddle is different from an English saddle in that it has no padding between the tree and the external leather and fleece skirting. The weight bearing area of the saddle is large and usually covered with sheepskin, but it must be padded with a saddle blanket in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse. Western saddles are extensively decorated and intricately carved silver conchos and other additions are frequently added to the saddle for show purposes. Other differences between the Western and English saddles include: An English saddle has no horn, no protective fenders and a different padding system on the horse's back * Stirrups: Those of the Western saddle cannot detach from the saddle in an emergency, but instead have a wider tread; combined with the rider's high-heeled cowboy boots, the design minimizes the risk that the rider's feet will slip through the stirrup during a fall and the rider being dragged. * Cinching (girthing): The method of securing the saddle to the horse. Rather than buckling on as does the English girth, the Western girth, known as a cinch, is anchored with a flat strap of leather or nylon called a latigo that may be secured with a flat knot, or via holes added so that a buckle can be used, either in place of the knot or in addition to one. * Seat and Cantle: These parts of a western saddle are more pronounced than in an English saddle and may provide greater comfort and security to the rider. *Tree: The tree of a western saddle is larger and covers more surface area than that of an English saddle. There is little padding between the tree bars and the underside of a western saddle, whereas much of the weight bearing area on an English saddle is supported by a large amount of internal flocking inside the panels. While a western saddle is designed to be ridden for many hours at a stretch; for covering distance where time is a factor, such as with Endurance riding, the lighter English saddle dominates. Types Full double- rigged team roping saddle. Note extra wide back cinch There are many types of Western saddle available. Some are general-purpose models while others emphasize either greater freedom for the horse or greater security for the rider, as may be necessary for specialized work in the various Western horse sports such as cutting, reining, barrel racing, team roping, equitation and western pleasure. Factors such as width of the swells, height of the cantle, depth of the seat, placement of the stirrups and type of rigging all influence the uses of a given design. For example, a saddle with wide swells, high cantle and deep seat is suitable for cutting, where a rider must remain in a secure, quiet seat on the horse. At the other end of the spectrum, a saddle with a \\"slick fork\\" - virtually no swells - and a low cantle is suited for calf roping, where a rider must dismount quickly, often while the horse is still in motion, and not be caught up on the saddle. The most common variations include the following: *Roping saddle: Heavy, sturdy saddle that usually has a thicker horn for securing a rope, low cantle, and slick fork that allows rider to dismount quickly when needed. *Rodeo bronc riding saddle: Hornless, deep seated saddle with wide swells, having small fenders with oxbow style stirrups, originally designed and made by rodeo innovator Earl Bascom in 1922. *Cutting saddle: Has a deep seat and wide swells allows the rider to sit deep and securely through sharp stops and turns. *Reining saddle: Has a deep seat to allow the rider to sit deeply and more freely swinging fenders for more leg movement on the rider's part. *Barrel racing saddle: Lightweight saddle with wide swells and high cantle which allows rider to sit securely but also allows the horse to perform fast sprints and sharp turns. *Endurance saddle: Lighter weight than most western saddles, often without a horn, has a tree that spreads the rider's weight out over a large area of the horse's back, thus reducing pounds per square inch. Often has stirrups hung slightly farther forward, to allow rider to get off the horse's back when traveling at faster speeds. Designed for long rides at faster speeds than a trail saddle. *Trail saddle: Designed for maximum comfort of rider as well as a good fit for the horse, features deep, padded seat, designed for long rides at slower speeds. *Show saddle: May be based on roping, cutting, or other trees, but is characterized by additional leather tooling and silver decoration. Usually features a deep, padded seat that allows the rider to sit quietly and give the appearance of a smooth ride. *\\"Equitation\\" saddle: Show saddle with an especially deep seat to help hold a rider in place. =Design variations= There are many variations of design and optional equipment elements that were influenced by geographic region, history, use and the body types of horses bred in a given area. Certain stylistic elements seen on some, but not all western saddles include: Parade saddle with extensive silver plating, tapaderos, and flank trappings *Breastcollar, an additional piece of equipment that runs from the saddle around the chest of the horse, lending both lateral stability and preventing the saddle from sliding back. Breastcollars are particularly common on trail horses and roping horses and stylized versions are often seen at horse shows. They are generally made out of leather, but may also be made of mohair or synthetic cord similar to a front cinch, or from synthetic materials that resemble leather. *Back cinch: A second cinch is often seen on working saddles, particularly full-rigged roping saddles. Made of several thicknesses of leather, it is adjusted just tight enough to touch the underside of the horse, but not tight enough to provoke discomfort or bucking. It prevents the back end of the saddle from rising up in working situations, and when team roping, it also minimizes the saddle fork from digging forward into the horse's withers when a cow is dallied from the saddle horn. The back cinch is generally not required or used on a center-fire or 3/4 rigged saddle. *Saddle strings, long strips of leather attached to the pommel and back jockey of working saddles, used for tying items to a saddle. *Horn wrap, primarily seen on roping saddles, extra wraps of leather or other material that thickens the horn and provides support for a dallied lasso. *Tapaderos, leather covers over the toe that close each stirrup from the front. A tapadero prevents the rider's boot from slipping through and also prevents brush encountered while working cattle on the open range from poking through the stirrup, injuring or impeding the horse or rider. The tapadero was particularly seen on certain saddles of the vaquero tradition, but today is primarily a decorative element. Tapaderos are not \\"show legal\\" for western- style horse show competition in most cases, but are often seen on saddles used by parade horses. Trees A classic \\"Wade\\" saddle, a tree style designed for working ranch horses The tree for a western saddle. This one is a manufactured tree of pine covered in fiberglass, an inexpensive design The underside of a tree for a western saddle. There are several different sizes of trees commonly found in saddles. Trees differ in the width of gullet and bars of the saddle, pitch of the bars (steep to flat, usually between an angle of 86 to 94 degrees with 90 being common), and length of the bars. The tree also influences the shape of the pommel and cantle on the seat on the saddle, though the seat can be altered to fit a rider by adding padding and other materials to a far greater degree than the fit of the saddle tree's bars on a horse. A wider gullet sits lower on the horse, while a narrow gullet sits higher and is designed to fit horses with higher withers. The bars form the primary loading surface of the saddle as it site on the horse's back. A horse with a flat back and widely sprung ribs will require bars with a flatter pitch than a saddle made for a narrow horse, where a steeper pitch to the bars will keep the saddle placed properly. Most saddles are made with pre-manufactured trees which come in a limited range of sizes. Custom-made saddles may be able to have further alterations made to a standard tree. *Regular - If a manufacturer has a 'regular' barred saddle it usually falls between 5¬æ\\" and 6\\". Often 90 degrees *Semi Quarter Horse - This type usually has a gullet width of about 6¬Ω inches and steeper bars than most other trees. It is the narrowest common tree and, despite its name, fits many breeds of horse. Often 90 degrees *Quarter Horse /Full Quarter Horse - Terminology varies with manufacturer, but overall design is intended to fit stock horse breeds such as the American Quarter Horse. This type usually has a gullet width of about 6¬æ inches, but may be up to 7 inches. It usually has a flatter pitch than the Semi-Quarter horse tree. Different makers tend to give different gullet dimensions in Quarter Horse and Full Quarter Horse trees. Usually between 90 and 94 degrees *Arabian - Depending on manufacturer, has a 6¬Ω\\" - 6¬æ\\" width gullet but a very flat pitch to the tree. Usually has shorter bars than Full- and Semi- Quarter horse trees. Intended to fit smaller horses with short but wide backs, such as the stock horse-type Arabian and Morgan. *Haflinger (7¬Ω\\" gullet) are very wide, designed for semi-draft breeds such as the Haflinger horse, which are short- backed, heavy, low-withered horses. Often have a flat pitch (usually greater than 94 degrees) and very little rock. *Draft - (8\\" gullet), are designed for riding Draft horses. Usually greater than 94 degrees *Pony - narrow gullet, flat pitch to the bars, very short tree, designed for children and smaller ponies such as the Shetland and Welsh pony. Rigging In-skirt rigging of a western show saddle, showing latigo and buckled cinch. The colored circles indicate the various options for placement of the rigging on a western saddle. The saddle shown has a \\"full\\" rigging position, shown by the yellow circle. The green circle indicates the placement of a 7/8 rigging, blue shows 3/4 rigging, and the red circle shows the historic \\"center fire\\" position. Saddle rigging refers to the arrangement of rings and plate hardware that connects the billets and girthing system that holds the saddle on the horse. Western saddle rigging can be either single or double. The front rigging consists of metal \\"cinch rings\\" on each side of the saddle to which a long, wide strap called a latigo is attached for holding the front cinch that goes around the heart girth of the horse, just behind the elbows. The back cinch is placed around the widest part of the horse's barrel, and is attached to the saddle either by reinforced slots in the leather skirting of the saddle, or, in particularly heavy-duty models, to a second set of rings. The front cinch is secured to the saddle by means of a latigo on the left, and on the right, by either a latigo or a billet. Latigos are not removed until worn out or broken. They run through the ring or buckle of the cinch (also called a cinch ring), and back to the rigging, sometimes multiple times for extra security. Modern latigos have several holes at the end so that a cinch can be buckled at a set tension, though the cinch may also be secured by a knot called a \\"latigo knot,\\" which is a type of half-hitch. The off-side billet is a shorter, doubled piece of leather with holes along its length, somewhat heavier and less flexible than latigo leather. It runs through the rigging cinch ring and both ends buckle onto the cinch. Older saddles may use a latigo on the off side, but this is less common. Once adjusted to the horse, an off-side latigo or billet is seldom disconnected from the cinch, which remains attached to the saddle until it needs to be replaced, unlike the girth of an English saddle, which is to be removed on both sides when not in use. While leather is preferred for latigos, nylon web is sometimes used, particularly on cheaper saddles, though it is prone to slip when knotted and the holes may tear more easily. When used, a back cinch, made of several thicknesses of leather, is held on by a simple heavy leather billet on each side of the saddle that buckles just tight enough to touch the underside of the horse, but not tight enough to provoke discomfort or bucking. At the belly midline, the front and back cinches are joined by a light belly strap, called a cinch hobble, that prevents the back cinch from moving too far back. =Rigging placement= A saddle that has only a cinch in the front is \\"single rigged\\". A saddle that has both a front cinch and a back cinch (sometimes called a flank cinch, even though it should never go around the horse's flanks) is \\"double rigged\\". The rear rigging is meant to stabilize the saddle. The back cinch is always located just below the cantle and held in place with a cinch hobble to prevent it from slipping back; however, the position of the front rigging varies. The rig positions are named by how far they are from the cantle to the fork.Western Saddle Guide. (2008). Retrieved on October 10, 2008 Placement of the front rigging is a critical component of western saddle design. The closer the rigging is to the center of the saddle, the more the rider will be balanced over the horse's center of balance, allowing freer movement and agility of horse and rider. On the other hand, the more forward the rigging is set, especially when combined with a back cinch, the more the saddle will set down on the horse, placing the rider a bit behind the horse's center of balance, but creating greater security. *Full rigging refers to the most forward position, where the front cinch ring is placed located under the center of the fork or swells of the saddle. Spanish settlers of North America originally used full rigging, but without a back cinch, this type of rigging was a disadvantage because the saddle would rise in the back while traveling over rough terrain. *Center fire is the rigging design placed closest to the center of the saddle. Historically, it replaced the full rigging. Center fire rigging is located halfway between the cantle and the fork and was always single-rigged. This type is rarely seen on western saddles today, but was used during the 1800s, and notably on the McClellan saddle of the U.S. Army. The Pony Express saddle also had center fire rigging. *Modern saddles also use two additional positions, called \\"seven-eighths\\" (written 7/8) and \\"three-quarter\\" (written 3/4). 3/4 rigging is located three-quarters of the way from the cantle to the fork; thus halfway between center fire and full positions. 7/8 rigging is 7/8 of the way from the cantle to the fork; or halfway between 3/4 and full.One type of three way rigging, (Open three-way design) showing different methods of latigo attachment to achieve the desired position *Three- way rigging utilizes various designs of multi-position cinch rings to combine the Full, 7/8 and 3/4 positions in one piece of hardware. Full position is achieved when the latigo is attached to the front ring. 7/8ths position has the latigo attached to both the front and the back ring, and the 3/4 position has the latigo attached at the back ring. *Flank cinches were added after the rodeo sports of calf roping and team roping became popular. The flank cinch was added in order to keep the saddle from tipping in the back when a lasso was tied or dallied to the saddle horn. As a result, the 3/4 and 7/8 front rigging positions were also developed. Endurance saddle, based on a western design, with a 3/4 rigging, placing the rider more directly over the stirrups and over the center of gravity of the horse. A similar tree without a horn is used for saddles used by saddle bronc riders/ Custom built saddles may be designed with any of the above rigging styles. Modern western saddles for riders who need speed and agility, such as barrel racing saddles, often have a 3/4 rigging, the closest placement to a center-fire rigging seen on modern saddles. The most popular modern rigging placement is the 7/8 rigging, which allows a rider to have a secure seat but more easily stay centered over a horse's center of balance and is often seen on saddles used for western equitation. A \\"full double\\" rigging is seen most often on saddles used for team roping, where the weight of the steer puts tremendous forward stress on the saddle, requiring rigging set well forward and both a front and back cinch to support the saddle. A few saddles are built with a three-way rigging plate that allows a saddle to be rigged in the full, 7/8 or 3/4 positions. =Rigging attachment styles= The front rigging is attached to the saddle in one of three ways: ring, flat plate or in-skirt. Ring rigging is made of rings on heavy leather straps attached directly to the saddle tree. This is the strongest attachment method, but a disadvantage is that it creates bulk under the legs and inhibits the free swing of the stirrups. The second style of attachment is the flat plate. This type has leather layers that are riveted around a metal plate and attached directly to the tree of the saddle. This is also a very strong type of ring attachment that reduces bulk under the leg and does not inhibit the swinging of the stirrups, though it is not as strong as ring rigging. The third style is the in-skirt, where the rings or plates are attached directly to the saddle's skirt. The advantage of having an in-skirt rigging is that it provides the least amount of bulk under the leg compared to the other styles of attachment. Two variations exist, the built-in and the built-on. The \\"built-in\\" rigging design makes the attachment of the rings very strong by sandwiching the rings with layers of leather and then sewing and riveting them to the skirt. This design is strong enough for pleasure riding but not for roping. It has the least amount of bulk under the leg and is popular for show saddles. A \\"built-on\\" rigging attaches the plate to the surface of the skirt, a weak placement of low quality. Historic saddles of the 19th century had rigging rings made of forged iron round stock, which would rust if it was exposed to the horse's sweat. The iron oxide would degrade and rot the leather that it came in contact with, which caused the rigging straps that were held by the rings to break. In order to correct this problem, saddle makers covered the metal rings in 4-5 ounces of medium thickness belly leather. This was a common remedy for the problem until approximately 1915, when brass rigging hardware became more common. =Western sidesaddle rigging= A modern western sidesaddle The Goodnight western sidesaddle that was developed in the 1870s by Charles Goodnight for his wife was a double rigged design. Goodnight developed this sidesaddle because there was a need to produce a woman's saddle for daily riding and work on the range. The saddle also had to fit a variety of horses on a day-to-day basis. it required two cinches. The cinches have a connecting strap, called a cinch hobble, to keep the rear girth from slipping back, which would cause the horse to buck. The girthing system still produced a shimmy in the rear, even though the rear cinch was brought up snugly against the horse. The double girthing system was not as secure as the balance strap seen on many modern sidesaddles.Flemmer, L. (2005). Goodnight western side saddles.

Format Best Week Ever features comedians analyzing the previous week's developments in pop culture, including recent happenings in entertainment and celebrity gossip. It followed a similar format to that set by the mini-series I Love the 80s and its successors. Episodes aired on Friday evenings at 10:00 p.m. and repeated several times over the weekend. At the end of every episode, the show named which celebrity, group of people, or object had \\"the Best Week Ever\\". The program's original Typepad-hosted blog bestweekever.blogs.com originally served as an ersatz online writer's room, mainly used to preview the events in the news which would end up in the Friday episode. In 2006, BestWeekEver.tv was launched to serve as more of a daily blog mostly separate from the program itself (beyond promotions and tie-ins for the show), detailing humorous stories in the news, odd television and YouTube videos, and features main contributors Michelle Collins, Dan Hopper, and formerly Sara Schaefer's observations on pop culture and other items. =Single host= Beginning October 24, 2008, the show adopted a format with a single host who summarized the week's events.Metro Philadelphia \\"‚ÄòBest Week Ever‚Äô gets even better with fresh new host.\\" Patalano, Heidi. Oct. 31, 2008. The show was renamed Best Week Ever With Paul F. Tompkins. Tompkins introduced topics from behind a podium, summarizing the week's events. Tompkins occasionally threw to panelists (usually Jessica St. Clair, Paul Scheer, Mike Britt, or Doug Benson) who offered their own take on a particular subject. Tompkins, a long-time panelist, had been with the show since its inception. =Weekly format= In both the original and latter format, each week consisted of four main segments and at least one peripheral segment. The first segment had no specific title and featured the biggest news stories of the week. The second segment was \\"The Sizzler\\". It featured Chuck Nice discussing the \\"hot\\" celebrity gossip. This section was formatted to satirize celebrity tabloid shows such as The Insider. Next was \\"In Case You Missed\\" which briefly showcases several short clips from the week's television (and occasionally the Internet and radio). The show ended with somebody being awarded \\"the Best Week Ever\\", an ironic prize usually given to somebody or something which had been featured extensively on news programs, a viral video (or any new meme), or prominent reality show contestant of the week. Recipients include Barack Obama (after beating out Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic Presidential nomination), the Dramatic Prairie Dog, and Midget Mac. =Additional programming= The show had podcast and IPTV elements, including Best Night Ever, where a host went through the night or weekend in television in a four-minute segment, and extra footage and segments on VH1's VSPOT online channel. For some time before the format change, VH1 began to have \\"Best Day Ever\\" episodes that aired Monday through Thursday for about five minutes and had different comedians go through the pop culture events of the day. Additionally, at the end of each calendar year, the show prepared a Best Year Ever special filled with \\"clips of celeb horrors of the past year\\".WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON?

Extended hiatus and cancellation Normally, Best Week Ever would leave for a summer break during July and August and return in September. New York magazine reported that Best Week Ever was on an extended hiatus until January 2010 and that it would return in the fall with Paul F. Tompkins hosting. However, the staffers feared that the show would never come back.VH1 Shelves Best Week Ever, Possibly Permanently . New York Magazine. June 6, 2009. The last episode aired June 12, 2009, with Dan Moschella named as having had the Best Week Ever. In January 2010, the show's website, BestWeekEver.tv announced the show's cancellation. Reboot and second cancellation On August 3, 2012, VH1 announced the return of Best Week Ever. New weekly episodes began January 18, 2013. However, on April 23, 2014, VH1 again canceled the series a second time. Criticism In its recounting of the events of the past week, Best Week Ever had been seen as a sign of the short attention span of millions of Americans. In a 2005 interview on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams said: \\"We have such short attention spans. Heck, VH1 has a show about last week\\".Williams Expresses Scorn For BWE In an article on the Pipe Dream website about VH1's decade-retrospective shows, writer Jeanette Duffy noted that \\"VH1 has moved on from exploiting entire decades to making us reminisce over events that happened just days ago in the Best Week Ever\\", jokingly suggesting that cable networks might eventually produce the \\"Best Five Minutes Ever\\".

The effect is also sometimes referred to as retrieval practice, practice testing, or test-enhanced learning. Retrieval practice may be the best way to refer to the testing effect because the benefits of retrieval- related testing are not limited to tests. It can be more broad like flash cards or quizzes.The testing effect on memory should be distinguished from more general practice effects, defined in the APA Dictionary of Psychology (2007) as \\"any change or improvement that results from practice or repetition of task items or activities.\\" The term testing effect is also sometimes used in a more general sense; The Oxford Dictionary of Psychology (2003) defines a testing effect as \\"any effect of taking tests on the respondents, a typical example being test sophistication.\\" Whereas psychologists who develop tests for personality and intelligence want to avoid practice effects, cognitive psychologists working with educators have begun to understand how to take advantage of tests‚Äînot as an assessment tool, but as a teaching/learning tool. It is useful for people to test their knowledge of the to-be-remembered material during the learning process, instead of only reading or otherwise passively studying the material. For example, a student can use flashcards to self-test and receive feedback as they study. The testing effect provides a larger benefit to long-term memory when the tested material is difficult enough to require effort, the rate of retrieval success is high, and feedback with correct answers is given after testing.  Empirical evidence  The first documented empirical studies on the testing effect were published in 1909 by Edwina E. Abbott. An important step in proving the existence of the testing effect was presented in a 1992 study by Carrier and Pashler. Carrier and Pashler showed that testing does not just provide an additional practice opportunity, but produces better results than other forms of studying. In their experiment, learners who tested their knowledge during practice later remembered more information than learners who spent the same amount of time studying the complete information. The abstract summarizes the results as follows: > In the pure study trial (pure ST condition) method, both items of a pair > were presented simultaneously for study. In the test trial/study trial (TTST > condition) method, subjects attempted to retrieve the response term during a > period in which only the stimulus term was present (and the response term of > the pair was presented after a 5-sec delay). Final retention of target items > was tested with cued-recall tests. In Experiment 1, there was a reliable > advantage in final testing for nonsense-syllable/number pairs in the TTST > condition over pairs in the pure ST condition. In Experiment 2, the same > result was obtained with Eskimo/English word pairs. This benefit of the TTST > condition was not apparently different for final retrieval after 5 min or > after 24 h. Experiments 3 and 4 ruled out two artifactual explanations of > the TTST advantage observed in the first two experiments. Because performing > a memory retrieval (TTST condition) led to better performance than pure > study (pure ST condition), the results reject the hypothesis that a > successful retrieval is beneficial only to the extent that it provides > another study experience. Carrier and Pashler's study did not reveal a very large advantage of testing over studying, but paved the way for numerous further studies that have shown a more marked advantage. The results of a 2010 study by Agarwal et al. showed that the desirable difficulty of open-book and closed-book tests better enhanced learning compared to restudying or testing without feedback. Additionally, a study done by Roediger and Karpicke showed that students in a repeated-testing condition recalled much more after a week than did students in a repeated-study condition (61% vs. 40%), even though students in the former condition read the passage only 3.4 times and those in the latter condition read it 14.2 times. Another study by Butler investigated the possibility that testing only promotes the learning of a specific response. The results showed that the mnemonic benefits of retrieving information from memory are seen well beyond this retention of a specific response. Thus, most studies show greater advantages for testing compared to passive studying as it relates to long-term retention of to-be-remembered information. However, some studies have produced results contrary to this claim. Using retrieval practices also produces less forgetting than studying and restudying.  Preconditions to measurement  = Retrieval success = Retrieval practice is a founded twist on the testing effect and is used widely across many classrooms in order to help students recall information prior to an exam, excluding inhabitable influences. Studies in retrieval practice were founded in 1987 by John. L Richards, who first scripted his findings in a published newspaper in New York. In order for a testing effect to be demonstrated, the test trials must have a medium to high retrieval success. If the test trials are so difficult that no items are recalled, or if there is not proper feedback providing answers to the non-recalled items, then minimal information will be encoded and stored to memory.Bjork, R. A., & Bjork, E. L. (1992). A new theory of disuse and an old theory of stimulus fluctuation. In A. Healy, S. Kosslyn, & R. Shiffrin (Eds.), From learning processes to cognitive processes: Essays in honor of William K. Estes (Vol. 2, pp. 35-67). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. Based upon research done by: = Time between retrieval practice and performance measure = Benefits of testing are often only visible after a substantial delay and not immediately after practice, when outcomes may even be better for passively restudied materials than for tested materials. Some authors suggest that this can be explained in part by limited retrieval success during practice. = Retrieval difficulty = According to the retrieval effort hypothesis, \\"difficult but successful retrievals are better for memory than easier successful retrievals\\". For example, Pyc and Rawson showed that repeated testing is more beneficial for learning if the intervals between repeated testing are long and each test is therefore more difficult than when the intervals are short and tests are easy. This finding is related to the theory that certain conditions that make learning more effortful through so-called desirable difficulties are beneficial. Another finding showed that weaker cues for recalling information will be more beneficial to future recollection compared to that of stronger cues. Although these strong cues were shown to be more advantageous for initial recall, these stronger cues reduced the likelihood of activating more elaborative information that could be beneficial for retention. On the hand, the weak cues better allowed the to-be-remembered information to be better retained over time, enhancing long-term memory of the information.  Cognitive accounts  Two views have arisen as to why testing seems to provide such a benefit over repeated study. The first view, provided by McDaniel,McDaniel, M.A., &Fisher;, R.P. (1991). Tests and test feedback as learning sources. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 16, 192‚Äì201. states that testing allows people to formulate newer, more lasting connections between items than does repeated study. The second view, provided by Karpicke and RoedigerKarpicke, J. D., & Blunt, J. R. (2011) studied the effect of testing on memory retention. For their study, they had participants study two different passages; passage one and passage two. They had the participants study passage 1 twice, and passage 2 once. However, passage two was tested on instead of being restudied.One week later they tested them on both passages, and they noticed that passage two was better recalled then passage one. They found that re-studying or re-reading memorized information had no effect, but trying to recall the information had an effect. New findings show more support for the second view. Spacing has also been shown to improve memory in younger and older adults. The spacing effect improves long-term memory from learning material with a break in between learning other information, while the testing effect improves long-term memory by restudying learned information through testing. Both of these methods have been combined to be referred to as space retrieval practice. Applications Flashcards are an application of the testing effect. Here, flashcard software Anki is used to review a mathematical formula through active recall. First, only the question is displayed. Then the answer is displayed too, for verification. Before much experimental evidence had been collected, the utility of testing was already evident to some perceptive observers. In his 1932 book Psychology of Study, C. A. Mace said \\"On the matter of sheer repetitive drill there is another principle of the highest importance: Active repetition is very much more effective than passive repetition. ... there are two ways of introducing further repetitions. We may re-read this list: this is passive repetition. We may recall it to mind without reference to the text before forgetting has begun: this is active repetition. It has been found that when acts of reading and acts of recall alternate, i.e., when every reading is followed by an attempt to recall the items, the efficiency of learning and retention is enormously enhanced.\\" In other words, the testing effect shows that when material is reviewed, the reviewer actively challenges their memory to recall than when re-reading or re-studying the materials. This is called active recall. Clearly the largest application for any human memory studies of learning effects is for education and finding better ways to relate information to students at every grade level. Extensive research has been done in this area in the last decade. With findings showing that the testing effect can have a greater impact after a delay even though students themselves seemed more confident in studying (which turned out to be false in the data). Additional reviews have sought to provide more reliable results of the testing effect to improve education, a trend that after nearly 100 years, seems to be catching on. ‚ÄúAdministering interim tests during studying is a potent strategy to promote and sustain the effectiveness of self-regulated learning across a learning phase.‚Äù As a result, teachers should persuade their students to constantly test themselves as part of their studying techniques. The testing effect is highly transferable. This means that the instructor can teach it in anyway that they want. In addition, they can give the students any format of test that they want, and the testing effect will still apply. Yang et al. did an experiment testing this. They had one group learn and study the material by reading more information with less visuals, and they had another group have more visuals to study from than verbal text. They split both groups into two groups: one that restudied and one that was tested on what they just learned. The groups that were tested were given a fill in the blank test. Then all of the groups were tested by a multiple choice test. In both cases, the participants that were tested twice did better. This shows that testing will result in better recall despite how the teacher teaches, or how the tests are formatted. \\"The testing effect is covered in the second module of the Teaching and Learning Strategies for Higher Education online short course, presented by Harvard‚Äôs Bok Center for Teaching and Learning in collaboration with GetSmarter and in association with HarvardX.\\"  See also  * Active recall * Desirable difficulty * List of memory biases * Mnemonic * Spaced repetition References * Category:Memory tests Category:Memory processes Category:Educational psychology ","title":"Testing effect"},{"id":"905663","text":"Kenneth Jerry Adair (December 17, 1936 ‚Äì May 31, 1987) was an American Major League Baseball second baseman, shortstop and third baseman with the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox and the Kansas City Royals between 1958 and 1970. Adair spent one season in Japan playing for the Hankyu Braves / Orix BlueWave. He batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Early life Adair was born in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, and graduated from [charles Page high school . He played college baseball and basketball (under Hank Iba) at Oklahoma State University. Adair also played one year in a work/play program for the McPherson (Kansas) BJs in the Ban Johnson League. That year McPherson went to the National Ban Johnson League tournament finals played in Wichita. He pitched many games as well as playing the infield. Baltimore Orioles Adair was signed by the Baltimore Orioles out of Oklahoma State University on September 2, 1958 for a $40,000 bonus. He made his Major League Baseball debut with the club that day against the Washington Senators, coming into the game in the bottom of the 8th inning as a defensive replacement for shortstop Chuck Oertel. He did not get an at bat in the game. Adair's first big league at bat came on September 5 against the Boston Red Sox. After drawing a walk and scoring in the 8th inning, Adair reached base again in the ninth inning on a fielder's choice. He picked up his first big league hit (a single to left field) in a 3‚Äì2 Orioles win over the visiting New York Yankees on September 21. That season, he hit .105 (2-for-19) in 11 games with the Orioles, primarily playing shortstop. He hit .314 (11-for-35) in 12 games in 1959 and went 1-for-5 (.200) in 3 games in 1960.http://www.baseball- almanac.com/players/player.php?p=adairje01 Adair's first full season in the big leagues came in 1961 with the Orioles, hitting .264 with 9 home runs and 37 RBI in 133 games. Although the majority of his time was spent at second base, he also played some shortstop and third base that year. Once, during the 1964 season, he was struck in the mouth by a bad throw during the first game of a doubleheader with the Detroit Tigers. The resulting laceration required 11 stitches, but Adair was back in the park in uniform in time to play the entire second game. In 1965, 28-year-old Adair hit .259 with 7 home runs and a career-high 66 RBI in 157 games with the Orioles. He was among American League leaders with 157 games (8th in the AL), 582 at bats (10th in the AL), 26 doubles (7th in the AL), 115 singles (10th in the AL) and 6 sacrifice flies (8th in the AL). As a result, Adair finished 17th in the AL MVP vote that was won by Zoilo Versalles of the Minnesota Twins. Chicago White Sox On June 13, 1966, Adair was traded by the Orioles with minor leaguer John Riddle to the Chicago White Sox for Eddie Fisher. Boston Red Sox On June 2, 1967, Adair was traded by the White Sox to the Boston Red Sox for Don McMahon and minor leaguer Rob Snow. Adair played well down the stretch with the Red Sox, hitting .291 with 3 homers and 26 RBI in 89 games, rounding out his season stats to .271 with 3 HR and 35 RBI in 117 games. With his pennant push performance at the plate, coupled with stellar defensive play, Adair finished 15th in the AL MVP balloting. Teammate Carl Yastrzemski won the award that year after claiming the elusive triple crown. Kansas City Royals Adair was taken by the Kansas City Royals with the 51st pick of the 1968 MLB expansion draft. In the Royals' inaugural season of 1969, the 32-year-old Adair hit .250 with 5 home runs and 48 RBI in 126 games. In 1970, Adair hit just .148 (4-for-27) before being abruptly released on May 5 as he was about to board a plane to make a road trip to Baltimore with the team. Adair had spent much of spring training that year with a young daughter who had terminal cancer and eventually diedJerry Adair loses daughter to cancer and claimed the Royals let him go without taking the family's problems into consideration. Royals General Manager Cedric Tallis defended the team's decision to release Adair saying \\"We just felt he couldn't help the club\\".Adair unhappy with technique Royals used to release him Legacy While having only a .254 career batting average, he was considered a good clutch hitter (Carl Yastrzemski wrote in his autobiography Baseball, The Wall, and Me \\"That man was one of the coolest clutch hitters I had seen\\"). However, his greatest strength was his defensive ability. Adair set then-major league records for single-season fielding percentage (.994) and fewest errors (5) in 1964, and followed that up by leading the league in fielding percentage again in 1965. He also set a record for consecutive errorless games by a second baseman (89), and consecutive chances handled without an error (458) from July 22, 1964 through May 6, 1965. In addition, he was considered a \\"gamer\\" who would often play when injured. After leaving Major League Baseball, Adair played in Japan for a year, and later coached for the Oakland Athletics (1972‚Äì74) and the California Angels (1975), working under his former Oriole teammate and manager in Boston Dick Williams. Adair died of liver cancer on May 31, 1987 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the age of 50.Cancer claims Jerry Adair References External links Category:1936 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Amarillo Gold Sox players Category:American expatriate baseball players in Japan Category:American men's basketball players Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Baseball players from Oklahoma Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:California Angels coaches Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Deaths from cancer in Oklahoma Category:Deaths from liver cancer Category:Hankyu Braves players Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Miami Marlins (IL) players Category:Oakland Athletics coaches Category:Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball players Category:People from Sand Springs, Oklahoma Category:Tulsa Oilers (baseball) players Category:Williston Oilers players ","title":"Jerry Adair"},{"id":"905664","text":"Sesame oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from sesame seeds. Besides being used as a cooking oil, it is used as a flavor enhancer in many cuisines, having a distinctive nutty aroma and taste. The oil is one of the earliest- known crop-based oils. Worldwide mass modern production is limited due to the inefficient manual harvesting process required to extract the oil.  Composition  Sesame oil is composed of the following fatty acids: linoleic acid (41% of total), oleic acid (39%), palmitic acid (8%), stearic acid (5%) and others in small amounts. History White sesame seeds, mostly unshelled. Historically, sesame was cultivated more than 5000 years ago as a drought- tolerant crop and was able to grow where other crops failed. Sesame seeds were one of the first crops processed for oil as well as one of the earliest condiments. Sesame was cultivated during the Indus Valley Civilisation and was the main oil crop. It was probably exported to Mesopotamia around 2500 BC. Manufacture =Manufacturing process= Bottling sesame oil at Moran Market, Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. Dark brown sesame oil derived from roasted/toasted sesame seeds. Extracting sesame oil by a bullock driven wooden press (Myanmar). Sesame seeds are protected by a capsule which only bursts when the seeds are completely ripe. This is called dehiscence. The dehiscence time tends to vary, so farmers cut plants by hand and place them together in an upright position to continue ripening until all the capsules have opened. The discovery of an indehiscent mutant (analogous to nonshattering domestic grains) by Langham in 1943 began the work towards development of a high-yielding, dehiscence-resistant variety. Although researchers have made significant progress in sesame breeding, harvest losses due to dehiscence continue to limit domestic US production. Tanzania remains the largest producer of sesame oil and also dominates the global consumption of this product. The African and Asian regions constitute the fastest developing sesame oil markets. The steady growth in demand being observed here is in line with rising household income figures and urbanization, as well as an increase in the use of sesame oil for food products and Asian dishes. While some manufacturers will further refine sesame oil through solvent extraction, neutralization and bleaching in order to improve its cosmetic aspects, sesame oil derived from quality seeds already possesses a pleasant taste and does not require further purification before it can be consumed. Many consumers prefer unrefined sesame oil due to their belief that the refining process removes important nutrients. Flavour, which was traditionally an important attribute, was best in oils produced from mild crushing. Sesame oil is one of the more stable natural oils, but can still benefit from refrigeration and limited exposure to light and high temperatures during extraction, processing and storage in order to minimize nutrient loss through oxidation and rancidity. Storage in amber-colored bottles can help to minimize light exposure. Sesame oil is a polyunsaturated (PUFA) semi-drying oil. Commercial sesame oil varies in colour from light to deep reddish-yellow depending on the colour of the seed processed and the method of milling. Provided the oil is milled from well-cleaned seed, it can be refined and bleached easily to yield a light- coloured limpid oil. Sesame oil is rich in oleic and linoleic acids, which together account for 85% of the total fatty acids. Sesame oil has a relatively high percentage of unsaponifiable matter (1.5-2.3%). In India and in some other European countries it is obligatory to add sesame oil (5-10%) to margarine and generally to hydrogenated vegetable fats which are commonly used as adulterants for butter or ghee. =Sesame seed market= The market for sesame oil is mainly located in Asia and the Middle East where the use of domestically produced sesame oil has been a tradition for centuries. About 65 percent of the annual US sesame crop is processed into oil and 35 percent is used in food. =Varieties= There are many variations in the colour of sesame oil: cold-pressed sesame oil is pale yellow, while Indian sesame oil (gingelly or til oil) is golden, and East Asian sesame oils are commonly a dark brown colour. This dark colour and flavour are derived from roasted/toasted sesame seeds. Cold-pressed sesame oil has a different flavour than the toasted oil, since it is produced directly from raw, rather than toasted, seeds. Sesame oil is traded in any of the forms described above: Cold-pressed sesame oil is available in Western health shops. Unroasted (but not necessarily cold-pressed) sesame oil is commonly used for cooking in South India, the Middle East, halal markets and East Asian countries. Nutrients The only essential nutrient having significant content in sesame oil is vitamin K, providing 17% of the Daily Value per 100 grams (ml) consumed supplying 884 calories (table). For fats, sesame oil is approximately equal in monounsaturated fat (oleic acid, 40% of total) and polyunsaturated fat (linoleic acid, 42% of total), together accounting for 80% of the total fat content (table). The remaining oil content is primarily the saturated fat, palmitic acid (about 9% of total, USDA table). Uses =Cooking= One type of sesame oil, a pale yellow liquid with a pleasant grain-like odor and somewhat nutty taste, is used as frying oil. A second type of oil, amber- colored and aromatic, is made from pressed and toasted sesame seeds and is used as a flavoring agent in the final stages of cooking. Despite sesame oil's high proportion (41%) of polyunsaturated (omega-6) fatty acids, it is least prone, among cooking oils with high smoke points, to turn rancid when kept in the open. This is due to the natural antioxidants, such as sesamol, present in the oil. Light sesame oil has a high smoke point and is suitable for deep- frying, while dark sesame oil (from roasted sesame seeds) has a slightly lower smoke point and is unsuitable for deep-frying. Instead it can be used for the stir frying of meats or vegetables, saut√©ing, or for the making of an omelette. Sesame oil is most popular in Asia, especially in Korea, China, and the South Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, where its widespread use is similar to that of olive oil in the Mediterranean. * East Asian cuisines often use roasted sesame oil for seasoning. * The Chinese use sesame oil in the preparation of meals. * In Japan, rƒÅyu is a paste made of chili-sesame oil seasoning and used as a spicy topping on various foods, or mixed with vinegar and soy sauce and used as a dip. * In South India, before the advent of modern refined oils produced on a large scale, sesame oil was used traditionally for curries and gravies. It continues to be used, particularly in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, mixed with foods that are hot and spicy as it neutralizes the heat. It is often mixed in with a special spice powder that accompanies idli and dosa as well as rice mixed with spice powders (such as paruppu podi). =Traditional uses= In Ayurvedic medicine, sesame oil (til t√©l) is used for massaging as it is believed to rid the body of heat due to its viscous nature upon rubbing. =Industrial uses= In industry, sesame oil may be used as *a solvent in injected drugs or intravenous drip solutions, *a cosmetics carrier oil, *coating stored grains to prevent weevil attacks. The oil also has synergy with some insecticides. Low-grade oil is used locally in soaps, paints, lubricants, and illuminants.  Allergy  As with numerous seed and nut foods, sesame oil may produce an allergic reaction, although the incidence of this effect is rare at approximately 0.1% of the population. Reports of sesame allergy are growing in developed countries during the 21st century, with the allergic mechanism from oil exposure expressed as contact dermatitis, possibly resulting from hypersensitivity to lignin-like compounds. Research Although preliminary research on the potential effect of sesame oil on inflammation and atherosclerosis has been conducted, as of 2017, there was insufficient quality of the studies to allow any conclusions.

The 2000 programme was updated in March 2006 following a review launched in September 2004. In 2008, the UK was the world's 9th greatest producer of man-made carbon emissions, producing around 1.8% of the global total generated from fossil fuels. Aim and progress Global mean surface temperatures 1856 to 2007 The aims of the programme are not only to cut all greenhouse gas emissions by the agreed 12.5% from 1990 levels in the period 2008 to 2012 (the international Kyoto commitment), but to go beyond this by cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by 2010. When the original programme was published in 2000, it confirmed that UK emissions were already forecast to be around 15% lower by 2010. As of March 2006, government projections were in line with the official energy policy of the United Kingdom) so that, by 2010, the UK will have reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by about 15-18% below 1990 levels, thus missing the government's internal target but achieving its Kyoto Protocol target, with a projected reduction of emissions from the basket of all greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide) of about 23-25% from 1990 levels. 2000 Climate Change Programme The stated strategies of the 2000 programme were to: *Improve business‚Äô use of energy, stimulate investment and cut costs; *Stimulate new, more efficient sources of power generation; *Cut emissions from the transport sector; *Promote better energy efficiency in the domestic sector, saving householders money; *Improve the energy efficiency requirements of the building regulations; *Continue cutting emissions from agriculture; *Ensure the public sector took a leading role. Government actions The following are among the actions taken to implement the strategy: =Climate Change Act= On 26 November 2008, after cross-party pressure over several years, led by environmental groups, the Climate Change Act became law. The Act puts in place a framework to achieve a mandatory 80% cut in the UK's carbon emissions by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), with an intermediate target of between 34% by 2020 which would have risen in the event of a strong deal at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. =Renewables Obligation= Introduced on 1 April 2002, the Renewables Obligation requires all electricity suppliers who supply electricity to end consumers to supply a set portion of their electricity from eligible renewables sources; a proportion that will increase each year until 2015 from a 3% requirement in 2002‚Äì2003, via 10.4% in 2010-2012 up to 15.4% by 2015‚Äì2016. The UK Government announced in the 2006 Energy Review an additional target of 20% by 2020‚Äì21. For each eligible megawatt hour of renewable energy generated, a tradable certificate called a renewables obligation certificate(ROC) is issued by OFGEM. On or before 31 September following the RO year (1 Apr - 31 Mar) Suppliers can meet their Renewables Obligation by: *acquiring and redeeming ROCs, *paying a buy-out price equivalent to ¬£33.24/megawatt hour in 2006/07 and rising each year with retail price index;or *a combination of redeeming ROCs and paying the buy-out price. When a supplier meets all or part of its obligation by paying the buy- out price for each MWh of its obligation not discharged by the redemption of ROCs, the money is put into a holding account called the buy-out fund. The buy-out fund is recycled before 1 November to those electricity suppliers who presented ROCs against their Renewables Obligation. This 'recycling' is distributed equally for each ROC redeemed, those suppliers who did not redeem any ROCs will receive no 'recycling' from the buy-out fund. The renewables obligation also makes requirements about how the electricity can be generated. An example is that the co-firing of biomass with coal is to be phased out - and will not be eligible for Renewable Obligation Certificates after 2016 (although the government has announced its intention to revisit the co-firing rules as part of the 2006 Energy Review). The renewables transport fuel obligation is a separate law, which although is not in force yet, is set to become law. It would require bio-ethanol and bio-diesel to be added to road fuel, up to a limit of 2 or 5.75%. The land required for this would be considerable. It has been estimated (by the NFU) that the biomass could be grown by using all of the UK's net wheat exports, and growing wheat on 1,200 square kilometres of land. =Housing and community grants= Grants to assist with the installation of renewable energy sources in domestic properties and for community groups were made available through the Clear Skies organisation, and the Major Photovoltaics Demonstration programme. In 2006 these were replaced by the Low Carbon Buildings Programme (LCBP). =CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme= The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme is a mandatory cap and trade scheme, announced in May 2007, that will apply to large non energy- intensive organisations in the public and private sectors, including hotel chains, supermarkets, banks, central government and large Local Authorities. It is anticipated that the scheme will have cut carbon emissions by 1.2 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2020.Action in the UK - Carbon Reduction Commitment , DEFRA, published 2007-05-23, accessed 2007-05-23 The CRC scheme will apply to organisations that have a mandatory half-hourly metered electricity consumption greater than 6,000 MWh per year. This roughly equates to an electricity bill above ¬£500,000 (US$1,000,000), although it would apply to emissions from direct energy use as well as electricity purchased.2007 Energy White Paper: Meeting the Energy Challenge , Department of Trade and Industry, published 2007-05-23, accessed 2007-05-25 =The Green Deal= The Green Deal is a policy to encourage energy efficiency improvements in the UK's building stock. It will be financed through loans attached to the energy bills of the improved properties - The green deal was dropped by government in 2015. =Electricity Market Reform= Electricity Market Reform is a UK programme seeking to decarbonise electricity generation in the UK by providing low carbon generators guaranteed income through a contract for difference arrangement. It is made up of 2 mechanisms: Contract for Difference (CfD) and the Capacity Market (CM). Nottingham Declaration Although not part of the central government programme, in local government, over 300 councils have signed up to the Nottingham Declaration, launched on 25 October 2000, committing them to work towards reducing emissions.

It comprises a confederation of four hap≈´ (subtribes) interconnected both by ancestry and by association over time: Te Uri-o-Hau, Te Roroa, Te Tao≈´, and NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua-o-≈årƒÅkei. The four hap≈´ can act together or separately as independent tribes. NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua's territory or rohe is traditionally expressed as, \\"TƒÅmaki ki Maunganui i te Tai Hauauru\\" and \\"TƒÅmaki ki Manaia i te Rawhiti\\". The northern boundary is expressed as, \\"Manaia titiro ki Whatitiri, Whatitiri titiro ki Tutamoe, Tutamoe titiro ki Maunganui\\". The southern boundary is expressed as, \\"Te awa o TƒÅmaki\\". The area runs from TƒÅmaki River in the south to Maunganui Bluff (at the northern end of Aranga Beach on the west coast) in the north, and to Whangarei Harbour on the east coast. By the time of European settlement in New Zealand, NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua's territory was around the Kaipara Harbour and stretching south to , the site of present-day Auckland.  History  NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua descends from the ancestor Tuputupuwhenua (also known as Tumutumuwhenua). The iwi traces its arrival in New Zealand to the MƒÅhuhu-ki-te-rangi canoe, which landed north of the Kaipara Harbour. They also descend from ancestors who migrated from Muriwhenua in the Far North and intermarried with the tribes in NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua's territory. Rivalry with NgƒÅpuhi escalated in the early 19th century when NgƒÅpuhi acquired muskets. NgƒÅpuhi attacked NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua in 1807 or 1808 in the battle of Moremonui north of Dargaville - probably the occasion of the first use of firearms in MƒÅori warfare. NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua overcame the NgƒÅpuhi warriors with hand weapons while NgƒÅpuhi were reloading their muskets, winning a decisive victory over the attackers. NgƒÅpuhi, led by Hongi Hika, exacted revenge in 1825 when they defeated NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua in the battle of Te Ika a Ranganui near Kaiwaka. On 20 March 1840 in the Manukau Harbour area where NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua farmed, paramount chief ƒÄpihai Te Kawau signed Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the Treaty of Waitangi. NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua sought British protection from NgƒÅpuhi as well as a reciprocal relationship with the Crown and the Church. Soon after signing the Treaty, Te Kawau offered land on the WaitematƒÅ Harbour to William Hobson, the new Governor of New Zealand, for his new capital. Hobson took up the offer and moved the capital of New Zealand to , naming the settlement Auckland. NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua came to national prominence in the 1970s in a dispute over vacant land at Bastion Point, a little way east of the Auckland city centre, adjoining the suburb of Orakei. The land, which the New Zealand government had acquired cheaply for public works many decades before, largely reverted to the tribe after a long occupation and passive resistance. Governance Te Runanga o NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua has a mandate, recognised by the New Zealand Government, to negotiate Treaty of Waitangi settlements for NgƒÅti Whatua. It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the MƒÅori Fisheries Act, and an Iwi Aquaculture Organisation in the MƒÅori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act. It represents NgƒÅti Whatua as an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act and is a T≈´hono organisation. The Runanga is a MƒÅori Trust Board governed by 11 trustees from 5 takiwƒÅ or districts: 1 trustee from ≈årakei, 2 from South Kaipara, 3 from Otamatea, 1 from Whangarei and 4 from Northern Wairoa. As of 2016, the chairperson of the trust is Russell Kemp, the support services manager is Pat Murray, and the trust is based in Whangarei. The iwi has interest in the territory of Northland Regional Council, Auckland Council, Kaipara District Council and Whangarei District Council.

The 740 film recorder contained digital to analog converters and a 7-inch, high precision, electrostatic CRT. The raster size was 1,024 by 1,024, but only 256 resolved spots could be displayed on a vertical or horizontal line. Points could be displayed in one of two intensities, and a line could be drawn from a point, vertically or horizontally, to the edge of the display to form an axis. Each point to be displayed was stored in a single 36 bit word, with 10 bits each for the X and Y coordinates, and 3 control bits, one to set either high or low intensity and two to indicate that an X or Y axis is to be drawn starting from the given point. If both the X and Y axis bits were set, a 45 degree line was drawn. The 740's CRT used a short persistence P11 phosphor. The film used was 35 mm and was stored in a magazine that could hold up to 100 feet. ASA 200 speed film was recommended. The film could be advanced under computer control.

Early life Mayhew was born at Martha's Vineyard, being fifth in descent from Thomas Mayhew (1592‚Äì1682), an early settler and the grantee (1641) of Martha's Vineyard and adjacent islands. Thomas Mayhew, Jr. (1622‚Äì1657), his son John (d. 1689) and John's son, Experience Mayhew (1673‚Äì1758), were active missionaries among the Indians of Marthas Vineyard and the vicinity. Mayhew graduated from Harvard College in 1744 and in 1749 received the degree of D.D. from the University of Aberdeen. So liberal were his theological views that when he was to be ordained minister of the West Church in Boston in 1747, only two ministers attended the first council called for the ordination, and it was necessary to summon a second council. Mayhew's preaching made his church practically the first Unitarian Congregational church in New England, though it was never officially Unitarian. He preached the strict unity of God, the subordinate nature of Christ, and salvation by character. Political views In politics, Mayhew bitterly opposed the Stamp Act, and urged the necessity of colonial union (or communion) to secure colonial liberties. He was famous, in part, for his 1750 and 1754 election sermons espousing American rights ‚Äî the cause of liberty and the right and duty to resist tyranny; other famous sermons included \\"The Snare Broken,\\" 1766. His sermons and writings were a powerful influence in the development of the movement for liberty and independence. Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission The extent of his political feeling can be seen in his Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission (complete text), a sermon delivered on the 100th anniversary of the execution of Charles I (January 30, 1649/50). Taking vigorous issue with recent efforts to portray Charles as a martyred monarch, Mayhew began with observations on the antiquity of English liberties. The English constitution, he asserted, ‚Äúis originally and essentially free.‚Äù Roman sources, such as the reliable Tacitus, made it clear that ‚Äúthe ancient Britons ‚Ä¶ were extremely jealous of their liberties.‚Äù England‚Äôs monarchs originally held their throne ‚Äúsolely by grant of parliament,‚Äù so the ancient English kings ruled ‚Äúby the voluntary consent of the people.‚Äù After forty pages of such historical discourse, Mayhew reached his major point: the essential rightness of the execution of an English king when he too greatly infringed upon British liberties. The vigor of Mayhew‚Äôs sermon established his reputation. It was published not only in Boston, but also in London in 1752 and again in 1767. In Boston, John Adams remembered long afterward that Mayhew‚Äôs sermon, ‚Äúwas read by everybody.‚Äù Some would say later that this sermon was the first volley of the American Revolution, setting forth the intellectual and scriptural justification for rebellion against the Crown. Seal of the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts In 1763 he turned his attention to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a branch of the Church of England established \\"to send priests and schoolteachers to America to help provide the Church's ministry to the colonists\\". His Observations on the Charter and Conduct of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts was published in Boston and London and raised considerable opposition in England and America; Thomas Secker, then archbishop of Canterbury, wrote an Answer the following year. In 1765, with the provocation of the Stamp Act fresh, Mayhew delivered another rousing sermon on the virtues of liberty and the iniquity of tyranny. The essence of slavery, he announced, consists in subjection to others‚Äî‚Äúwhether many, few, or but one, it matters not.‚Äù The day after his sermon, a Boston mob attacked Chief Justice Thomas Hutchinson‚Äôs house, and many thought Mayhew was responsible. Mayhew was Dudleian lecturer at Harvard in 1765. He died July 1766. A quarter century after his death, the following lines were delivered at the Harvard commencement address of 1792: While Britain claim'd by laws our rights to lead, And faith was fetter'd by a bigot's creed. Then mental freedom first her power display'd and call'd a MAYHEW to religion's aid. For this great truth, he boldly led the van, That private judgment was the right of man.

The term was coined by Hermann Ebbinghaus through studies he performed on himself, and refers to the finding that recall accuracy varies as a function of an item's position within a study list. When asked to recall a list of items in any order (free recall), people tend to begin recall with the end of the list, recalling those items best (the recency effect). Among earlier list items, the first few items are recalled more frequently than the middle items (the primacy effect).Deese and Kaufman (1957) Serial effects in recall of unorganized and sequentially organized verbal material, J Exp Psychol. 1957 Sep;54(3):180-7 One suggested reason for the primacy effect is that the initial items presented are most effectively stored in dormant memory because of the greater amount of processing devoted to them. (The first list item can be rehearsed by itself; the second must be rehearsed along with the first, the third along with the first and second, and so on.) The primacy effect is reduced when items are presented quickly and is enhanced when presented slowly (factors that reduce and enhance processing of each item and thus permanent storage). Longer presentation lists have been found to reduce the primacy effect. One theorised reason for the recency effect is that these items are still present in activated memory when recall is solicited. Items that benefit from neither (the middle items) are recalled most poorly. An additional explanation for the recency effect is related to temporal context: if tested immediately after rehearsal, the current temporal context can serve as a retrieval cue, which would predict more recent items to have a higher likelihood of recall than items that were studied in a different temporal context (earlier in the list). The recency effect is reduced when an interfering task is given. Intervening tasks involve working memory, as the distractor activity, if exceeding 15 to 30 seconds in duration, can cancel out the recency effect. Additionally, if recall comes immediately after test, the recency effect is consistent regardless of the length of the studied list, or presentation rate. Amnesiacs with poor ability to form permanent long-term memories do not show a primacy effect, but do show a recency effect if recall comes immediately after study. People with Alzheimer's disease exhibit a reduced primacy effect but do not produce a recency effect in recall. Primacy effect The primacy effect, in psychology and sociology, is a cognitive bias that results in a subject recalling primary information presented better than information presented later on. For example, a subject who reads a sufficiently long list of words is more likely to remember words toward the beginning than words in the middle. Many researchers tried to explain this phenomenon through free recall [null tests]. Coluccia, Gamboz, and Brandimonte (2011) explain free recall as participants try to remember information without any prompting. In some experiments in the late 20th century it was noted that participants who knew that they were going to be tested on a list presented to them would rehearse items: as items were presented, the participants would repeat those items to themselves and as new items were presented, the participants would continue to rehearse previous items along with the newer items. It was demonstrated that the primacy effect had a greater influence on recall when there was more time between presentation of items so that participants would have a greater chance to rehearse previous (prime) items. Overt rehearsal was a technique that was meant to test participants' rehearsal patterns. In an experiment using this technique, participants were asked to recite out loud the items that come to mind. In this way, the experimenter was able to see that participants would repeat earlier items more than items in the middle of the list, thus rehearsing them more frequently and having a better recall of the prime items than the middle items later on. In another experiment, by Brodie and Murdock, the recency effect was found to be partially responsible for the primacy effect. In their experiment, they also used the overt-rehearsal technique and found that in addition to rehearsing earlier items more than later items, participants were rehearsing earlier items later on in the list. In this way, earlier items were closer to the test period by way of rehearsal and could be partially explained by the recency effect. In 2013, a study showed that primacy effect is also prominent in decision making based on experience in a repeated-choice paradigm, a learning process also known as operant conditioning. The authors showed that importance attached to the value of the first reward on subsequent behaviour, a phenomenon they denoted as outcome primacy. In another study, participants received one of two sentences. For example, one may be given \\"Steve is smart, diligent, critical, impulsive, and jealous.\\" and the other \\"Steve is jealous, impulsive, critical, diligent, and smart.\\" These two sentences contain the same information. The first one suggests positive trait at the beginning while the second one has negative traits. Researchers found that the subjects evaluated Steve more positively when given the first sentence, compared with the second one. Recency effect Two traditional classes of theories explain the recency effect. =Dual-store models= These models postulate that study items listed last are retrieved from a highly accessible short-term buffer, i.e. the short-term store (STS) in human memory. This allows items that are recently studied to have an advantage over those that were studied earlier, as earlier study items have to be retrieved with greater effort from one‚Äôs long-term memory store (LTS). An important prediction of such models is that the presentation of a distraction, for example solving arithmetic problems for 10‚Äì30 seconds, during the retention period (the time between list presentation and test) attenuates the recency effect. Since the STS has limited capacity, the distraction displaces later study list items from the STS so that at test, these items can only be retrieved from the LTS, and have lost their earlier advantage of being more easily retrieved from the short-term buffer. As such, dual-store models successfully account for both the recency effect in immediate recall tasks, and the attenuation of such an effect in the delayed free recall task. A major problem with this model, however, is that it cannot predict the long-term recency effect observed in delayed recall, when a distraction intervenes between each study item during the interstimulus interval (continuous distractor task).Bjork & Whitten (1974). Recency sensitive retrieval processes in long-term free recall, Cognitive Psychology, 6, 173‚Äì189. Since the distraction is still present after the last study item, it should displace the study item from STS such that the recency effect is attenuated. The existence of this long-term recency effect thus raises the possibility that immediate and long-term recency effects share a common mechanism. =Single-store models= According to single-store theories, a single mechanism is responsible for serial-position effects. A first type of model is based on relative temporal distinctiveness, in which the time lag between the study of each list item and the test determines the relative competitiveness of an item‚Äôs memory trace at retrieval. In this model, end-of-list items are thought to be more distinct, and hence more easily retrieved. Another type of model is based on contextual variability, which postulates that retrieval of items from memory is cued not only based on one‚Äôs mental representation of the study item itself, but also of the study context. Since context varies and increasingly changes with time, on an immediate free-recall test, when memory items compete for retrieval, more recently studied items will have more similar encoding contexts to the test context, and are more likely to be recalled. Outside immediate free recall, these models can also predict the presence or absence of the recency effect in delayed free recall and continual-distractor free- recall conditions. Under delayed recall conditions, the test context would have drifted away with increasing retention interval, leading to attenuated recency effect. Under continual distractor recall conditions, while increased interpresentation intervals reduce the similarities between study context and test context, the relative similarities among items remains unchanged. As long as the recall process is competitive, recent items will win out, so a recency effect is observed. =Ratio rule= Overall, an important empirical observation regarding the recency effect is that it is not the absolute duration of retention intervals (RI, the time between end of study and test period) or of inter-presentation intervals (IPI, the time between different study items) that matters. Rather, the amount of recency is determined by the ratio of RI to IPI (the ratio rule). As a result, as long as this ratio is fixed, recency will be observed regardless of the absolute values of intervals, so that recency can be observed at all time scales, a phenomenon known as time-scale invariance. This contradicts dual-store models, which assume that recency depends on the size of STS, and the rule governing the displacement of items in the STS. Potential explanations either then explain the recency effect as occurring through a single, same mechanism, or re- explain it through a different type of model that postulates two different mechanisms for immediate and long-term recency effects. One such explanation is provided by Davelaar et al. (2005), who argue that there are dissociations between immediate and long-term recency phenomena that cannot be explained by a single-component memory model, and who argues for the existence of a STS that explains immediate recency, and a second mechanism based on contextual drift that explains long-term recency. Related effects In 1977, William Crano decided to outline a study to further the previous conclusions on the nature of order effects, in particular those of primacy vs. recency, which were said to be unambiguous and opposed in their predictions. The specifics tested by Crano were: ;Change of meaning hypothesis: The items on the beginning of a list establish a theme that the participants expect the rest of the list to fall into. The participant modified the meaning of some of the words on the list to fit with the expectation he or she established. Watkins and Peynicioglu (1984) explain this as participants changing the meaning of words, deviating from the established theme, to reduce the amount of deviation in the information presented. ;Inconsistency discounting: Participants would disregard information that was not consistent with previous items presented to them. In other words, discounting involves thinking of inconsistent information as having less value than information that is consistent with other information presented (Devine & Ostrom, 1985). ;Attention decrement hypothesis: Information presented first has a greater influence on participants than information that is presented later, causing a primacy effect to occur, even if the information is consistent. Steiner and Rain (1989) explain people pay more attention to information presented at the beginning, but progressively pay less attention to the information presented to them. The primacy effect occurs because participants pay attention to the beginning information and ignore the information presented later. On the other hand, if participants are in a situation where they have to continuously pay attention to information, a recency effect may occur. The continuity effect or lag-recency effect predicts that having made a successful recall, the next recalled item is less likely to come from a remote serial position, rather than a nearby serial position (Kahana, Howard, Zaromb & Wingfiend, 2002). The difference between the two items' serial position is referred to as serial- position lag. Another factor, called the conditional-response probability, is the likelihood of recalling a certain serial-position lag. A graph of serial- position lag versus conditional response probability reveals that the next item recalled minimizes absolute lag, with a higher likelihood for the adjacent than the previous one.

History On the official formation of the AOF began and by September was largely complete. By the end of 1917 the AOF comprised the battleship Chesme, the cruisers Askold and Varyag, 6 destroyers, 3 submarines and other ships. The AOF's operational zone included the Barents Sea - from the Norwegian border to the Kara Gates - including the White Sea. Its mission was to secure uninterrupted the sea lines of communications connecting Russia with its Entente allies. After Bolshevik Russia's withdrawal from World War I in March 1918, the flotilla comprised approximately 90 combatant and auxiliary ships. In August 1918 Allied interventionist forces and the White Army captured the best ships of the AOF. The rest of the ships were intentionally put out of commission or destroyed.

Reining is also considered to be a lot like figure skating. All work is done at the lope (a slow, relaxed version of the horse gait more commonly known worldwide as the canter), or the gallop (the fastest of the horse gaits). Originating from working cattle, reining is often described as a Western form of dressage riding, as it requires the horse to be responsive and in tune with its rider, whose aids should not be easily seen, and judges the horse on its ability to perform a set pattern of movements. The horse should be willingly guided or controlled with little or no apparent resistance and dictated to completely. A horse that pins his ears, conveying a threat to his rider, refuses to go forward, runs sideways, bounces his rear, wrings his tail in irritation or displays an overall poor attitude is not being guided willingly, and is judged accordingly. Origins Throughout the history of the Americas, dating back to the earliest Spanish settlers in what today is Mexico and the Southwestern United States, including Texas and California, ranchers needed to manage cattle from horseback. Cattle were moved, branded, doctored, sorted, and herded, often on open range without the benefit of fences, barns or other means of holding the animals. A good cowboy needed a quick and nimble horse, one that could change directions quickly, stop \\"on a dime,\\" and sprint after an errant cow. The horse needed to be controlled mostly by legs and weight, ridden with only one hand and a light touch on the reins, so that the cowboy's attention could also be on tasks that could include handling a lariat (to rope cattle), opening a gate, or simply waving a hand, hat or rope to move along a reluctant herd animal. Informal demonstrations of these ideal characteristics amongst ranch cowboys and vaqueros evolved into the sport of reining, as well as the related events of cutting and working cow horse as well as several other horse show classes. Other nations with traditions of herding livestock on vast areas, such as Australia and Argentina, developed similar traditions that have blended into the sport as it has expanded worldwide. Movements Circles are performed at speed The reining pattern includes an average of eight to twelve movements which must be executed by the horse. Patterns require the following movements: *Circles: the horse must perform large, fast circles at a near-gallop and smaller, slow circles at a lope. They should be perfectly round, with the rider dictating the pace of the horse. There should be an easily seen change of speed as the rider transitions from the large, fast to the small, slow circles. Most circles incorporate changes of direction that require a flying change of lead. *Flying lead change: the horse changes its leading front and hind legs at the lope mid-stride, during the suspension phase of the gait. The horse should not break gait nor change speed. It can be used for as turning and direction. While completing a change at speed can improve one's score, precision is the most important factor in judging: A horse taking more than one stride to complete the change, or a horse that changes early, late, or that changes only the front feet and not the hind feet will be penalized. *Rundown: the horse gallops or \\"runs\\" along the long side of the arena, at least from the fence or rail. A rundown is a required movement prior to a sliding stop and a rollback to the designated direction (either towards the judge or towards the nearest wall depending on the pattern). *Sliding Stop: the horse accelerates to a gallop and then suddenly comes to a complete halt, planting its hind feet in the footing and allowing its hind feet to slide several feet, while continuing to let its front feet \\"walk\\" forward. The back should be raised upward and hindquarters come well underneath. A particularly powerful stop may, depending on arena conditions, produce flying dirt and a cloud of dust. The movement should finish in a straight line, and the horse's position should not change. This movement is a crowd favorite, along with spins (see below). The spin is one of the most difficult and crowd-pleasing maneuvers. *Back or Backup: the horse backs up quickly for at least . The horse must back in a perfectly straight line, stop when asked and hesitate a moment before the next movement. It is judged on how quick, smooth and straight the line is. *Rollback: the horse immediately, without hesitation, performs a 180-degree turn after halting from a sliding stop, and immediately goes forward again into a lope. The horse must turn on its hindquarters, bringing its hocks well under, and the motion should be continuous with no hesitation. *Spins or Turnarounds: beginning from a standstill, the horse spins 360 degrees or more (up to four and one-quarter full turns) in place around its stationary inside hind leg. The hind pivot foot remains in essentially the same location throughout the spin, though the horse will pick it up and put it down as it turns. Spins are judged on correctness, smoothness, and cadence. Speed adds to the difficulty and will improve the score of a correctly done spin. A pattern requires at least one set of spins in each direction. Horses must stop the spin in the designated place or be penalized for over or under spinning. The term Pivot is sometimes used to describe a turn on the hindquarters of up to 360 degrees where the horse has to keep a rear pivot foot stationary. In 4-H competition, pivots of 90, 180, or 360 degrees are sometimes used in pattern classes to introduce youth riders to reining concepts. *Pause or Hesitate: the horse is asked to stand still for a few seconds to \\"settle\\" between certain movements in the reining pattern, particularly after spins. Pauses are not judged as a movement per se, but a horse that is ill-mannered or behaves with impatience when asked to wait will be penalized. Scoring A proper sliding stop requires a horse to keep its head down, back rounded, hindquarters well underneath the body, and to \\"walk\\" with the front legs as the hind legs slide. Scoring is on the basis of zero (0) to infinity, and 70 is an average score for a horse that made no errors but also did not perform maneuvers with a higher level of difficulty. Points for each maneuver are added or subtracted by 1/2, 1, and 1-1/2 point increments for each of the 7 to 8 maneuvers in the designated pattern as follows: *-1 ¬Ω for an extremely poor execution *-1 for very poor *- ¬Ω for poor *0 for correct with no degree of difficulty *+1/2 for good execution *+1 for very good *+ 1 ¬Ω for excellent Each part of the pattern is judged on precision, smoothness, and finesse. The \\"degree of difficulty\\" for each maneuver, typically related to speed and agility, is also assessed. Increased speed increases the difficulty of most movements and the potential for a high score. For example, a perfectly executed fast spin will score higher than an equally perfectly executed slow one.NRHA rules for judging A score below 70 reflects deductions for poorly performed movements or penalties, a score above 70 reflects that some or all movements were above average. In addition to the scores for each maneuver, a large variety of penalties may be assessed for specific infractions. Penalties may range from a half-point (1/2) to five (5) points for each infraction, and in some cases a significant error may result in a zero score (0) for the run. Certain misbehaviors may incur penalty points beyond a poor score for a given maneuver. Significant errors, such as going off pattern or using illegal equipment, will result in a \\"zero score\\". Under NRHA rules, horses with a zero score cannot earn a placing or advance in a multi-go event, though they may be eligible for a payout if there is a small number of horses in the entire competition. Some sanctioning organizations other than NRHA may allow a horse in a small class to earn an award for last place. Major mistakes, such as failure to present the horse for an equipment check, a rider with illegal equipment or one who abuses the animal in specified ways, result in a \\"no score,\\" which prevents the horse from earning any award or payout, even if it is the only horse in the class. The horse Reining may be performed by any horse, but the Stock horse breeds, particularly the American Quarter Horse, dominate the field. The reining horse must be agile, quick, and very responsive to the rider's commands. Powerful hindquarters are required to hold position in a sliding stop or a rollback, excellent coordination is required for proper spins and flying lead changes. Correct leg conformation is essential, as the limbs and joints are often under considerable stress in competition. The horse must also have an excellent temperament to perform with both speed and precision. Equipment and attire Riders must use a western saddle. Spurs are allowed, but whips are not. Bridles are western-styled, without a noseband or cavesson. The bosal style hackamore is also allowed on \\"junior\\" horses. There are very strict rules about what types of bits and bosals are legal. For protection, horses usually wear splint boots on the cannons of their lower front legs as well as skid boots on their hind fetlocks. Bell boots, which wrap around the pastern and protect the hoof and coronary band, are also usually seen, sometimes only on the front feet, other times on all four feet. Polo wraps are also another form of protection that is used, this helps give support to the tendons and ligaments, and prevents bruising and irritation. These can be used on all four legs but if wrapped improperly can cause damage. Reining horses are usually fitted with special horseshoes on the hind feet called slide plates. Slide plates have wider bar steel and are smoother than regular horseshoes, with even the nail heads filed to be flush with the shoe. When the horse plants its hind feet for a sliding stop, the shoes allow the hind legs to slide along the ground with less resistance. Slide plates often have long trailers to help the horse's hind legs slide in a straight path as well as a rolled toe so that the front of the hoof does not accidentally catch the ground. Riders must wear a long-sleeved shirt, jeans, and cowboy boots. In most competitions, they also wear chaps. Gloves are optional. There has historically been less difference between men's and women's attire in reining than in most western events, though women's clothing is more influenced by fashion trends from Western pleasure competition, and thus women sometimes wear brighter colors, and are more apt to add a decorated jacket or vest, though usually not as flashy as in other horse show events. Wearing a certified equestrian helmet is permitted by some organizations,2011 Rules of Equine Canada, \\"Section K - Reining\\", pg 6, Equine Canada, retrieved September 5, 2011Reglamento Para Rienda, pg 36, Fedaraci√≥n Ecuestre Mexicana, retrieved September 5, 20112011 USEF Rule Book, \\"Reining Horse Division\\" Rule RN 101 retrieved September 5, 2011 though not commonly used.Ferguson v Ulmer, California Court of Appeals, 2003 WL 22512042, November 6, 2003, retrieved September 5, 2011 Bit and Hackamore rules Horses in most types of reining competition are required to perform in a curb bit. In most cases, riders with a horse in a curb must give all rein commands with only one hand.2011 AQHA handbook, rule 443.2007 NRHA handbook, p. 682007 USEF Rulebook, Western division. Riders may use both hands when a horse is ridden with a snaffle bit or a bosal hackamore. However, snaffles and hackamores ridden with both hands are usually limited only to special classes for horses between the ages of three and five years old. Most of the time, with the exception of \\"freestyle\\" classes, snaffle bit and hackamore horses do not compete directly against curb bit horses, though specific details vary depending on the particular sanctioning organization. 2007 NRHA handbook, p. 33.2007 USEF Rulebook, Western division. Allows very small classes to be combined, with some restrictions. In the last thirty years, the snaffle bit is the more common headgear used on younger horses, but in the past, the hackamore was more common. Some local or regional competitions offer a non- sanctioned \\"novice horse\\" division where horses of any age who have limited experience as reining horses can be ridden two-handed in a snaffle. Sometimes reining classes at breed shows are split into \\"junior horse\\" and \\"senior horse\\" divisions. Depending on the breed, Junior horses are either 3, 4 or 5 years old, and allowed to show in a snaffle or bosal. Senior horses who age out of the junior horse divisions at age six must be shown in a curb. The rules have changed over the years to reduce the stress on young horses. Junior horse divisions at one time were limited to horses that were only 3 and, sometimes, 4 years old. Expansion to age five parallels the standards set by the FEI and in endurance competitions, recognizing that the physical and mental development of most young horses is not considered complete until that time. Further, though many western stock horse breeds are started under saddle at the age of two, they generally are not physically or mentally ready to be entered into any type of reining competition at that age and in some cases are prohibited from entering any performance class until at least 2-1/2 years old.2011 AQHA handbook, rule 450. Both the NRHA and many breed associations offer snaffle bit futurities, usually for three-year-old horses, which pay very large purses. Reining competition Reining as a sport was first recognized by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) in 1949, and later by the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) in its western division and within a number of its breed divisions. The National Reining Horse Association (NRHA) was formed in 1966 in the United States, and developed a worldwide membership as well as standardized rules and patterns that significantly influenced other organizations, including the AQHA and USEF. The sport of reining became an FEI-recognized discipline in 2000, and FEI-sanctioned reining competitions are held across the world, including at the World Equestrian Games. In 2011, USA Reining was established to serve as the reining sport affiliate for the USEF and FEI competition structure in the United States. Individual divisions at a reining competition vary with the sanctioning organization. However, standard classes include those limited to junior or senior horses, to horses of a specific age (such as three-year- olds), classes for professional, \\"non-pro,\\" or amateur riders (those who do not work with horses for pay), youth riders of various ages, adult riders over age 40 or 50, as well as open events for all competitors. Classes may also be limited by the experience level of the horse or the rider. =National= In individual nations where reining competitions are held, national organizations usually oversee the sport. Reining classes can be held at a stand-alone competition just for reiners, or as one category within many different classes offered at a horse show. For example, in the United States, the National Reining Horse Association (NRHA) creates patterns and develops judging standards, sanctioning events open to all breeds. However, the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) and its reining discipline affiliate, USA Reining, are the national organizations overseeing FEI and high performance competition in the USA, but also work with the NRHA in non-FEI open reining competition sanctioned by the USEF,2011 USEF Rule Book, \\"Reining Horse Division\\" Rule RN 101 retrieved September 5, 2011 and in individual horse breed show reining competition governed by the USEF, such as Morgans or Arabians.2011 USEF Rule Book, \\"Arabian Horse Division\\" Rule AR 199 retrieved September 5, 20112011 USEF Rule Book, \\"Morgan Horse Division\\" Rule MO 176 retrieved September 5, 2011 Breed organizations that sanction their own shows, including those for Quarter Horses (AQHA), Appaloosas (ApHC),2010 Appaloosa Horse Club Rule Book, rule 502 and American Paint Horses (APHA) also cooperate with the NRHA. =International= International competitions are regulated by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Reining is growing in popularity around the world, including Europe and Australia. It was added as a part of the World Equestrian Games, beginning in 2002. =Freestyle= A competitor in Freestyle reining, dressed as Miss Piggy Freestyle reining allows a horse and rider team to incorporate reining movements into a three and one-half minute musical routine, akin to the KUR Freestyle competition in Dressage, but with elements that resemble the freestyle events in human competitions such as figure skating. Under NRHA rules, costumes are allowed, though not required; riders may ride with one, two or even no hands on any type of NRHA approved bit; props, within certain limits, are allowed; and the show management may allow special arena lighting. Freestyle reining competitions have no specific rules as to saddle, though humane equipment is required. Allowing \\"no hands\\" means that some competitors may perform without a bridle, which increases the difficulty of the movements. The rider must include a specified number of spins, stops and flying lead changes in a performance. Rollbacks, rein backs and dressage type maneuvers such as the half-pass may be added and scored. Competitors are judged on technical merit and artistic impression. At some competitions, an applause meter is added and may contribute to the artistic impression portion of the score.Freestyle reining rules.

It was an important catalyst to the end of Korean isolationism in the 19th century. After passing the Keupsa Gate without permission from the Koreans, the merchant ship was attacked and fought over for several days before finally being destroyed in Pyongyang.  Background  In the mid-19th century, the Great powers of Europe and the United States were eager to open up new trade in Asia beyond their presence in China. As early as 1832, discussions of opening up Korea to trade were made by the captain of , Edmund Roberts, yet in 1844 a draft by Congress was shelved due to lack of interest. Japan was opened up to trade when Commodore Matthew C. Perry sailed into Uraga Harbor near Edo on July 8, 1853, and (under the threat of force) Japan signed the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. The first contact between the U.S. and Korea was not hostile; several Americans who were shipwrecked in Korea in 1855 and 1866 were treated well and sent to China for repatriation back to their own countries.  Approach  Determined to open Korea for trade, General Sherman entered Korean waters with goods purchased from Tientsin. They departed Chefoo on August 9, 1866, and arrived on the coast of Korea on August 16, 1866.\\"Gojong-sillok\\" (Vol. 3) Upon arriving, the crew of General Sherman attempted to meet with Korean officials to begin negotiations for a trade treaty. The steamer reportedly carried a cargo of cotton, tin, and glass, and was heavily armed. Only five of the crew and passengers were non-Asian,\\"Corea the Hermit Kingdom\\" p.391. accessed August 24,2018 with the rest of the crew consisting of thirteen Chinese and three Malay sailors.\\"Corea the Hermit Kingdom\\" p.391. reports the Asian crew numbered 19 Chinese and Malayians. accessed August 24,2018 A Chinese shroff (money-changer) was also aboard. General Sherman, assisted by Chinese junks, entered the Taedong River on Korea's west coast, sailing towards Pyongyang. The ship stopped at the Keupsa Gate on the border between Pyongan and Hwanghae provinces. Yu Wautai, the captain of one of the Chinese junks, had 20 years of experience trading with Koreans.Rev. Thomas's letter dated 12 January 1866 published in Missionary Magazine July 1866 Local officials met Captain Page of General Sherman and communicated well enough to learn the ship was interested in trade. The Koreans refused all trade offers but agreed to provide the crew with food and provisions. Page was told to wait at the gate while higher level government officials were consulted; however, General Sherman continued further upriver and anchored west of Pyongyang. Due to the previous month's rains and the tides, the depth of the Taedong River was unusually high allowing the steamer to reach Pyongyang. Park Gyu-su (the governor of Pyongyang) sent his adjutant general, Yi Hyon-Ik, to provide the crew with food, but told the captain he should have stayed at the Keupsa Gate. He was again ordered to wait while the Korean ruler was consulted. At the time Korea was ruled by a regent, the Heungseon Daewongun, in the name of his minor son Gojong. Father Ridel, a French priest who later that year guided the French invasion party into Korea, told the westerners in China that the regent Daewongun had sent orders that General Sherman must leave immediately or all aboard would be killed.  Incident  The events that followed have been disputed. The ship's crew seized Adjutant-General Yi and his two deputies, who were attempting to pursue a small boat launched from General Sherman with six men aboard bound for the shore. According to Governor Park's report, another government official, Shin Tae-jung, tried to persuade the crew to release Yi Hyon-ik and his men but failed. Instead, General Sherman moved further upstream, firing its guns into the crowd, killing seven and wounding five before eventually anchoring at Hwang-gang-jung (House of Yellow River). Five men then launched a second boat and navigated north of Pyongyang to determine the river's depth. The citizens of Pyongyang gathered on the riverbank, shouting for the release of Yi Hyon-ik. A man in the boat (probably Robert J. Thomas, the only one who spoke Korean) replied they would answer if they were allowed inside Pyongyang city. The crowd responded by throwing stones at the small boat. Korean soldiers shot arrows and guns at the launch, which retreated back to the ship. The Koreans sent a rescue party and managed to free Yi, but his deputies (Yoo Soon-won and Park Chi-young) were killed. General Sherman eventually turned back and sailed downstream until she ran aground into Yang-Gak, an island across from Pyongyang. The fighting continued for four days, after which the Koreans resorted to fire boats, filled with wood, sulphur and saltpeter. The first two failed to inflict any damage, but the third set General Sherman ablaze. Unable to extinguish the flames, the crew jumped into the water. According to the Korean Official historical record, Gojong sillok, there were two survivors from the initial attack, Robert Thomas and Cho Neung-bong; however, they were beaten to death. In January 1867, , led by Captain Robert W. Schufeldt, attempted to investigate the demise of General Sherman, but bad weather turned her back. In the spring of 1868, the , under the helm of Captain John C. Febiger, reached the Taedong River's mouth and received an official letter acknowledging the death of all crewmen of General Sherman. Concern over this incident is often erroneously cited as a reason why the U.S. Navy conducted the 1871 Korea Campaign, which resulted in the death of about 300 Korean soldiers and three Americans, but official records at the time do not support this rationale.Empirical Research on the 1871 U.S. Military Action in Korea by Thomas Duvernay 2012 Five years later, Korea was forced to sign a trade treaty with Japan in a separate incident, and in 1882 finally signed a treaty with the United States promising to abide by international norms regarding the treatment of prisoners. These treaties ended several centuries of isolationism.  Disputed account  A plaque marking the sinking of General Sherman in Pyongyang The Koreans had demonstrated on several occasions that while they did not want to engage in trade with westerners, they would not harm them. It was already well known that two months prior to the General Sherman incident, an armed vessel captained by Ernst Oppert, a German, had visited Korea and made a similar demand for trade, had been refused by the Koreans, but had been treated well and returned to China safely.Ein verschlossenes Land. ‚Äì Brockhaus, Leipzig 1880 Oppert returned to Korea in Emperor, which steamed up the Han River near Seoul, on the same day that General Sherman left Chefoo.U.S. Diplomatic Correspondence, 1870 Surprise, an American ship, had recently been shipwrecked in Chulsan, in Pyong-an Province, on June 24, 1866. The crew was not harmed and was sent to China by Governor Park Gyu-su, the same official in charge during the General Sherman incident.the Study of Park Gyu-su by Kim Myong-ho 2008 Some Koreans have claimed that the real purpose of General Shermans voyage was to seek treasures buried in the royal tombs near Pyongyang. On board the ship was a Chinese inspector of gold and silver, whose presence led to conjecture that General Sherman was planning to loot precious metals from a king's tomb near Pyongyang.Yonggu Kim, Diplomatic History In China, it was believed that the royal coffins in the tombs of Pyongyang, where more than one dynasty of Korea lay buried, were made of solid gold, and after the departure of General Sherman to Korea, some westerners in China speculated that General Shermans expedition had something to do with these treasures.Corea, the Hermit Nation by William Elliot Griffis Robert Jermain Thomas, the ship's interpreter, had also asked a Korean undercover officer the whereabouts of a white pagoda, which is usually associated with worship.the Memoir of Park Gyu- Su. Additionally, the ship did not possess a manifest of the items listed for trade, leading some to point to an ulterior motive. Furthermore, the Koreans also believed the use of an armed metal-hull gunboat was suspicious in a mission simply for trade. Even among westerners residing in China, there were concerns regarding how heavily armed General Sherman was at the time. Beginning in the late 1960s, North Korea's government historians began to claim the attack on General Sherman was planned and led by Kim Hyong-jik, the father of North Korean president Kim Il-sung. The claim has no confirmation in historical records but is still being repeated in North Korean publications, including textbooks. In 2006, North Korea issued a postage stamp commemorating the sinking of the merchant vessel.New Stamps Issued The was formerly moored at what is believed to be the spot where the incident took place. In late 2012, however, the ship was relocated to the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum.USS General Sherman Incident  References   Further reading  * Richard F.

When the Ottomans exiled Fakhreddine to Tuscany, Italy in 1613, he entered an alliance with the Medicis. Upon his return to Lebanon in 1618, he began modernizing Lebanon. He developed a silk industry, upgraded olive-oil production, and brought with him numerous Italian engineers who began the construction of mansions and civil building throughout the country. The cities of Beirut and Sidon were especially built in the Italianate style. The Italianate, specifically, Tuscan, influence on architecture in Lebanon dates back to the Renaissance when Fakhreddine, the first Lebanese ruler who truly unified Mount Lebanon with its Mediterranean coast executed an ambitious plan to develop his country. The influence of these buildings, such as the ones in Deir el Qamar, influenced building in Lebanon for many centuries and continues to the present time. For example, streets like Rue Gouraud continues to have numerous, historic houses with Italianate influence. Buildings like the Nicolas Sursock mansion on Rue Sursock, which is today a major museum, attest to the continuous influence of Italianate architecture in Lebanon. =Literature= Khalil Gibran (April 1913) Khalil Gibran (1883‚Äì1931), who was born in Bsharri, is particularly known for his book The Prophet (1923), which has been translated into more than twenty different languages.The Hindu (5 January 2003).

Rising demand for Arabic music outside Western Asia has provided Lebanese artists with a small but significant global audience. However, widespread piracy continues to inhibit the music industry's growth. =Media= Lebanon is not only a regional center of media production but also the most liberal and free in the Arab world.Migliorino, p. 122 According to Press freedom's Reporters Without Borders, \\"the media have more freedom in Lebanon than in any other Arab country\\". Despite its small population and geographic size, Lebanon plays an influential role in the production of information in the Arab world and is \\"at the core of a regional media network with global implications\\". After independence, Beirut emerged as the epicenter of publishing in the Arab world, characterized by free and liberal media and literary scenes.Migliorino, p. 123 Lebanon's press became a huge industry despite the country's small size and has remained a haven for Arabic publishing. The establishment of modern printing presses and sophisticated book distribution channels made Beirut a regional publishing leader, and gave the Lebanese publishers a dominant role in Arab publishing.Anker, Jean. Libri: Volume 51 Lebanon hosts annually two important regional publishing events, the Beirut Book Fair and the Beirut Francophone Book Fair. Television in Lebanon was introduced in 1959, with the launch of two privately owned stations, CLT and T√©l√© Orient that merged in 1967 into T√©l√© Liban. Lebanon has ten national television channels, with most being affiliated or supported by certain political parties or alliances. Lebanon was one of the first countries in the Arabic-speaking world to introduce internet. Lebanese Photographers like Said Mhamad have become popular all across world because of Internet and social media. Beirut's newspapers were the first in the region to provide readers with web versions of their newspapers. By 1986, three newspapers from Lebanon were online, Al Anwar, Annahar, and Assafir, and by 2000, more than 200 websites provided news out of Lebanon. =Cinema= Cinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian, Roy Armes, was the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt's, that could amount to a national cinema. Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced over 500 films,Harabi, Najib (University of Applied Sciences, Northwestern Switzerland) Knowledge Intensive Industries: Four Case Studies of Creative Industries in Arab Countries , World Bank Project (May 2009) p. 16. some of which are: * West Beirut ‚Äì by Ziad Doueiri, released in 1998, received the Prix Fran√ßois Chalais at the Directors' fortnight of the Cannes Film Festival (1998) * Mabrouk Again ‚Äì by Hany Tamba, released in 2000 *The Kite‚Äì by Randa Chahal, released in 2003, received many prestigious awards including the Silver Lion, Prix de la paix- Gillo Pontecorvo and Prix de la Lanterne Magique at the Venice Film Festival (2003) * After Shave ‚Äì by Hany Tamba, released in 2005, received the 2006 French C√©sar Award for best foreign short film * Bosta ‚Äì by Philippe Aractingi, released in 2005 * Under the Bombs ‚Äì by Philippe Aractingi, released in 2006 * Caramel ‚Äì starring and directed by Nadine Labaki, released in 2007 * Where Do We Go Now? ‚Äì starring and directed by Nadine Labaki, released in 2011, received the Cadillac People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival (2011) *Capernaum ‚Äì written by Nadine Labaki, Jihad Hojaily and Michelle Keserwany, released in 2018, the film was selected as the Lebanese entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards. =Theatre= Lebanese theatre has its origin in passion plays. The musical plays of Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of modern Arab theatre. Some scholars like Abdulatif Shararah divided theatre in Lebanon into three phases: translations of European plays, Arab nationalism, and realism.Badawƒ´, Mu·∏•ammad Mu·π£·π≠af√°. Modern Arabic Literature = Cultural relations between Lebanon and Egypt = \\\\---- The cultural relations between Lebanon and Egypt is considered a unique kind of cultural historical relations, Because there is a considerable overlap between the Lebanese and Egyptian cultures, especially in the fields of literature, theater, cinema and journalism, all of them played an integral role towards each other especially in theater, cinema and journalism, that's what was confirmed by the Conference Egypt in the eyes of the Lebanese and which is Within the activities of the cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World .

Fashion Many Christians and most Muslims who live in the cities wear modern stylish clothes. In the countryside, women sometimes wear traditional colorful skirts and men wear a traditional sherwal (baggy trousers). Dress was historically Ottoman, but remains only as part of the folk culture. Today, almost all Lebanese wear modern clothing. Famous names in the Lebanese fashion industry include Elie Saab, Zuhair Murad, Darin Hachem, Reem Acra, and Rabih Kayrouz Holidays and festivals Beiteddine Palace, venue of the Beiteddine Festival Lebanon celebrates national holidays and both Christian and Muslim holidays. Christian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian Calendar and Julian Calendar. Maronites, Greek Orthodox, Catholics, Protestant, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar. Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al- Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham‚Äôs willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura. Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day. Music festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture. Among the most famous are Baalbeck International Festival, Byblos International Festival, Beiteddine International Festival, Broumana Festival, Batroun Festival, Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival. These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's Ministry of Tourism, Lebanon Hosts about 15 Concerts from International Performers Each Year Ranking Number one for Nightlife in the Middle east and 6th Worldwide. Cuisine An array of Lebanese cuisine. Lebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as Syria, Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus. The Lebanese national dishes are the kibbe, a meat pie made from finely minced lamb and burghul (cracked wheat), and the tabbouleh, a salad made from parsley, tomatoes, and burghul. The national beverage is arak, a strong anise-flavored liquor made from fermented grape juice. It is usually drunk with water and ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki. Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of mezze - small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled meat or fish. In general, meals are finished with Arabic coffee and fresh fruit, though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well. M'Juhdara, a thick stew of onions, rice, and lentils, is sometimes considered poor man's fare and is often eaten around Lent by people in the Lebanese diaspora. Beirut and its environs contain many restaurants of various national origins. At the same time, wine is growing in popularity and a number of vineyards currently exist in the Bekaa valley and elsewhere. Beer is also highly popular and Lebanon produces a number of local beers, of which almaza is perhaps the most popular. =Food in daily life= Lebanese cuisine is influenced by other Mediterranean cuisines. Pita bread is a staple. The Lebanese enjoy hummus (a chick pea dip), fool (a fava bean dip), and other bean dishes. Rice is nearly a staple and pasta is popular. Salted yogurt is common in many dishes. Red meat and chicken are common but are usually eaten as part of a dish. Eating in Lebanon is tied to family: people almost never eat alone. The Lebanese consider eating out a social and almost aesthetic experience. During Lent, Christians eat meatless dishes and at Saint Barbara, they eat a variety of wheat-based dishes. Lebanon sells fruits and vegetables to neighboring Arab countries, as well as to Italy, France, and the United States. Wine is produced in the Bekaa and exported to Europe. Society Lebanese society is similar to certain cultures of the Mediterranean as the country is uniquely diverse religiously .Davis, Craig S.

By comparison to most other Arab capitals, Beirut is more modern and more culturally liberal. Compared to Damascus, Cairo, and Baghdad, and especially in contrast to such cities as Riyadh, Beirut is more tolerant with regard to relations between men and women, and also with regard to homosexuality. Notwithstanding the persistence of traditional attitudes regarding the role of women, Lebanese women enjoy equal civil rights and attend institutions of higher education in large numbers (for example, women constituted 41 percent of the student body at the American University of Beirut in 1983). Although women in Lebanon have their own organizations, most exist as subordinate branches of the political parties. While gay sex does not enjoy wide acceptance, Beirut has a number of gay bars and nightclubs, in addition to five LGBT rights organizations, namely Helem, Arab Foundation for Equality (AFE), Nasawiya-Feminist Collecrive, Proud Lebanon, and Mosa√Øque.

The band was formed by Pete Doherty (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) during a hiatus from the Libertines. As of 2013 the band includes Mick Whitnall (lead guitar), Drew McConnell (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Adam Ficek (drums, percussion). Babyshambles have released three albums Down in Albion (2005), Shotter's Nation (2007) and Sequel to the Prequel (2013), three EPs and a number of singles. History = Early history and touring (2003-2005)= In mid-2003, Pete Doherty was banned from playing with the Libertines until he could overcome his substance abuse problems. As a response, Doherty formed an alternative band, and recruited former Libertine Steve Bedlow as vocalist. Initially, Doherty planned on calling his new band T'Libertines, because of the band's Yorkshire connection ‚Äì the line up of the band at the time consisted mainly of Yorkshiremen. On the night Babyshambles' first gig was scheduled to take place, Doherty was arrested for burgling Carl Bar√¢t's flat. After he was charged and released, his friend Dean Fragile organized a new gig at the Tap'n'Tin. The performance received mixed reviews. Doherty was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for his crime. His sentence was later reduced on appeal to two months. When he was released from prison, Doherty rejoined The Libertines and sidelined the Babyshambles project. However, he found time to record the band's first single \\"Babyshambles\\", which was released in April 2004 on High Society Records. The artwork was by Sophie Thunder. The single was limited to 2000 CDs and 1000 7\\" vinyl copies. In the early summer of 2004, Doherty once again found himself cast out of The Libertines because of his drug use. As a result, Doherty brought Babyshambles to the fore with Patrick Walden on guitar, Gemma Clarke on drums and Peter Perrett's two sons, Jamie and Peter Junior, on guitar and bass respectively. Doherty organised several gigs and the band began to gain respect in their own right, even though Doherty missed a number of appearances. The band's lineup underwent several changes before stabilizing during the late summer of 2004 with Doherty on vocals, Patrick Walden on guitar, Gemma Clarke on drums and Drew McConnell on bass. In September and October 2004, Babyshambles embarked on a British tour that culminated with two shows at the London Scala. Despite fears that Doherty's performance would not be consistent, the tour sold-out and received critical acclaim. The band's second single \\"Killamangiro\\" was released 29 November 2004 on Rough Trade Records, reaching number 8 on the UK singles chart. The band embarked on another tour in December 2004, among growing concerns regarding Doherty's drug dependence. During a gig in Blackpool, the band walked off the stage when it became clear that Doherty was too intoxicated to perform, and a riot broke out at the London Astoria after Doherty failed to appear, with 150-200 of the audience invading the stage and damaging the band's equipment, including the destruction of Gemma Clarke's drumkit, an incident that cast doubt over her desire to continue in the band. After finally stabilizing in late summer, Babyshambles' lineup underwent another change in January 2005. On 27 January 2005, drummer Gemma Clarke quit the band after disagreeing with their management. The ongoing heavy drug abuse of the band members, especially of frontman Doherty, and James Mullord's inability to do something about it, made her eventually leave the band. She was immediately replaced by Adam Ficek, who was once a band member of the White Sport alongside Patrick Walden. =Down in Albion (2005-2007)= In April and May 2005, Babyshambles spent several weeks in a recording studio in Wales working on their debut album with Mick Jones of the Clash, who had also worked with Doherty on the production of the Libertines' albums. The album, entitled Down in Albion, was released on 14 November 2005. It reached the Top 10 on the UK Albums Chart. The first single from the album, \\"Fuck Forever\\", had been released on 15 August, reaching number four on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, \\"Albion\\", was released on 28 November and reached number eight in the UK singles chart. Fellow English rock group Oasis had booked Babyshambles to support them on their UK tour in July 2005. However, Doherty was attending the birthday celebration of fashion designer Hedi Slimane with Kate Moss and was unable to arrange transport back to the UK in time for the band's first appearance. As a consequence Oasis cancelled Babyshambles' support for the rest of the tour. Several small gigs took place at the end of 2005 and 2006 Babyshambles announced four small club shows in London, Liverpool, Sheffield and Stoke in January 2006. To the surprise of his fans, the band performed without guitarist Patrick Walden, with Doherty on guitar instead. Walden returned for a gig in Cambridge on 23 January and a UK tour in February. He played his last gig with the band at the Shepherd's Bush Empire during that tour, and has not appeared with Babyshambles since. He has, however, appeared on stage independently and in the company of Drew McConnell and Seb Rochford, playing two Babyshambles songs which he co-wrote with Pete Doherty, in July 2007. In February 2006, Babyshambles won the Naomi Award for Worst Live Act, and were nominated for several NME awards. The band performed \\"Albion\\" at the NME Awards show, and Doherty won the \\"Sexiest Man\\" award. In August 2006, Babyshambles signed to major record label Parlophone for the release of an EP, and headlined the Get Loaded in the Park festival. The band released the limited edition single \\"Beg, Steal or Borrow\\", which was exclusively available to those who had attended the festival. A free copy of \\"The Blinding\\" was released in the street magazine The Big Issue. A cover version of the Clash song \\"Janie Jones\\" was released through B-Unique Records in October. The single was released to raise money for Joe Strummer's charity foundation Strummerville and features contributions from others bands such as Dirty Pretty Things, Larrikin Love, We Are Scientists, the Kooks, and Guillemots. This release marked the first time that Carl Bar√¢t and Pete Doherty had worked together since the Libertines parted, although they never met during the recording process. On 4 December 2006, The Blinding EP was released to critical acclaim. The release was promoted with music videos for \\"The Blinding\\" and \\"Love You But You're Green\\", and an acoustic performance of the latter on The Culture Show. The single was not eligible for the singles chart because it contained too many tracks; however, the band claimed on its MySpace page that it would have made number four in the Christmas Day 2006 UK chart had it been eligible. On 18 January 2007, it was announced that the band had signed a long-term record deal with Parlophone. The contract was reportedly for three albums. In Summer 2007, Babyshambles played Oxegen, Glastonbury Festival, the V Festival, T in the Park and Paredes de Coura Festival. =Shotter's Nation (2007-2010)= On 1 October 2007 Babyshambles released their second album Shotter's Nation. The track listing for the album was revealed on 23 July 2007 in the (p)review posted on Allan Jones' Editor's Diary Uncut.co.uk blog. The Stephen Street-produced record contains 12 tracks and features a guest appearance from Bert Jansch on the acoustic closer. Adam Ficek commented that Shotter's Nation is a \\"glossy picture\\" of where the band are at the moment. The first single from the album, \\"Delivery\\", was released on 17 September 2007, reaching number six in the UK Singles Chart after its first week on general sale. A week prior to the release, a 7-inch vinyl containing a demo version of the song and an interview with the band was released with NME magazine. In November 2007 Babyshambles played their first arena tour, taking in dates at the Newcastle Metro Radio Arena, MEN Arena in Manchester, the Nottingham Arena, Bournemouth International Centre, London's Wembley Arena, Brighton's Brighton Centre, and Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The second single from Shotter's Nation, \\"You Talk\\", was released on 3 December 2007. In January and February 2008, Babyshambles played their biggest European tour to date. Babyshambles are due to play at a lot of festivals this Spring and this Summer, especially in France. In June they played at Hove Festival in Norway. In August they headlined the RadioOne/NME Stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals. However, a large amount of their scheduled tours were cancelled due to Doherty's recent imprisonment. On 8 April, it was announced that Babyshambles was going to release A CD/DVD live untitled \\"Oh! What A Lovely Tour\\" on 2 June. The concert was recorded during the winter leg of the UK arena tour at the SECC Glasgow on 2 December.Hove Festival Homepage On 22 May 2008 Babyshambles performed at the Saturday Night Fiber, a new music festival in Madrid, Spain with other artists such as Morrissey. Growing speculation suggested that Babyshambles would be unable to make all tour dates for 2008, but in a recent interview with NME \\"Doherty added that he will honour all his booked live commitments with Babyshambles, but will not book further gigs until his solo album is finished\\". On 12 January 2009, along with Roger Daltrey, Babyshambles played a one-off gig at the O2 Academy Bristol in aid of Teenage Cancer Trust. =Sequel to the Prequel (2010-2014)= In June 2010 drummer and co-songwriter Adam Ficek split with the band to focus on his solo outfit Roses Kings Castles, with former Supergrass drummer Danny Goffey temporarily taking his place. In early 2013, NME announced that Babyshambles were working on a third album, with Stereophonics drummer Jamie Morrison replacing Adam Ficek in the line-up. Stephen Street denied this speculation, however, bassist, Drew McConnell is said to have broken the news to the music magazine. On 29 April 2013, Babyshambles announced a UK tour for the months of September and October of the same year, kicking off on 4 September at Glasgows Barrowlands. The new album, titled Sequel to the Prequel, was released on 2 September 2013, following Babyshambles' scheduled Australian shows in late July. The album charted at number 10 in the UK. Although Doherty's band, the Libertines, reformed in 2014, Babyshambles still continued to perform sporadic shows and festivals until 2014, most notably Rock am Ring, Rock Werchter, and Best Kept Secret Festival.

His innovative work as a sound engineer and producer in Germany's krautrock and kosmische music scenes helped to shape postwar European popular music. Plank oversaw recordings such as Cluster's Cluster 71 (1971), Neu!'s self-titled debut (1972), Kraftwerk's Autobahn (1974), and Harmonia's Deluxe (1975). He later produced for new wave acts such as Eurythmics and Ultravox. As a musician, Plank is credited on albums by Guru Guru, Kraan, Cluster, Liliental and Os Mundi. He collaborated with Dieter Moebius on five Moebius & Plank studio albums recorded between 1979 and 1986. The Moebius & Plank sound foreshadowed techno and electronica and influenced many later musicians. Style and influence Plank and the bands he worked with in West Germany had a strong influence on mainstream rock artists, some of whom were able to popularize aspects of his production technique and his distinctive approach. In the 1980s, electronic pop bands were able to realize his ideas in performance as computerized electronic instruments became readily available. Plank (who began his career as soundman for Marlene Dietrich) was an ardent believer in the possibilities of electronic music and electronic soundscapes. He was also known for blending them with conventional sounds, or natural sounds given unconventional treatments, such as using large metal containers and other industrial objects as percussion instruments. Plank used multi-track recording facilities. He favored sometimes harsh-sounding effects and contrasting audio for each element in the mix. Plank used combinations of echo, reverberation and other electronic, mixing, editing and tape-based effects to create mixes. Plank favored a very 'live' production sound, especially on drums. On a recording session in Hamburg in 1970 with Hartmut Kulka from the German Blue Flames & Philip Cantlay of Casey Jones & the Governors/Gaslight Union, together known as Kulka & Cantlay, he set up and recorded conga drums with specially inserted microphones to provide an unusual percussion sound. Career =1960s= Plank began producing albums and working as a sound engineer in the late 1960s and became involved in the underground music scene which was spreading outwards through Germany from Berlin. In 1969 he served as engineer for the first Kluster album, Klopfzeichen, which was released the following year. His long association with Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius of Kluster and later Cluster endured until his death. He also served as engineer for Alexander von Schlippenbach's album The Living Music, which was released in 1969, the first of a long list of engineering and production credits. =1970s= During the 1970s Conny Plank produced and/or engineered many recordings by significant German progressive/experimental music acts often referred to as krautrock internationally, including Kraftwerk, Organisation, Neu!, Cluster, Harmonia, Night Sun, Holger Czukay and Guru Guru. In 1977, through Brian Eno, Plank recruited Dave Hutchins from Island Studios, as house engineer. Hutchins undertook recording and mixing roles on many of the productions originating from the studios in the following ten years. As a musician, Plank played guitar and keyboards on three Guru Guru albums: Kang Guru, Guru Guru, and Mani und Seine Freunde, the Os Mundi album 43 Minuten, and Cluster's self-titled debut album. In 1978 and 1979 he added guitar and percussion to two Roedelius solo albums, Durch Die W√ºste and Selbstportrait. He was a member of the short lived band Liliental, contributing guitar, keyboards, and vocals. In 1979 he went into the studio with Dieter Moebius to record the first Moebius & Plank album, Rastakraut Pasta which was released the following year. =1980s= Plank continued to work as half of the duo Moebius & Plank, recording four additional albums. Their second album, Material, was released in 1981. Their third album, the African-influenced Zero Set, with Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier, was released in 1983. These two albums are early examples of the predecessors of techno and electronica. In 1983, Moebius & Plank also recorded the album Ludwig's Law using an Emulator, an early form of sampling keyboard that enabled them to duplicate other instruments without having musicians to play them. Mayo Thompson of Red Krayola contributed vocals, mainly spoken monologues. The project was rejected by Sky Records and was not released until 1998. The final Moebius & Plank collaboration, En Route was recorded in Conny's Studio in 1986 but left incomplete as Plank's health deteriorated. It was completed and mixed in 1995, primarily by Dieter Moebius, and released that year. During the eighties, Plank remained in high demand with the new generation of electronic pop and new wave artists, including Devo, The Meteors from the Netherlands, (Hunger in 1980) and (Stormy Seas in 1981), The Fred Banana Combo, Ultravox (Systems of Romance, Vienna and Rage in Eden), Freur and The Tourists (Luminous Basement), Eurythmics (In the Garden). He also worked on pop and rock productions with artists such as Scorpions, Clannad, Killing Joke, Play Dead, and Gianna Nannini (Latin Lover, Sogno Di Una Notte d'Estate, Tutto Live and others, also credited for music). Plank's other production credits include Liaisons Dangereuses, Phew, Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, √Åstor Piazzolla, Psychotic Tanks, DAF (including the classic single Der Mussolini) Gianna Nannini, Echo & the Bunnymen, Les Rita Mitsouko, and Nina Hagen. According to Ren√© Tinner and Stephan Plank in a radio documentary about the life of Conny Plank, it was Brian Eno's idea that Plank should produce the U2-album The Joshua Tree instead of him. After being introduced to the band by Eno and after a short meeting, Plank turned down the job (\\"I cannot work with this singer\\").Conny Plank ‚Äì eine Produzentenlegende, NDR German Radio, February 11, 2006 According to the companion website of the documentary film Conny Plank ‚Äì The Potential of Noise (but not the film itself), after the meeting, Plank firstly asked for time for a second thought. In the meantime he attended a U2 concert at Freilichtb√ºhne Loreley, where U2's Bono introduced Plank to the audience as their new producer, after which Plank is said to have left the concert and never communicated further with any member of U2.Conny Plank ‚Äì The Potential of Noise, Conny-plank.de Death Plank fell ill while touring South America with Dieter Moebius, Arno Steffen and Detlef Wiederhoeft performing music from Ludwig's Law. Some of Plank's last work, before his death in 1987 from laryngeal cancer in Cologne, was the recording of concerts on Eurythmics' Revenge tour, and samples used on the NED Synclavier on their Savage album. His studio, at his home on the southern outskirts of Cologne, continued to be run by his widow Christa Fast and their son until her failing health and the general change in the music business forced them to offer its contents for sale in May 2006.Vintage-music-equipment Fast died on 1 June 2006. Conny's famous hand-built mixing desk was bought by English producer David M. Allen and transported to England. The desk was originally designed and built by Plank in 1970, altered and upgraded consistently until his death in 1987. The 56 channel desk was a custom design and has a number of unique features, including a specially designed equalization (EQ) section that conformed to Plank's own preferred EQ settings, as well as a section which can be removed and which was fitted into a converted military van adapted for remote recording. It is also reputedly laminated in wood taken from a single cherry tree from Plank's own garden. The mixing desk was initially installed at Club Ralf, the private studio of producer Mark Ralph, where it was used to record and mix a range of work including all or parts of \\"In Our Heads\\" and \\"Why Make Sense\\" by Hot Chip, \\"Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action\\" by Franz Ferdinand and \\"Communion\\" by Years & Years. It is currently situated in North London at Studio 7, the private studio of songwriter and artist Laurence Loveless.Connys-Studio.de, Conny Plank's studio.

It starts at Queens Wharf on the Auckland waterfront, adjacent to the Britomart Transport Centre and the Downtown Ferry Terminal, and runs increasingly more steeply uphill for almost three kilometres in a mostly straight south-southwesterly direction towards the Karangahape Road ridge, and the residential suburbs in the interior of the Auckland isthmus. Geography Named after Queen Victoria, Queen Street was an early development of the new town of Auckland (founded in 1840), although initially the main street was intended to be Shortland Street, running parallel to the shore of Commercial Bay. The early route of Queen Street led up the middle of a gully following the bank of the Waihorotiu Stream (later bounded in as the 'Ligar Canal'). This canal was culverted beneath the street from the 1870s onward, allowing for further development of the street to be undertaken. The course of the stream is still reflected today in the slight bend of lower Queen Street. From north of Shortland Street, Queen Street is built on land reclaimed from the sea in the late 19th century (see Auckland waterfront article). There are several other 'Queen Streets' in the greater Auckland area, mostly in suburbs that were separate towns before being absorbed by a growing central city. Auckland was also called the \\"Queen City\\" since before the turn of the 20th century, though that term is now overshadowed by the nickname \\"City of Sails\\". Demographics The statistical areas of Queen Street, which covers a full block either side of Queen Street north of Wellesley Street, and Queen Street South West, which covers the area west of Queen Street to Vincent Street and Pitt Street south of Wellesley Street, had a population of 3,807 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 639 people (20.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,527 people (67.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,860 households. There were 2,076 males and 1,725 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.2 males per female, with 123 people (3.2%) aged under 15 years, 1,851 (48.6%) aged 15 to 29, 1,626 (42.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 204 (5.4%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 46.3% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 5.0% MƒÅori, 2.8% Pacific peoples, 41.4% Asian, and 9.9% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 73.6%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 54.5% had no religion, 27.0% were Christian, and 14.4% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 1,329 (36.1%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 162 (4.4%) people had no formal qualifications. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,953 (53.0%) people were employed full-time, 630 (17.1%) were part-time, and 204 (5.5%) were unemployed. History Queen Street (c.1889); painting by Jacques Carabain =Street, Stream and Canal= Settlement in the Queen Street area began in 1841 with a number of wooden buildings along the western side, following the general path of the Waihorotiu Stream according to the plans set out by surveyor Felton Mathew. While the street was metalled in 1843 ('metal' is a New Zealand term for gravel road), the natural stream still often overflowed its banks, and the area was still swampy. This led to canalisation and later covering-over of the stream.History of Queen Street (from the Auckland City Council website. Retrieved 15 August 2007.) =Mainstreet of Auckland= After a fire in 1858 destroyed around 50 buildings in High Street and Shortland Street, the commercial district began to shift towards Queen Street instead, and the first brick and plaster buildings of the 1860s started to cement this move, with the Bank of New Zealand building (only the fa√ßade extant today) being one of the first examples. Fires however still continued to plague the new town, with one in 1873 wiping out another 54 buildings in the Queen Street area between Wellesley Street West and Grey Street (today Greys Avenue). The fires, amongst other things, led to the establishment of the Auckland Volunteer Fire Service. Lower Queen Street in 1919, with trams, cars and horse-drawn cabs visible. In the 1880s, the first horse-drawn buses began connecting Queen Street with areas such as Ponsonby Road and Remuera. In 1900, the first motorcar was admired on the street, and in 1902 the street was finally asphalted, the first street in New Zealand. The same year the first electric trams also arrived, to provide services until 1956. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a large number of imposing buildings constructed, such as the Smith & Caughey's building, the Auckland Town Hall and the General Post Office at the waterfront, later to become the Britomart Transport Centre. By that time, the street was popular for events such as parades and festivities, as well as for political activities such as the strike demonstrations of 1913. The Queen Street riots broke out in the adjacent Aotea Square in late 1984. During the second half of the 20th century, many of the older buildings on Queen Street were demolished to make space for larger office buildings. Pre-2016 view of Queen Street looking towards downtown Auckland, from in front of the Downtown Ferry Terminal Character Queen Street is known by reputation all over the country, even by people who have never seen it. It gives its name to the most expensive square in the New Zealand version of Monopoly and to a somewhat disrespectful description of business people with rural investment interests (but lacking farming expertise): 'Queen Street farmers'. The street was immortalised by The Front Lawn with their song (It started on) Queen Street. The street has been the site of numerous parades, marches and other events of political, cultural or sporting nature. Together with adjacent High Street, it is the main retail precinct of the central city, with most national store, bank and restaurant franchises having a branch on the street. Several important other local businesses, such as the Smith & Caughey's department store, have flagship branches here. The street sees very high pedestrian numbers, estimated by some as up to 10 times as high as on Broadway in Newmarket, seen as Queen Street's closest shopping street rival in Auckland. Transport and foot traffic Queen Street by Aotea Square. The SkyCity Village Cinemas is visible in the background. Prior to a 2006‚Äì2008 street upgrade (see below), Council figures showed that over 50,000 pedestrians, 40,000 public transport users and 20,000 people in private vehicles used Queen Street daily. The Council anticipated that the private car share would drop by around 15%. An editorial of The New Zealand Herald accused Council of using overestimated public transport user numbers for political purposes to support its bus lane plans. =Former tram network= Until December 1956, trams provided public transport along Queen Street, and it was the only street in New Zealand with grand unions, double- track to double-track junctions, where trams could go to all directions from all directions. These junctions were at the intersections with Customs Street and Wellesley Street.The End of the Penny Section: When Trams Ruled the Streets of New Zealand ‚Äì Stewart, Graham; Wellington: Grantham House, Revised Edition 1993, Page 149 Since the closure of Auckland's tram network, Balaclava Junction on Melbourne's tram network has been the sole grand union left in the Southern Hemisphere. 2006‚Äî2008 upgrade A section of Queen Street following the 2006‚Äì2008 upgrade. Public perception in the early 2000s was that Queen Street had lost some of its good reputation in the previous decades, with a rundown and uncoordinated streetscape and the loss of several prestigious retailers cited as either causes or effects. Auckland City Council decided to address the issue of the 'tired' Queen Street through a major redevelopment of the street. This involved the widening and relaying of footpaths with basalt kerbstones and paving. Granite insets, designed in consultation with the local MƒÅori (Ngati Whatua iwi), as well as recycled redchip pavers from the existing footpath, were used to denote special areas ‚Äì such as those related to the existence of the old Waihorotiu Stream. New street furniture (such as multi- purpose poles for lighting, signage and pennants) and new trees and other landscaping were added to create a 'boulevard effect'.Auckland's CBD Into the future ‚Äì Queen Street upgrade (from the Auckland City Council website) The liquid ambers and Nikau Palms chosen for the new design touched off heated public discussion in 2006 as their inclusion came at the destruction of previous, established trees (which were not native flora of New Zealand, and thus not retained in the new landscaping plan). The 2006‚Äì2008 project repeatedly increased in cost, from NZ$23 million to around NZ$43.5 million, with some aspects (such as an improved entrance to Myers Park) falling victim to the blowout. While Council noted in June 2007 that progress had often been quicker than expected, the cost overruns, and the long duration of the construction works ‚Äì which substantially affected pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic as well as retail sales ‚Äì made the upgrade unpopular in public, at least during the duration. It also became a problem issue for Dick Hubbard in his failed campaign for re-election to Mayor of Auckland in 2007. The upgrade is now considered to have generally been a success, and it won the 2009 Urban Design Award of the New Zealand Institute of Architects, which commended it for creating a quality public realm and sense of place.New Zealand Architecture Award Winners 2009 (from the New Zealand Institute of Architects website. Accessed 7 June 2009.) =Upgrade priorities= To accommodate construction work, Auckland City Council reduced traffic lanes for vehicles to one lane in each direction in early 2007. A proposal was made for this to become permanent, with extended public transport provisions such as bus lanes and cycle lanes proposed for the outer lanes. Also proposed was a 30 km/h speed limit. Committee discussions and public consultation resulted in four physical lanes being retained, mainly to safeguard the street layout for future public transport options such as light rail. The changes included further improvements to pedestrian facilities, with the total footpath area increasing by 20% to almost 14,000 m¬≤, and longer traffic signal phases for pedestrians, while three new signalised pedestrian crossings were introduced mid-block, at accident 'black spots'. Also undertaken was a reduction of on- street parking spaces from 81 to 51, part of the prioritisation for pedestrians. The remaining spaces became dedicated short-term parking (i.e. drop-offs, loading). Not included in the design were dedicated bus bays, noted as a serious oversight by some critics, causing potential delays on the proposed bus lanes. Buildings and attractions Auckland Town Hall, a major civic building of the early 20th century. The Farmers Trading Company premises, looking up from the corner of Queen Street and Victoria Street. The Guardian building, one of the heritage office buildings on the street, recently converted to apartments. Vulcan Buildings, looking up from the corner of Queen Street and Vulcan Lane. At the northern (waterfront) end of Queen Street are several significant buildings. These include: * Auckland Ferry Building, 1911. Alexander Wiseman architect. This brick and sandstone building is in the Edwardian Baroque style. It was renovated in 1986 at a cost of $11 million. * Endeans Building, 1914‚Äì15. Corner of Queen Street and Quay Street. Built by John Endean, a prominent hotel proprietor, in 1905 and rebuilt 10 years later after a fire. Chilwell and Trevithick architects. The upper floors of this reinforced concrete building were converted to apartments during the 1990s. Listed as a Category II heritage building. * (Former) Chief Post Office, 1910. John Campbell architect. Opened by Prime Minister William Massey before a crowd of over 8,000. This Edwardian Baroque building of limestone and granite has been incorporated into the Britomart Transport Centre. Campbell was the Government Architect, and consequently this building has similar features to the New Zealand Parliament Buildings in Wellington, which were constructed around the same time. * (Former) Custom House, 1888. Thomas Mahoney architect, 22 Customs St. This building displays the mansard roofs typical of the French Second Empire Style. In 1909 an addition was built to the south [now demolished]. Prior to the Town Hall's opening in 1911 several departments of the Auckland City Council were located here. The Custom House was renovated for retail use in the 1980s.The old Auckland Customhouse, c.1889 Between Customs Street and Wellesley Street, Queen Street is lined with retail and office buildings. This section of the street is where the majority of the high-rise buildings are located. These are mostly 20th century in origin, although a number of 19th century structures survive. Many large corporations, insurance companies and banks had substantial buildings on Queen Street and in some cases their head offices were located here rather than in Wellington (the capital). The most significant buildings along the middle part of the street are the: * Dilworth Building, 1927. Gummer and Ford architects. 22 Queen St. Envisaged as one of a pair of buildings flanking the entrance to Queen Street and thus being a \\"Gateway to Auckland\\". The use of electric cranes rather than hydraulic meant a very short construction period. The Dilworth Building is a reinforced concrete structure encased in Portland stone. William Gummer had been trained in the offices of Sir Edwin Lutyens, and this building shows influence of this connection. * The Queens Arcade ‚Äì 34 Queen Street. 1920s Neo-classical building linking the eastern side of Queen Street with Customs Street. * Imperial Hotel ‚Äì 66 Queen Street. A Victorian building from 1883 that is now used as a backpackers, the Imperial Hotel incorporated a building that had previously been offices for the Auckland Harbour Board and the Gas Board. * Guardian Trust Building ‚Äì 105 Queen Street. A 1919 reinforced concrete structure distinguished by bronze entrance columns. The architect William Gummer had been trained in the offices of Sir Edwin Lutyens, and this building shows influence of this connection. The stone used on the Queen Street fa√ßade and in the lobby is Cloudy Bay Marble from Nelson. * The Deloitte Centre ‚Äì 80 Queen Street. New tower designed by Woods Bagot Architects which incorporates the Jean Batten State Building. * Jean Batten State Building ‚Äì Named after the pioneer New Zealand aviator Jean Batten. Designed by John Mair, government architect in 1937 and completed in 1940. This was intended as office space for Government departments in Auckland which had outgrown their premises in the Custom House in nearby Customs Street. The building was used by the American High Command as their headquarters for the duration of the Second World War. * South British Insurance Building ‚Äì 15 Shortland Street. 1927 building by R F Draffin for the South British Insurance Company ‚Äì the lobby is arguably the best Art-Deco interior in Auckland. The addition to the east dates from 1968 and is on the site of a Victorian Pub. * General Building ‚Äì 33 Shortland Street. Neo-Classical skyscraper built for the Yorkshire Insurance Company. Designed by W R Bloomfield in 1928. Bloomfield was probably the first Maori architect. The Shortland Street facade of this building was extended in 1977. Few people looking at the building would be aware that the right hand {western} side of the building is from 1928 and the left hand {eastern} from 1977 as the classical detailing was perfectly replicated. * Bank of New Zealand Building, 1865. Leonard Terry architect. 125 Queen St. Built of beige sandstone imported from Hobart, Australia, this building was originally only five bays wide, and in 1882 two more bays were added on the Queen Street facade. In 1986 this building was substantially altered, and now only the facade remains, attached to a large high rise office building. * Vulcan Buildings, 1928. Holman, Moses & Watkins architects. This elegant building stands prominently on the southern corner of Vulcan Lanehttp://heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz/2013/10/vulcan-lane.html and Queen Street, and has design influences principally from Neoclassical architecture, but also the English Arts and Crafts movement. A defining feature is the cupola on the top of the building. The building also marks a significant change in built form of Central Auckland, as the city was being transformed from the low-rise buildings of the 19th century to the high-rise buildings of the 20th century.A Guide to the Architecture of Central Auckland ‚Äì Errol Haarhoff. Balasoglou Books 2003 * Landmark House, formerly Auckland Electric Power Board Building 1927. Wade & Bartley architects. Cnr Queen St and Durham St east. This is an example of the early Art Deco ‚Äì gothic skyscraper style. The design emphasises the vertical, drawing on references from Chicago and New York skyscrapers of the period. The Auckland Electric Power Board used the building as a form of advertising by flood lighting the exterior. * Queen Victoria Building, Auckland, formerly John Courts Building. Designed by John Currie in 1899 for the Direct Supply Company. Cnr Queen St and Victoria St East. The first three stories are in the Victorian Italianate style. Internally the building retains its timber columns and floor structure. In 1910 John Court opened his department store in the building and in 1916 added three stories in the same style. * AMP Building ‚Äì 220 Queen Street. 1962 Modernist New York Style Skyscraper. This building is an example of a Glass curtain wall and is distinguished by crisp metal detailing. Designed by Jack Manning for Thorp Cutter Pickmere & Douglas Architects. * Strand Arcade 233‚Äì237 Queen St. Commissioned by local businessman Arthur Myers, built in 1900 with the latest in lifts, ventilation and lighting (the basement restaurant could seat 700). Renovated in 1970 this Edwardian shopping arcade has remained largely unaltered. * Auckland Savings Bank Building, 1884. Edward Bartley architect. 260 Queen St. This is an example of the mid Victorian italianate style. The facade displays columns and panels of coloured marble and granite. In 1977 this building became a McDonald's restaurant, although the facade and interior remain largely intact due to a sensitive renovation. Beyond the Wellesley Street intersection lies the midtown district, with its entertainment and civic focus, centred on Aotea Square. Here are located most of the important civic buildings, including the: * Auckland Civic Theatre, 1929. Bohringer, Taylor & Johnson architects. 269 Queen St. This is one of the best remaining examples of an atmospheric theatre. The monumental Art Deco stripped-classical facade hides a lavish Hollywood inspired interior. The lobby is a reproduction of an Indian rock temple decorated with 500 elephants. The auditorium is decorated as an open courtyard in ancient Baghdad, the ceiling imitating the night sky with hundreds of electric stars placed as they appear in the southern sky. Extensively renovated in 1994 it is now part of a larger entertainment and retail complex. The renovation fixed several problems including the undersized stage and inadequate backstage facilities. * St. James Theatre ‚Äì 316 Queen Street. 1927 theatre building in the 1920s Hollywood/Spanish style designed for vaudeville but wired for talking pictures in 1929. The stage capacity, acoustics and seating sightlines meant this theatre was superior to the other venues of the period (His Majesty's, King's Theatre, and the Auckland Opera House); even after the appearance of the Civic it still stood out as the best venue for traditional live theatre. The landmark turret above the Queen street entrance is possibly still concealed behind modernist cladding. * Bledisloe House, 1959. A modernist glass facade office block designed for Central Government services as part of the proposed Civic Centre. Designed by Gordon Wilson with Jack Beere and named after Lord Bledisloe (Governor-General of New Zealand from 1930 to 1935). This was the only one of a complex of six identical buildings planned for the environs of what is now Aotea Square. The other five buildings were to be the new Town Hall, a City Administration block, a new Public Library, public Art Gallery and a final office block to be rented out as commercial office space. In the middle of this complex was to be the Auckland Centennial Theatre and a public square. The Admin Bldg was eventually built in 1966 in a different form and the theatre appeared in 1989 as the Aotea Centre. The other four buildings would have required the demolition of all the other buildings on this city block including the 1911 Town Hall and the Civic Theatre. The Bledisloe Building was renovated in 2014 by Auckland Council. * Aotea Centre, 1990. Ewen Wainscott architect. Initially proposed in 1949 as the Auckland Centennial Hall, construction of this building was delayed for several decades. Intended to supplant the town hall, when it opened it was found to have acoustical problems resulting in a costly refit. Complaints from performers over many years resulted in the renovation of the Town Hall. The lobby of the Aotea Centre contains many art works by New Zealand artists. * Council Administration Block, 1966. Tibor K.Donner architect. Considered a positive example of 1950s modernism, which contrasts with the 1911 Town Hall on the far side of Aotea Square. Is considered to be Auckland's first 'skyscraper'. * Auckland Town Hall, 1911. J. Clark & Sons architects. 303 Queen St. A Melbourne firm designed this building in the English Baroque style. It is built of Melbourne Bluestone and Oamaru stone with art nouveau leadlight windows. The main auditorium has excellent acoustics being based upon the famous Gewandhaus Concert Hall in Leipzig, Germany. The large pipe organ was donated by Sir Henry Brett, a former mayor of Auckland. This building was renovated in the late 1990s and continues to be widely considered as Auckland's premier concert venue. Further up Queen Street beyond Mayoral Drive is the uptown district, centred on Myers Park. This is often referred to as Upper Queen Street, although that name actually refers to a separate continuation of Queen Street on the other side of the K'Road ridge. The most significant buildings in this area are the: * 'Queen Street Shops' ‚Äì 456‚Äì488 Queen Street. Range of Edwardian retail buildings from 1909 onwards. Designed by two Auckland architects, T W May and Alexander Wiseman. These form a harmonious ensemble facing Myers Park but also retain many original features often removed from other structures; the curved corrugated iron verandahs are intact and held up by vertical posts, and virtually all the shops' fronts are intact including the glazed tile work surrounds. * Theosophical Society Building, 1923. Henry Robinson architect. Located at the Queen St entrance to Myers Park, this is a fine example of interwar neo-classical architecture for the Theosophical Society replacing an earlier structure from 1912 located further down Queen Street. Recently renovated as a 'gentlemen's club' called 'The White House'. * Myers Free Kindergarten 1916 B.Chilwell & R.Trevithick architects. Designed as a large homely cottage this brick and stucco building is located in the middle of the 1914 Myers Park. An example of Arts & Crafts architecture which still operates as a kindergarten. * Auckland Baptist Tabernacle 1884 Edmund Bell architect. Near the corner of Queen St & Karangahape Road. Large Imperial Roman temple. The interior has decorative ceiling stencilwork in the neo-classical style by Samuel and Charles Blomfield. Beyond the Karangahape Road ridge the southernmost 500 metres of the street is called Upper Queen Street, and it crosses the eastern part of the Central Motorway Junction, the largest interchange on the New Zealand state highway network.

He played in Major League Baseball as a right fielder from 1973 to 1991. A seven-time All-Star player, Parker won two National League batting titles and was the 1978 National League Most Valuable Player. He was a member of two world championship winning teams with the Pittsburgh Pirates in and with the Oakland Athletics in . Parker was the first professional athlete to earn an average of $1 million per year, having signed a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker's career achievements include 2,712 hits, 339 home runs, 1,493 runs batted in and a lifetime batting average of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career, with a powerful arm, winning three consecutive Gold Gloves during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977. Early life Parker grew up in Cincinnati near Crosley Field, where he learned to play baseball on the stadium's parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk in a foundry. Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School. He has said his favorite sport was football, and he starred at tailback but injured a knee in a game during his senior year and gave up the game. Also a baseball star, one of his fondest memories is playing at Western Hills High School (alma mater of Pete Rose), where he hit a home run that landed on the roof of a Frisch's restaurant. Playing career =Pittsburgh Pirates= In the early 1970s, as a member of the Pirates AAA minor league ball team Charleston (WV) Charlies, Parker hit a home run that landed on a coal car on a passing train and the ball was later picked up in Columbus, Ohio.\\"Parker Excited to Return to Charleston\\", The Charleston Gazette, May 1, 2009. He began his major league career on July 12, 1973, with the Pittsburgh Pirates, for whom he played from 1973 to 1983. At the 1977 MLB All-Star Game he became the only player in history to have worn batting helmets from two different teams‚Äîneither of them his own‚Äîin the same game, wearing a San Diego Padres helmet early on before swapping it out for a Cincinnati Reds one.Paul Lukas (July 12, 2013) \\"http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/38106/uni-watch-all-star-helmet- mix-ups\\" In 1977, he was National League batting champion, a feat he repeated in 1978 when he was named the National League's MVP. This was in spite of a collision at home plate with John Stearns during a game against the Mets on June 30, 1978, in which Parker fractured his jaw and cheekbone; he wore a specially constructed facemask in order to minimize his time away from the lineup.Paul Lukas, \\"Aggh! It's Dave Parker at the plate!,\\" ESPN Page 2, July 29, 2008, accessed March 9, 2009. The Pirates rewarded him with baseball's first million-dollar-per-year contract.Derek A. Reveron, \\"Dave Parker: Big Man, Big Bat and Baseball's Biggest Salary,\\" Ebony October 1979: \\"the reported five=year, $5 million contract he agreed to in January.\\"\\"Parker's $5 Million Pact Says He's Baseball's Best,\\" Jet February 22, 1979, p. 48. The following year, he was an instrumental part of the Pirates' World Series championship team.Dave Parker as told to George Vass, \\"The Game I'll Never Forget,\\" Baseball Digest April 1985, pp. 79-80: \\"I've been a big influence in some pennant races. We won the division three years when I was at Pittsburgh ('74, '75 and '79), and we won the World Series in 1979.\\" During a game in 1979, a powerful hit he made to right field was very difficult to throw into the infield, because he had \\"knocked the cover off the ball.\\" One of the seams on the ball ruptured, making nearly half of the cover come loose. Pittsburgh fans angered by his million-dollar contract threw \\"nuts and bolts and bullets and batteries\\" at him, as pitcher Kent Tekulve stated; a typo in a news story made it appear that they threw car batteries.Mike Downey, \\"Dave Parker Left His Anger, not His Talent, in Pittsburgh: During his second season in Cincinnati, he produced some big numbers, reminiscent of his happy days with the Pirates,\\" Baseball Digest November 1985, repr. from The Los Angeles Times: pp. 30-31. In 1981, at a point in his career when it looked as if he would one day rank among the game's all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.New York: Crown, . The authors, noting that Parker had succeeded Roberto Clemente at the position, wrote, \\"Someone must have a fondness for right field in Pittsburgh.\\" Parker took after his Pirates teammate Willie Stargell in warming up in the on-deck circle with a sledgehammer (when most batters would use a simple lead- weighted bat).Rushin, Steve. \\"Big Brew Ha-ha: Old hands Don Baylor and Dave Parker are showing the Brewers how to stay loose and win,\\" Sports Illustrated (June 11, 1990). In the early 1980s, however, Parker's hitting suffered due to injuries, weight problems, and his increasing cocaine use.\\"Reds Star Dave Parker Admits Cocaine Use,\\" Lakeland Ledger September 12, 1985: \\"In his first public admission of drug use, Parker said that he bought cocaine from [Curtis] Strong and used it with him in Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia.\\" He became one of the central figures in a drug scandal that spread through the major leagues. =Later career= At the end of the 1983 season, Parker became a free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. In Cincinnati, his hometown, he returned to the form that made him an All-Star in Pittsburgh. In 1985, he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a .312 batting average, 34 home runs, and 125 RBI. Parker finished second in 1985 MVP voting to Willie McGee. Parker was also the winner of the League's first-ever Home Run Derby in 1985. Following the season, Parker was among several players who testified against a dealer in the Pittsburgh drug trials. Named as \\"regular users\\", Parker and six other players were suspended for the following season. The sentences were commuted, however, in exchange for donating ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, submitting to random drug testing, and contributing 100 hours of drug-related community service.Cook, Ron. \\"The Eighties: A terrible time of trial and error,\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (September 29, 2000).Bodley, Hal. \\"Ueberroth took action in 1986 cocaine scandal,\\" USA Today (March 4, 2004). After the 1987 season, Cincinnati traded Parker to the Oakland Athletics for Jos√© Rijo and Tim Birtsas. In Oakland, Parker was able to extend his career by spending most of his time as a designated hitter. Although injuries and age caught up to him to a degree - he hit just .257 with 12 homers in 377 at-bats in 1988 and .264 with 22 homers in 553 at-bats in 1989 - his veteran leadership was a significant factor in the A's consecutive World Series appearances. Parker signed with the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1990 season and had a solid year as the Brewers' DH, with a .289 average and 21 home runs in 610 at-bats. Milwaukee opted for youth, however, at the end of the year and traded the aging Parker to the Angels for Dante Bichette. Parker's last season was 1991. He played for the California Angels until late in the season when he was released. The Toronto Blue Jays then signed him as insurance for the pennant race, and Parker hit .333 in limited action. Since he was acquired too late in the season, however, he did not qualify for inclusion on the post-season roster and thus was unable to play in the American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins, which the Blue Jays lost in five games. Parker retired at the end of the season. Retirement Parker has served as a first- base coach for the Anaheim Angels, a batting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998, and a special hitting instructor for Pittsburgh. He owned several Popeye's Chicken franchises in Cincinnati until selling his interest in them in 2012 after 25 years. Parker never got more than 24% of votes on Hall of Fame ballots, and his 15-year Baseball Writers' Association of America eligibility was exhausted on the 2011 ballot. He can now be considered for the Veterans Committee Expansion from 2014. Supporters of Parker's Hall of Fame candidacy argue that Parker's involvement with the Pittsburgh drug trials has contributed to his not being voted into the Hall of Fame, which may have also harmed the candidacies of Keith Hernandez (who never received more than 10.8% and fell off the writers' ballot on his ninth try) and Tim Raines (debuted at 24.3%, but was elected on his tenth year on the ballot), serving as a precursor to those listed on the Mitchell Report not being voted into the Hall of Fame due to steroid abuse. Critics say that Parker's stats fall short of accepted standards of inclusion in the Hall. While Tim Raines became a cause c√©l√®bre among the sabermetric community which pushed for his election, Dave Parker does not fare as well when using advanced stats. Parker has had both of his knees replaced due to injuries from his playing career.KICU telecast, Oakland A's vs Chicago White Sox, August 17, 2008, per Dave Henderson In 2013, he confirmed to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He is involved in raising money to find a cure for Parkinson's disease through the Dave Parker 39 Foundation. Parker has six children. He currently resides in Loveland, Ohio, near Cincinnati, with his wife, Kellye. Parker was elected to the Reds Hall of Fame Class of 2014, which also included fellow Cincinnati natives Ron Oester and Ken Griffey Jr. In 2012, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Public Schools Athletic Hall of Fame.

An implementation of OAI-PMH must support representing metadata in Dublin Core, but may also support additional representations. The protocol is usually just referred to as the OAI Protocol. OAI-PMH uses XML over HTTP. Version 2.0 of the protocol was released in 2002; the document was last updated in 2015. It has a Creative Commons license BY-SA. History In the late 1990s, Herbert Van de Sompel (Ghent University) was working with researchers and librarians at Los Alamos National Laboratory (US) and called a meeting to address difficulties related to interoperability issues of e-print servers and digital repositories. The meeting was held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in October 1999. A key development from the meeting was the definition of an interface that permitted e-print servers to expose metadata for the papers it held in a structured fashion so other repositories could identify and copy papers of interest with each other. This interface/protocol was named the \\"Santa Fe Convention\\". Several workshops were held in 2000 at the ACM Digital Libraries conferenceACM Digital Libraries conference and elsewhere to share the ideas from the Santa Fe Convention. It was discovered at the workshops that the problems faced by the e-print community were also shared by libraries, museums, journal publishers, and others who needed to share distributed resources. To address these needs, the Coalition for Networked InformationCoalition for Networked Information and the Digital Library FederationDigital Library Federation provided funding to establish an Open Archives Initiative (OAI) secretariat managed by Herbert Van de Sompel and Carl Lagoze. The OAI held a meeting at Cornell University (Ithaca, New York) in September 2000 to improve the interface developed at the Santa Fe Convention. The specifications were refined over e-mail. OAI-PMH version 1.0 was introduced to the public in January 2001 at a workshop in Washington D.C., and another in February in Berlin, Germany. Subsequent modifications to the XML standard by the W3C required making minor modifications to OAI-PMH resulting in version 1.1. The current version, 2.0, was released in June 2002. It contained several technical changes and enhancements and is not backward compatible. Uses Some commercial search engines use OAI-PMH to acquire more resources. Google initially included support for OAI-PMH when launching sitemaps, however decided to support only the standard XML Sitemaps format in May 2008.Google Webmaster blog In 2004, Yahoo! acquired content from OAIster (University of Michigan) that was obtained through metadata harvesting with OAI-PMH. Wikimedia uses an OAI-PMH repository to provide feeds of Wikipedia and related site updates for search engines and other bulk analysis/republishing endeavors. Especially when dealing with thousands of files being harvested every day, OAI-PMH can help in reducing the network traffic and other resource usage by doing incremental harvesting.incremental harvesting NASA's Mercury metadata search system uses OAI-PMH to index thousands of metadata records from Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) every day.

The novel is an expanded version of a short story first published in Galaxy Science Fiction in August 1967. The novel was published in 1968 and was released in the United Kingdom under the title The Anvil of Time. Synopsis Hawksbill Station was a penal colony in the Cambrian Period created by an authoritarian United States government, using time travel to exile rebels and political dissidents into the past.http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/reviews/times-three-by-robert- silverberg/ The colony houses only male exiles, who are sent there as a \\"humane\\" alternative to execution. The machine only works one way, leaving prisoners marooned in the past. The prison is set in a barren coastal area. The novel focuses on the relationships between the main character, the de facto leader of the colony, and his nemesis in the government, Jacob ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Bernstein, both of whom were leading dissidents. It also explores the petty ideological differences among the prisoners and the confused circumstances leading to the establishment of the authoritarian government. The prisoners, all middle-aged or elderly, are surprised by the arrival of a much younger prisoner. The newcomer, supposedly an economist, is questioned about economic theory and political ideology. His answers reveal his essential ignorance of both. This ignorance, combined with his youth, cause the prisoners to wonder if he is, in fact, a political prisoner or a common criminal, exiled for a heinous crime. When the newcomer arrives via the time machine a second time, it is revealed that he is a police officer of a new government that overthrew the authoritarian government but was unrelated to the dissident movements of the exiles. The new government discovered the existence of Hawksbill Station and a way to travel from past to future, making it possible to retrieve prisoners from the colony. The newcomer has been sent to evaluate the prisoners and to recommend whether they are appropriate for retrieval. With return now possible, the leader of the exiles realizes that he is a time traveler of a different sort. The struggle against the authoritarian government, his life's work, is over. His closest friends in the movement, as well as his most bitter enemies, are dead. He is tempted to visit the newcomer's future, but Hawksbill Station is now the only existence he knows.  Reception  Algis Budrys said that Hawksbill Station was Silverberg's best story. Hawksbill Station was credited by Jeff Vogel, a small indie game developer, as having influenced the design for his game Exile: Escape from the Pit, saying that while most of the game's plotlines were his, this classic short story helped shape his ideas.

The peace negotiations were precipitated by the successful storming of Lankaran by General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky on 1 January 1813. The treaty confirmed the ceding and inclusion of what is now Daghestan, eastern Georgia, most of the Republic of Azerbaijan and parts of northern Armenia from Iran into the Russian Empire. The text was prepared by the British diplomat Sir Gore Ouseley who served as the mediator and wielded great influence at the Persian court. It was signed by Nikolai Rtischev for Russia Treaty of Gulistan and Mirza Abolhassan Khan Ilchi for Persia. The result of the treaty was that it forcefully ceded the bulk of Iran's Caucasian territories, and it also directly contributed to the outbreak of the next war of the 19th century: the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828). Under the Treaty of Turkmenchay that came out of that war, the last Caucasian territories were stripped from Iran, now Armenia and the remaining part of modern-day Azerbaijan that had remained in Iranian hands. By 1828, Iran had lost by both treaties all of those integral territories in Transcaucasia and the North Caucasus. The area north of the Aras River, including the territory of the contemporary nations of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the North Caucasian Republic of Dagestan, were part of Iran until they were occupied by Russia during the 19th century. As a further direct result and consequence of the Treaty of Gulistan in combination with the 1828 Treaty Turkmenchay, the formerly-Iranian territories became part of Russia for around the next 180 years, except Dagestan, which has remained a Russian possession ever since. Out of most the territory, three separate nations would be formed through the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991: Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Lastly and equally importantly, Russia's imposing the two treaties has also decisively parted the Azerbaijanis and Talysh between the two nations. Background The Russian Empire had sworn in a new tsar, Alexander I, in 1801 and was very eager to control neighboring territories, as he was determined to expand. A few years previously in Iran, Fath Ali Shah Qajar also became the new shah after the assassination of his uncle, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, in 1797. Agha Mohammad Khan had during his reign defeated and re-subordinated all of his enemies and former Afsharid/Safavid vassals and subjects in the regions of what is now Georgia, Armenia, southern Dagestan, and Azerbaijan and claimed those areas as rightfully belonging to Persia. By the events prior, during and after the Battle of Krtsanisi in 1795, he had regained full control over eastern Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Several years later, after Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated in Shusha and Erekle II had died as well, Russia stepped in and capitalized on the moment to annex eastern Georgia to allow unrestricted travel and trade between the regions and Russia, furthering its public claim on the land.Sicker, Martin. The Islamic World in Decline: From the Treaty of Karlowitz to the Disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Praeger Publishers, 2000. Pg. 98-104 Persia tried to align with France in 1801 to better position itself in case of war with Russia, but those attempts fell through. Ironically, as both Russia and Britain were engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, Fath Ali Shah instead brokered a deal with Britain to provide Persia with military support from British troops in exchange for preventing any European country from entering India.Keddie, Nikki R.. Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution, Updated Edition. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006. Pg. 32-39 With the alliance, Persia entered into the First Russo-Persian War against a militarily-preoccupied Russia, which was heavily invested in the Napoleonic Wars. Although Persia entered the war mainly to reassert its control over Georgia and to ensure the protection of the rest of its northwestern borders, Fath Ali Shah had heard about the atrocities being committed by Russian Commanders in Georgia \\"through massive extortion and maladministration\\".David M. Lang ‚ÄúGriboedov's Last Years in Persia‚Äù, American Slavic and East European Review, Vol. 7, No. 4 (Dec., 1948), pp. 317-339 Numerically, the Persian forces had a considerable advantage during the war since they were five times as large as Russian adversaries. However, the Persian forces were technologically backwards and poorly trained, a problem that the Persian government did not recognize until far later. Despite the crippling disadvantages, the fighting continued in northern Persia, Azerbaijan and in regions of Georgia. Persia was so enraged at Russia that it declared a jihad and demanding its people to unite to fight the war against it.Sicker, Martin. The Islamic World in Decline: From the Treaty of Karlowitz to the Disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Praeger Publishers, 2000, p. 106-112 Persia was actually losing the war and asked for military and financial aid from France's Napoleon because if the Franco-Persian alliance. France promised to deliver support on Iran's ambitions to regain its recently-lost territory of Georgia, but France's relations with Russia were more important after the two countries signed the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 and so France left Persia unassisted. The Battle of Aslanduz, on 31 October 1812, was the turning point in the war, which led to the complete destruction of the Persian army and so Fath Ali Shah had no option but to sign the Treaty of Gulistan.Polk, William R..

Assessment Even today, Iran officially sees it and the later Treaty of Turkmenchay as some of its most humiliating treaties ever signed. The treaty is also regarded by Iranians as the main reason for Fath Ali Shah to be seen as one of Iran's most incompetent rulers in memory. Scholars in Azerbaijan point out that the Karabakh Khanate, where the treaty was signed, had pursued an independent foreign policy as early as 1795, when \\"Ibrahim Khalil Khan, the wali of Qarabagh, fearing for his independence, warned Sultan Selim III of Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar's ambitions to subdue Azerbaijan and later Qarabagh, Erivan and Georgia. In the same year Muhammad Khan, the hakim of Erivan, also wrote the Sultan alerting him to Agha Muhammad's 'aggression' and seeking Ottoman protection\\".Muhammad Riza Nasiri, \\"Asnad va Mukatabat-i Tarikh-i Qajariya\\", Tehran, Intisharat-i Kayhan, 1366/1987, pp. 7-8. Imperial Russian historians maintain that Russia's absorption of the Transcaucasus territories delivered their population from constant Iranian and Ottoman invasions and that the Christian nations of the Caucasus were liberated from Muslim repression, which ushered in the years of peace and relative economic stability. Vital to the signing of the treaty was the agreement made by Fath Ali Shah with Britain. With the defeat in the Russo-Persian War, the Shah understood that another attack by the Russians was almost inevitable. Britain saw the war as unwinnable for the Persians and used that to strengthen their foreign affairs. Using their new-found diplomatic connections with the British, Persia established the Treaty of Defensive Alliance in 1812, which promised that Britain would \\"offer a defensive alliance against further Russian encroachments\\". Its terms essentially stated that Persia would defend against any European army entering India, which stationed most British troops and, in return, Britain would provide military and financial against any future Russian attack.Sicker, Martin. The Islamic World in Decline: From the Treaty of Karlowitz to the Disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Praeger Publishers, 2000, p. 104-107 Aftermath The treaty did not answer vital questions such as whether the Persian army would be disarmed or be able to regroup. It was known to both sides that Persia would strike again because they considered the regions rightfully theirs and were furious about Russia‚Äôs treatment of the land and people. The war was becoming costly in terms of troops and finance, so the Treaty of Gulistan led to over a decade of nominal peace (1813‚Äì1826) between Russia and Persia, mainly for the clause regarding trade: both governments saw much potential with it and used it to their advantage. Permanent diplomatic missions were set up in Persia as well as Russia in order to keep trade open as long as possible.Kazemzadeh, F. \\"Iranian relations with Russia and the Soviet Union, to 1921.\\" From Nadir Shah to the Islamic Republic. Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pg. 330-338 It was a period of tense stability, though, as both countries understood that the treaty was written very vaguely and that nothing was written about provisions for the military mainly to prevent Persia from trying to regain the regions of Georgia or the Caucasus, thus leaving open the possibility of another future war. It is likely that neither the Iranian Shah (king) nor the Tsar regarded the treaty of Gulistan as definitive. According to Prof. Timothy C. Dowling: According to Prof. William Bayne Fisher (et al.): As another result of Persia's losses to Russia, the two treaties of Gulistan and Turkemenchai also divided Azerbaijani\\"The result of the Treaty of Turkmenchay was a tragedy for the Azerbaijani people. It demarcated a borderline through their territory along the Araxes river, a border that still today divides the Azerbaijani people.\\" in Svante Cornell, \\"Small nations and great powers: A Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict in the Caucasus\\", Richmond: Curzon Press, 2001, p. 37. and TalyshMichael P. Croissant, \\"The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict: causes and implications\\", Praeger/Greenwood,1998 - Page 67: The historical homeland of the Talysh was divided between Russia and Iran in 1813. people from their brethren in Iran. The area to the North of the river Aras, amongst which is the territory of the contemporary nations of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the North Caucasian Republic of Dagestan, were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century. Precursor to Second Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828 The Treaty of Gulistan left the possibility of conflict between the two countries and so was weak from the start. Russia's main priority before the war was to focus on the wars being fought with Napoleon, which explains the small numbers of troops ghat it dedicated for the Russo-Persian War. The Treaty of Gulistan was mainly a way for both countries to \\"gain a breath\\"Lambton, Ann K. S. \\"Persia: The Breakdown of Society.\\" The Central Islamic Lands from Pre-Islamic Times to the First World War. Cambridge University Press, 1970. Pg. 435-452 so that the Russo- Persian War could end, and they could focus on other issues. After the treaty was signed, Persia started rapidly building up its army once more, as Fath Ali Shah was fully devoted to regaining the lost territories. It was surprising to no one when Fath Ali Shah ordered his military commander, Abbas Mirza, to start training troops in 1823, three years before the second Russo-Persian War of the century, which was three times as much military preparation as he had devoted to the first war. The clergy in Persia also publicly announced that the jihad against Russia was not over.Sicker, Martin. The Islamic World in Decline: From the Treaty of Karlowitz to the Disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Praeger Publishers, 2000. Pg. 114-122 In 1826, Persia once again attacked the territories lost to Russia, and the British supported the Persians. The second war lasted two years, and Persia lost 35,000 troops to Russia's 8,000. Persia's poor performance led to the signing of the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which resulted in the loss of modern-day Armenia and the remaining parts of Azerbaijan.

Location  The barrio of Palermo is to the southeast; N√∫√±ez is to the northwest; Coghlan, Villa Urquiza, Villa Ort√∫zar and Colegiales are to the southwest.  History  Washerwomen in Bajo Belgrano, painting by Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n, 1865. Belgrano was named after Manuel Belgrano, a politician and military leader who created the national flag of Argentina. In 1820, at Belgrano's death, Buenos Aires' legislature introduced a law to name the next town to be founded after him. This happened in 1855, when the Buenos Aires government, fearful that relatives of Juan Manuel de Rosas would dispute the governmental decision to expropriate Rosas' lands, laid down a new town on part of it and named it Belgrano. The town was declared a city shortly thereafter, due to its booming growth, and in 1880 it became the nation's capital for a few weeks, because of the dispute between the national government and Buenos Aires province for the status of the city of Buenos Aires. It was in Belgrano that the law declaring Buenos Aires as Argentina's federal capital was issued. Alberti Sq. In 1887, the federal district was enlarged by the annexation of the towns (partidos) of Belgrano and Flores.  Subsections  The front of Universidad de Belgrano Belgrano is an upper-middle-class neighborhood that can be roughly divided into Belgrano R, Belgrano C, central Belgrano, and Lower Belgrano (Bajo Belgrano). The heart of the barrio pulses with life on its main thoroughfare, Avenida Cabildo, which runs Northwest to Southeast; the subway (subte) Line D follows its route. Avenida Cabildo carries heavy automobile traffic, and features corner caf√©s, grocery stores, movie theaters, specialty shops, clothing boutiques, bookstores, and other retail venues. Pedestrians are especially numerous on weekend afternoons as Porte√±os (residents of Buenos Aires) from various areas of the city come to shop. Most of the neighborhood's densest housing is located in the vicinity of Cabildo. High-rise luxury apartment buildings are clustered on the leafy streets surrounding the Universidad de Belgrano, a private liberal-arts university. Many older single-family homes have been replaced by high-rise residential structures in the denser sections of Belgrano. West of Cr√°mer avenue, \\"Belgrano R\\" is chiefly residential and lower-density in nature, characterized by calm streets lined with large, mature shade trees. Most buildings in this section are detached single-family homes that follow Anglo-Saxon architectural styles; some residences have sizable backyards with swimming pools. This section is favored by wealthy Argentines and expatriate businesspeople. \\"Belgrano C\\" is also home to Buenos Aires's small Chinatown. The district is crowded with restaurants and specialty grocery stores catering to Asian-Argentines and to the general public.  Transportation  Other than Cabildo, avenues Libertador, Luis Maria Campos, Cr√°mer, Ricardo Balb√≠n (formerly known as del Tejar), and Figueroa Alcorta run parallel to the riverbank, while Federico Lacroze, Juramento, Monroe and Congreso run from the riverbank to the Southwest direction. Belgrano is served by the Buenos Aires metro line D, many bus lines (notably Colectivo 60), and two commuter rail lines. Approximately 1.5 km to the west of Belgrano lies Avenida General Paz, a major limited-access freeway that defines the city limits of Buenos Aires proper. Beyond this avenue lie the suburbs of Vicente Lopez, Florida and Olivos. Highrise apartment buildings overlooking Barrancas de Belgrano.  Notable Attractions  The lush park Barrancas de Belgrano was designed by the famous French-Argentine landscape/park architect Carlos Thays, who designed many open spaces throughout Buenos Aires. Several blocks north of the Belgrano University, Barrancas de Belgrano spans several city blocks and is overlooked by highrise upper-middle class apartment buildings. On Manuel Belgrano square, a local artisan fair is held regularly, and becomes especially vibrant on weekends. It features a small bust of Manuel Belgrano on its middle spot. In the edge of the plaza lies the Inmaculada Concepci√≥n church, called \\"La Redonda\\" (the round one) by locals because of its circular plan. Many weddings are celebrated in this church in the afternoon hours. Two museums are also across Juramento and Cuba streets: Larreta and Sarmiento, respectively. Larreta museum focus on Spanish art. It is located on the former private residence of writer Enrique Larreta, designed by architect Ernesto Bunge on 1882. It features a well kept Andalusian garden. Historical Museum Sarmiento exhibits some objects belonging to former presidents Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Nicol√°s Avellaneda. It is located in what used to be Belgrano townhall, where the national congress held its sessions while Belgrano was the capital of the Argentine republic. Nearby, going down to Lower Belgrano (Bajo Belgrano), appears the Barrancas de Belgrano, three squares along together, older Rio de la Plata River natural terraces. Two blocks away, in Lower Bergrano there is the Estadio de Excursionistas, the local football team. Although neighboring Nu√±ez is widely known as the home of River Plate, its landmark stadium River Plate Stadium‚Äîalso home of the Argentina national football team‚Äîis located within the boundaries of Belgrano.

SPIE, Vol. 4102, p. 1, Inorganic Optical Materials II, Marker, A.J. and Arthurs, E.G., Eds. Such devices have found widespread use for various applications in the electro-optical field including: optical fibers for guided lightwave transmission, optical switches, laser amplifiers and lenses, hosts for solid-state lasers and optical window materials for gas lasers, and infrared (IR) heat seeking devices for missile guidance systems and IR night vision. Harris, D.C. (2009) \\"Materials for Infrared Windows and Domes: Properties and Performance\\", SPIE PRESS Monograph, Vol. PM70 (Int. Society of Optical Engineers, Bellingham WA) While single-crystalline ceramics may be largely defect-free (particularly within the spatial scale of the incident light wave), optical transparency in polycrystalline materials is limited by the amount of light that is scattered by their microstructural features. The amount of light scattering therefore depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, or light.Belyakov, A.V., \\"Production of Transparent Ceramics (Review)\\", Science for Ceramics Manufacture, Glass and Ceramics, Vol. 52, p. 14 (1995) For example, since visible light has a wavelength scale on the order of hundreds of nanometers, scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale. Most ceramic materials, such as alumina and its compounds, are formed from fine powders, yielding a fine grained polycrystalline microstructure that is filled with scattering centers comparable to the wavelength of visible light. Thus, they are generally opaque as opposed to transparent materials. Recent nanoscale technology, however, has made possible the production of (poly)crystalline transparent ceramics such as alumina Al2O3, yttria alumina garnet (YAG), and neodymium-doped Nd:YAG. Tachiwaki, T., et al., Novel synthesis of YAG leading to transparent ceramics\\", Solid State Communications, Vol. 119, p. 603 (2001)Lu, J., et al., \\"Neodymium doped YAG nanocrystalline ceramics ‚Äì a new generation of solid state laser and optical materials\\", J.

SPIE, Vol. 5786, p. 251 (Tustison, R.W., Ed., Window and Dome Technology and Materials IX, 2005) Introduction Synthetic sapphire - single-crystal aluminum oxide (sapphire ‚Äì Al2O3) is a transparent ceramic Transparent ceramics have recently acquired a high degree of interest and notoriety. Basic applications include lasers and cutting tools, transparent armor windows, night vision devices (NVD), and nose cones for heat seeking missiles. Currently available infrared (IR) transparent materials typically exhibit a trade-off between optical performance and mechanical strength. For example, sapphire (crystalline alumina) is very strong, but lacks full transparency throughout the 3‚Äì5 micrometer mid-IR range. Yttria is fully transparent from 3‚Äì5 micrometers, but lacks sufficient strength, hardness, and thermal shock resistance for high-performance aerospace applications. Not surprisingly, a combination of these two materials in the form of the yttria-alumina garnet (YAG) has proven to be one of the top performers in the field. In 1961, General Electric began selling transparent alumina Lucalox bulbs. In 1966, GE announced a ceramic \\"transparent as glass,\\" called Yttralox. In 2004, Anatoly Rosenflanz and colleagues at 3M used a \\"flame-spray\\" technique to alloy aluminium oxide (or alumina) with rare-earth metal oxides in order to produce high strength glass-ceramics with good optical properties. The method avoids many of the problems encountered in conventional glass forming and may be extensible to other oxides. This goal has been readily accomplished and amply demonstrated in laboratories and research facilities worldwide using the emerging chemical processing methods encompassed by the methods of sol-gel chemistry and nanotechnology. Barbaran, J.H., et al., \\"Synthesis of highly doped Nd:YAG powder by SOL-GEL method\\", Semiconductor Physics, Quantum Electronics and Optoelectronics, Vol. 8, p. 87 (2005) Many ceramic materials, both glassy and crystalline, have found use as hosts for solid-state lasers and as optical window materials for gas lasers. The first working laser was made by Theodore H. Maiman in 1960 at Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu, who had the edge on other research teams led by Charles H. Townes at Columbia University, Arthur Schawlow at Bell Labs, and Gould at TRG (Technical Research Group). Maiman used a solid-state light- pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Synthethic ruby lasers are still in use. Both sapphires and rubies are corundum, a crystalline form of aluminium oxide (Al2O3). =Crystals= Ruby lasers consist of single-crystal sapphire alumina (Al2O3) rods doped with a small concentration of chromium Cr, typically in the range of 0.05%. The end faces are highly polished with a planar and parallel configuration. Neodymium-doped YAG (Nd:YAG) has proven to be one of the best solid-state laser materials. Its indisputable dominance in a broad variety of laser applications is determined by a combination of high emission cross section with long spontaneous emission lifetime, high damage threshold, mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, and low thermal beam distortion. The fact that the Czochralski crystal growth of Nd:YAG is a matured, highly reproducible and relatively simple technological procedure adds significantly to the value of the material. Nd:YAG lasers are used in manufacturing for engraving, etching, or marking a variety of metals and plastics. They are extensively used in manufacturing for cutting and welding steel and various alloys. For automotive applications (cutting and welding steel) the power levels are typically 1‚Äì5 kW. Kingery, W.D., Bowen, H.K., and Uhlmann, D.R., Introduction to Ceramics, p. 690 (Wiley-Interscience, 2nd Edition, 2006) In addition, Nd:YAG lasers are used in ophthalmology to correct posterior capsular opacification, a condition that may occur after cataract surgery, and for peripheral iridotomy in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma, where it has superseded surgical iridectomy. Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers (wavelength 532 nm) are used for pan-retinal photocoagulation in patients with diabetic retinopathy. In oncology, Nd:YAG lasers can be used to remove skin cancers. These lasers are also used extensively in the field of cosmetic medicine for laser hair removal and the treatment of minor vascular defects such as spider veins on the face and legs. Recently used for dissecting cellulitis, a rare skin disease usually occurring on the scalp. Using hysteroscopy in the field of gynecology, the Nd:YAG laser has been used for removal of uterine septa within the inside of the uterus. In dentistry, Nd:YAG lasers are used for soft tissue surgeries in the oral cavity. Currently, high powered Nd:glass lasers as large as a football field are used for inertial confinement fusion, nuclear weapons research, and other high energy density physics experiments = Glasses = Glasses (non-crystalline ceramics) also are used widely as host materials for lasers. Relative to crystalline lasers, they offer improved flexibility in size and shape and may be readily manufactured as large, homogeneous, isotropic solids with excellent optical properties. The indices of refraction of glass laser hosts may be varied between approximately 1.5 and 2.0, and both the temperature coefficient of n and the strain-optical coefficient may be tailored by altering the chemical composition. Glasses have lower thermal conductivities than the alumina or YAG, however, which imposes limitations on their use in continuous and high repetition-rate applications. The principal differences between the behavior of glass and crystalline ceramic laser host materials are associated with the greater variation in the local environment of lasing ions in amorphous solids. This leads to a broadening of the fluorescent levels in glasses. For example, the width of the Nd3+ emission in YAG is ~ 10 angstroms as compared to ~ 300 angstroms in typical oxide glasses. The broadened fluorescent lines in glasses make it more difficult to obtain continuous wave laser operation (CW), relative to the same lasing ions in crystalline solid laser hosts. Several glasses are used in transparent armor, such as normal plate glass (soda-lime- silica), borosilicate glass, and fused silica. Plate glass has been the most common glass used due to its low cost. But greater requirements for the optical properties and ballistic performance have necessitated the development of new materials. Chemical or thermal treatments can increase the strength of glasses, and the controlled crystallization of certain glass compositions can produce optical quality glass-ceramics. Alstom Grid Ltd. currently produces a lithium di-silicate based glass-ceramic known as TransArm, for use in transparent armor systems. It has all the workability of an amorphous glass, but upon recrystallization it demonstrates properties similar to a crystalline ceramic. Vycor is 96% fused silica glass, which is crystal clear, lightweight and high strength. One advantage of these type of materials is that they can be produced in large sheets and other curved shapes. Patel, P.J., et al., Transparent Armor, The AMPTIAC Newsletter, Advanced Materials and Processes Technology, Vol. 4 (Fall, 2000) Sands, J.M., et al., (ARL) and Boyce, M.C. (MIT Mech. Engr.), Protecting the Future Force: Transparent Materials Safeguard the Army's Vision, Army Materials Research: Transforming Land Combat Through New Technologies, AMPTIAC Quarterly, Vol. 8 (2004) =Nanomaterials= It has been shown fairly recently that laser elements (amplifiers, switches, ion hosts, etc.) made from fine-grained ceramic nanomaterials‚Äîproduced by the low temperature sintering of high purity nanoparticles and powders‚Äîcan be produced at a relatively low cost. These components are free of internal stress or intrinsic birefringence, and allow relatively large doping levels or optimized custom-designed doping profiles. This highlights the use of ceramic nanomaterials as being particularly important for high-energy laser elements and applications. Primary scattering centers in polycrystalline nanomaterials‚Äîmade from the sintering of high purity nanoparticles and powders‚Äîinclude microstructural defects such as residual porosity and grain boundaries (see Transparent materials). Thus, opacity partly results from the incoherent scattering of light at internal surfaces and interfaces. In addition to porosity, most of the interfaces or internal surfaces in ceramic nanomaterials are in the form of grain boundaries which separate nanoscale regions of crystalline order. Moreover, when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced well below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the light scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. Lempicki, A. Transparent Ceramics ALEM Associates (2007) In the processing of high performance ceramic nanomaterials with superior opto-mechanical properties under adverse conditions, the size of the crystalline grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline particles present in the raw material during the synthesis or formation of the object. Thus a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (~ 0.5 Œºm or 500 nm) eliminates much of the light scattering, resulting in a translucent or even transparent material. Furthermore, results indicate that microscopic pores in sintered ceramic nanomaterials, mainly trapped at the junctions of microcrystalline grains, cause light to scatter and prevented true transparency. It has been observed that the total volume fraction of these nanoscale pores (both intergranular and intragranular porosity) must be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission, i.e. the density has to be 99.99% of the theoretical crystalline density. Lasers =Nd:YAG= For example, a 1.46 kW Nd:YAG laser has been demonstrated by Konoshima Chemical Co. in Japan. In addition, Livermore researchers realized that these fine-grained ceramic nanomaterials might greatly benefit high-powered lasers used in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Programs Directorate. In particular, a Livermore research team began to acquire advanced transparent nanomaterials from Konoshima to determine if they could meet the optical requirements needed for Livermore's Solid-State Heat Capacity Laser (SSHCL). Livermore researchers have also been testing applications of these materials for applications such as advanced drivers for laser-driven fusion power plants. Transparent Ceramics Spark Laser Technology, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (S&TR;, 2006) Assisted by several workers from the NIF, the Livermore team has produced 15 mm diameter samples of transparent Nd:YAG from nanoscale particles and powders, and determined the most important parameters affecting their quality. In these objects, the team largely followed the Japanese production and processing methodologies, and used an in house furnace to vacuum sinter the nanopowders. All specimens were then sent out for hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Finally, the components were returned to Livermore for coating and testing, with results indicating exceptional optical quality and properties. One Japanese/East Indian consortium has focused specifically on the spectroscopic and stimulated emission characteristics of Nd3+ in transparent YAG nanomaterials for laser applications. Their materials were synthesized using vacuum sintering techniques. The spectroscopic studies suggest overall improvement in absorption and emission and reduction in scattering loss. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope observations revealed an excellent optical quality with low pore volume and narrow grain boundary width. Fluorescence and Raman measurements reveal that the Nd3+ doped YAG nanomaterial is comparable in quality to its single-crystal counterpart in both its radiative and non-radiative properties. Individual Stark levels are obtained from the absorption and fluorescence spectra and are analyzed in order to identify the stimulated emission channels possible in the material. Laser performance studies favor the use of high dopant concentration in the design of an efficient microchip laser. With 4 at% dopant, the group obtained a slope efficiency of 40%. High-power laser experiments yield an optical-to- optical conversion efficiency of 30% for Nd (0.6 at%) YAG nanomaterial as compared to 34% for an Nd (0.6 at%) YAG single crystal. Optical gain measurements conducted in these materials also show values comparable to single crystal, supporting the contention that these materials could be suitable substitutes to single crystals in solid-state laser applications.Kuman, G.A., et el., IEEE Journ. Quantum Electronics, Vol. 40, p.747 (2004) =Yttria, Y2O3= The initial work in developing transparent yttrium oxide nanomaterials was carried out by General Electric in the 1960s. In 1966, a transparent ceramic, Yttralox, was invented by Dr. Richard C. Anderson at the General Electric Research Laboratory, with further work at GE's Metallurgy and Ceramics Laboratory by Drs. Paul J. Jorgensen, Joseph H. Rosolowski, and Douglas St. Pierre. Yttralox is \\"transparent as glass,\\" has a melting point twice as high, and transmits frequencies in the near infrared band as well as visible light. IR 100 Award, Yttralox, 1967 Gemstones of Yttralox transparent ceramic Richard C. Anderson holding a sample of Yttralox Further development of yttrium ceramic nanomaterials was carried out by General Electric in the 1970s in Schenectady and Cleveland, motivated by lighting and ceramic laser applications. Yttralox, transparent yttrium oxide Y2O3 containing ~ 10% thorium oxide (ThO2) was fabricated by Greskovich and Woods.Greskovich, C. and Woods, K.N., \\"Fabrication of Transparent ThO2-doped Y2O3\\", Bull. Amer. Ceram. Soc., Vol. 52, p. 473 (1973) The additive served to control grain growth during densification, so that porosity remained on grain boundaries and not trapped inside grains where it would be quite difficult to eliminate during the initial stages of sintering. Typically, as polycrystalline ceramics densify during heat treatment, grains grow in size while the remaining porosity decreases both in volume fraction and in size. Optically transparent ceramics must be virtually pore-free. GE's transparent Yttralox was followed by GTE's lanthana-doped yttria with similar level of additive.Rhodes, W.H., \\"Controlled Transient Solid State Second-Phase Sintering of Yttria\\", J. Am. Ceram. Soc., Vol. 64, p. 13 (1984) Both of these materials required extended firing times at temperatures above 2000 ¬∞C. La2O3 ‚Äì doped Y2O3 is of interest for infrared (IR) applications because it is one of the longest wavelength transmitting oxides. It is refractory with a melting point of 2430 ¬∞C and has a moderate coefficient of thermal expansion coefficient. The thermal shock and erosion resistance is considered to be intermediate among the oxides, but outstanding compared to non-oxide IR transmitting materials. A major consideration is the low emissivity of yttria, which limits background radiation upon heating. It is also known that the phonon edge gradually moves to shorter wavelengths as a material is heated.Rhodes, W.H. and Trickett, E.A., \\"Progress on Transparent Yttria\\", GTE Labs, Inc., (Defense Technical Information Center, 1984) In addition, ytrria itself, Y2O3 has been clearly identified as a prospective solid-state laser material. In particular, lasers with ytterbium as dopant allow the efficient operation both in cw operationKong, J., et al., \\"9.2-W diode-pumped Yb:Y2O3 ceramic laser\\", Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 86, p. 116 (2005) and in pulsed regimes.Tokurakawa, M., et al., \\"Diode-pumped 188 fs mode-locked Yb3+:Y2O3 ceramic laser\\", Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 90, p. 71 (2007) At high concentration of excitations (of order of 1%) and poor cooling, the quenching of emission at laser frequency and avalanche broadband emission takes place.Bisson, J.F., et al., \\"Switching of emissivity and photoconductivity in highly doped Yb3+:Y2O3 and Lu2O3 ceramics\\", Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 90, p. 201 (2007) =Future= The Livermore team is also exploring new ways to chemically synthesize the initial nanopowders. Borrowing on expertise developed in CMS over the past 5 years, the team is synthesizing nanopowders based on sol-gel processing, and then sintering them accordingly in order to obtain the solid-state laser components. Another technique being tested utilizes a combustion process in order to generate the powders by burning an organic solid containing yttrium, aluminum, and neodymium. The smoke is then collected, which consists of spherical nanoparticles. The Livermore team is also exploring new forming techniques (e.g. extrusion molding) which have the capacity to create more diverse, and possibly more complicated, shapes. These include shells and tubes for improved coupling to the pump light and for more efficient heat transfer. In addition, different materials can be co-extruded and then sintered into a monolithic transparent solid. An amplifier slab can formed so that part of the structure acts in guided lightwave transmission in order to focus pump light from laser diodes into regions with a high concentration of dopant ions near the slab center. In general, nanomaterials promise to greatly expand the availability of low-cost, high-end laser components in much larger sizes than would be possible with traditional single crystalline ceramics. Many classes of laser designs could benefit from nanomaterial-based laser structures such as amplifies with built-in edge claddings. Nanomaterials could also provide more robust and compact designs for high-peak power, fusion-class lasers for stockpile stewardship, as well as high-average-power lasers for global theater ICBM missile defense systems (e.g. Strategic Defense Initiative SDI, or more recently the Missile Defense Agency. Night vision Panoramic Night Vision Goggles in testing. A night vision device (NVD) is an optical instrument that allows images to be produced in levels of light approaching total darkness. They are most often used by the military and law enforcement agencies, but are available to civilian users. Night vision devices were first used in World War II, and came into wide use during the Vietnam War. The technology has evolved greatly since their introduction, leading to several \\"generations\\" of night vision equipment with performance increasing and price decreasing. The United States Air Force is experimenting with Panoramic Night Vision Goggles (PNVGs) which double the user's field of view to approximately 95 degrees by using four 16 mm image intensifiers tubes, rather than the more standard two 18 mm tubes. Thermal images are visual displays of the amount of infrared (IR) energy emitted, transmitted, and reflected by an object. Because there are multiple sources of the infrared energy, it is difficult to get an accurate temperature of an object using this method. A thermal imaging camera is capable of performing algorithms to interpret that data and build an image. Although the image shows the viewer an approximation of the temperature at which the object is operating, the camera is using multiple sources of data based on the areas surrounding the object to determine that value rather than detecting the temperature. Night vision infrared devices image in the near-infrared, just beyond the visual spectrum, and can see emitted or reflected near-infrared in complete visual darkness. All objects above the absolute zero temperature (0 K) emit infrared radiation. Hence, an excellent way to measure thermal variations is to use an infrared vision device, usually a focal plane array (FPA) infrared camera capable of detecting radiation in the mid (3 to 5 Œºm) and long (7 to 14 Œºm) wave infrared bands, denoted as MWIR and LWIR, corresponding to two of the high transmittance infrared windows. Abnormal temperature profiles at the surface of an object are an indication of a potential problem. Maldague X. P. V. and Moore, P.O., eds., Principles of Infrared and Thermal Testing, in Nondestructive Handbook, Infrared and Thermal Testing, Volume 3, 3rd edition, ASNT Press, Columbus (2001) Infrared thermography, thermal imaging, and thermal video, are examples of infrared imaging science. Thermal imaging cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900‚Äì14,000 nanometers or 0.9‚Äì14 Œºm) and produce images of that radiation, called thermograms. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects near room temperature, according to the black body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to see one's environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature. Therefore, thermography allows one to see variations in temperature. When viewed through a thermal imaging camera, warm objects stand out well against cooler backgrounds; humans and other warm-blooded animals become easily visible against the environment, day or night. As a result, thermography is particularly useful to the military and to security services. Thermogram of a lion =Thermography= In thermographic imaging, infrared radiation with wavelengths between 8‚Äì13 micrometers strikes the detector material, heating it, and thus changing its electrical resistance. This resistance change is measured and processed into temperatures which can be used to create an image. Unlike other types of infrared detecting equipment, microbolometers utilizing a transparent ceramic detector do not require cooling. Thus, a microbolometer is essentially an uncooled thermal sensor.Kumar, R.T. Rajendra, et al., Room temperature deposited vanadium oxide thin films for uncooled infrared detectors, Materials Research Bulletin, Vol. 38, p. 1235 (2003) The material used in the detector must demonstrate large changes in resistance as a result of minute changes in temperature. As the material is heated, due to the incoming infrared radiation, the resistance of the material decreases. This is related to the material's temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) specifically its negative temperature coefficient. Industry currently manufactures microbolometers that contain materials with TCRs near ‚àí2%. Maldague X. P. V., et al., \\"Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Infrared and Thermal Testing: Part 1. Principles of Infrared and Thermal Testing\\", in Nondestructive Handbook, Infrared and Thermal Testing, Vol. 3, 3rd Edn., Columbus, Ohio, ASNT Press (2001) p.718 =VO2 and V2O5= The most commonly used ceramic material in IR radiation microbolometers is vanadium oxide. The various crystalline forms of vanadium oxide include both VO2 and V2O5. Deposition at high temperatures and performing post-annealing allows for the production of thin films of these crystalline compounds with superior properties, which may be easily integrated into the fabrication process. VO2 has low resistance but undergoes a metal- insulator phase change near 67 ¬∞C and also has a lower TCR value. On the other hand, V2O5 exhibits high resistance and also high TCR. Other IR transparent ceramic materials that have been investigated include doped forms of CuO, MnO and SiO. Missiles Many ceramic nanomaterials of interest for transparent armor solutions are also used for electromagnetic (EM) windows. These applications include radomes, IR domes, sensor protection, and multi-spectral windows. Optical properties of the materials used for these applications are critical, as the transmission window and related cut-offs (UV ‚Äì IR) control the spectral bandwidth over which the window is operational. Not only must these materials possess abrasion resistance and strength properties common of most armor applications, but due to the extreme temperatures associated with the environment of military aircraft and missiles, they must also possess excellent thermal stability. Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted from the surface of an object which is due to the object's temperature. Infrared homing refers to a passive missile guidance system which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it. Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as \\"heat-seekers\\", since infrared is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background. Zarchan, P., Tactical and Strategic Missile Guidance, AIAA (2007) Mahulikar, S.P., Sonawane, H.R., & Rao, G.A., \\"Infrared signature studies of aerospace vehicles\\", Progress in Aerospace Sciences, Vol.43, p.218 (2006) =Sapphire= The current material of choice for high-speed infrared-guided missile domes is single-crystal sapphire. The optical transmission of sapphire does not extend to cover the entire mid- infrared range (3‚Äì5 Œºm), but starts to drop off at wavelengths greater than approximately 4.5 Œºm at room temperature. While the strength of sapphire is better than that of other available mid-range infrared dome materials at room temperature, it weakens above ~600 ¬∞C.Harris, D.C., \\"Overview Of Progress In Strengthening Sapphire At Elevated Temperatures\\", Proc. SPIE, Vol. 3705, p. 2 (1999) Limitations to larger area sapphires are often business related, in that larger induction furnaces and costly tooling dies are necessary in order to exceed current fabrication limits. However, as an industry, sapphire producers have remained competitive in the face of coating-hardened glass and new ceramic nanomaterials, and still managed to offer high performance and an expanded market. =Yttria, Y2O3= Alternative materials, such as yttrium oxide, offer better optical performance, but inferior mechanical durability. Future high-speed infrared-guided missiles will require new domes that are substantially more durable than those in use today, while still retaining maximum transparency across a wide wavelength range. A long-standing trade-off exists between optical bandpass and mechanical durability within the current collection of single-phase infrared transmitting materials, forcing missile designers to compromise on system performance. Optical nanocomposites may present the opportunity to engineer new materials that overcome this traditional compromise. The first full scale missile domes of transparent yttria manufactured from nanoscale ceramic powders were developed in the 1980s under Navy funding. Raytheon perfected and characterized its undoped polycrystalline yttria, while lanthana-doped yttria was similarly developed by GTE Labs. The two versions had comparable IR transmittance, fracture toughness, and thermal expansion, while the undoped version exhibited twice the value of thermal conductivity. Renewed interest in yttria windows and domes has prompted efforts to enhance mechanical properties by using nanoscale materials with submicrometer or nanosized grains. In one study, three vendors were selected to provide nanoscale powders for testing and evaluation, and they were compared to a conventional (5 Œºm) yttria powder previously used to prepare transparent yttria. While all of the nanopowders evaluated had impurity levels that were too high to allow processing to full transparency, 2 of them were processed to theoretical density and moderate transparency. Samples were sintered to a closed pore state at temperatures as low as 1400 C.Hogan, P., et al., \\"Transparent Yttria for IR Windows and Domes ‚Äì Past and Present\\", Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (10th DoD Electromagnetic Windows Symposium, 2004) After the relatively short sintering period, the component is placed in a hot isostatic press (HIP) and processed for 3 ‚Äì 10 hours at ~ 30 kpsi(~200 MPa) at a temperature similar to that of the initial sintering. The applied isostatic pressure provides additional driving force for densification by substantially increasing the atomic diffusion coefficients, which promotes additional viscous flow at or near grain boundaries and intergranular pores. Using this method, transparent yttria nanomaterials were produced at lower temperatures, shorter total firing times, and without extra additives which tend to reduce the thermal conductivity. Recently, a newer method has been developed by Mouzon, which relies on the methods of glass-encapsulation, combined with vacuum sintering at 1600 ¬∞C followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1500 ¬∞C of a highly agglomerated commercial powder. The use of evacuated glass capsules to perform HIP treatment allowed samples that showed open porosity after vacuum sintering to be sintered to transparency. The sintering response of the investigated powder was studied by careful microstructural observations using scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy both in reflection and transmission. The key to this method is to keep porosity intergranular during pre-sintering, so that it can be removed subsequently by HIP treatment. It was found that agglomerates of closely packed particles are helpful to reach that purpose, since they densify fully and leave only intergranular porosity.Mouzon, J., et al., \\"Fabrication of transparent yttria by HIP and the glass-encapsulation method\\", J. Euro. Ceram. Soc., Vol. 29, p. 311 (2009) =Composites= Prior to the work done at Raytheon, optical properties in nanocomposite ceramic materials had received little attention. Their studies clearly demonstrated near theoretical transmission in nanocomposite optical ceramics for the first time. The yttria/magnesia binary system is an ideal model system for nanocomposite formation. There is limited solid solubility in either one of the constituent phases, permitting a wide range of compositions to be investigated and compared to each other. According to the phase diagram, bi- phase mixtures are stable for all temperatures below ~ 2100 ¬∞C. In addition, neither yttria nor magnesia shows any absorption in the 3 ‚Äì 5 Œºm mid-range IR portion of the EM spectrum. In optical nanocomposites, two or more interpenetrating phases are mixed in a sub-micrometer grain sized, fully dense body. Infrared light scattering can be minimized (or even eliminated) in the material as long as the grain size of the individual phases is significantly smaller than infrared wavelengths. Experimental data suggests that limiting the grain size of the nanocomposite to approximately 1/15th of the wavelength of light is sufficient to limit scattering. Nanocomposites of yttria and magnesia have been produced with a grain size of approximately 200 nm. These materials have yielded good transmission in the 3‚Äì5 Œºm range and strengths higher than that for single-phase individual constituents.Stefanik, T., et al., \\"Nanocomposite Optical Ceramics for Infrared Widows and Domes\\", Proc. SPIE, Vol. 6545 (2007)Handbook of Optical Materials, Ed. Marvin Weber, Laser and Optical Science and Technology (CRC Press, 2002) Enhancement of mechanical properties in nanocomposite ceramic materials has been extensively studied. Significant increases in strength (2‚Äì5 times), toughness (1‚Äì4 times), and creep resistance have been observed in systems including SiC/Al2O3, SiC/Si3N4, SiC/MgO, and Al2O3/ZrO2.\\"Review: Structural Ceramic Nanocomposites\\", J. Europ. Ceram. Soc., Vol. 17, p. 1061 (1997)Nihara, K. et al., \\"New Nanocomposite Structural Ceramics\\", Mat. res. Soc. Symp. Proc., Vol. 286, p.405 (1993) Mechanical Properties of Ceramics, Wachtman, J.B., Cannon, W.R. and Matthewson, M.J. (John Wiley & Sons, 2009) The strengthening mechanisms observed vary depending on the material system, and there does not appear to be any general consensus regarding strengthening mechanisms, even within a given system. In the SiC/Al2O3 system, for example, it is widely known and accepted that the addition of SiC particles to the Al2O3 matrix results in a change of failure mechanism from intergranular (between grains) to intragranular (within grains) fracture. The explanations for improved strength include: *A simple reduction of processing flaw concentration during nanocomposite fabrication. *Reduction of the critical flaw size in the material‚Äîresulting in increased strength as predicted by the Hall-Petch relation) *Crack deflection at nanophase particles due to residual thermal stresses introduced upon cooling form processing temperatures. *Microcracking along stress-induced dislocations in the matrix material.Choi, S.M., and Awaji, H., \\"Nanocomposites:A New Materials Design Concept\\", Sci. Tech. Adv. Mat., Vol. 6, p. 2 (2005) Armor There is an increasing need in the military sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to transmit light around the visible (0.4‚Äì0.7 micrometers) and mid-infrared (1‚Äì5 micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring transparent armor. Transparent armor is a material or system of materials designed to be optically transparent, yet protect from fragmentation or ballistic impacts. The primary requirement for a transparent armor system is to not only defeat the designated threat but also provide a multi-hit capability with minimized distortion of surrounding areas. Transparent armor windows must also be compatible with night vision equipment. New materials that are thinner, lightweight, and offer better ballistic performance are being sought. Advances in Ceramic Armor IV. Part I: Transparent Glasses and Ceramics], Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings, Vol. 29 (Wiley, American Ceramic Society, 2008) Ashley, J., \\"Transparent Armor ‚Äì Will it be the next diamond in the rough?\\", RDECOM Magazine, U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (2006) Existing transparent armor systems typically have many layers, separated by polymer (e.g. polycarbonate) interlayers. The polymer interlayer is used to mitigate the stresses from thermal expansion mismatches, as well as to stop crack propagation from ceramic to polymer. The polycarbonate is also currently used in applications such as visors, face shields and laser protection goggles. The search for lighter materials has also led to investigations into other polymeric materials such as transparent nylons, polyurethane, and acrylics. The optical properties and durability of transparent plastics limit their use in armor applications. Investigations carried out in the 1970s had shown promise for the use of polyurethane as armor material, but the optical properties were not adequate for transparent armor applications. Several glasses are utilized in transparent armor, such as normal plate glass (soda- lime-silica), borosilicate glasses, and fused silica. Plate glass has been the most common glass used due to its low cost, but greater requirements for the optical properties and ballistic performance have generated the need for new materials. Chemical or thermal treatments can increase the strength of glasses, and the controlled crystallization of certain glass systems can produce transparent glass-ceramics. Alstom Grid Research & Technology (Stafford, UK), produced a lithium disilicate based glass-ceramic known as TransArm, for use in transparent armor systems with continuous production yielding vehicle windscreen sized pieces (and larger). The inherent advantages of glasses and glass-ceramics include having lower cost than most other ceramic materials, the ability to be produced in curved shapes, and the ability to be formed into large sheets.Klementa, R., et al., \\"Transparent armour materials\\", J. Euro. Cer. Soc., Vol. 28, p. 1091 (2008) Transparent crystalline ceramics are used to defeat advanced threats. Three major transparent candidates currently exist: aluminum oxynitride (AlON), magnesium aluminate spinel (spinel), and single crystal aluminum oxide (sapphire). =Aluminium oxynitride spinel= Aluminium oxynitride spinel (Al23O27N5), abbreviated as AlON, is one of the leading candidates for transparent armor. It is produced by the Surmet Corporation under the trademark ALON. The incorporation of nitrogen into aluminium oxide stabilizes a crystalline spinel phase, which due to its cubic crystal structure and unit cell, is an isotropic material which can be produced as transparent ceramic nanomaterial. Thus, fine-grained polycrystalline nanomaterials can be produced and formed into complex geometries using conventional ceramic forming techniques such as hot isostatic pressing, and slip casting. The Surmet Corporation has acquired Raytheon's ALON business and is currently building a market for this technology in the area of Transparent Armor, Sensor windows, Reconnaissance windows and IR Optics such as Lenses and Domes and as an alternative to quartz and sapphire in the semiconductor market. The AlON based transparent armor has been tested to stop multi-hit threats including of 30calAPM2 rounds and 50calAPM2 rounds successfully. The high hardness of AlON provides a scratch resistance which exceeds even the most durable coatings for glass scanner windows, such as those used in supermarkets. Surmet has successfully produced a 15\\"x18\\" curved AlON window and is currently attempting to scale up the technology and reduce the cost. In addition, the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force are both seeking development into next generation applications.Lundin, L., \\"Air Force testing new transparent armor\\", Air Force Research Laboratory Public Affairs (2005)Lundin, L., \\"AFRL tests transparent armor: Researchers investigate a transparent ceramic material that provides better protection than today's bulletproof glass at a fraction of the weight and thickness\\", Advanced Materials and Processes (November 2006) =Spinel= Magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) is a transparent ceramic with a cubic crystal structure with an excellent optical transmission from 0.2 to 5.5 micrometers in its polycrystalline form. Optical quality transparent spinel has been produced by sinter/HIP, hot pressing, and hot press/HIP operations, and it has been shown that the use of a hot isostatic press can improve its optical and physical properties.Bruch, A., General Electric, Transparent Magnesia-Alumina Spinel and Method, U.S. Patent 3516839 (1970) Spinel offers some processing advantages over AlON, such as the fact that spinel powder is available from commercial manufacturers while AlON powders are proprietary to Raytheon. It is also capable of being processed at much lower temperatures than AlON and has been shown to possess superior optical properties within the infrared (IR) region. The improved optical characteristics make spinel attractive in sensor applications where effective communication is impacted by the protective missile dome's absorption characteristics.Sands, J.M., et al., \\"Modelling transparent ceramics to improve military armour\\", Special Issue on Transparent Ceramics, Journ. Europ. Cer. Soc., Vol. 29, p. 261 (2009)Thewis, B.W. and Gordon, L.J., Method of preparing magnesia spinel, U.S. Patent 3304153 (1970) Spinel shows promise for many applications, but is currently not available in bulk form from any manufacturer, although efforts to commercialize spinel are underway. The spinel products business is being pursued by two key U.S. manufacturers: \\"Technology Assessment and Transfer\\" and the \\"Surmet Corporation\\". An extensive NRL review of the literature has indicated clearly that attempts to make high-quality spinel have failed to date because the densification dynamics of spinel are poorly understood. They have conducted extensive research into the dynamics involved during the densification of spinel. Their research has shown that LiF, although necessary, also has extremely adverse effects during the final stages of densification. Additionally, its distribution in the precursor spinel powders is of critical importance. Traditional bulk mixing processes used to mix LiF sintering aid into a powder leave fairly inhomogeneous distribution of Lif that must be homogenized by extended heat treatment times at elevated temperatures. The homogenizing temperature for Lif/Spinel occurs at the temperature of fast reaction between the LiF and the Al2O3. In order to avoid this detrimental reaction, they have developed a new process that uniformly coats the spinel particles with the sintering aid. This allows them to reduce the amount of Lif necessary for densification and to rapidly heat through the temperature of maximum reactivity. These developments have allowed NRL to fabricate MgAl2O4 spinel to high transparency with extremely high reproducibility that should enable military as well as commercial use of spinel.Villalobos, G.R., et al., \\"Transparent Ceramics: Magnesium Aluminate Spinel\\", Materials Science and Technology, NRL Review (2005) =Sapphire= Single-crystal aluminum oxide (sapphire ‚Äì Al2O3) is a transparent ceramic. Sapphire's crystal structure is rhombohedral and thus its properties are anisotropic, varying with crystallographic orientation. Transparent alumina is currently one of the most mature transparent ceramics from a production and application perspective, and is available from several manufacturers. But the cost is high due to the processing temperature involved, as well as machining costs to cut parts out of single crystal boules. It also has a very high mechanical strength ‚Äì but that is dependent on the surface finish. The high level of maturity of sapphire from a production and application standpoint can be attributed to two areas of business: electromagnetic spectrum windows for missiles and domes, and electronic/semiconductor industries and applications. There are current programs to scale-up sapphire grown by the heat exchanger method or edge defined film-fed growth (EFG) processes. Its maturity stems from its use as windows and in semiconductor industry. Crystal Systems Inc. which uses single crystal growth techniques, is currently scaling their sapphire boules to diameter and larger. Another producer, the Saint-Gobain Group produces transparent sapphire using an edge-defined growth technique. Sapphire grown by this technique produces an optically inferior material to that which is grown via single crystal techniques, but is much less expensive, and retains much of the hardness, transmission, and scratch-resistant characteristics. Saint- Gobain is currently capable of producing 0.43\\" thick (as grown) sapphire, in 12\\" √ó 18.5\\" sheets, as well as thick, single-curved sheets. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory is currently investigating use of this material in a laminate design for transparent armor systems. The Saint Gobain Group have commercialized the capability to meet flight requirements on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and F-22 Raptor next generation fighter aircraft. =Composites= Future high-speed infrared-guided missiles will require new dome materials that are substantially more durable than those in use today, while retaining maximum transparency across the entire operational spectrum or bandwidth. A long-standing compromise exists between optical bandpass and mechanical durability within the current group of single-phase (crystalline or glassy) IR transmitting ceramic materials, forcing missile designers to accept substandard overall system performance. Optical nanocomposites may provide the opportunity to engineer new materials that may overcome these traditional limitations. For example, transparent ceramic armor consisting of a lightweight composite has been formed by utilizing a face plate of transparent alumina Al2O3 (or magnesia MgO) with a back-up plate of transparent plastic. The two plates (bonded together with a transparent adhesive) afford complete ballistic protection against 0.30 AP M2 projectiles at 0¬∞ obliquity with a muzzle velocity of per second. Transparent ceramic composite armor, U.S. Patent H001519 (2002) Another transparent composite armor provided complete protection for small arms projectiles up to and including caliber .50 AP M2 projectiles consisting of two or more layers of transparent ceramic material.Transparent ceramic armor, U.S. Patent H001567 (2003)Navias, L., Magnesia alumina spinel articles and process of preparing same, U.S. Patent 3083123 (1965) Nanocomposites of yttria and magnesia have been produced with an average grain size of ~200 nm. These materials have exhibited near theoretical transmission in the 3 ‚Äì 5 Œºm IR band. Additionally, such composites have yielded higher strengths than those observed for single phase solid-state components. Despite a lack of agreement regarding mechanism of failure, it is widely accepted that nanocomposite ceramic materials can and do offer improved mechanical properties over those of single phase materials or nanomaterials of uniform chemical composition. Nanocomposite ceramic materials also offer interesting mechanical properties not achievable in other materials, such as superplastic flow and metal-like machinability. It is anticipated that further development will result in high strength, high transparency nanomaterials which are suitable for application as next generation armor.

It was founded in Columbus, Ohio on February 13, 1854. History The Republican National Convention at Cincinnati 1876 From the Civil War era, Ohio politics was dominated by the Republican Party, with Ohio Republicans playing key roles in the national party. As the National Republican party slowly began to change from a party affiliated with Northern States and into a socially conservative, neo-liberal economic party, so has the Ohio Republican Party. =Early years= President Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877) Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881) President James A. Garfield (1881) Early Ohio Republicans such as Salmon P. Chase staffed many important national offices. Chase coined the phrase \\"Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men\\". Starting in the 1880s, Ohio's Marcus A. Hanna was a significant power in the back rooms of the national Republican party. In the 1890s, Hanna led the conservative wing of the party against Theodore Roosevelt's progressive movement. In the 60 years from 1860 to 1920, Ohioans headed the Republican presidential ticket nine times, losing only twice. In 1912, Democrat Woodrow Wilson won with 40.96 percent of the vote, the Republican ticket was split, with Teddy Roosevelt leaving to start the Bull-Moose Party. In the 1916 election, Wilson won again with 49.24 percent of the vote. During the next three presidential elections, the Republican candidate won Ohio, until 1932 when Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state. FDR would win Ohio in 1932, 1936, and 1940. =Post New Deal= The national political upheaval that ushered in the New Deal era in the 1930s benefited the Ohio Democratic Party. Party politics in Ohio became very competitive, with Republicans and Democrats trading victories at all levels. During this time Robert A. Taft, known as \\"Mr. Republican,\\" became the leader of the conservative wing of the Republican party during a time when progressives controlled both major parties, and one of the most popular Senators in Ohio history. From the 1930s to the 1970s, Republicans still won the majority of elective offices in Ohio. Starting in the 1960s Ohio Democrats began to win more elections with rulings from the United States Supreme Court that required district representation be based on population and not land sized. The equalization of legislative districts shifted power to Ohio's cities and away from rural farmers. By the mid-1980s, Ohio government at all levels was dominated by Democrats. By 1990, the Republicans had won a majority on the Ohio Apportionment Board, which draws district lines for federal and state legislative seats. The 1992 adoption of term limits by referendum further strengthened the party's hand and 1992 marked the last victory by a Democrat (John Glenn) in a statewide race until 2006. =State of the party= Redistricting after the 2000 census combined with Ohio's term limits laws had Republican officeholders at the federal and state levels struggling with each other to draw federal congressional districts to create safe seats, with the interests of incumbent US representatives clashing with the interests of state legislators facing term limits looking to Congress for their next jobs. About 43 percent of the voters voted for Democrats in 2000. Joe Hallett wrote in the Columbus Dispatch (January 13, 2002): > Redistricting should be a happy process for Republicans.... But the task has > hardly been gleeful. Contrarily, it has turned into an embarrassment for > Republicans.... Eight-year term limits, more than the state budget, are to > blame. These days, state lawmakers constantly are scouting their next > jobs.... [V]isions of Congress dance in their heads. They want districts > ready-made for their ascensions. Meanwhile, congressional incumbents > constantly angle for districts they can't possibly lose. Although term limits were pushed by conservative Republican activists in the 1980s, they forced the retirement of Republican Speaker Jo Ann Davidson (R-Columbus) from the House of Representatives in 2001 as well as the leader of the conservative wing of the party, Deputy Speaker William G. Batchelder (R-Medina). In 2001, Republicans sought United States House of Representatives seats held by Democrats Sherrod Brown and Ted Strickland. The state legislature considered redrawing their districts. Critics allege the motivation was to aid in Republican victories. When Democrat Brown threatened to run for governor in 2002, if he lost his seat through redistricting, the legislature scrapped redistricting plans. Republican Governor Taft won re- election. Taft was challenged by Cuyahoga County commissioner Tim Hagan. Both Brown and Strickland held onto their congressional seats. By 2004, Republicans held all six statewide executive offices (governor/lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, auditor, and treasurer), a two-thirds majority in the state senate and house, a 5-2 majority on the Supreme Court, both seats in the US Senate, and 12 of Ohio's 18 seats in the US House of Representatives. In 2006, Democrats began to retake some statewide offices. These include all of the executive offices except State Auditor (including the governorship going to Ted Strickland over Republican challenger J. Kenneth Blackwell) and one of the seats in the US Senate (Sherrod Brown defeating incumbent Mike DeWine). Ohio Republicans still held ten seats in the US House of Representatives, one seat in the U.S. Senate, and a majority in both houses of the Ohio General Assembly. Between the election of Robert Cupp in 2007, the death of Chief Justice Thomas Moyer, and the appointment of Democrat Eric Brown in 2010, Republicans had controlled all seven seats on the Ohio Supreme Court previously. In 2008, Democratic Presidential Candidate Barack Obama defeated Republican Candidate John McCain in Ohio. In 2010, Republicans regained all of the statewide elected executive offices, including the governorship with the election of John Kasich, and regained the majority in the state House of Representatives and retaining the state Senate. Republicans also retained their seat in the U.S. Senate with the election of Rob Portman and retained a majority of the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition, 8th District Representative John Boehner was elected Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, making him third in line of succession (and the highest ranking Republican) to the Presidency of the United States. In November 2011, Gov. John Kasich's law that limits public worker's union bargain abilities was voted down by the people of Ohio. This was a major blow to the platform that Gov. Kasich ran on in 2010. Taft family political power The Taft Family has been one of the most powerful political families in US History. Robert Taft, Sr. was the first Taft to come to America, around the 1670s. The Ohio section of Taft's are descendants of Robert, Sr. President William H. Taft (1909-1913) President William McKinley (1897-1901) President Warren G. Harding (1921-1923) The start of the five generations of Taft's in politics was with Alphonso Taft. He was the founder of the Ohio political dynasty that is associated with the Republican Party. Alphonso was in President Ulysses S. Grant's Cabinet, first as Attorney General then as Secretary of War. He was later appointed US Ambassador to the Austria-Hungary Empire.Leonard, Lewis Alexander (1920). \\"The Life of Alphonso Taft\\", New York, NY: Hawke Publishing Co. Three of Alphonso's sons entered into politics also, former US Representative of Ohio's 1st District Charles Phelps Taft, former US President and Chief Justice of the United States William Howard Taft, and former Republican Party Delegate Henry Waters Taft. Both of William H. Taft's sons entered into politics. Robert A. Taft was a former US Senator and his other son Charles Phelps Taft II was former Mayor of Cincinnati. Both men were seen as great politicians. The next generation of Taft politicians came from two of Robert's children. Robert Taft, Jr. served in both houses of the US Congress. His brother William Howard Taft III was Ambassador to Ireland. The current generation of Tafts in politics are former Ohio Governor Bob Taft, son of Robert Taft Jr. William Howard Taft IV, son of William H. Taft III, has been an Ambassador to NATO and United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. Controversies In 2005, the Republican fundraiser and coin dealer Thomas Noe ran a rare coin fund that the State of Ohio had invested $50 million in. Soon valuable coins came up missing and an investigation discovered Noe had taken around $13 million from the fund. He was convicted in 2006 and was sentenced to 18 years in state prison. Noe was a top fundraiser for the George W. Bush campaign in Ohio in 2004, and the chairman for his campaign in Northwest Ohio. He was later convicted of making illegal contributions to the Bush campaign. Noe had ties to then Governor Bob Taft. It was discovered through this scandal that the Governor and some of his top aides took improper gifts from Noe and other lobbyist. In 2005, Gov. Taft was charged with four misdemeanors related to these gifts. This scandal had a negative effect on the Ohio Republican Party, who lost many seats in congress after 2006 and the Governorship went to Ted Strickland. In 2008, Barack Obama won Ohio's 20 electoral college votes on his way to the presidency.

Biography Kellogg was born in Worthington, Massachusetts and attended the common schools. He moved to Columbus, Ohio, in 1833 and then to Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1855 where he engaged in the lumber business with the firm Kellogg, White & Co. at Kelloggville (which was named after him) in Kent County, Michigan. He was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1857 and 1858. Kellogg was elected from Michigan as a Republican to United States House of Representatives for the 36th, 37th, and 38th Congresses, serving from March 4, 1859 to March 3, 1865. He represented Michigan's 3rd congressional district for his first two terms, then the 4th district after a redistricting. In all three contests, he defeated the former mayor of Grand Rapids, Thomas B. Church, in the general election. During the American Civil War, he organized the Second, Third, and Sixth Regiments by the authority of the United States Department of War. He was appointed as the colonel of the Third Michigan. During Reconstruction, he was appointed by U.S. President Andrew Johnson as collector of internal revenue for the southern district of Alabama on April 30, 1866, and served until July 1868, residing in Mobile, Alabama. Upon the re-admission of Alabama to the Union, Kellogg was elected to a partial term in Alabama's 1st congressional district to the 40th Congress, serving from July 22, 1868, to March 3, 1869. He was succeeded by fellow Republican Alfred Buck. Kellogg then moved to New York City and later to Alliance, Ohio, where he died. He is interred in Fulton Street Cemetery in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Adopting its nameplate from a marque of Ford Canada during the 1940s and 1950s, the Monarch was marketed as the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Granada in North America. Slotted between the Comet (replaced by the Zephyr for 1978) and the Montego (renamed the Cougar for 1977), a single generation of the Monarch was produced. Originally developed to replace the Comet, the Monarch was remarketed in response to the 1973 fuel crisis as Ford sought to introduce premium-content compact vehicles. Sharing its chassis underpinnings with the Comet/Maverick, the Monarch and Granada marked the final evolution of the 1960‚Äì1965 Ford Falcon platform architecture. Following the 1980 model year, the Monarch was discontinued, replaced by Cougar sedans and station wagons from 1981 and 1982. For 1983, the Cougar reverted to a coupe configuration, with other body designs adopting the Marquis nameplate (replaced by the Mercury Sable in 1986). Alongside the Granada, Ford assembled the Monarch at Mahwah Assembly (Mahwah, New Jersey) and Wayne Stamping & Assembly (Wayne, Michigan). In total, 575,567 Monarchs were produced. Development Developed as an extensively updated Mercury Comet for the 1975 model year, the Mercury Monarch originated as external circumstances outside of Ford Motor Company forced major changes in consumer buying habits. The 1973 fuel crisis would lead to buyers valuing luxury over performance, with fuel economy becoming a key attribute. As Ford predicted the compact segment would grow in sales, the Comet/Maverick would remain in production. For 1975, Ford introduced the restyled Maverick as the Ford Granada; the restyled Comet became Mercury Monarch. Although General Motors introduced the Buick Apollo (later Skylark) and Oldsmobile Omega in 1973, the Granada/Monarch would be one of a few vehicles that would break a long-standing tradition within American auto manufacturers of associating size with luxury. To differentiate the Granada/Monarch from the Maverick/Comet, Ford offered the new-generation vehicles with a number of comfort and convenience features in a compact- segment car.  Overview  = Chassis = As with the Ford Granada, the Mercury Monarch shared its unibody chassis with its Ford Maverick/Mercury Comet predecessors. Based heavily on the first-generation Ford Falcon from 1960, the design utilized coil spring front suspension with a leaf-sprung live rear axle; due to its Falcon origins, the Monarch was also loosely mechanically related to the first-generation Ford Mustang and Mercury Cougar. The base engine was a inline six-cylinder engine, with a inline six optional. V8 power came from one of two options: the or Windsor engines. = Body = Although originally developed to become the Mercury Comet, the Mercury Monarch was differentiated from the Comet produced alongside it in a number of ways. Using the Mercedes-Benz 280 as a benchmark for its styling and interior packaging, the Monarch abandoned the Coke bottle styling of the Comet for straighter-edged body panels. In the front, the Monarch adapted much of the styling of the Marquis (with single exposed headlights). While the roofline of the four-door model was heavily influenced by Mercedes-Benz, the two-door was given its own roofline with vertical opera windows. The rear featured horizontal wrap-around taillamps with amber reflectors and a color-keyed decorative trim panel with a fuel filler door. In 1978, the Monarch underwent an exterior facelift; the headlamps were converted from round to rectangular, with the turn signals moved under the headlamps. The taillamps were revised to all red lenses and the center trim panel was changed to a new design with an argent finish on base models and matching red reflector on top trim levels. On the inside, in contrast from other Lincoln-Mercury cars, the Monarch was equipped with front bucket seats. While a feature associated with sporty cars at the time, the individual seats (from the European Ford Granada) were chosen for their support and range of adjustment.http://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG5.htm In contrast to European cars, the wood-trimmed dashboard of the Monarch was equipped with three instruments: a speedometer, fuel gauge, and a clock.http://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG5.htm File:1976 Mercury Monarch (18847628439).jpg1976 Mercury Monarch (Shown with Ford Crown Victoria LX wheels) File:1976 Mercury Monarch (18846118970).jpg1976 Mercury Monarch File:Mercury Monarch (4498149535).jpg1978‚Äì1980 Mercury Monarch File:Mercury Monarch (4498148677).jpg1978‚Äì1980 Mercury Monarch File:Mercury Monarch (9174536515).jpgGrille and hood ornament = Trim = At its launch, the Monarch was available in two trim levels: base and Ghia. For 1977, the two- door coupe was produced in an S (Sports Coupe) trim. For 1978 and 1979, the ESS (European Sports Sedan) trim was available, distinguished by blacked-out exterior trim. Grand Monarch Ghia 1975 Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia The Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia was offered from 1975 to 1976, marketed as the highest-trim version of the Monarch. Adopting many features shared with the larger Marquis and Grand Marquis, the Grand Monarch Ghia offered a sophisticated central hydraulic power system and four-wheel disc brakes not used on the standard Monarch or Granada. According to the May 1976 edition of Car and Driver, three out of five of Ford top executives, including Henry Ford II, used the Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia as their personal car. Other standard Grand Monarch Ghia features included: * Leather trim * Vinyl roof * LCD clock * Leather-wrapped steering wheel * Power steering * Dual map lights * Illuminated visor vanity mirror (passenger side) * 14-inch cast-aluminum spoke wheels * Solid-state ignition * Whitewall steel-belted radial tires * Reclining bucket seats with matching map pockets * Plusher carpeting and soundproofing 1977 Lincoln Versailles (successor to Grand Monarch Ghia) For 1977, the Grand Monarch Ghia was withdrawn and repackaged as the Lincoln Versailles. Intended as a response to the Cadillac Seville, the Versailles adopted much of the content of the Grand Monarch Ghia with a slightly restyled exterior. Among one of the most controversial examples of badge engineering in the American automotive industry, the Lincoln Versailles was withdrawn during the 1980 model year.

The capital and seat of government is Awka. Onitsha, a historic port city from pre-colonial times is the largest urban area in the state. The state's theme is \\"Light of the Nation\\", formerly known as the \\" Home for all\\". Anambra has 181 towns within it. Etymology The name Anambra is the anglicized version of the river ·ªåmambala, the Igbo name of the Anambra River which flows through the state as the colonialists could not perfectly pronounce the name of the river. Location Boundaries are formed by Delta State to the west, Imo State and Rivers State to the south, Enugu State to the east, and Kogi State to the north. The name was derived from the Anambra River (Omambala) which flows through the area and is a tributary of the River Niger. The indigenous ethnic groups in Anambra state are the Igbo (99% of population) and small population of people who are bilingual ,they live mainly in the north-western part of the state. Anambra is the eighth-most populated state in the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the second-most densely populated state in Nigeria after Lagos State. The stretch of more than 45 km between the towns of Oba and Amorka contains a cluster of numerous thickly populated villages and small towns, giving the area an estimated average density of 1,500‚Äì2,000 persons per square kilometre. Natural resources Anambra is rich in natural gas, crude oil, bauxite, and ceramic. It has an almost 100 percent arable soil. Anambra state has many other resources in terms of agro-based activities such as fisheries and farming, as well as land cultivated for pasturing and animal husbandry. It has the lowest poverty rate in Nigeria. =Oil and gas= In the year 2006, a foundation-laying ceremony for the first Nigerian private refinery, Orient Petroleum Refinery (OPR), was made at Aguleri area., All Africa, 2006 The Orient Petroleum Resource Ltd, (OPRL) owners of OPR, was licensed in June 2002, by the Federal Government to construct a private refinery with a capacity of . In 2012, following the efforts of Governor Peter Obi and other stakeholders of Orient Petroleum, Anambra State became an oil-producing state. The indigenous company struck oil in the Anambra River basin. On 2 August 2015, the management of Orient Petroleum Resources Plc said the company planned to increase its crude oil production to 3,000 barrels per day by September 2015, as it stepped up production activities in two new oil wells in its Aguleri oil fields. An indigenous company, Nails and Stanley Ltd, was to establish a gas plant at Umueje in Ayamelum Local Government Area to support economic activities in the oil and gas industry in the state. Urbanization and structural planning Since the late 1990s, there has been a migration from rural to urban areas in the state, resulting in Anambra becoming a highly urbanized state: 62% of its population lives in urban areas. In October 2015, the APGA-led state government of Willie Obiano signed a memorandum of understanding with Galway modular housing company, Affordable Building Concepts International, for 10,000 housing units to be built in the state. Given decades of neglect of infrastructure and bad governance, the shift in human migration has posed problems for the state. Infrastructure improvements, both physical and social, have lagged behind the growth in population. There are problems in environmental sanitation, erosion control, and provision of social services. Major cities have become characterized by inadequate and deteriorated road networks and walkways, unregulated building patterns, poor sanitation, uncontrolled street trading, mountains of garbage, and chaotic transport systems, creating congestion, noise pollution, and overcrowding. The government of Peter Obi, with the assistance of the UN-HABITAT, produced 20-year structural plans (2009‚Äì2028) for three major cities in the State: Onitsha, Nnewi and Awka Capital Territory, to restore urban planning and guide their growth into the future. The plans contain policies and proposals for land use, city beautification, road infrastructure, industrial development, housing, waste disposal, water supply and health and educational facilities to turn the cities into successful urban areas that can generate employment and wealth, and provide high living standards for their residents. Anambra became the first state in Nigeria to adopt structural Plans for its cities. With effective implementation, it should systematically grow as a major economic center in Nigeria and West Africa. The process of urbanization is fairly contributed by population growth, immigration, migration, and infrastructure initiatives like good road, water, power, and gardens, resulting in the growth of villages into towns, town into cities and cities into metros. To have ecologically feasible development, planning requires an understanding of the growth dynamics. There is a fear that if too many people leave the villages, only the aged men and women will be left to farm. This pattern has been seen in Amesi, Akpo, and Achina towns in Aguata local government area. They have been important in the production of yam, Cocoyam, and cassava through consistent agriculture, but such activities have suffered due to the out- migration of youth to the urban centres. There has been both food scarcity in the region and over-population in urban areas. To upgrade the State capital and improve traffic, Awka, Governor Willie Obiano signed off on construction of three fly-overs between the Amawbia and Arroma end of the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway, a distance of about three kilometres within the city. Culture and tourism Ogbunike Caves, listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, is one of the most visited tourist sites in Anambra State. It is classified as a Sandstone cave (Lateritic sandstones of Campanian-Miocene age). The Owerre Ezukala caves and waterfalls are great tourist attractions in the State. Largely unexplored, the caves are said the be the largest in West Africa. Igbo-Ukwu, Anambra State Igbo Ukwu Museum: Igbo Ukwu is an ancient town known for its astonishing metal crafts; it continues to attract tourists to see its bronze artifacts. First noticed in 1938, the bronzes were later excavated by Thurstan Shaw (an English archaeologist). They have been dated to the 9th century, and are of high value and historic relevance. Onugbu soup is a famous dish from the state. Education Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, the state capital, is also the center of Nigeria's metalwork and carving industries. Educationally, Anambra is a centre of excellence. There are the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK), Awka, and a federal university with a College of Medicine situated at Nnewi. The UNIZIK Nnewi runs a modern teaching hospital, with facilities also at Umunya and Ukpo. UNIZIK also has faculty of pharmaceutical sciences at Agulu, a School of Preliminary studies at Mbaukwu, and a College of Agriculture. Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, formerly known as Anambra State University, and formerly known as Anambra State University of Science and Technology (ASUTECH), has two campuses, one in Uli, and another at Igbariam; the Federal Polytechnic, Oko; Nwafor Orizu University of Education (formerly known as the Nwafor Orizu College of Education), Nsugbe. Private universities include The Tansian University, Umunya; Madonna University, Okija; St Paul's University, Awka and St Peter‚Äôs University, Achina with a campus at Onneh Town. The UA College of Science & Technology Isuofia- the only accredited private polytechnic in the state and Aguata .www.uapoly.org ,now The University of America College of Science and Technology. www.uan.edu.ng. Literacy rate in the state is comparatively high compared to other states. Anambra State students have won laurels nationally and internationally in recent times. This is a pointer to the literacy rate of the State when compared to others. Primary and secondary school enrollment in the state is one of the highest in the country. Consequently, Anambra state has the highest number of JAMB candidates going after the limited number of spaces in Nigeria's tertiary colleges. Since 2011/2012 till date (2014), its students have had the best results in both WAEC and NECO-conducted senior secondary school examinations. Politics Anambra's political history can be described as varied. Until the early 21st century, it was marked by considerable unrest. Having a long list of \\"firsts\\" in Nigerian history, it has been known by the sobriquet as \\"The Light of The Nation\\". On 29 May 1999, Chinwoke Mbadinuju was sworn in as civilian governor of Anambra state, after many years of military rule. His administration was marred by deep problems: the most notable was withholding of teachers' salaries in the school. The teachers finally conducted a ten-month strike in all the government secondary schools in the state. Before Mbadinuju's rule, secondary education had been free of charge. But his administration imposed a tuition fee of 3,000 Naira per term for all secondary schools, which led to an unprecedented massive demonstration by secondary school students from all over the state. Many people attribute Mbadinuju's failure to political godfathers; his successor also struggled. On 26 May 2003, Chris Ngige was sworn in as the new governor of the state, but he was removed in March 2006 after Peter Obi of APGA filed charges against him of electoral malpractice. The Court of Appeal in Enugu asserted that Ngige's apparent victory in the 2003 election was fraudulent and ordered him to leave the seat. Obi was ousted by a faction of the Anambra State House of Assembly on 2 November 2006 and replaced by Virginia Etiaba, his deputy. On 9 February 2007, Mrs. Etiaba handed power back to Obi after the Court of Appeal had nullified Obi's removal. On 14 April 2007, Andy Uba of PDP was \\"elected\\" as the new governor of the state and, on 29 May, was sworn in. Reported to be massively rigged, the election was widely criticised. On 14 June 2007 the Supreme Court of Nigeria ruled that Peter Obi's tenure had not ended; therefore there was no vacancy in the governorship. It removed Andy Uba from office and replaced him with his predecessor Obi. On 6 February 2010, Peter Obi was re-elected governor for a second term of four years, after a hot contest with Chris Ngige, a former governor of the state; Prof. Charles Soludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria; and Andy Uba, who was a strong voice in the state's politics. Other contenders included Mrs Uche Ekwunife, Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu, and many others. Twenty-five contestants ran for the office. Obi was affirmed as the winner of the election, having more than 30% votes above the immediate runner-up. Chief Willie Obiano was sworn in on 17 March 2014 after winning 16 November 2013 election. Governor Willie Obiano of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) was sworn in for a second term in office on 17 March 2018 after the victory at 18 November 2017 elections. Cities and administrative divisions With an annual population growth rate of 2.21 percent per annum, Anambra State has over 60% of its people living in urban areas. It is one of the most urbanized states in Nigeria. The major urban centres of Anambra state are Onitsha, including Okpoko town,Ogbaru; Nnewi, and Awka, the state capital. Awka and Onitsha had developed as pre-colonial urban centres: Awka was the craft industrial centre of the Nri hegemony. Onitsha is a city state on the Niger, having developed as a river port and commercial centre. Onitsha is a fast-growing commercial city, and has developed to become a huge conurbation extending to Idemili, Oyi and Anambra East LGAs, with one of the largest markets in West Africa. In 2012 the tri-city area was dubbed the Onitsha-Nnewi-Awka (ONA) Industrial Axis, in recognition if the expanding industrial capacity. Nnewi (sometimes called the Taiwan of Nigeria) is a rapidly developing industrial and commercial centre. Designated as the state capital, Awka has regained its precolonial administrative eminence. Other main towns of Anambra state are: Abagana, Abba, Abacha, Umueri, Abatete, Achalla, Achina, Adazi Ani, Adazi-Enu, Adazi-Nnukwu, Agukwu, Aguleri, Agulu, Aguluezechukwu, Aguluzigbo, Ajalli, Akpo, Akpu, Akwaeze, Akwukwu, Alor, Amaetiti, Amansea, Amanuke, Amaokpala, Amawbia, Amesi, Amichi, Amorka, Anam, Anaku, Atani, Awa, Umueri , Awba-Ofemili, Awgbu, Awka-Etiti, Awkuzu, Azia, Azigbo, Ebenator Ozulogu, Ebenebe, Ekwulobia, Ekwulumili, Enugwu-Agidi, Enugwu Aguleri, Enugwu Ukwu, Ezinifite, Ezinihite, Eziowelle, Ezira, Ichi, Ichida, Ideani, Ifitedunu, Ifite-Ogwari, Igbakwu, Igbariam, Igbedor, Igbo-Ukwu, Ihembosi, Ihiala, Ikenga, Inoma, Iseke, Isuaniocha, Isulo, Isuofia, Lilu, Mbosi, Mgbakwu, Mmiata Anam, Nando, Nanka, Nawfia, Nawfija, Nawgu, Ndikelionwu, Ndi-okpaleke, Ndiukwuenu, Nibo, Nimo, Nise, Nkpologwu, Nkpor, Nkwelle-Ezunaka, Neni, Nnobi, Nnokwa, Nsugbe, Nteje, Nzam, Oba, Obeledu, Obosi, Ochuche-Umuodu, Ogbunike, Ogbunka, Ogidi, Ojoto, Okija, Oko, Okpeze, Omasi, Omogho, Omor, Onneh, Ora-Eri, Oraifite, Oraukwu, Orsumoghu, Ossomala, Osumenyi, Owellezukala, Owelle-Olumbanasa, Ozubulu, Ubuluisiuzor, Ufuma, Uga, Ugbenne, Ugbenu, Uke, Ukpo, Ukpor, Ukwalla- Olumbanasa, Ukwulu, Uli, Umuanaga, Umuawulu, Umuchu, Umudioka, Umueje, Umuerum, Umueze Anam, Umuoba Anam, Umudora Anam, Umumbo, Umunnachi, Umunya, Umunze, Umuoji, Umuomaku, Umuona Unubi,Odekpe-Oluumbanasa(11), Utuh,Odeh- Olumbanasa(11), Igbokenyi Olumbanasa(11) Odomagwu-Olumbanasa(11), Allah/Onugwa-Olumbanasa(11). = Local Government Areas = Anambra State LGA Map Anambra State consists of twenty-one (21) Local Government Areas. They are: * Aguata * Awka North * Awka South * Anambra East * Anambra West * Anaocha * Ayamelum * Dunukofia * Ekwusigo * Idemili North * Idemili South * Ihiala * Njikoka * Nnewi North * Nnewi South * Ogbaru * Onitsha North * Onitsha South * Orumba North * Orumba South * Oyi History Anambra's history stretches to the 9th century AD, as revealed by archaeological excavations at Igbo-Ukwu and Ezira. It has great works of art in iron, bronze, copper, and pottery works belonging to the ancient Kingdom of Nri. These have revealed a sophisticated divine Kingship administrative system, which held sway in the area of Anambra from c. 948 AD to 1911. In some towns, such as Ogidi and others, local families had hereditary rights to kingship for centuries. Great Britain recognised some of these traditional kings and leaders in their system of indirect rule of the Protectorate of South Nigeria. Beginning in the 19th century, they appointed some noble leaders as Warrant Chiefs, authorizing them to collect taxes, among other duties. Anambra is in the Igbo-dominated area that seceded as part of an independent Biafra in 1967, following rising tensions with Northern Nigeria. During the Nigerian/Biafran war (1967-1970), Biafran engineers constructed a relief airstrip in the town of Uli/Amorka (code named \\"Annabelle\\"). Extremely dangerous relief flights took off from Sao Tome and other sites loaded with tons of food and medicine for the distressed Biafran population. Uli/Amorka airstrip was the site where American pilots such as Alex Nicoll, and scores of others, delivered tons of relief supplies to the Biafran population. Disgusted by the suffering and mounting death toll in Biafra from starvation, as well as the continuous harassment of the relief planes by the Nigerian Airforce, Carl Gustaf von Rosen resigned as a Red Cross relief pilot. He helped Biafra to form an airforce of five Minicoin planes Malm√∂ MFI-9 stationed at the Uga airstrip. He named his tiny but effective airforce \\"Babies of Biafra\\" in honour of the babies who died from starvation inside Biafra. Old Anambra State was created in 1976 from part of East Central State, and its capital was Enugu. In 1991 a re-organisation divided Anambra into two states, Anambra and Enugu. The capital of Anambra is Awka.

He was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York City, graduated with degrees in Biology and Humanities from M.I.T. in 1980, and got a Masters in English Literature from the University of Chicago in 1981. He was active in the Greenwich Village music scene in the 1980s, attending the Cornelia Street Songwriters Exchange and performing at Folk City and Speak Easy while working on a PhD in Poetics from New York University. He also helped to edit the Fast Folk Musical Magazine (now part of the Smithsonian-Folkways collection) and recorded songs for a dozen issues. After earning his PhD in 1991, he worked as an English professor until 1994, when he began writing and performing full-time. Over the next 10 years he toured mainly in the Northeast and Midwest, with several short tours in Europe and one in Israel. In 1999 he was appointed Connecticut State Troubadour. In the fall of 2003, he enrolled in medical school at the University of Connecticut and became an MD. He currently practices family medicine in Hartford, Connecticut, and continues to perform as part of a folk quintet, The Faithful Sky with long-time collaborators including Jim Mercik.  Recordings  Blumenfeld's first album, The Strong in Spirit, was self-released as an LP in late 1987. It featured performances by Lucy Kaplansky, Marshal Rosenberg, Kenny Kosek and Mark Dann, and was produced by David Seitz. It includes \\"Let Me Fall In Love Before the Spring Comes,\\" which was later included in on a Winter's Night, a popular compilation edited by Christine Lavin. In 1993, Barehanded became the first release of the New York-based independent label Prime-CD. In 1996, Blumenfeld released Mozart's Money, a more highly produced album that helped him gain a national audience through reviews and indie radio airplay. AllMusic praised it as a leap forwards with its more \\"confident\\" and \\"radio-friendly\\" sound. Lucy Kaplansky and Mark Dann feature prominently and are joined by Michael Visceglia (of Suzanne Vega's band) and Mindy Jostyn. Rocket Science, the last of his Prime-CD recordings, came out in 1998; AllMusic noted its \\"brave\\", \\"bold\\" and \\"endearingly honest songs\\" in a 3/5 review. In 2000, he recorded Big Red in Switzerland for the Brambus record label with percussionist Shane Shannahan, who later joined Yo Yo Ma's Silk Road Project, and popular Swiss country music singer Doris Ackermann. In 2010, his CD Dad was released on Waterbug Records.

If ‚àíf is supermodular then f is called submodular, and if the inequality is changed to an equality the function is modular. If f is twice continuously differentiable, then supermodularity is equivalent to the conditionThe equivalence between the definition of supermodularity and its calculus formulation is sometimes called Topkis' characterization theorem. See : \\\\frac{\\\\partial ^2 f}{\\\\partial z_i\\\\, \\\\partial z_j} \\\\geq 0 \\\\mbox{ for all } i eq j. Supermodularity in economics and game theory The concept of supermodularity is used in the social sciences to analyze how one agent's decision affects the incentives of others. Consider a symmetric game with a smooth payoff function \\\\,f defined over actions \\\\,z_i of two or more players i \\\\in {1,2,\\\\dots,N}. Suppose the action space is continuous; for simplicity, suppose each action is chosen from an interval: z_i \\\\in [a,b]. In this context, supermodularity of \\\\,f implies that an increase in player \\\\,i's choice \\\\,z_i increases the marginal payoff df/dz_j of action \\\\,z_j for all other players \\\\,j. That is, if any player \\\\,i chooses a higher \\\\,z_i, all other players \\\\,j have an incentive to raise their choices \\\\,z_j too. Following the terminology of Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer (1985), economists call this situation strategic complementarity, because players' strategies are complements to each other. This is the basic property underlying examples of multiple equilibria in coordination games. The opposite case of submodularity of \\\\,f corresponds to the situation of strategic substitutability. An increase in \\\\,z_i lowers the marginal payoff to all other player's choices \\\\,z_j, so strategies are substitutes. That is, if \\\\,i chooses a higher \\\\,z_i, other players have an incentive to pick a lower \\\\,z_j. For example, Bulow et al. consider the interactions of many imperfectly competitive firms. When an increase in output by one firm raises the marginal revenues of the other firms, production decisions are strategic complements. When an increase in output by one firm lowers the marginal revenues of the other firms, production decisions are strategic substitutes. A supermodular utility function is often related to complementary goods. However, this view is disputed. Submodular functions of subsets Supermodularity and submodularity are also defined for functions defined over subsets of a larger set. Intuitively, a submodular function over the subsets demonstrates \\"diminishing returns\\". There are specialized techniques for optimizing submodular functions. Let S be a finite set. A function f\\\\colon 2^S \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is submodular if for any A \\\\subset B \\\\subset S and x \\\\in S \\\\setminus B, f(A \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\})-f(A) \\\\geq f(B \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\})-f(B). For supermodularity, the inequality is reversed. The definition of submodularity can equivalently be formulated as : f(A)+f(B) \\\\geq f(A \\\\cap B) + f(A \\\\cup B) for all subsets A and B of S.

Introduced as the highest trim level of the full-size Ford model range, the LTD introduced options and features normally reserved for more luxurious Lincoln and Mercury models. The largest vehicle produced by Ford in North America for most of its production, the LTD was joined by the intermediate Ford LTD II from 1977 to 1979; the LTD II served as the replacement for the Torino/Gran Torino range. At various times throughout its production, the LTD range included two- and four-door pillared and hardtop sedans, a two-door convertible, and the Country Squire five-door woodgrain station wagon. For the 1979 model year, the LTD was downsized, becoming externally smaller than the LTD II, and for 1983, it became a mid-size car. The Ford Granada was discontinued, with the LTD nameplate moving to a restyled version of that car; the full-size LTD then became LTD Crown Victoria. The mid-size LTD was replaced by the 1986 Ford Taurus, as Ford continued its shift towards front-wheel drive vehicles. Outside of North America, the 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 was manufactured in South America into the 1980s and marketed as the Ford LTD. Etymology The LTD designation has been speculated by some to be an abbreviation of \\"Luxury Trim Decor\\" and by others as a \\"Limited\\" trim designation for the Galaxie. There is evidence in early 1970s Australian LTD sales brochures, that \\"Lincoln Type Design\\" was adapted by Ford's Australian marketing, as the meaning of the LTD nameplate to play up Lincoln-like exclusitivity and design influence of its Falcon-based LTD luxury car, since actual Lincoln models were not sold in that country. However, there is no evidence of \\"Lincoln Type Design\\" nor any other meaning ever being used in brochures or advertising copy of North American sales literature. The original Car Life review at the time the first Galaxie 500 LTD was released suggests that \\"LTD\\" stood for nothing and was ambiguous in meaning. First generation (1965‚Äì1968) For the 1965 model year, Ford introduced an all-new design for its full-size model range. To further expand its flagship Galaxie 500 series, the 500 LTD was introduced. Sharing top billing within the Galaxie series with the performance 500XL, the 500 LTD was designed as a luxury-oriented vehicle, offering many features of more expensive vehicles under the lower price of the Ford nameplate. In line with Cadillac and Imperial (and its own Lincoln-Mercury offerings), the LTD offered features and options such as power windows, power driver's seat, power brakes, power steering, air conditioning, and a full or half-vinyl top (called a landau or brougham interchangeably by the same manufacturers). Ford offered the Galaxie 500 LTD in two body styles: a two-door hardtop and a four-door hardtop. The launch of the LTD would lead to several responses from other American manufacturers. As a mid-year introduction, Chevrolet introduced the Caprice (its closest rival), with 1966 bringing the AMC Ambassador DPL, Plymouth Fury VIP, and Dodge Monaco. As with the LTD, all of these model lines were full-size sedans/hardtops offered with higher-trim features and content. For 1966, the Galaxie name was dropped from the LTD, making it a nameplate in its own right. Along with the rest of the Galaxie line, the LTD received a minor exterior revision, including a split grille. Front disc brakes became an option. For 1967, the LTD underwent several changes, with a four-door pillared sedan joining the model range. To comply with federally-mandated safety regulations, the LTD received a padded steering wheel, non-protruding instrument panel knobs, a dual-circuit brake master cylinder, four-way hazard flashers, and front outboard shoulder belt mounting points. While the roofline of the four-door hardtop saw minor styling revisions, the two-door hardtop saw extensive changes, giving it a formal profile. The front seats saw a new option, Twin Comfort Lounge Seats (a 50/50 split bench seat). In various forms, the configuration would be adopted by American automakers into the early 2000s. For the first time, the LTD was produced with a direct Lincoln- Mercury counterpart, as Mercury introduced the Marquis two-door hardtop. Serving largely as a preview of the upcoming major redesign, the 1968 LTD adopted several minor revisions of its own. The 1965-1967 LTD was repackaged as the optional LTD Brougham trim, with a newly base LTD slotted between the Brougham and Galaxie 500. For the first time, the LTD badge was added to the wood-trimmed Country Squire station wagon (as part of the distinct Ford station wagon series, it did not fully adopt the LTD name until 1969). While the two-door hardtop saw slight changes to its roofline, four-door hardtops were restyled to more closely match their two-door counterparts, with the rear doors receiving more curves to their greenhouse design. The vertically-stacked headlamps introduced in 1965 were replaced by a hidden headlamps; shared with Lincoln-Mercury, the configuration would be a design feature denoting the top- trim LTD for the next decade. The hidden-headlamp system was operated by engine vacuum; if the system were to fail, the headlamp doors retracted up to ensure the headlamps were visible. The model year also saw further changes to comply with safety regulations. Along with the addition of side marker lights and reflectors, the parking lights illuminated with the headlights; front outboard shoulder belts were fitted to cars built effective January 1, 1968. The padded steering wheel was replaced, following the addition of an energy- absorbing steering column.

At least one example was built by Lehmann-Peterson. This car does not appear to have a B-pillar or a division window. Andy Hotton Associates also built about 10 examples of an LTD limo, in which the extra length was added at the B-pillar and C-pillar. Second generation (1969‚Äì1978) For the 1969 model year, the LTD was given a major redesign. Based on a largely carryover chassis, the wheelbase of all full-size Ford sedans now stretched to 121 inches. = Timeline = 1969:Ford LTD is given a redesign on a longer (121-inch) wheelbase chassis; the hidden headlights and formal roofline introduced in 1967 are retained. An all-new body features a split grille with a horizontal center divider (shared with XLs and Country Squires).Odin, L.C. A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full- size automobile production 1969‚Äì1978. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K. *1970: The split grille was discontinued; while its Mercury Marquis counterpart continues its Lincoln-style fascia, Ford redesigned the front end of the LTD with a three-segment grille with a prominent center section (a toned down version of the Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation)). All LTDs got a new Federally-mandated locking steering column and wheel, with the ignition switch located on the right side of the column. *1971: The LTD was given a styling update. In the rear, the long-running Ford styling tradition ended as the twin round or square \\"jet exhaust\\" taillights were replaced by horizontal taillights on all full-size Fords. In between the two tail lamps was a center \\"third\\" brakelight; on the Galaxie 500, this space was an alloy trim panel while Custom 500s had body-color trim. In front, the LTD lost its hidden headlamps to Lincoln-Mercury, but got a new front end treatment with a tall center grille section and \\"LTD\\" spelled out in block letters on the hood. With the discontinuation of the XL series, the convertible was moved to the LTD line. These were produced with bucket seats and center consoles; the console was similar to the console in the XLs and Mercury Marauders of 1969‚Äì1970, with a \\"stirrup\\" style shift handle. A modified 1971 Ford Custom is featured prominently in the 1973 American film White Lightning. It is the car driven by the film‚Äôs lead character, portrayed by Burt Reynolds. *1972: 1972 models were virtually the same as the 1971s, although the bumper now stretched across the lower section of the grille. A new rear bumper integrated the taillights; also in the rear, the design of the trunklid was squared off. Due to decreased demand in the segment, 1972 was the final model year for the LTD convertible. *1973: In 1973, in order to comply with federal regulations, the LTD was given a major redesign for the model year. The requirements for 5-mph front bumpers had taken effect, with larger rear bumpers to be added in 1974. While the redesign slightly decreased the weight of the LTD, it still was far in excess of two tons, making agility and fuel economy both key weak points. The new styling was bulkier, making the car look significantly larger and heavier than previous models. Four-door models (sharing rooflines with Mercury) were given thin B-pillars for roof reinforcement and branded as \\"pillared hardtops\\" (frameless door glass remained on all Ford LTD models). The 460 engine became an option for the first time in 1974. *1974: Five-mph bumpers added to the rear. Mostly carryover from the 1973 model year. Mid- year, a non-woodgrain LTD wagon became available. A new Federal law required seat belts to be buckled before the starter would operate; public protests prompted the government to relax this requirement. Subsequent models got a simple \\"Fasten Seat Belt\\" warning light and buzzer for 1975, and owners were now permitted to disable the starter interlock on their 1974s. *1975: Following the discontinuation of the Galaxie series after 1974, Ford sought to fill its place by expanding the LTD trim lineup. Above the Custom 500 was the standard LTD, the LTD Brougham, and newly introduced for 1975, the LTD Landau. In an effort to comply with pending rollover standards (as well as to differentiate it from the Mercury Marquis), the two-door was converted from a hardtop to a coupe with wide B-pillars and a tall, narrow \\"opera window\\" (Chevrolet did the same thing with the 1974 Caprice Coupe). More or less the Ford counterpart to the Mercury Grand Marquis, the LTD Landau featured rear fender skirts and various decor packages for additional luxury; it was distinguished by the return of hidden headlamps (exclusive to its trim level). Hidden headlamps were also shared with the LTD Country Squire wagon. The 429 engine was replaced by the 460 V8 sourced from Lincoln-Mercury for 1975. A catalytic converter now required the use of unleaded fuel, and the gas gauge and fuel filler sported warnings to this effect. *1976: Four-wheel disc brakes and 8-track were optional. Last year for LTD Brougham trim level. *1977: Since the LTD Brougham had been discontinued, the LTD Landau received the former Brougham interior as the base offering. Optional interiors, including the LTD Landau Luxury Group, were still available. *1978: Final year for 121-inch wheelbase LTD, as it is replaced by the downsized Panther-platform generation LTD for 1979. Approximately 7,850,000 full-size Fords and Mercurys were sold over the 1969‚Äì1978 period.Flammang, James Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976‚Äì1999 3rd Edition (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc. 1999) This makes it the second best selling Ford automobile platform after the Ford Model T.

The base engine was the 302 cid V8. The next largest engine was Ford's 351 CID V8, the most common choice. Still larger was Ford's 400 CID V8. Topping the range was the 429 cid V8, which was replaced by the 460 CID V8 for 1974. The full-sized Fords remained strong sellers each year during this period, due to their high comfort, powerful engines, good build quality and reasonable cost. =LTD II= When Ford updated its mid-size product line for 1977, they took on the LTD name as well. To differentiate them from the full-size product lineup, the mid-size cars were called the LTD II in an attempt to appeal to buyers as a downsized alternative to the full-sized LTD which had competition from GM's newly downsized full-sized cars. The LTD II was based on the Ford Torino and served as a restyled replacement for it. The LTD II styling was also adapted to update the final generation of the Ford Ranchero. The LTD II was discontinued after 1979 without being replaced, as the new Panther-platform LTD was nearly a foot shorter than an LTD II and the Granada became Ford's mid-size product line with its 1981 redesign. Third generation (1979‚Äì1982) = Background = For the 1977 model year, General Motors became the first American auto manufacturer to introduce downsized full-size sedans, with its B/C full-size sedans having a smaller exterior footprint than their A-body intermediates. As Ford remained in development with its downsizing of the LTD (and its Lincoln-Mercury counterparts), Ford touted the aspects of its larger sedans, comparing the LTD side-by-side with the GM flagship sedan Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham. Nearly matching the Chevrolet Caprice in size, Ford offered the \\"Trim Size\\" LTD II, a new generation of the Torino intermediate. Trailing GM for nearly two years, Ford began production of the third- generation LTD on July 31, 1978 at Louisville Assembly; in August, production came online at Atlanta Assembly, Los Angeles Assembly, and Oakville Assembly. The LTD marked the launch of the rear-wheel drive Ford Panther platform; in stark contrast to the Chrysler R platform, the Panther chassis was completely new from the ground up. In line with the GM B/C downsizing, the Panther design introduced trimmer body profiles, nimbler body handling (from smaller size), and better fuel economy (to better comply with CAFE standards). For 1979, Ford introduced the Ford LTD sedans and LTD Country Squire station wagons; the Lincoln Continental was delayed until 1980, making Lincoln the final brand to introduce a downsized model range. In Canada, the Custom 500 nameplate continued on for the last time, serving as the base model through the 1981 model year. = Model overview = alt= In comparison to its 1978 predecessor, the 1979 LTD shed approximately 15 inches of body length and 7 inches of wheelbase; (dependent on powertrain) the Panther chassis shed over 700 pounds in curb weight. While slightly narrower overall, the body design also led to increased interior and trunk space. The lighter Panther chassis and body displaced the need for the large-block 400 and 460 V8s; Ford made the metric- displacement 5.0L V8 (302) standard and a 5.8L V8 (351) optional. In contrast to Chrysler and General Motors, Ford Panther-chassis vehicles retained V8 engines as standard equipment. For 1981, to further improve its CAFE performance (while avoiding the use of 6-cylinder or diesel engines), a variant of the 5.0L V8 became the standard engine, making the 5.0L optional; output decreased to only 115 hp (the lowest since the final Flathead V8 in 1953). Adopting the sharp-edged styling of the (smaller) Ford Fairmont, the 1979 LTD would shed its optional hidden headlamps, with all versions adopting exposed rectangular headlights (besides a much wider grille). Base-trim examples were fitted with dual headlamps and clear parking lamp lenses; higher-trim versions used quad headlamps with amber lenses. For 1980, trim levels were revised, with the base trim becoming the LTD S and the LTD Landau replaced by the LTD Crown Victoria, with the standard LTD in between. The Ford equivalent of the Mercury Grand Marquis, the LTD Crown Victoria drew its name from a styling element, a brushed aluminum band covering the B-pillar and the roof, influenced by its 1955-1956 Ford Fairlane namesake. Intended largely for fleet sales, the LTD S was sold as both a sedan and a station wagon (without wood trim). A 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission became an option for the 5.0L V8 (exclusive to the Panther chassis at the time). The Lincoln-style hood ornament of 1979 was replaced by a horizontal design; fitted only to the LTD Crown Victoria, the design would be used unchanged through 1987. For 1981, alongside the addition of the 4.2L V8, the body underwent minor revisions to improve fuel economy. The vents in the front bumpers were removed (shifting the license plate mount under the left headlamp) and the sideview mirrors were repositioned (leading to the return of vent windows as an option). For 1982, the LTD saw the addition of the Ford Blue Oval emblem on the grille and trunklid (replacing \\"FORD\\" badging). To aid in tracking fuel consumption, a trip computer was added as an option. While standard, the 4.2L engine was offered for the final time. The 5.8L engine was dropped from retail sale, becoming exclusive to police car use; alongside the Motorcraft 7200VV two- barrel variable venturi carburetor; a conventional carburetor was available with the police option high-output 351. Introduced as an option with the 5.0L engine for 1980, the AOD overdrive transmission became paired with all three engines. Fourth generation (1983‚Äì1986) From 1981 to 1983, Ford underwent a major revision of its full-size and mid-size product lines, involving all three of its divisions. For the 1983 model year, the LTD and LTD Crown Victoria into distinct product lines. The latter became the full-size Ford sedan range (alongside the LTD Country Squire), with the LTD nameplate effectively replacing the Ford Granada in a mid-cycle model revision. In line with Ford, the Mercury Marquis and Grand Marquis were also split into distinct product lines; replacing the Cougar (sedan and wagon), the Marquis became the counterpart of the repackaged LTD. Shedding nearly 13 inches of length, 9 inches of wheelbase, 7 inches of width, and over 600 pounds of curb weight (dependent on powertrain), the 1983 LTD underwent nearly the same reduction in size as its 1979 predecessor, although the downsizing was the result of re- marketing a stronger-selling nameplate for a slow-selling model line. Ultimately, the LTD became the third-best selling automobile in the U.S. for 1983 and 1984. = Model overview = Sharing the mid-size version of the Fox platform with its Granada predecessor, the fourth-generation LTD has a 105.6-inch wheelbase. In contrast to both the Granada and the full-size LTD, the fourth-generation LTD was sold as a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon (no two-door was offered). Alongside the base-trim sedan, the LTD Brougham trim made its return, with a LTD Squire wood-trimmed wagon. For its 1983 launch, the LTD retained two engines from the Granada: a 2.3L Lima inline-4 and a 3.3 L Falcon Six inline-6. Also inherited from the Granada was a 3.8 L Essex V6, which replaced the inline-6 entirely for 1984. For 1984, both engines gained fuel injection in the United States (the Canadian-market V6 remained carbureted until 1986). A rare option, seen only in 1982‚Äì1984, was an LPG (propane)-powered version of the four-cylinder engine; it was largely discontinued due to poor sales and lack of propane fueling infrastructure. For the first time since 1971, the LTD was offered with a manual transmission; a 3-speed automatic was optional on the 2.3L engine and standard on the 3.3L engine (all 3.8L engines came with a 4-speed overdrive automatic). For the 1985 model year, the LTD underwent a minor model revision. Along with minor changes to the taillamps, the LTD received a new grille, distinguished by a centered Ford Blue Oval emblem. 1986 models are identifiable by the addition of a federally-mandated CHMSL (center brake lamp).

It came standard with the high output 5.0L CFI V8 engine, four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, 600 lb-in front and 270 lb-in rear coil springs, front and rear sway bars, 10 inch front disc and 10 inch rear drum brakes, and a 3.27:1 rear gear ratio with a Traction-Lok differential. The LX model was the only LTD to have a tachometer in the instrument cluster. The center console and floor-mounted shifter re-appeared, having last been available in the full-size 1972 model year. Police Package editions were also produced alongside the LX. Notable for its bigger sway bars and brakes, it also included bench seats with an automatic trunk opener located underneath the steering wheel. They were a factory option and most were equipped with light bars and police accessories, although some came without. Mercury's sister car to the LX, the Marquis LTS, was available only in Canada and only in the 1985 model year, with only 134 produced that year. = Discontinuation = As the 1980s progressed, the use of front-wheel drive expanded out of the compact segment towards the mid-size segment. Following the success of the Chrysler K-Cars and the General Motors A-body sedans (along with the introduction of Honda Accord sedan and Toyota Camry), Ford was one of the last major manufacturers to introduce a mid-size front-wheel drive model line. For 1986, Ford introduced the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable; originally developed as the replacements for the Panther- platform model lines, the mid-size Taurus and Sable would replace the LTD and Marquis product lines. Along with the transition to front-wheel drive, the exterior of the Taurus was designed to optimize fuel efficiency, replacing the boxy LTD with one of the most aerodynamic sedans in the world. For the 1986 model year, Ford marketed the LTD alongside its replacement, transitioning potential buyers into the massive model change. Atlanta Assembly produced its final LTD on December 13, 1985 (13 days before the Taurus was unveiled); Chicago Assembly produced the final example on January 3, 1986. Brazil Ford LTD Brazil, 1975 The LTD was built locally in Brazil between 1967 and 1981, based on the 1966 Galaxie platform. An upper version called Landau was assembled locally as well.1976 Ford Full-Line Factory Sales Brochure 1979 Ford LTD Factory Sales Brochure Venezuela The LTD was introduced to the Venezuelan market in 1966, aiming to compete with Chrysler's New Yorker, with the LTD performing much better than its rivals. Over 85,000 LTDs were assembled in the Ford plant of Valencia, Venezuela, some for export to Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. Versions of the Fox-body 1983‚Äì1986 North American LTD manufactured in Venezuela continued the use of the Granada name complete with uplevel Elite badged versions.

She also worked in plaster and marble. Hoffman created portrait busts of working-class people and significant individuals. She was particularly known for her sculptures of dancers, such as Anna Pavlova. Her sculptures of culturally diverse people, entitled \\"Hall of the Races of Mankind\\", was a popular permanent exhibition at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. It was featured at the Century of Progress International Exposition at the Chicago World's Fair of 1933. She was commissioned to execute commemorative monuments and was awarded many prizes and honors, including a membership to the National Sculpture Society. In 1925, she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1931. Many of her portraits of individuals are among the collection of the New York Historical Society. She maintained a salon, a social gathering of artistic and personal acquaintances, at her Sniffen Court studio for many years. She was highly skilled in foundry techniques, often casting her own works. Hoffman published a definite work on historical and technical aspects of bronze casting, Sculpture Inside and Out, in 1939.  Early life and education  Malvina Hoffman was born in New York City, the fourth of six children of the concert pianist and composer, Richard Hoffman, and Fidelia Marshall (Lamson) Hoffman. She was named after a maternal aunt, Malvina Helen (Lamson) Cornell, who would later survive the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Her mother, also a pianist, presided over her education at home until she was 10 years of age. The Hoffman's regularly entertained artists and musicians in their home. As a young girl, she met Swami Vivekananda when he lived and taught in New York City, and several of her later sculptures, like that of Sri Ramakrishna, are located at the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York. Hoffman attended Veltin School for Girls, Chapin, and Brearley private schools. While at Brearley, she took evening classes at the Woman's School for Applied Design and the Art Students League of New York. She studied painting with John White Alexander in 1906, and also with Harper Pennington. Hoffman developed her skill as an artist during her studies with George Grey Barnard, Herbert Adams, and Gutzon Borglum. She worked as an assistant to sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor at his MacDougal Street studio in Greenwich Village in 1907. In 1908, Hoffman traveled to Paris with Katharine Rhoades and Marion H. Beckett and studied art there. She made a bust of her father, her first finished sculpture, in 1909, two weeks prior to his death. It was exhibited at the National Academy the following year. Also in 1910, she won an honorable mention for a sculpture of her future husband, Samuel Grimson, at the Paris Salon. Hoffman gravitated towards sculpture due to the artistic freedom she felt when creating a three-dimensional work of art. After her father's death in 1910, Hoffman moved to Europe with her mother. They first visited London, where they attended the ballet of Alexander Glazunov's Autumn Bacchanale. Hoffman was inspired by the combination of motion and control exhibited by Mikhail Mordkin and Anna Pavlova. Mother and daughter visited Italy before moving to Paris. She worked as a studio assistant for Janet Scudder. During the nights she studied at Acad√©mie Colarossi. She studied with Emanuele Rosales and after five unsuccessful attempts, she eventually was accepted as a student by Auguste Rodin. She caught his attention when she quoted a poem that he attempted to remember by Alfred de Musset. During their lessons, he advised her, \\"Do not be afraid of realism\\".A Little Girl Who Remembered Vivekananda She made a trip to Manhattan in 1912 to dissect bodies at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. From Rosales and Rodin, she learned about bronze casting, chasing, and finishing at foundries. The Hoffman women lived in Paris until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.  Career  = Dancers = Hoffman became famous internationally for her sculptures of ballet dancers, such as Vaslav Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova, who often posed for her. In 1911, she made Russian Dancers, which was exhibited that year at the National Academy and the following year at the Paris Salon. She made a plaster bust, the last work she made of Pavlova, in 1923. Hoffman also created friezes and other works that captured the movements of dancers. In 1912, she made Bacchanale Russe. In 1917, a version of it won the National Academy's Julia A. Shaw Memorial Prize and the next year a large casting of the sculpture was on display in Paris at the Luxembourg Gardens. She has been called \\"America's Rodin\\". = World War I = Hoffman helped to organize, and was the American representative, for the French war charity, Appui aux Artistes that assisted needy artists. She also organized the American-Yugoslav relief fund for children. While working for the Red Cross during World War I, Hoffman traveled to Serbia. She made a larger-than-life-sized work of Croatian sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, with whom she studied. Malvina Hoffman, Modern Crusader (Milan Pribiƒáeviƒá, a highly decorated veteran of the Balkan wars), cast bronze, 18 1/4 x 11 3/4 x 10 inches, , Smithsonian American Art Museum Her sister, Helen, was on the board of the Red Cross, which sent clothing and medical supplies for the Serbian cause. Through her sister, she met Serbian Colonel Milan Pribiƒáeviƒá in 1916, who inspired her when he came to the United States and delivered rousing speeches in which he asked Serbian immigrants to fight to save their homeland. Hoffman, who may have had a romantic relationship with the colonel, had an interest in \\"powerful, charismatic\\" people. She once said, \\"Hero worship formed a major part of my emotional life.\\" He modeled for her sculpture of him entitled A Modern Crusader (1918). His nephew said that it capture that \\"he was gaunt and weary. His eyes were deep sunk in their sockets ... Only his firm mouth and his powerful chin showed no trace of the inhuman punishment which his body and soul had received during half a decade of life in the trenches.\\" There are casts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Art Institute of Chicago. She also authored the well known poster \\"Serbia needs your help\\". She based it on the Miloje P. Igrutinoviƒá's photo of dead Serbian soldiers, who died of hunger and exhaustion on the Greek island of Vido. She made the solder \\"alive\\" on the poster and later, as a sort of an artistic installation, posted soldier's head on the bronze statue of the Saint Francis of Assisi in front of the Mayo clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. In 2018 an exhibition \\"Who is Malvina Hoffman\\" dedicated to Hoffman was open in Novi Sad, Serbia. It was part of the wider project \\"Serbia, war and posters\\" by the state government. The Hoffman exhibition, organized in cooperation with the US embassy in Belgrade, which later toured the entire Serbia. Among other exhibits, Hoffman's drawings which she made when she visited Serbia in 1919 were also displayed. She published her impressions about the visit in the chapter Hunger in the Balkans of her book Heads and Tales. The poster \\"Serbia needs your help\\" later circulated around the United States, being located in a library of a local politician in Phoenix, Arizona, or in the Navajo reservation. That was where the priest Janko Trboviƒá found it. One reprint of the poster, after an intricate and extended search, was donated by the basketball player Vlade Divac. Modern and Contemporary Art Museum, Harvard University = Interwar period = In 1919, she created a pedimental sculpture for Bush House in London. The same year, she was in Paris cataloging Rodin's works for the Mus√©e Rodin. In 1929, her first major exhibit was held at the Grand Central Art Galleries with 105 works of art in various mediums. During the war, she met the American Red Cross worker John W. Frothingham and his Serbian wife Jelena Lozaniƒá. As member of the American Red Cross, she and Lozaniƒá continued to organize the relief for Serbia (now amalgamated into Yugoslavia) during the Interbellum, regularly giving lectures on orphaned Serbian children. She welcomed Croatian sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, lending him her studio to work. In 1919, at the request of Herbert Hoover, director of American Relief Administration, Hoffman travelled to Serbia and Yugoslavia to visit US humanitarian missions throughout the state. That same year she visited the site of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo, as the second recorded American to do so, after John W. Frotingham (some even claim the second foreign visitor in general). After the war, she made the sculpture The Sacrifice, which was dedicated in 1923 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. In it, the head of a 13th-century crusader lay on the lap of a draped woman. It is a memorial to the late Ambassador of France, Robert Bacon, and alumni of Harvard University who lost their lives during the war. After the War Memorial Chapel at Harvard University was completed in 1932, it was installed there. = Hall of Man = Artist Malvina Hoffman; Stanley Field, director and the nephew of the founder of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago; and actress Mary Pickford at the 1934 opening of Hoffman's Grand Central Art Galleries exhibition \\"The Races of Man.\\" In 1929, Hoffman received a telegram from Stanley Field, \\"Have proposition to make, do you care to consider it? Racial types to be modeled while traveling round the world.\\" Hoffman was commissioned by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois to create anthropologically accurate sculptures of peoples of diverse nationalities and races. She traveled around the world ‚Äî including distant places like Africa, India, and Bali ‚Äî in 1931 to 1932, creating busts and figures of people and taking more than 2,000 photographs. She completed more than 105 sculptures, predominantly in bronze, but also in marble and stone. They included busts and full-length figures of individuals, which were installed at the museum's Hall of Man in 1933. She documented her travels for the commission in the book, Heads and Tales. It was a popular exhibit at the museum, but some critics considered it a purely anthropological study. During the 1960s, questions began to circulate about the exhibit. According to American Historical Review, \\"the sculptures in the 'Races of Mankind' had perpetuated an older typological approach by presenting 'race' in the form of literally static bronze figures depicting idealized racial 'types'\\".Brattain, Michelle, \\"Race, Racism, and Antiracism: UNESCO and the Politics of Presenting Science to the Postwar Public\\". The American Historical Review 112.5 (2007): 40 pars. March 11, 2010. The Hall of Man was deinstalled in 1969, but some of the sculptures are still on display. In 2016, fifty recently conserved sculptures from the Mankind collection were on display at the museum in an exhibition called, \\"Looking at Ourselves: Rethinking the Sculptures of Malvina Hoffman.\\" = World War II = Studio in Manhattan As she had during World War I, Hoffman served the Red Cross and she raised money for the Red Cross and national defense during the war. She again supported Serbia, which was again occupied by Germany. Jointly with the mayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, she participated in the fund raising events of organized by Jelena Lozaniƒá, and in sending of the relief to the occupied territory. In 1948, Hoffman created relief sculptures for the walls of the American World War II Memorial for the Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial in Vosges, France. It is on the site of the Battle of the Bulge (1944). There are 5,255 American soldiers buried in the cemetery. = Other = She depicted the evolution of medicine in a 13-panel bas relief for Boston's Joslin Clinic. Hoffman made portrait sculptures, including those of John Muir, Wendell Willkie, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Henry Clay Frick, and Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. Her works were exhibited often at the National Academy. In 1965, she published Yesterday is Tomorrow. Among her awards are the gold medal she won in 1924 from the National Academy, the gold medal of honor she won in 1962 for Mongolian Archer from the Allied of Artists of America, and the gold medal of honor that she won in 1964 from the National Sculpture Society. She was awarded five honorary doctorates. Her awards for public service include the French Legion of Honour and the Royal Order of St. Sava III of Yugoslavia.  Personal life  Murray Hill, New York, which was the site of Hoffman's studio. She created the plaques on the wall. She was married to an Englishman, Samuel Bonarius Grimson, on June 4, 1924. Grimson was injured by mustard gas and phosgene during World War I, and his career as a concert violist ended when his hands were crushed during an accident with a truck during the war. After the war, he collected antique paintings and instruments. He also invented a tube for a color television. He traveled with her during her search for authentic indigenous models for the anthropological series. Hoffman and Grimson divorced in 1936, some speculated that it was due to an affair that she had with the ballerina Anna Pavlova. He married Bettina Warburg, the daughter of Nina Loeb and Paul Warburg, in 1942. She was 16 years his junior. Grimson died in 1955. Hoffman befriended painter Romaine Brooks, writer Gertrude Stein, and ballet dancer Anna Pavlova. She held costume parties and balls in her studio, which were reported in the city's society pages. She often spent the summers in a Hartsdale cottage provided to her by Paul Warburg. On July 10, 1966, Malvina Cornell Hoffman died of a heart attack in her studio in Manhattan, which had been purchased by the philanthropist Mary Williamson Averell and provided to Hoffman for a low- priced rent.

Guards () or Guards units (, gvardeyskiye chasti) were elite military units of Imperial Russia prior to 1917‚Äì18. The designation of Guards was subsequently adopted as a distinction for various units and formations of the Soviet Union and the modern Russian Federation. The tradition goes back to a chieftain's druzhina of medieval Kievan Rus' and the Marksman Troops (–°—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–µ—Ü–∫–æ–µ –í–æ–π—Å–∫–æ), the Muscovite harquebusiers formed by Ivan the Terrible by 1550. The exact meaning of the term \\"Guards\\" varied over time.  Imperial Russian Guard  In the Russian Empire, Imperial Russian Guard units (also lifguard or life-guard, ), derived from German Leibgarde (en: lifeguard or life-guard), were intended to ensure the security of the sovereign, initially, that of Peter the Great in the 1690s. These were based on the Prussian Royal Life Guards. During the 19th century the Imperial Russian Guard regiments were not exclusively composed of Russian troops, but also included Lithuanian, Finnish and Ukrainian units. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Imperial Guards consisted of 13 infantry, 4 rifles and 14 cavalry regiments, artillery, engineers and transport, making up a separate entity within the army of three divisions. During the Brusilov Offensive the 1st and 2nd Guards' numbers were supplemented with line army corp and from September 1916 were known as the 'Special Army'.Nik Cornish The Russian Army 1914-18 2001 page 16 \\"These corps were to be known, from 21 July 1916, as the Guards Army. ... by the Guards during the Brusilov Offensive their numbers were supplemented with line army corps and the whole became in September 1916 the 'Special Army'.\\" In February‚ÄìMarch 1917, the defection of reserve battalions of the Imperial Guard based in St.Petersburg was a major factor in the overthrow of the Tsarist government. The service units of the Guard at the front disintegrated along with the remainder of the Imperial Army, until it was formally replaced by the new Red Army on 28 January 1918.  Russian Revolution  The Red Guards () were armed groups of workers formed during the Russian Revolution of 1917, although the designation and concept dates back to Moscow during the Revolution of 1905. In 1917 the volunteers of the Red Guard and their elected leaders formed the main strike force of the Bolsheviks. These workers' militias were created in March 1917 in by Factory and Plant Committees and by Bolshevik party cells, with the initial purpose of defending the industrial enterprises and districts where they were recruited. In October 1917 the Red Guards of Petrograd played a leading role in the capture of the Winter Palace and the overthrow of the Provisional Government. When the Soviet Red Army was formed in 1918, the Red Guards became the Army Reserve and the basis for the formation of regular military detachments. The White Guard () or White Army (, whose members were called ), comprised both the political and military forces of the Russian White Movement, which opposed the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution and fought against the Red Army during the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1921.  Soviet Guards  Badge of the Soviet Guards (1941). The Guards units () were again awarded to units and formations that distinguished themselves during the Second World War by the order of People's Commissar for Defence of USSR No.303 on the 18 September 1941, and were considered to have elite status. However, the Guards badge was not introduced until 21 May 1943. In late 1941, Stavka began awarding the honorific title 'Guards' to regiments, divisions, and corps that had distinguished themselves in combat. Units earning this title had often suffered up to 30 percent or more casualties after successfully performing desperate missions. It was not only a prestigious designation, as units so honoured were thereafter better equipped and given preference in personnel, supplies, equipment and material. (Harrel, 2019) Zhukov states \\"the first period of the war gave birth to the Soviet Guards. For mass heroism and success in the battles of 1941-1942 the Guards title was awarded to 789 groups, formations, separate units, and fighting ships of the Soviet Armed Forces.\\" Pik Sovetskoy Gvardii, meaning \\"Soviet Guard Peak\\", the second highest mountain in the Anyuy Range, was named after the Soviet Guards.South Anyui Range // Great Soviet Encyclopedia : [in 30 vol.] / Ch. ed.

As a member of the Room 40 codebreaking unit he helped decrypt the Zimmermann Telegram which brought the USA into the First World War. He joined the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;) at the war's end. As Chief Cryptographer, Knox played an important role in the Polish-French- British meetings on the eve of the Second World War which disclosed Polish cryptanalysis of the Axis Enigma to the Allies. At Bletchley Park he worked on the cryptanalysis of Enigma ciphers until his death in 1943. He built the team and discovered the method that broke the Italian Naval Enigma, producing the intelligence credited with Allied victory at the Battle of Cape Matapan. In 1941 Knox broke the Abwehr Enigma. By the end of the war, Intelligence Service Knox had disseminated 140,800 Abwehr decrypts, including intelligence important for D-Day. Personal life and family Dillwyn Knox, the fourth of six children, was the son of Edmund Knox, tutor at Merton College and later Bishop of Manchester; he was the brother of E. V. Knox, Wilfred Knox and Ronald Knox, and uncle of the novelist Penelope Fitzgerald. His father was a descendant of John Arbuthnott, 8th Viscount of Arbuthnott.Dod's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland, Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 1904, p. 983The Spectator, vol. 20, 1847, p. 1171The Gentleman's Magazine, vol. 177, 1845, p. 311 Dillwyn‚Äîknown as \\"Dilly\\"‚ÄîKnox was educated at Summer Fields School, Oxford, and then Eton College. He studied classics at King's College, Cambridge from 1903,Richmond, John Classics and Intelligence - 'Classics Ireland' Volume 9 (2002) and in 1909 was elected a Fellow following the death of Walter Headlam, from whom he inherited extensive research into the works of Herodas. While an undergraduate he was friends with Lytton Strachey and John Maynard Keynes. He and Keynes were lovers at Eton. Knox privately coached Harold Macmillan, the future Prime Minister at King's for a few weeks in 1910, but Macmillan found him \\"austere and uncongenial\\". He married Olive Rodman in 1920, forgetting to invite two of his three brothers to his wedding. The couple had two sons, Oliver and Christopher. He was an atheist.\\"Dillwyn [Knox, son of an Evangelical bishop] was from his student years an unwavering atheist.\\" Alan Hollinghurst, \\"The Victory of Penelope Fitzgerald\\" (a review of Hermione Lee, Penelope Fitzgerald [a niece of Alfred Dillwyn Knox]: A Life, Knopf, 488 pp.), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXI, no. 19 (December 4, 2014), p. 8. (The article comprises pp. 8, 10, 12.) Academic scholarship Between the two World Wars Knox worked on the great commentary on Herodas that had been started by Walter Headlam, damaging his eyesight while studying the British Museum's collection of papyrus fragments, but finally managing to decipher the text of the Herodas papyri. The Knox- Headlam edition of Herodas finally appeared in 1922. Codebreaking = World War I = Soon after World War I broke out in 1914, Knox was recruited to the Royal Navy's cryptological effort in Room 40 of the Admiralty Old Building, where some of his best work is said to have been done in the bath (in Room 53). In 1917, Knox followed Room 40 with its expansion into ID25. Among other tasks, he was involved in breaking: * the Zimmermann Telegram which brought the USA into the war. * much of the German admiral's flag code by exploiting an operator's love of romantic poetry. =Between WW1 and WW2= Government Code and Cypher School During World War I he had been elected Librarian at King's College, but never took up the appointment. After the war Knox intended to resume his research at King's, but was persuaded by his wife to remain at his secret work; indeed, so secret was this work that his own children had no idea, until many years after his death, what he did for a living, and his contribution to the war effort. Commercial Enigma The Enigma machine became available commercially in the 1920s. In Vienna in 1925, Knox bought the Enigma 'C' machine evaluated by Hugh Foss in 1927 on behalf of GC&CS.; Foss found \\"a high degree of security\\" but wrote a secret paper describing how to attack the machine if cribs ‚Äî short sections of plain text ‚Äî could be guessed. When ‚Äî a decade later ‚Äî Knox picked up this work, he developed a more effective algebraic system (rodding) based on the principles described by Foss. Spanish Enigma Germany's Navy adopted Enigma in 1926, adding a plug-board ('stecker') to improve security. Nazi Germany supplied non-steckered machines to Franco's Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. On 24 April 1937, Knox broke Franco's Enigma but knowledge of this breakthrough was not shared with the Republicans. States \\"Professor Denis Smyth, of the University of Toronto, an expert on Second World War intelligence operations, said that the British codebreaker Alfred Dilwyn Knox cracked the code of Franco's machine in 1937, but 'this information was not passed on to the Republicans'.\\" Soon afterwards, Knox began to attack signals between Spain and Germany encrypted using steckered Enigma machines. On the eve of World War II =Polish-French-British meetings= GC&CS; began to discuss Enigma with France's Deuxi√®me Bureau in 1938, obtaining from the Bureau details of Wehrmacht Enigma supplied by Asch√© and signal intercepts, some of which must have been made in Eastern Europe. This led the French to disclose their links with Polish cryptographers. Knox, Hugh Foss and Alastair Denniston represented GS&CS; at the first Polish-French-British meeting at Paris in January 1939. The Poles were under order to disclose nothing of importance at this time, leaving the British codebreakers disappointed. However Knox's description of his system of rodding impressed the Polish codebreakers, and they requested his presence at a second meeting. Knox attended the second Polish-French-British conference, held on 25‚Äì26 July 1939 at the Polish Cipher Bureau facility (at Pyry, south of Warsaw, Poland). Here, the Poles began to disclose to their French and British allies their achievements in solving Enigma decryption. Although Marian Rejewski, the Polish cryptographer and mathematician who solved the plugboard-equipped Enigma used by Nazi Germany, approached the problem through permutation theory (whereas Knox applied linguistics) a good personal relationship was quickly established at the conference. The good impression made by Rejewski on Knox played an important role in increasing recruitment of mathematicians to Bletchley Park. Knox was chagrined ‚Äî but grateful ‚Äî to learn how simple was the solution of the Enigma's entry ring (standard alphabetical order). After the meeting, he sent the Polish cryptologists a very gracious note in Polish, on official British government stationery, thanking them for their assistance and sending \\"sincere thanks for your cooperation and patience\\". Enclosed were a beautiful scarf featuring a picture of a Derby winner and a set of paper 'batons'. These 'batons' were known as rods to the British and had been used to solve the Spanish Enigma. Knox's rodding method was later used to break the Italian Naval Enigma. =Turing's bombe= Alan Turing worked on Enigma during the months leading to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, and occasionally visited GC&CS;'s London HQ to discuss this problem with Knox. In the 1939 register Turing was recorded in Naphill, staying with Knox and his wife. By November 1939 Turing had completed the design of the bombe ‚Äî a radical improvement of the Polish bomba. =World War II= Knox's rodding method To break non-steckered Enigma machines (those without a plugboard), Knox (building on earlier research by Hugh Foss) developed a system known as 'rodding', a linguistic as opposed to mathematical way of breaking codes. This technique worked on the Enigma used by the Italian Navy and the German Abwehr. Knox worked in 'the Cottage', next door to the Bletchley Park mansion, as head of a research section, which contributed significantly to cryptanalysis of the Enigma. Knox's team at The Cottage used rodding to decrypt intercepted Italian naval signals describing the sailing of an Italian battle fleet, leading to the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. Admiral John Godfrey, Director of Naval Intelligence credited the Allied victory at Matapan to this intelligence; Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, who had commanded the victorious fleet at Matapan, went to Bletchley to personally congratulate 'Dilly and his girls'. Intelligence Services Knox In October 1941, Knox solved the Abwehr Enigma. Intelligence Services Knox (ISK) was established to decrypt Abwehr communications. In early 1942, with Knox seriously ill, Peter Twinn took charge of running ISK and was appointed head after Knox's death. By the end of the war, ISK had decrypted and disseminated 140,800 messages. Intelligence gained from these Abwehr decrypts played an important part in ensuring the success of Double-Cross operations by MI5 and MI6, and in Operation Fortitude, the Allied campaign to deceive the Germans about D-Day. Death Knox's work was cut short when he fell ill with lymphoma. When he became unable to travel to Bletchley Park, he continued his cryptographic work from his home in Hughenden, Buckinghamshire, where he received the CMG. He died on 27 February 1943. A biography of Knox, written by Mavis Batey, one of 'Dilly's girls', the female codebreakers who worked with him, was published in September 2009. Classified poetry Knox celebrated the victory at Battle of Cape Matapan with poetry, which remained classified until 1978. Portrayals in fiction Knox is shown recruiting Alan Turing to Bletchley Park in Hugh Whitemore's play, Breaking the Code (1986). In the 1996 television film, he is portrayed by Richard Johnson.
