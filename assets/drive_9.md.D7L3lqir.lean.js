Ida Crouch-Hazlett (born Ida Estelle Crouch, c. 1870 - 1941) was an American political activist prominent in the suffrage and socialist movements. Crouch-Hazlett is best remembered as a prominent orator and organizer for the Socialist Party of America during the first two decades of the 20th century. In 1902 Crouch-Hazlett became the first female candidate for U.S. Congress from Colorado, when she ran for a seat in the House of Representatives. Biography Early years Ida Estelle Crouch was born c. 1870 in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of two college-educated schoolteachers.Gary M. Fink (ed.), \\"Ida Crouch-Hazlett,\\" Biographical Dictionary of American Labor. Revised edition. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984; pp. 167-1687. Crouch grew up in Monmouth, Illinois, where she attended elementary school, before enrolling in the Monticello Seminary of Godfrey, Illinois. She was an 1888 graduate of Illinois State Normal School (an institution that would later become Illinois State University) at Bloomington and later did course work at Stanford University, where she studied Economics,Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole, The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pp. 51-51. and the Chicago School of Social Sciences following completion of her training as a teacher at Illinois Normal School. Crouch was married at a fairly early age to N. Hazlett, who died not long thereafter.John A.H. Keith (ed.), Semi-Centennial History of the Illinois State Normal University, 1857-1907. Bloomington: Illinois State Normal University, 1907; pg. 288. After graduation, Crouch- Hazlett ran for local school board on the ticket of the Prohibition Party.Mari Jo Buhle, Women and American Socialism, 1870-1920. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1981; pg. 215. Following that unsuccessful attempt, she held a series of positions as a teacher of elocution in Illinois, Colorado, and Wyoming, an occupation which helped her to craft her own skills as an orator. In 1894, Crouch-Hazlett turned to journalism, working as a newspaper reporter. Crouch-Hazlett worked for newspapers in Chicago, Denver, and Leadville, Colorado, and St. Louis. She continued to work as a journalist through 1900. While in Colorado Crouch-Hazlett was first exposed to the bitter class struggle between miners and mine-owners, which further shaped her political views. Political career Crouch-Hazlett's first foray into politics came in 1896, when she was named a national organizer for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Crouch-Hazlett was one of the NAWSA's professional organizers who toured the length and breadth of California during the unsuccessful 1896 election campaign, joining such stalwarts of the movement as Susan B. Anthony, Carrie Chapman Catt, and Anna Howard Shaw. Crouch-Hazlett continued on the staff of the NAWSA until 1901, touring the country for the organization and conducting public lectures building public support for women's right to vote. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, Crouch-Hazlett began to see the fight for socialism as a central component of the struggle of women for equal rights and she made advancement of the socialist movement a central part of her political efforts.Buhle, Women and American Socialism, 1870-1920, pg. 241. She joined the fledgling Socialist Party of America (SPA) around the time of its formation in 1901 and thereafter became one of its most prominent female voices. In 1902, Hazlett became the first female candidate for U.S. Congress in the state of Colorado when she ran for the House of Representatives on the Socialist ticket. After the 1902 campaign, Hazlett continued without pause taking her oratorial skills on the road on behalf of the Socialist Party as one of its national organizers. Crouch-Hazlett spent the better part of the next two years, holding public lectures and thereby attempting to help build state and local organizations for the new political party. She remained one of the SPA's touring national organizers through 1904. Crouch-Hazlett was a delegate of the Socialist Party of Colorado to the 1904 National Convention of the Socialist Party\\"Delegates to the 1904 Convention of the Socialist Party of America,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ and a Socialist Party of Montana delegate to the 1908 Convention.\\"Delegates to the 1908 Convention of the Socialist Party of America,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ Following her time as a Socialist Party traveling lecturer, Crouch-Hazlett settled down as an organizer for the Socialist Party of Montana, an organization at the time of about 450 dues-paying members active in 25 \\"locals.\\"Jerry W. Calvert, The Gibraltar: Socialism and Labor in Butte, Montana, 1895-1920. Helena: Montana Historical Society Press, 1988; pg. 30. Hazlett was named editor of the Socialist Party of Montana's newspaper, Montana News, in December 1905.Montana Historical Society, \\"Montana News (Lewistown, Mont.),\\" Chronicling America, chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ One historian has called Crouch-Hazlett \\"a most different administrator\\" of the party newspaper, noting that she preferred to play the role of \\"roving reporter\\" and leaving the technical and administrative details of newspaper production to her close political associate, State Secretary James D. Graham. Her time traversing the massive state of Montana in this period involved Crouch-Hazlett closely with the Western Federation of Miners. Her association in the labor movement also had a certain participatory element, as during the course of her life, Hazlett was herself a member of the Knights of Labor and the American Labor Union, ultimately unsuccessful rivals of the American Federation of Labor. Beginning in 1908, the Montana Socialist Party was divided by a bitter factional split, pitting Graham and party editor Crouch- Hazlett on one side and Lewis Duncan, the future Socialist mayor of Butte, on the other. Driven by Local Butte, the 1908 State Convention of the Socialist Party of Montana appointed an auditing committee headed by Duncan to closely inspect the organization's books.Calvert, The Gibraltar, pg. 33. Duncan proclaimed the state party's books to be in \\"wretched condition\\" and led Local Butte in organizing a call for the resignation of Graham and Hazlett. While Graham was amenable, Crouch-Hazlett refused to accede to this demand, so in the spring of 1909 the Duncan-dominated State Executive Committee expelled both Graham and Hazlett from the party's ranks and formally terminated the organization's connection with the Lewistown-based Montana News. Graham and Crouch-Hazlett were accused of the misappropriation of party funds by the Duncan faction, and the matter ended up in the courts. The Unitarian minister Duncan also made morals allegations against Crouch-Hazlett, charging that she had been \\"living openly in an adulterous and licentious relationship with a former member of the Lewistown local.\\" Back of these factional fisticuffs in addition to financial and personal disagreements there lay a policy difference. Local Butte was at this time warmly supportive of Big Bill Haywood, industrial unionism, and the syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World, going so far as to endorse Haywood as a potential candidate for President of the United States, while Crouch-Hazlett in Montana News stressed the historic refusal of the Socialist Party to directly intervene in trade union matters.Calvert, The Gibraltar, pg. 34. in 1910, with Montana News broken by the factional warfare and party membership down by 45 percent, Crouch-Hazlett again resumed her role as a professional organizer for the Socialist Party of America. She dedicated the bulk of her time to organizing efforts in the American South from 1914 to 1916. Crouch-Hazlett moved to Brooklyn, New York during the latter part of the decade and ran for New York State Assembly in the 1st District of Kings County, New York on the Socialist ticket in 1920.\\"Ida Crough (sic.) Hazlett,\\" Political Graveyard, politicalgraveyard.com/ Crouch-Hazlett ended her career as an organizer on behalf of the Socialist Party in 1921. During this final year, Crouch-Hazlett was at least once kidnapped by a band of members of the American Legion, who transported her hundreds of miles before leaving her in a deserted area. This experience did not break Crouch-Hazlett's commitment, but it did nonetheless coincide with an end to her tenure as a Socialist Party organizer. Membership in the SPA plummeted during the early part of the 1920s, following its splitinto rival Socialist and Communist organizations at its 1919 Emergency National Convention. With dues collections drastically diminished, the party was forced to curtail the number of its paid functionaries due to ensuing budgetary difficulties, forcing Hazlett to seek other means of support. Crouch-Hazlett visited England, arranging beforehand with British labor activist Jessie Stephen to have her letters typed whilst there. Death and legacy In 1925 Crouch-Hazlett enrolled at New York University in an effort to earn a Doctorate degree. She died in May 1941. Her papers reside among the Social Democratic Party Papers of the Milwaukee County Historical Society in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Lavie, an expert in the psychophysiology of sleep and sleep disorders, heads the Technion Sleep Laboratory and holds the Andr√© Ballard Chair in Biological Psychiatry. Between 1993 and 1999 he served as dean of the Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, and between 2001 and 2008, as the Technion‚Äôs vice president for resource development and external relations. Lavie has authored several books, including The Enchanted World of Sleep and Restless Nights: Understanding Sleep Apnea and Snoring. Lavie has founded several start-up companies. Biography Peretz Lavie was born in Petah Tikva, Israel, in 1949. The family moved to Zikhron Ya'akov, where he completed his studies at the elementary school Nili and then at the regional high school in Pardes Hanna. He was an instructor and coordinator in the youth movement Maccabi Hatzair. He finished his bachelor's degree in statistics and psychology at Tel Aviv University.http://www.emetprize.org/english/Product.aspx?Product=27&Year;=2006 He received his Ph.D. in physiological psychology at the University of Florida, in 1974, working in the pioneering sleep laboratory of Wilse B. Webb. He continued postdoctorate research at the Department of Psychiatry of the University of California, San Diego with Daniel Kripke. On his return to Israel in 1975, Lavie joined the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, where he set up a sleep research laboratory, which was then the first laboratory to diagnose sleep disorders. Now called the Center for Sleep Medicine, it currently has four branches in Israeli hospitals. Through these research facilities, over 120,000 people have been tested. In 1997, Lavie initiated a similar center in the affiliated hospitals of Harvard University in the USA. In addition to clinical services, the center established companies that manufacture medical equipment for sleep testing.http://patent.ipexl.com/assignee/Itamar_Medical_1.html Among these is Itamar Medical - that manufactures equipment for home diagnosis of sleep disorder, identifying people who are at high risk for heart disease, and SLP that manufactures a variety of sensors for sleep laboratories. Lavie initiated and participated in a number of actions to change public regulations in Israel, for example in cancelling the \\"zero hour\\" policy in primary schools. He was a promoter of \\"daylight saving time\\" and the prevention of road accidents due to fatigue and sleepiness. Lavie also persuaded the Israel Broadcasting Authority to broadcast a silent channel (broken only in the event of an alert) during The first Gulf War. This was also implemented during the second Lebanon War. In 1978, Lavie became Senior Lecturer; in 1983 Associate Professor; and in 1989 Full Professor. In 1994, he was awarded the Andre Ballard Chair in Biological Psychiatry. Between 1993-99 he was appointed Dean of the Rappaport Faculty of Medicine at the Technion. From 2001-08 he was Vice President of the Technion's Public Affairs and Resource Development division. Lavie was editor-in-chief of the Journal of Sleep Research He has written several books; written more than 400 scientific articles; and given hundreds of lectures. His bestselling book ‚ÄúThe Enchanted World of Sleep‚Äù has been translated into 15 languages. Another, ‚ÄúRestless Nights: Understanding Snoring and Sleep Apnea,‚Äù earned him the 2006 Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital Authors Award. As Technion President, which he became in 2009 succeeding Yitzhak Apeloig, Lavie was instrumental in forming an alliance with Cornell University in order to compete for the right to build Cornell Tech, a $2 billion graduate school of applied sciences on Roosevelt Island. The success of this bid, and the creation of the Technion-Cornell Institute of Innovation (TCII) in 2012, the first such honor to be received by any Israeli center of higher education. Lavie's Technion Presidency witnessed the reception by Technion of its 3rd Nobel Prize in Science. In 2011, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Prof. Dan Shechtman for the discovery of quasicrystals. Lavie initiated and oversaw the Technion cornerstone centennial, in which 100 years of Technion history were celebrated since the laying of the first cornerstone in 1912. He was succeeded as President by Uri Sivan. Peretz Lavie is married to Lena Lavie, a cell biologist, and has three children and three grandchildren.

Sess. 3 c. 2) was passed by the Parliament of England in April 1554 to regulate the future marriage and joint reign of Queen Mary I and Philip of Spain, son and heir apparent of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. In reality, the Act seems to have served as a business contract between England and Spain; it specifies what Spain could expect from the union, while at the same time assuring the English that England would not become a satellite of Spain. Under the terms of the marriage treaty, Philip was to enjoy his wife's titles and honours as King of England and Ireland for as long as their marriage should last. All official documents, including Acts of Parliament, were to be dated with both their names (with Philip's preceding Mary's as deemed proper for husband and wife), and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. The Act stated that King Philip would take part in governing Mary's realms while reserving most authority for Mary herself. Formally, King Philip was to co-reign with his wife according to the Act, which nevertheless ensured that the new king would not become too powerful by prohibiting him from appointing foreigners to any offices, taking his wife or any child that might be born to them outside her realm and claiming the crown for himself should he outlive his wife. The Act presumed that the Queen would have children by the Prince and allowed full personal union between England and Ireland and all the realms Philip was to inherit from his father or from his grandmother, Queen Joanna, should Philip's son Charles die childless. The Act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863.

Career Chaltin was born in Ixelles in Belgium. He was appointed a lieutenant in 1885 and entered the service of the Congo Free State in 1891. In 1893 he was head of the Force Publique station at Basoko. He left this post to ascend the Lomami River to Bena-Kamba, then striking overland to Riba Riba, near present-day Kindu. Chaltin burned down Riba Riba. When rebuilt, the town took the name of Lokandu. He then raised the siege of the Stanley Falls station; now, Kisangani when it was falling to the Swahilis. He defeated the Arab-led forces on 18 May 1893. After defeating them again at Kirundu, the Arabs were expelled from the region. On 15 July 1898, the Stanley Falls district would become the Province Orientale, with Stanleyville as its headquarters. Chaltin secured the Dungu region in the northeast of the free state and was commander of the Haut-U√©l√© district from 1893. In 1896, King Leopold II decided to extend the Free State territory to the northeast. His forces were to advance first to the Lado Enclave on the Nile, which had been ceded to him but not yet occupied, and then northward towards Khartoum, capital of the declining Mahdist state of Sudan. A force of 2,700 men led by Francis, Baron Dhanis was to march by way of the Aruwimi River, while Chaltin was given a force of 700 men to take a more northerly route along the Bomu River. Dhanis's force was mainly made up of Batetela people, who rebelled and killed several Belgian officers, then went on the region's rampage. Dhanis managed to escape, but it was several years before the Batetela revolt was suppressed. Chaltin managed to reach the Nile at Bedden in February 1897 and defeated the Mahdists there in the Battle of Rejaf. This consolidated Leopold's claim to the Upper Nile, but Chaltin did not have the forces to do more. Chaltin died in Uccle. He gave his name to the town of Port-Chaltin near Kisangani. After independence, the city was renamed Aketi in 1971.

It was released on 1 March 2002 by Bock. The album was exclusively released for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia. It was recorded in 2001 in Sarajevo after the great success of the band's debut album, Now, Always, Never. Producers of album were the front-man of the band, Enes Zlatar, and the chairman of the Bock label, Oliver Dujmoviƒá. On this album the prevailing musical style is Disco with elements of soul, funk and reggae. Theme of the album \\"Queen Of The Disco\\" can be said to be a conceptual album. Every song on the album has an intro, or a skit, which on the CD is one track of its own preceding every song. The intros are from 4 to 27 seconds long and are all spoken-word. Every skit follows the same theme. In the first skit, a man talks about feeling lonely while walking alone on a cold night, ultimately coming to a disco and entering (\\"for no reason, I go in\\"). The man, who by the second skit is clearly the main character and narrator of the story, goes on to talk about seeing a woman at the disco, but it is clear to the listener that they never meet. He keeps coming back to the disco night after night, looking for her. The general feeling is that she became an obsession, and that without her, the narrator could not be happy (\\"without her, the world was darker\\"). He saw her again once, on the street, but she \\"looked right through\\" him. The narrator ultimately ends up spending the rest of his life never knowing or seeing her (the Queen of the disco) again, but he keeps coming back to the disco. He stays at the disco \\"forever\\"; the disco ends up being hell, which could be interpreted in a literal, as well as a symbolic sense. Hidden track After the final song on the CD, \\"Love You Baby\\", there is a hidden track, which ends approximately at the five-minute mark. At six minutes and one second, the hidden track begins, with the unnamed song sang in Bosnian. The song could be said to be about life, death and a person's sense of security in life, where the person is content with everything \\"old\\" and familiar, whereas new things frighten him/her. The chorus consist of a single line, \\"Trideset je godina\\" (\\"it is thirty years\\"), which could be interpreted as someone or something being 30 years old, or that 30 years have passed since something occurred. The hidden track is only the second song by Sikter that is sung in Bosnian; the first was \\"JTM\\" from their first album \\"Now, Always, Never\\". \\"JTM\\" is short for \\"jebem li ti mi≈°a\\", a joke-swear which is sung as the chorus. It literally translates to \\"I'm f***ing your mouse\\", meaning that the person saying the swear is not happy with, or is slightly angry at the person at which the swear is directed, but being formulated as it is, it is clear that the anger is not deep at all, as the swear cannot be taken seriously. It could be said that the swear is an ambiguous type of humor. Where \\"JTM\\" is a humorous song, the hidden track on \\"Queen Of The Disco\\" is a song with a serious tone and a serious theme.

William Healy Dall and Paul Bartsch , \\"A Monograph of West American Pyramidellid Mollusks\\" , Smithsonian Institution, 1909 Description The broadly conic shell is milk- white. Its length measures 4 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are large, obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which the tilted edge of the last volution only projects, which shows five strong spiral threads. The five whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, strongly contracted at the sutures, appressed at the summits with a sloping shoulder that extends from the summit to the second spiral keel. They are marked by narrow decidedly elevated, retractive axial ribs, of which 16 occur upon the first and second, 18 upon the third, and 22 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the ribs, the whorls are marked between the sutures by four spiral keels, which equal the ribs in strength and render them decidedly nodulous at their junction. The spaces enclosed by the ribs and cords are well impressed rectangular pits whose axis coincides with the spiral sculpture. The sutures are subchanneled, showing a portion of the first basal keel in the last two volutions. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a broad channel, crossed by the axial ribs which terminate at the posterior edge of the first basal keel. The base of the body whorl is well rounded. It is marked by five subequal and subequally spaced spiral lirations, separated by broad spaces which are marked by numerous prominent axial threads. The aperture is broadly oval. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is moderately strong, curved, reinforced by the base. It is provided with a weak fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered with a thin callus. Distribution The type species was found in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego, California.

In some cases, untimed play can occur at the end of a game following the expiration of the clock, and may even be when a score occurs that decides the outcome of the game. Gridiron football In gridiron football, untimed play occurs in the following situations: * Extra points following touchdowns are attempted without the clock ticking (except in arena football, which uses a continuously running clock except in the last minute of a half) * If the clock expires while a play is in progress, the play continues untimed until the ball is dead * If, at the end of a quarter or a half, a defensive foul occurs, the offense is entitled to an untimed down * Specifically in Canadian football, if the clock expires while the ball is dead, play continues with one untimed down. (This is in contrast to American football, where if the ball is dead and time expires, the half or game immediately ends.) * In leagues that use the Kansas playoff for overtime (including Canadian, college and most high school football), all overtime play is untimed. * In the NFL, field goal attempts‚Äîunless they land in the field of play‚Äîare limited to five seconds. Should such a field goal attempt take longer than five seconds to complete, the excess will be untimed. * Also in the NFL, kickoffs and safety kicks are untimed unless, and until, the receiving team attempts to return the kick. All untimed downs are subject to the play clock and must commence before it expires, or else a delay of game penalty is levied. Basketball In basketball, untimed play occurs in the following situations: * Free throws are shot without the clock ticking, though in the NBA, there is a 10-second clock to shoot a free throw or else it is forfeited. * At the end of the game, the buzzer automatically ends the game. However, if a player has released the ball from his hands before the buzzer sounds and the ball makes it through the basket, the score counts. * When the ball is put in play by being inbounded, the play is untimed until touched by a player on the court. The player on the court closest to the ball will sometimes take advantage of this by delaying touching the ball for as long as possible by high-bouncing or rolling the ball down the court towards their teammate, buying his or her team a bit more time to shoot before the shot clock or game clock expires. * In 3x3, a formalized version of the 3-on-3 halfcourt game, overtime is untimed. The game ends by rule once either team scores 2 points in overtime, with shots from behind the \\"three-point\\" arc worth 2 points and all other shots (whether field goals or free throws) worth 1 point. * The Basketball Tournament, an annual offseason event in the U.S., uses the Elam Ending, an untimed end-of-game procedure, in all games. In the TBT implementation, the game clock proceeds normally until the first dead ball with 4:00 or less remaining in the fourth quarter. At that point, a \\"target score\\" is set by adding 8 points (originally 7; increased in 2019) to the score of the leading team. The game then resumes, with the shot clock fully operational but the game clock shut off. The first team to reach or exceed the target score wins the game. Ice hockey In hockey, mid-game penalty shots and post-game shootouts are untimed.

It is currently the city-owned Herington Regional Airport. History Herington Army Air Field was located eight miles from Herington, Kansas, on a 1,700-acre tract of land which had been purchased by the United States government. It was planned as a satellite of Topeka Army Airfield, a Second Air Force installation which was situated some 70 miles to the northeast and which served as the headquarters for the 21st Bombardment Wing. Construction of Herington Army Air Field, accomplished by contract under supervision of the Air Service Command, commenced in September 1942, and continued over a period of 14 months. Three runways were built with a dimension of 150 x 6750 feet, with a gross load capacity of 74,000 pounds, wheel load of 37,000 pounds. Runways and apron (500 x 4,750 feet) were constructed with a ten-inch gravel base placed in layers on a six-inch compacted earth subbase, and surfaced with one and one-half-inch asphalt cement; the service strip (80 feet wide) was a six-inch concrete slab, thickened to nine inches at the expansion and construction joints. three taxiways, 50 feet wide, completed the runway system. Fronting on the field, three squadron hangars, 120 by 80 feet, were built. Construction work of a general nature relative to the site chosen for the army air field near Herington, included a water storage and distribution system; a sewage collection and disposal plant; an electric distribution system; two gasoline storage and distribution systems; 128,000 square yards of paved roads and streets; 14,000 square yards of paved walks; and a swimming pool. The station contained about 100 buildings, electric transmission lines, and all the other things one could expect to find in a town of 2,500 people. Units On 1 November 1942, however, Maj. Harold Painter, who was slated to become the first commanding officer, arrived to take over the field. On 26 January 1943, Major Painter formally assumed command of Herington Army Airfield and appointed an adjutant, a provost marshal, a post engineer, a quartermaster(Capt. Arthur J. Sand), and a medical officer. On the same day also the following units were activated: * 503d Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron * 1161st Guard Squadron * 399th Army Air Forces Band In the ensuing weeks, a Base Signal Office was created, a Base Operations Section organized, a Finance Department set up, and a Base Chemical Service inaugurated. Commencing with only one officer on 1 November 1942, the number of military personnel on the field grew to 12 officers and 145 enlisted men by 1 March 1943 and to 103 officers and 1,768 enlisted men at the end of the following June. The first contingent of WACs, consisting of one officer and ten enlisted women, arrived one year later. The peak in the strength of the permanent party military personnel was reached in August 1944, with totals of 113 officers and 2,123 enlisted men and women. Deployment staging mission The 21st Bombardment Wing was charged with the responsibility of the final processing of heavy bombardment crews and equipment just prior to their leaving for overseas assignments. To carry out that program the wing utilized Topeka Army Airfield, and three satellite fields (Herington AAF, Bruning AAF, and Fairmont AAF) in Kansas and Nebraska. This processing of heavy bombardment crews and equipment, sometimes called staging and also preparation for overseas movements, proved to be the principal function of Herington Army Airfield. A preliminary step leading to the development of the program there was the assignment on 25 January 1943 of the 47th, the 48th, the 49th, and the 50th Airdrome Squadrons. On 17 February following, the 6th Heavy Bombardment Processing Headquarters was activated at Herington. The dominant role played by the processing function is indicated by the fact that in January 1944 the commanding officer of the 6th Heavy Bombardment Processing Headquarters, assumed command over the entire field. That move in effect consolidated three units which existed there: the Processing Headquarters itself; the 503d Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron; and the 406th Sub-Depot, jurisdiction over which the Second Air Force but recently had taken over from the Air Service Command. Two months later, the whole was organized as the 274th Army Air Forces Base Unit. The first combat crews and aircraft arrived at Herington for processing during the latter part of June 1943; and the program immediately got under way. Spread out over a period of approximately five days, the schedule involved the performance of the following functions on all such crews and aircraft which were temporarily assigned to the field: * Auditing and processing of personnel records, orders, and allied papers of each person, and bringing payments up to date * A physical fitness examination * A clothing and equipment inspection * The issue of certain critical items of equipment * The assignment of the final type aircraft, and the conduct of specified vital inspection tests thereon * A prisoner of war lecture * Communications instructions * The assignment of crews and aircraft to scheduled overseas projects * Briefings on routes to be traveled * Arranging the schedule for departure to the port of embarkation. For the first 11 months of the active program, Herington was primarily a B-24 Liberator staging field, with a few B-17 Flying Fortress crews and aircraft being assigned there for processing. During the months of June, July, and August 1944, however, it was converted into a B-29 Superfortress staging field. That meant, of course, the processing of very heavy bombardment crews and aircraft just prior to their departure for overseas assignments. By working around the clock during rush periods, the 274th AAF Base Unit at Herington was able to process an average of nine combat crews a day. Normally, however, the rate of processing was much more moderate. Figures for the year ending 30 June 1944 may be regarded as typical. They reveal that during that interval an average of just over 86 crews and 76 aircraft were processed each month. With some slight diminution this rate was maintained until the end of World War II. On the whole most of the crews involved left Herington with their own aircraft. Some of the others traveled by train to the ports of embarkation. The remainder, along with some few aircraft, were transported to ports of embarkation by the Air Transport Command. Inactivation In May 1945, the Continental Air Forces assumed jurisdiction of Herington AAF from the Second Air Force. On 18 July following Herington Army Airfield and the entire 21st Bombardment Wing were placed under the direct supervision of Headquarters, Continental Air Forces. In September 1945 Herington became an installation of the I Staging Command, with the change in the name of the 21st Wing to that designation. Soon thereafter Headquarters I Staging Command was moved from Topeka Army Airfield to Merced Army Airfield in California. There was no further change in the status of Herington, however, until its inactivation on 14 November 1945. Thereafter jurisdiction over it formally passed from the Continental Air Forces to the Oklahoma City Air Service Technical Command. The installation then was placed on an inactive status, and a declaration of surplus was prepared. On 18 October 1946 the War Department listed the field as surplus to its needs. After disposal had been made of all remaining property and a final audit had been made, jurisdiction over Herington Army Airfield was transferred to the Army's District Engineer, Seventh Service Command at Omaha, Nebraska who assumed jurisdiction over the field on 19 March 1947, pending disposition. Excess buildings and demilitarized equipment were sold or transferred to other bases. Some were torn down and sales were held for scrap lumber of torn down buildings, fence posts, barbed wire and other items which no longer had a useful need. Current status 2006 USGS photo of the former Herington Army Airfield The War Assets Administration eventually turned the air base over to local government officials. Since then the installation has been operated by the city of Herington as its municipal airport. The airport maintains a small portion of the N/S runway along with a small portion of the parking apron for aircraft use. Otherwise the remainder of the wartime airfield is abandoned. The NW/SE and SW/NE runways have been reduced to a single lane concrete road, with cattle feeding yards to the east and west sides of the road. About half of the N/S runway is abandoned along with the majority of the large aircraft parking apron and associated taxiways. Two of the wartime hangars remain in use, one as part of an open storage yard, the other in a non-aviation use. Most of the station area is unused with many concrete foundations of the former wartime station buildings evident. A few wartime buildings appear to be standing, although they are in a severe state of disrepair. The station area has some light industrial companies and some wartime streets are evident in photography. The former wartime airfield can be reached travelling east on U.S. Route 56 from Herington.

Initially a six-plane team was envisioned as performing for only one year with the Canadair Sabre 5, but the Golden Hawks were so popular after their 1959 show season that the team was re-established for 1960, under the command of W/C Jack Allan with Villeneuve flying as the lead pilot with the team.Dempsey 2002 p. 160. Villeneuve was the first leader of the RCAF Golden Hawks jet fighter aerobatic demonstration team in 1959, and then again in 1960. S/L Villeneuve was with the Hawks from the beginning in 1959 as leader of the team for two years, yielding the lead position to F/L Jim McCombe for the 1961 season. He had to leave the team when he became married, under the Hawks rule of only two years for married men. He then went on to Training Command.

His father was Margrave Philip William; his mother was Charlotte Johanna, a daughter of Prince John George II of Anhalt-Dessau and Princess Henriette Catherine of Nassau.  Life  After his father's death in 1711, his mother put Frederick Henry under the guardianship of his uncle Frederick I, and after Frederick I's death in 1713, under the guardianship of his cousin Frederick William I. In 1711, Frederick Henry was made the chief of the Infantry Regiment No. 12. However, he showed little interest in military affairs. In 1733, King Frederick William I was so incensed with the disorder in Frederick Henry's regiment that he was jailed for several weeks. Frederick the Great held little respect for Frederick Henry's abilities and did not employ him. In 1741, Frederick Henry traded the Infantry Regiment No. 12 for the Infantry Regiment No. 42, but again, he cared little for his duties, and he left its business to the respective commanders. When his brother Frederick William died in 1771, Frederick Henry inherited the Lordship of Schwedt-Wildenbruch. As \\"Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt\\", he was a patron of the arts, especially theater. In 1755 he acquired the Prinzessinnenpalais in Berlin and in 1785, he contracted the actress Henriette Hendel-Schutz to perform in his Court Theater. He married his first cousin Leopoldine Marie of Anhalt-Dessau, a daughter of Prince Leopold I of Anhalt- Dessau, nicknamed the old Dessauer. After the birth of two daughters, he and his wife quarreled so often and so violently, that he banned her to Kolberg for the rest of her life. When he died in 1788, the junior line of Brandenburg-Schwedt died out and the secundogeniture fell back to the Electorate. His daughters and nieces received a pension.

Data extracted from See the NCBI webpage on Spirochaetes Data extracted from Brachyspira species include pathogens in pigs, birds, dogs, and humans. B. pilosicoli colonizes millions of humans worldwide, leading to human intestinal spirochaetosis, a chronic, intermittent watery diarrhea vastly underdiagnosed because of the lack of a simple diagnostic tool for clinicians. Multiplex qPCRs are promising diagnostic tools, as Brachyspira do not grow on conventional media. B. pilosicoli also cause avian spirochetosis: birds might be considered as the natural reservoir. B. hyodysenteriae leads to diarrheal disease in growing pigs worldwide, causing the so-called swine dysentery, typhlocolitis or porcine intestinal spirochaetosis, which contributes to major \\"production losses\\" in agrobusiness. Some species like B. innocens or B. intermedia seem to be less virulent. Phylogeny The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 123 by 'The All- Species Living Tree' Project.'The All-Species Living Tree' Project. ‚ô† Strains found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) but not listed in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LSPN).  Evolutionary hypothesis  It is interesting to consider that Brachyspira could be the missing link between independent gram-negatives and eventually internalized organisms like Mitochondria. One could imagine the following phylogenetic pathway: gram-negative free dwellers -> spirochetes attached to cell cytoskeleton and expressing porins creating cytoplasmic bridges and genome complementarity between parasite and mother cell -> rickettsia with full internalization --> permanent intracellular host = mitochondrion  Pathogenesis of human intestinal spirochetosis (HIS)  Brachyspira bacteria have evolved a parasitic lifestyle through genomic reduction (~2.5 to 3.3 Mb) compared to other gram negative bacteria (~5 Mb). Humans become infected through dirty water ingestion, possibly by swimming in waters containing the bacteria or by direct oral exposure to contaminated feces (outdoor tribes, raw egg eaters, slum inhabitants with no sanitation, MSM). Genome homologies between Borellia, Treponema and Brachyspira imply that Brachyspira is expected to: * import carbohydrates and short fatty acids (6->3 carbons) for its energetic needs from the colon lumen, * swim to (viscophily) and through (viscotaxy) mucin layers thanks to its spiroid shape and flagellum (see film ), * attach to colonocytes apically and to each other laterally, * thereby creating a continuous layer of bacterial cells which can withstand feces movement in vivo: this is the pathognomonic brush border seen in histology on colonic biopsies *its is still to be elucidated if Brachyspira is, as Borrelia, able to attach to decorin and progress in loose connective tissue and invade other tissues, *as for borrelia and syphilis, Brachyspira may be able to translocate to seminal vesicles where it would find another niche \\"outside\\" the body with mucins to invade, epithelia to attach and glucose available. Chapot F. (2020) hypothesises that Brachyspira may be a sexually transmittable disease in MSM communities via ano-oral route but also penetrative route. Once attached apically to the enterocyte, hidden to the natural and acquired immunity by the mucous layer and occupying a niche that other bacteria cannot use, Brachyspira most likely expresses at its apex porins allowing it to import from the colonocyte's cytoplasm the amino acids and nucleic acids necessary to replicate. It has also been demonstrated that Brachyspira creates an environment which is favorable to its locomotion by upregulating mucin expression: it creates its own niche.  Clinical manifestations in human medicine  Publications now tend to point out that Brachyspira colonization should not be considered harmless commensalism: * Chronic diarrhea * Irritable bowel syndrome * Acute intestinal pain * Ulcerative colitis * Post translocation spirochetemia and cardiogenic shock  Antibiotic treatment and resistances in human medicine  Treament with 10 days co-amoxicilline 1g bid + metronidazole 500 tid seems to have very good results on abdominal symptoms. It is advised to administer Saccharomyces boulardii once a day during this course of antibiotherapy. Doxycycline resistance has been documented and should be avoided. Antibiotic treatment and resistance in veterinary medicine Veterinary antibiotics used to treat pigs with dysentery due to Brachyspira species include the lincosamide lincomycin, the ionophore salinomycin, the quinoxaline carbadox, the pleuromodulins tiamulin and valnemulin, as well as the aminoglycoside gentamicin, an important antibiotic used in humans. Brachyspira resistance to the above antibiotics has been increasingly reported. While no Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) antimicrobial breakpoints for Brachyspira have been established, resistance to the pleuromodulins tiamulin and valnemulin is considered at MIC ‚â• 2 ¬µg/ml.Karlsson M,Fellstr√∂m C, Johansson KE,Franklin A.

In Sweden, 10-15% of B. pilosicoli isolates between 2002 and 2010 were resistant to tiamulin (MICs >4 Œºg/ml), and a gradual increase in tiamulin MICs was seen in B. hyodysenteriae between 1990 and 2003, which has since plateaued.Pringle M, Land√©n A, Unnerstad HE, Molander B, Bengtsson B. Antimicrobial susceptibility of porcine Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli isolated in Sweden between 1990 and 2010.Acta Vet Scand. 2012 Sep 21;54:54. Decreased susceptibility to lincomycin, but not to tiamulin was found among Polish isolates.Zmudzki J, Szczotka A, Nowak A, Strzelecka H, Grzesiak A, Pejsak Z.Antimicrobial susceptibility of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae isolated from 21 Polish farms.Pol J Vet Sci. 2012;15(2):259-65. In the USA, resistance of Brachyspira species collected 2008‚Äì2010 was common only against lincomycin (80% had MIC of 32 or 64), MIC's were moderately high against gentamicin, while resistance to valnemulin(4.7%) and tiamulin (3.2% of isolates) was yet uncommon, as reported in the only U.S. study to date, from Iowa. The use of pleuromodulins in U.S. food animals is not separately reported in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's annual Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA) report, \\"Antimicrobials Sold or Distributed for Use in Food- Producing Animals\\". However, the amount of 190 tonnes of lincosamides used is substantial per ADUFA; antibiotics used in the U.S. in food animals in 2011 was: Ionophores 4,123,259 kg, aminoglycosides 214,895 kg, and Lincosamides 190,101 kg. Microbiologic identification Brachyspira are capable of hemolysis, the degree of which has been used to characterize them, with B. hyodysenteriae showing strong beta hemolysis while B. pilosicoli, B. intermedia, B. murdochii, and B. innocens have been described as weakly hemolytic.Komarek V,Maderner A,Spergser J,Weissenb√∂ck H. Infections with weakly haemolytic Brachyspira species in pigs with miscellaneous chronic diseases. Vet Microbiol 134: 311‚Äì317. However, in a recent study from Iowa State University, all (10/10) B. intermedia isolates, 91% (9/11) of Brachyspira spp. isolates, and 20% (2/6) of B. pilosicoli isolates from farms in North Carolina (36), Iowa (23), Minnesota (9), Nebraska (3), Michigan (2), Illinois (2), Missouri (1), North Dakota (1), South Dakota (1), and Ohio (1), demonstrated strong beta-hemolysis. Recently quantitative PCR seems to be a more sensitive way to identify Brachyspira, which is globally a very fastidious bacterium to grow. Change in ecology In the U.S.A. Brachyspira- associated pig disease and isolation of Brachyspira species from swine with diarrheal disease largely disappeared from swine herds in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but returned in the mid-2000s for unknown reasons. A 2011 study of isolates from Midwestern swine herds described major changes in Brachyspira spp frequency and hemolysis, i.e. pathogenicity: the majority of isolated Brachyspira species were previously considered minimally pathogenic or commensal, like Brachyspira murdochi (27%)or novel/unclassifiable Brachyspira species (25%), while only 40.5% of 79 isolates from diseased pigs could be confirmed as the classic pathogens B. hyodysenteriae or Brachyspira pilosicoli by PCR.Clothier KA, Kinyon JM, Frana TS, Naberhaus N, Bower L, Strait EL, Schwartz K.Species characterization and minimum inhibitory concentration patterns of Brachyspira species isolates from swine with clinical disease.J Vet Diagn Invest. 2011 Nov;23(6):1140-5. Brachyspira species previously capable of weak hemolysis only, like B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli were found to produce strong hemolysis. They were also frequently identified from diseased swine which suggests they are emerging pathogens. A compelling explanation for this change in epidemiology and ecology is selection by the increasing use of antibiotics in pigs (e.g. as growth promoters), since B. murdochii and unclassifiable Brachyspira spp. are less susceptible to antimicrobials than the previously established Brachyspira pathogens.

Lett was born in Waddingham, Lincolnshire, the eldest of eight children of local general practitioner Dr Richard Alfred Lett and his wife Bithiah (n√©e Appleford). His younger sister, Phyllis, later became a famous contralto. He was educated at Marlborough College and the University of Leeds and then trained as a doctor at the London Hospital from 1896. He returned to Leeds to graduate MBBCh in 1899 and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) in 1902. He worked at the London Hospital, being appointed surgical registrar in 1902, assistant surgeon in 1905, surgeon in 1915, and later senior surgeon. He also served as lecturer in anatomy and clinical and operative surgery from 1909 to 1912. He was a general surgeon, but had a special interest in urology and headed the hospital's genito-urinary department for many years. In 1905 he published a study of the treatment of breast cancer by removal of the ovaries, one of the earliest studies in this field. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps and served at the Anglo-American Hospital at Wimereux in France from 1914 to 1915, the Belgian field hospital at Veurne in 1915, and then in Egypt. He resigned his commission in November 1916 with the rank of major and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1920. In December 1934 he retired from active surgery and became consulting surgeon to the London Hospital, effectively an honorary position. He served on the council of the Royal College of Surgeons of England from 1927 to 1943 and was president from 1938 to 1940, following which he was created a Baronet in 1941. He was also appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1947 for his services to the King Edward's Hospital Fund, of which he had been honorary secretary since 1941. During the Second World War he chaired the committee for the allocation of medical manpower. From 1946 to 1948 he was chairman of the British Medical Association, during the creation of the National Health Service. Lett married Helen (Nellie) Browne, daughter of the famous surgeon Sir Buckston Browne, in 1906; they had three daughters. He died at his home at Walmer, Kent. As he had no sons, the baronetcy became extinct.

It was built in 1917-18 for what was then the Western College for Women by the architect Thomas Hastings, in a \\"Transitional Gothic\\" style with both Gothic and Romanesque influences. It is now a venue for church services and weddings. History Kumler Chapel under construction in 1917. Kumler Chapel was constructed beginning in 1917, suffered from a structural collapse, and was then rebuilt beginning in June and completed in September 1918. Kumler Chapel was built on the Western College for Women campus, which is now a part of the Western Campus for Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Kumler Chapel replaced an older chapel. The building was built due to the beneficence of Mrs. Anna Kumler Wright, an alumna of Western College for Women, and her sister Ella Kumler McKelvy, also an alumna of Western College for Women. The sisters decided to have Kumler Chapel built in honor of their parents: their father, Reverend J.P.E. Kumler and their mother, Mrs. Abbie Goulding Kumler.‚ÄúMiles in the Development of Kumler Chapel‚Äù. Miami University Western Archives Kumler Chapel was originally dedicated on November 10, 1916 yet it was not finished being built until September 1918. November 28, 1918 became the official Dedication Day for Kumler Chapel; this site was completed and a piece of ivy was removed from a neighboring building, Peabody, and was attached to the east side of Kumler Chapel.‚ÄúDedication Day‚Äù. Western archives. Oxford, OH-Historical documentation, November 28, 1918. The building‚Äôs arch and mortar collapsed on February 26, 1918 at 4:20pm. This collapse was a major setback for the construction of Kumler Chapel. The cost of Kumler Chapel was never revealed, and the total cost was divided between the Kumler sisters as well as the architect, Thomas Hastings of New York.Western Campus - Kumler Chapel. November 1, 2011. The chapel was originally used for church services, baccalaureates, and convocation for the Western College for Women.‚ÄúChurch Services‚Äù. Western Archives, Oxford, OH-Historic pamphlets for the Western College for Women, 1972 During the 1970s, two Chapel Interns were appointed from among the seminary students to assist in developing the religious life of Western College for Women. The two interns were to be one man and one woman who were not married. These interns helped develop the use of the chapel for weddings and other activities. Architecture Noted architect Thomas Hastings, formerly of Carr√®re and Hastings, designed Kumler Chapel inspired by both the Gothic and Romanesque, called ‚ÄúTransitional Gothic.‚Äù . Miami University Western Archives His inspiration for Kumler Chapel came from √âglise Saint-Pierre, a church in Bazouches-au-Houlme, Normandy. The outside of Kumler Chapel is built with Fieldstone laid in a fishbone pattern which comes from the original church in Normandy, which dates back to the 9th Century. The windows of Kumler Chapel are extremely important and possess great meaning. They are Gothic pointed arches with the absence of tracery; this style dates back to the Romanesque period. The windows were originally designed for a chapel by Montague-Castle-London Company of New York, and then brought to Oxford. There are three main windows: the one in the center is a display of Christ; below him are Mary, Martha, and Mary Magdelene with an inscription underneath that reads: ‚ÄúBut His teaching Christ brought the meaning of true womanhood to every woman of every nation and every home.‚Äù This window was dedicated to Jeremiah P.E. Kumler, D.D. The west window represented the Old Testament incidents of Prophetess Deborah with listeners. This window was dedicated to Elias Kumler. The east window represented the New Testament and displayed love expressed through Christ. This window was dedicated to Abagail Goulding Kumler. All windows in Kumler Chapel are plain glass except for two, which are rose glass.Western College - Miami University, Oxford, Austin Organs The interior is dark, heavy wood, which is to create a solemn and peaceful atmosphere.Ohio Historic Inventory. Ohio Historic Preservation Office, August 30, 2008. There are heavy beams in the ceiling on the interior. The exterior was built with grey fieldstone, from nine native fieldstone, which was laid in a fishbone pattern. An architectural specialty of Kumler Chapel is the alignment of the ridgepole of the tower roof. It is at the right angles to that of the nave roof whereas ridgepoles are usually parallel.

Technological aspects Melomics applies an evolutionary approach to music composition, i.e., music pieces are obtained by simulated evolution. These themes compete to better adapt to a proper fitness function, generally grounded on formal and aesthetic criteria. The Melomics system encodes each theme in a genome, and the entire population of music pieces undergoes evo-devo dynamics (i.e., pieces read-out mimicking a complex embryological development process). The system is fully autonomous: once programmed, it composes music without human intervention. This technology has been transferred to industry as an academic spin-off, Melomics Media, which has provided and reprogrammed a new computer cluster that created a huge collection of popular music. The results of this evolutionary computation are being stored in Melomics' site, which nowadays constitutes a vast repository of music content. A differentiating feature is that pieces are available in three types of formats: playable (MP3), editable (MIDI and MusicXML) and readable (score in PDF). Computer clusters The Melomics computational system includes two computer clusters: Melomics109 and Iamus, dedicated to popular and artistic music, respectively. Melomics109: The largest repository of popular music Melomics109 is cluster programmed and integrated in the Melomics system. Its first product is a vast repository of popular music compositions (roughly 1 billion), covering all essential styles. In addition to MP3, all songs are available in editable formats (MIDI); and music is licensed under CC0, meaning that it is freely downloadable. 0music is the first album published by Melomics109, which is available in MP3 and MIDI formats, under CC0 license. It has been argued that, by making such amount of editable, original and royalty-free music accessible to people, Melomics may accelerate the process of commoditization of music, and change the way music is composed and consumed in the future. Iamus: First album of professional contemporary music by a non-human intelligence In the first stages of the development of the Melomics system, Iamus composed Opus one (on October 15, 2010), arguably the first fragment of professional contemporary classical music ever composed by a computer in its own style, rather than attempting to emulate the style of existing composers. The first full composition (also in contemporary classic style), Hello World!, premiered exactly one year after the creation of Opus one, on October 15, 2011. Four later works premiered on July 2, 2012, and were broadcast live from the School of Computer Science at Universidad de M√°laga as part of the events included in the Alan Turing year. The compositions performed at this event were later recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra, creating Iamus' eponymous first album, which New Scientist reported as the \\"first complete album to be composed solely by a computer and recorded by human musicians.\\" Commenting on the quality and authenticity of the music, Stephen Smoliar, critic of classical music at The San Francisco Examiner, commented \\"What is primary is the act of making the music itself engaged by the performers and how the listener responds to what those performers do... what is most interesting about the documents generated by Iamus is their capacity to challenge the creative talents of performing musicians\\". Accessed: 10 January 2013. Applications Melomics' empathic music has been tested in a number of therapeutic clinical trials, evidencing positive effects in reducing fear of heights, acute stress and pain perception. One of the studies resulted in a reduction of almost two thirds of pain perception in children undergoing a standard Skin Prick Test during allergy testing, as compared to the standard procedure. Some of these experiments made use of free mobile apps to adapt music to daily activity, such as jogging, or commuting, but also for therapeutic use, such as lessening stress before an exam, reducing chronic pain, insomnia, and to help children go to sleep. Ongoing efforts to allow Melomics to adapt music in real-time to changes in the physiological state of the listener, and to music branding were also reported.(archived at ) References External links *Melomics Homepage *Melomics page at University of Malaga (Spain) Category:Biotechnology Category:Music technology Category:Evolutionary algorithms Category:Spanish Supercomputing Network ","title":"Melomics"},{"id":"33965213","text":"Richard Levinge may refer to: * Sir Richard Levinge, 1st Baronet (1656‚Äì1724) Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, also sat in the English House of Commons, and Commons of Great Britain *Sir Richard Levinge, 2nd Baronet (c1690‚Äì1748) Irish landowner and politician, MP for Westmeath 1723‚Äì27 and for Blessington 1727‚Äì48 * Richard Levinge (1724‚Äì1783), Irish politician, MP for Duleek 1768-76 *Sir Richard Levinge, 7th Baronet (1811‚Äì1884), Irish landowner and politician, MP for Westmeath 1857‚Äì65 *Sir Richard Levinge, 4th Baronet (c 1723‚Äì1786) of the Levinge baronets *Sir Richard Levinge, 6th Baronet (1785‚Äì1848) of the Levinge baronets *Sir Richard George Augustus Levinge, 7th Baronet (1811‚Äì1884) of the Levinge baronets *Sir Richard William Levinge, 10th Baronet (1878‚Äì1914) of the Levinge baronets *Sir Richard Vere Henry Levinge, 11th Baronet (1911‚Äì1984) of the Levinge baronets *Sir Richard George Robin Levinge, 12th Baronet (born 1946) of the Levinge baronets ","title":"Richard Levinge"},{"id":"33965215","text":"The Brown‚ÄìKaufman amendment (or the SAFE Banking Act) was a failed 2010 amendment proposed in the United States Senate to be part of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank bill by Democratic Senators Sherrod Brown (OH) and Ted Kaufman (DE).

Bent edge was also part of a rising anti- Dischord sentiment among many people in the punk scene. It was started by members of Washington, DC hardcore scene who were fed up with the rigidness and intolerance in the nascent straight edge scene. To combat straight edge, they started throwing beer and drug-fuelled punk shows. The point of these shows was to be the complete antithesis of straight edge. Many adherents to this lifestyle became known for their heavy drug and alcohol use. Quickly, this idea spread throughout the US. As early as 1982, only a year after Straight Edge was released, kids were approaching Minor Threat while they were on tour telling them that they were bent or curved edge. To Ian Mackaye, \\"the anti-movement started before the movement began. People were rebelling against straight edge before there was even a movement to rebel against\\". At the time that bent edge started, there were several people living in the Dischord Records House that were not straight edge. Straight edge and non straight edge people mixed freely, but as time went on, the tolerance in the straight edge scene faded, adding momentum to the bent edge ideals.

Unlike check kiting, which is illegal under nearly all circumstances, laws against credit card kiting are not completely prohibitive of the practice, thereby allowing it to be done to some degree. It is up to the banks to detect the practice and when necessary, stop it. In order for prosecution to occur in a credit card kiting scheme, a bank must prove intent to deceive. Et seq. reference infers paying credit card minimum balances with credit card proceeds is de facto evidence of deceit. Methods Introductory rates Many credit cards offer introductory rates, which in some cases, could be as low as 0% to which balances from other cards can be transferred. In theory, this enables the endless transfer of balances between cards, and since so many offers are available, this could be carried out for a long period of time. But many banks now have become aware of this practice, and introductory rates are offered only a limited number of times. In this case, the kiter is delaying legally due balances, and potentially, interest payable to the credit card bank. Cash advances Cash advances can be obtained from most credit cards, which can be used to pay off balances or loans. Though there are fees and higher interest rates for obtaining these loans, if a card has a high credit limit or no limit at all, this in theory could be used to pay off the previous balance while adding to the interest. In this case, the kiter is delaying legally due balances, and potentially, interest payable to the credit card bank; or, in the cited extreme case, using the credit card proceeds to earn interest at both banks' expense. Self payment Many payment services, such as PayPal and Square, allow people to receive credit card payments for low prices, which could be made to oneself. These could be used to pay off balances. In this case, the kiter is creating cash while avoiding legally entitled cash advance fees. This is a violation of PayPal and Square Terms of Service contracts and agreements.

In a traditional blog a blogger will write his or her comments about a given topic and other users may view and sometimes comment on the bloggers work. A reverse blog is written entirely by the users, who are given a topic. The blog posts are usually screened and chosen for publication by a core group or the publisher of the blog. Overview A reverse blog is characterized primarily by the lack of a blogger on a site providing blog-style content. The number of comments must be limited in order to differentiate a reverse blog from a forum. This number of comments must be fixed as well. These are the primary and necessary characteristics of a reverse blog. The reverse blog is also commonly called an inverse blog. Common features These features are common or popular among reverse blogs, but not necessary. * An approval system to rate comments * A login form to track user actions * Moderators and user hierarchy to enforce content  Purposes  The Reverse Blog has gained popularity over the years as users have developed a disdain for traditional blogging. In general, users are not willing to monitor the comments of one blogger. Instead, they would prefer to make a blog themselves. In order to deal with the increasing number of unread blogs, reverse blogs were created. These focus users into a common area to represent various topics and (optionally) rate each other's content.

He served in the Croatian Parliament from 2011 to 2015. Early life and education Ivan Grubi≈°iƒá was born in Dicmo in a poor family. He had seven brothers and sisters. His father Jure and one of the brothers were killed by the Yugoslav Partisans. His mother worked as a seamstress. After finishing elementary school, Grubi≈°iƒá enrolled in the Catholic gymnasium in Split, graduating in 1956. During his time in high school he played the organ. Grubi≈°iƒá received a degree in theology in 1962 at the Catholic Faculty of Theology of the University of Zagreb, and also a degree in sociology and philosophy at the University of Zadar in 1982. He received his Ph.D. in 1995 at the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, with the thesis Religious Behavior of Catholics in Dalmatia in the Mid-80s and Evaluation of Behavior. Academia Grubi≈°iƒá taught at the Catechetical Institute of the Zagreb Catholic Faculty of Theology, the Theological-Catechetical Institute in Split and the Croatian Studies College. Although officially retired since 2013, he still worked part-time at the Maritime Faculty of the University of Split, teaching philosophy. Grubi≈°iƒá was the initiator and one of the founders of humanist Hrvatska akademske udruga ‚Äì ƒåovjek nadasve (Croatian Academic Association - Man Above All). He was also the founder and the leader of the public lecture series Suvremeno dru≈°tvo i duhovnost (Contemporary Society and Spirituality) and Znanost i dru≈°tvo (Science and Society). He authored 12 books and edited four conference proceedings. He was also the founder and managing editor of the journal Dijalog (Dialogue). Grubi≈°iƒá started Savez za graƒëansku i etiƒçku Hrvatsku (Alliance for Civic and Ethical Croatia). He was awarded the National Award for the Promotion and Popularization of Science, Annual Award of the City of Split, \\"Velimir Terziƒá\\" Award for the promotion of democracy and Slobodna Dalmacija Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2007, President Stjepan Mesiƒá awarded him the Order of Danica Hrvatska for special merits in culture. Politics Despite being warned against any form of active engagement in politics by the leadership of the Catholic Church, Grubi≈°iƒá led an independent list in the 2011 parliamentary election in the 10th electoral district, eventually winning 29.000 votes (11.7%), and two seats in Sabor. In January 2012, the Archbishop Marin Bari≈°iƒá suspended Grubi≈°iƒá for founding a political party, and accepting the parliamentary term. His suspension covered exercise of confession, preaching and celebrating the Holy Mass, as well as the ban on wearing the priestly garments. Grubi≈°iƒá appealed to the Congregation for the Clergy, but his appeal was rejected. Grubi≈°iƒá actively advocated revision, even termination, of the treaties signed between Croatia and the Holy See, which would, among other things, reduce the amount of taxpayer money annually given to the Catholic Church from the state budget. He criticized Church leadership on several occasions because of their profligacy. He believed that religious communities should be financed only by their members through church tax, praising the example of Germany. Grubi≈°iƒá also opposed the teaching of religious education in public schools stating that it should only be taught in churches. During the campaign for the 2013 referendum on prohibiting same-sex marriage, Grubi≈°iƒá stated that \\"referendum was unnecessary because definition of a marriage as a union between a man and a woman already stands in the family law\\", as well as that referendum created a form of talibanism, or \\"exclusion of others and different which is in contrast with the Christs teaching\\". Grubi≈°iƒá ran on 2013 local elections as a candidate for the Split- Dalmatia county prefect, and eventually came in second. However, he was elected to the Split City Council and served as a city councilor from 2013 until his resignation and formal departure from politics in 2016. In 2014 interview for Index.hr, Grubi≈°iƒá described Cabinet of Zoran Milanoviƒá as \\"less prone to theft, but incapable and with no results\\". When commenting on President Ivo Josipoviƒá, with whom he was a good friend, he stated that it would've been tragedy if he had been elected for a second term, because \\"he says what people want to hear, but he didn't initiate any changes to the matters in which he had jurisdiction\\". Grubi≈°iƒá also criticized nationalism in Croatia stating that \\"nationalism itself shouldn't be a moral crisis, but the way it's carried out in Croatia is associated with hatred, and hatred should always be suppressed. Hate speech is not a speech of civilized society, particularly human and Christian society.\\" In 2016, he retired from politics and thus his suspension was repealed by the Archbishop. Death On 19 March 2017, after struggling with health problems Grubi≈°iƒá died in Split, aged 80. He spent his last years in the retirement home for priests in Split. He was buried in his hometown of Dicmo.

The Valia paani maram is a sacred instrument used only for rites in temples. It is made up of the heart wood of jack wood, taken from the tree standing at the temple complex. On either side, it is covered with pieces of tanned leather of cow or bull-calf. Two hooks are provided on either side for tying a cloth so that the instrument rests either on the shoulder or wrist of the artist while beating it. It is beaten with palms.

Life  Charles of Brandenburg-Schwedt was born in Berlin. He joined the Prussian Army at an early age and distinguished himself during the First Silesian War at the capture of G≈Çog√≥w, at the Battle of Mollwitz and the Battle of Chotusitz. He took command in Upper Silesia in the spring of 1745, to the special satisfaction of his cousin, King Frederick II of Prussia. During the Seven Years' War Margrave Charles again held independent commands, as Frederick II had confidence in him, and he distinguished himself at the Battle of Hochkirch and the Battle of Torgau. In both battles, as at Mollwitz, he was wounded. The General German Biography (ADB) describes him as a noble, philanthropic character and lover of the arts and sciences. For 31 years he governed the knights, the Bailiwick of Brandenburg, and its fiefs as Grand Master of the Order of St. John, having been installed at Sonnenburg in 1731. He died in Breslau.  Issue  Charles Frederick Albert was never married, but had one daughter with his mistress, Dorothea Regina Wuthner (who was raised to the nobility on 14 January 1744 as \\"Frau von Carlowitz\\"): * Caroline Regina von Carlowitz (Soldin, 12 December 1731 ‚Äì Berlin, 16 September 1755), married in Berlin on 16 June 1747 to Count Albrecht Christian von Sch√∂nburg-Hinterglauchau (22 January 1720 ‚Äì 9 March 1799), Charles's adjutant. They had three children: **Countess Ernestine Caroline Wilhelmine Albertine of Sch√∂nburg-Hinterglauchau (6 June 1748 ‚Äì 21 March 1810); married in Berlin on 2 November 1770 to Count Frederick Louis Finck von Finckenstein (18 February 1745 ‚Äì 18 April 1818). **Count Frederick William Charles Ernest of Sch√∂nburg-Hinterglauchau (9 January 1751 ‚Äì 17 June 1751). **Count Christian William Charles Frederick Ernest of Sch√∂nburg- Hinterglauchau (14 June 1752 ‚Äì 9 March 1770). In 1744, Charles was engaged to marry Maria Amalia of Hesse-Cassel (1721‚Äì1744), but she died before they could wed. Upon his death in 1762, lacking legitimate heirs, his estate reverted to the crown. After the Treaty of Hubertusburg, Frederick II granted these fortunes to the two officers for whom he had particular gratitude: Hans Sigismund von Lestwitz received the estate of Friedland, and Joachim Bernhard von Prittwitz, who had led the king from the battlefield in the Kunersdorf, received the estate at Quillitz. Theodore Fontane gave this circumstance a special mention, by quoting a proverb: \\"Lestwitz a sauv√© l'etat, Prittwitz a sauv√© le roi.\\" (Lestwitz saved the state, Prittwitz the king.) The staff officers of the Lestwitz regiment received a golden medal.

Bayer. Retrieved 2011-12-05. The polyps are retractable and the stems have an axis of the protein gorgonin surrounding a narrow, hollow, cross-chambered central core. Molecular phylogenetic analyses undertaken suggest that the family is polyphyletic. The main feature which separates the members of the different genera is the degree and type of spiculation. Other diagnostic features include the pattern of branching and the morphology of the whole colony. There is an increase in complexity from unbranched whip forms, open branched forms, reticulate forms and the leafy frond forms which include by Phyllogorgia and Phycogorgia. Many species of gorgoniids are native to warm waters around the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of America. Some genera, including Lophogorgia, Leptogorgia and Eunicella, have a more widespread distribution including the temperate eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea.

In: Funeral Maelstrom Of Hate, no. 6, 2004. by Nefandus drummer, backing vocalist and lyricist Mika \\"Belfagor\\" Hakola. The band recorded the single Myst√©rion T√©s Anomias in Tore \\"Necromorbus\\" Stjerna's Necromorbus studio in January 1998 and released it through Pounding Metal Productions. In 2000, Belfagor retired from his musical activities to concentrate on his occult studies and practices. This, together with the closure of Shadow Records, led to the cancellation of the band's planned debut album. It was never recorded, but was to be released by Shadow Records under the title Mystery of Iniquity (Luciferian Evangelium Cantata). The label released promotional ads featuring the planned album cover as early as 1999 . In 2003, while in prison, Hakola started composing again. In 2004, he was joined by singer Nebiros again, and they recruited drummer Tore \\"Shiva\\" Stjerna, who had produced the Myst√©rion T√©s Anomias single. After he served another prison sentence, Hakola got in contact with guitarist Atum, and through him with bassist Teh√¥m. In December 2004, the band recorded two songs for the Myst√©rion T√©s Anomias re-release through Norma Evangelium Diaboli; on the re-release, Hakola used the new pseudonym \\"Michayah\\", and Nebiros called himself Leviathan.Ofermod: Myst√©rion t√©s anomias, Norma Evangelium Diaboli 2005. The band's first album Pentagrammaton, which was supposed to feature Moloch of Teitanblood sharing vocals with NebirosStahlschrulle: Ofermod - Interview . and \\"mark the ten year anniversary of OFERMOD\\" in 2006, was \\"partly finished in late 2005/early 2006\\", but delayed because \\"Michayah was sent to prison, for assault, robbery and a few other incidents, in early March 2006\\". He was released in August 2006, but sentenced to serve more time the same year, \\"due to new acts of violence\\". Pentagrammaton was therefore further delayed until 2007. The album remained unreleased because \\"obviously the forces of chaos did not want this album to be released\\". Belfagor took time to solely re-work the material, which was produced by former Marduk bassist Magnus \\"Devo\\" Andersson and released under the title Tiamt√º in 2008. The band released their second album Thaumiel in 2012 with singer and guitarist J. Kvarnbrink; aka \\"Teh√¥m\\" of the bands Mortuus and Head of the Demon, replacing Nebiros who left the band in 2011 to rejoin Malign; though he briefly rejoined the band in 2012 for some live performances, and produced once again at Endarker Studio by Magnus Andersson. By 2012, Ofermod had a new and complete line-up; including bassist Robin \\"Rudra\\" Fj√§ll and drummer Simon Samuelsson. The band released their second EP Serpents Dance in 2014 and their third full length album Sol Nox in 2017. Johannes Kvarnbrink amicably departed the band upon completion of Sol Nox and according to Hakola he left due to feeling he had achieved his potential and had nothing more to offer the band; even stating that the album was a masterpiece that he couldn't top. From July 2017 until September 13, 2019, Mika Hakola was the only member of the band left until he announced that bassist Robin Fj√§ll had rejoined the band. According to Hakola, he alongside Fj√§ll are currently working on the band's next album. On March 20, 2020, Shadow Records announced that they would be releasing a remastered and remixed version of the band's scrapped 2005 album Pentagrammaton; it was revealed that the album will be released on June 22, 2020. The remixing and remastering was done by Tore Stjerna. Mika Hakola has also confirmed that a new Ofermod album will follow up the release of Pentagrammaton. Music and ideology Ofermod are based on the forces of Sitra Achra. Belfagor claims to write the lyrics in connection with meditation and astral travels and composes the music in semi- trance.Terry Demeter: Ofermod. Breath of the Dragon. In: Unrestrained Magazine, no. 39, pp. 74f. Belfagor tries to avoid being consciously influenced by other bands.Nathan T. Birk: OFERMOD. Ofermod's musical style supposedly influenced other Swedish black metal bands such as Watain and Ondskapt.Stahlschrulle: Ofermod - Tiamt√º. On Tiamt√º, Ofermod \\"has eschewed breakneck speed for brutish, evocative music, which has far more technically in common with Death Metal than Black Metal\\".Stewart Voegtlin: TheLeftHandPath.com - Interview: Ofermod. Their EP's style has been likened to bands such as Watain (whom Ofermod supposedly influenced), Dark Funeral (whom Belfagor called one of \\"the non-serious bands that use the Satanic thing as an image but actually have no idea of this phenomenon's esoteric aspects\\") and Gorgoroth by AllMusic journalist Eduardo Rivadavia. Marduk guitarist Morgan H√•kansson, for whose album Wormwood Belfagor wrote the lyrics to \\"Phosphorous Redeemer\\", described their early music as \\"raw black metal\\", whereas the style on the Tiamt√º album \\"include[s] some death metal, like a bit of MORBID ANGEL\\"Darren Cowan: MARDUK. Interview with guitarist Morgan H√•kansson, December 2009, accessed on 29 December 2009. (whose debut album Altars of Madness made a great impression upon BelfagorBelfagor: 5 Klassiker. In: Rock Hard, no. 269, October 2009, p. 83.). The band originally worshipped the Devil and termed the music \\"Orthodox Black Metal\\". The new tracks on the EP re- release were characterised as \\"Orthodox Death Metal\\", \\"for the band no longer use the word 'Satan' (ha-shatan) as a description of their religion, but leave the holiest essence of the Lord silent, as it forever should be, for it existed before the cosmos and eventually will bring to its primal form: No- Thing = Utter Spiritual Death\\". Yet Ofermod are still connected to Satanism; Belfagor stated that \\"our lyrics and most of all the presence conjured into our album in the process of making it is SATANIC in every way possible\\", and that he considers black metal and death metal to be \\"exactly the same, when it comes to the Cult, as it is the same satanic forces of Chaos we religiously devote ourselves to\\". The band refers especially to the Kabbalah and chaos as the dark counterpart to creation, which is seen as the true evil by Ofermod, but Belfagor also uses terms like evil for his own views, being evil from a cosmic perspective. According to Belfagor, \\"[t]he materialization of existence must and will be inverted, emanation by emanation, for it is a curse life has inflicted upon itself through manifestation\\". Mika Hakola joined \\"Dragon Rouge\\" a Draconian Current organization founded by Thomas Karlsson sometime before the release of Thaumiel and has been actively promoting the organization in various ways, the most recent one being sharing their website and logo in the booklet of Sol Nox, as well as being an avid and frequent practitioner of Draconian Magick and Go√´tia, even offering his services to perform occult rituals outside of his music.

The term was coined by Gunther Eysenbach in 2004 for the first time along with coining, Infodemiology, a new branch of science-based research. The work of Gunther Eysenbach, which utilized the Google Search queries, had led to the birth of Google Flu. Other than Google search engines have also been used. Later other researchers utilized other social media such as Twitter to find the disease outbreak patterns. The infoveillance detects disease outbreaks quicker than traditional public health surveillance systems with the minimal cost involved, revealing the promising results for the future surveillance methodologies. Google Flu Trends Google uses the query information to detect the flu trends and it compares the results to the countries' official surveillance data. The primary research behind the Google Flu Trend can be found in Ginsberg et al.'s work. In light of evidence showing that Google Flu Trends was occasionally over-estimating flu rates, researchers have also proposed a series of more advanced and better-performing approaches to flu modeling from Google search queries. Google Dengue Trends Google uses the query information to detect the dengue trends and it compares the results to the countries' official surveillance data. The primary research behind the Google Dengue Trend is found in Chan et al.'s work . Flu Detector Flu Detector was developed by Vasileios Lampos et al. at the University of Bristol. It is an application of Machine Learning that firstly uses Feature Selection to automatically extract flu-related terms from Twitter content and then uses those terms to compute a flu-score for several UK regions based on geolocated tweets. The primary research behind the Flu Detector is found here; a generalized scheme able to track other events as well is proposed here. A new, totally revamped (in terms of models and online data) version of the Flu Detector has been recently launched.

It has more than 48 million articles ( in English) written collaboratively by volunteers around the world. Almost all of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the site, and it has about 100,000 regularly active contributors.  What type of thing is Wikipedia?  Main page of Wikipedia * Reference work - compendium of information, usually of a specific type, compiled in a book for ease of reference. That is, the information is intended to be quickly found when needed. Reference works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. **Encyclopedia - type of reference work or compendium holding a comprehensive summary of information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge. Glossary of Library Terms. Riverside City College, Digital Library/Learning Resource Center. Retrieved on: November 17.2007. Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries, which are usually accessed alphabetically by article name. Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries. *** Internet encyclopedia project (online encyclopedia) - large database of useful information, accessible via the World Wide Web. *Database - organized collection of data. The data is typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information. For example, modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies. **Online database - database accessible from a network, including from the Internet (such as on a web page). *Website - collection of related web pages containing images, videos or other digital assets. A website is hosted on at least one web server, accessible via a network such as the Internet or a private local area network through an Internet address known as a Uniform Resource Locator. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. **Wiki - website that allows the creation and editing of any number of interlinked web pages via a web browser using a simplified markup language or a WYSIWYG text editor. Wikis are typically powered by wiki software and are often developed and used collaboratively by multiple users. Examples include community websites, corporate intranets, knowledge management systems, and note services. The software can also be used for personal notetaking. *Community - group of interacting people with social cohesion, who may share common values. **Community of action - community in which participants endeavor collaboratively to bring about change. ** Community of interest - community of people who share a common interest or passion. These people exchange ideas and thoughts about the given passion, but may know (or care) little about each other outside of this area. The common interest on Wikipedia is knowledge. ** Community of purpose - community that serves a functional need, smoothing the path of the member for a limited period surrounding a given activity. For example, researching a topic on Wikipedia.org, buying a car on autobytel.com, or antique collectors on icollector.com or individual. ** Virtual community - social network of individuals who interact through specific media, potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. *** Online community - virtual community that exists online and whose members enable its existence through taking part in membership ritual. An online community can take the form of an information system where anyone can post content, such as a Bulletin board system or one where only a restricted number of people can initiate posts, such as Weblogs. **** Wiki community - users, especially the editors, of a particular wiki. * Collective memory - shared pool of information held in the memories of two or more members of a group.  Implementation of Wikipedia  *Structure of Wikipedia **List of Wikipedias - Wikipedia is implemented in many languages. As of April 2018, there were 304 Wikipedias, of which 294 are active. ** Logo of Wikipedia - unfinished globe constructed from jigsaw pieces‚Äîsome pieces are still missing at the top‚Äîinscribed with glyphs from many different writing systems. ** Articles - written works published in a print or electronic medium. Each Wikipedia is divided into many articles, with each article focusing on a particular topic. *** Types of articles on Wikipedia **** Prose articles - **** Lists - ***** Item lists - ***** Article indexes (on the English Wikipedia) - ***** Outlines (on the English Wikipedia) - * Content management on Wikipedia - processes for the collection, managing, and publishing of information on Wikipedia ** Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia - opposing philosophies of editors of Wikipedia concerning the appropriate scope of the encyclopedia, and the appropriate point for a topic to be included as an encyclopedia article or be \\"deleted\\". ** Notability in English Wikipedia - metric used to determine topics meriting a dedicated encyclopedia article. It attempts to assess whether a topic has \\"gained sufficiently significant attention by the world at large and over a period of time\\" as evidenced by significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the topic. ** Reliability of Wikipedia - Wikipedia is open to anonymous and collaborative editing, so assessments of its reliability usually include examinations of how quickly false or misleading information is removed. An early study conducted by IBM researchers in 2003‚Äîtwo years following Wikipedia's establishment‚Äîfound that \\"vandalism is usually repaired extremely quickly‚Äîso quickly that most users will never see its effects\\" and concluded that Wikipedia had \\"surprisingly effective self-healing capabilities\\". ** Vandalism on Wikipedia - the act of editing the project in a malicious manner that is intentionally disruptive. Vandalism includes the addition, removal, or other modification of the text or other material that is either humorous, nonsensical, a hoax, spam or promotion of a subject, or that is of an offensive, humiliating, or otherwise degrading in nature. There are various measures taken by Wikipedia to prevent or reduce the amount of vandalism. ** Wiki magic - described by Jimmy Wales as a phenomenon whereby an author may write the beginnings of an article at the end of the day, only to wake up in the morning and find the stub converted into a much more substantial article. *Computer technology that makes Wikipedia work: Servers installed in Ashburn, Virginia (US) **Hardware *** Computers - general purpose devices that can be programmed to carry out sets of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. A computer that is used to host server software is called a \\"server\\". It takes many servers to make Wikipedia available to the world. These servers are run by the WikiMedia Foundation.https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers **Software - Wikipedia is powered by the following software on WikiMedia Foundation's computers (servers). It takes all of these to make Wikipedia pages available on the World Wide Web: *** Operating systems used on WikiMedia Foundation's servers: **** Ubuntu Server - used on all Wikipedia servers except those used for image file storage **** Solaris - used on Wikipedia's image file storage servers *** MediaWiki - main web application that makes Wikipedia work. It's a free web-based wiki software application developed by the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), written in PHP, that is used to run all of WMF's projects, including Wikipedia. Numerous other wikis around the world also use it. *** Content storage - Wikipedia's content (it's articles and other pages) are stored in MariaDB databases. WikiMedia Foundation's wikis are grouped into clusters, and each cluster is served by several MariaDB servers, in a single-master configuration. *** Distributed object storage - distributed objects are software modules that are designed to work together, but reside either in multiple computers connected via a network. One object sends a message to another object in a remote machine to perform some task. **** Ceph - **** Swift - *** Proxy servers - act as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity. Proxies were invented to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems. Today, most proxies are web proxies, facilitating access to content on the World Wide Web. The proxy servers used for Wikipedia are: **** For serving up HTML pages - Squid and Varnish caching proxy servers in front of Apache HTTP Server. Apache processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. **** For serving up image files - Squid and Varnish caching proxy servers in front of Sun Java System Web Server **** DNS proxies - WikiMedia Foundation's DNS proxy servers run PowerDNS. It's a DNS server program that runs under Unix (including Ubuntu). DNS stands for \\"domain name system\\". **** Load balancing - ***** Linux Virtual Server (LVS) ‚Äì Wikipedia uses LVS on commodity servers to load-balance incoming requests. LVS is also used as an internal load balancer to distribute MediaWiki and Lucene back-end requests. ***** PyBal - Wikimedia Foundation's own system for back- end monitoring and failover. *** Caching **** Memcached - Wikipedia uses Memcached for caching of database query and computation results. *** For full- text search - Wikipedia uses Lucene, with extensive customization contributed by Robert Stojnic. *** Wikimedia configuration fileshttp://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/ **Setting up Wikipedia on a home computer ***Downloading Wikipedia's database (all article text) *** Installing MediaWiki (the software that runs Wikipedia)  Wikipedia community  * Community of Wikipedia - loosely-knit network of volunteers, sometimes known as \\"Wikipedians\\", who make contributions to the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. A hierarchy exists whereby certain editors are elected to be given greater editorial control by other community members. ** Volunteering - altruistic activity, intended to promote good or improve human quality of life, but people also volunteer for their own skill development, to meet others, to make contacts for possible employment, to have fun, and a variety of other reasons that could be considered self-serving.

History of Wikipedia  History of Wikipedia - Wikipedia was formally launched on 15 January 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, using the concept and technology of a wiki pioneered by Ward Cunningham. Initially, Wikipedia was created to complement Nupedia, an online encyclopedia project edited solely by experts, by providing additional draft articles and ideas for it. Wikipedia quickly overtook Nupedia, becoming a global project in multiple languages and inspiring a wide range of additional reference projects. * Nupedia - the predecessor of Wikipedia. Nupedia was an English-language Web-based encyclopedia that lasted from March 2000 until September 2003. Its articles were written by experts and licensed as free content. It was founded by Jimmy Wales and underwritten by Bomis, with Larry Sanger as editor-in-chief. * Wayback Machine - digital time capsule created by the Internet Archive non-profit organization, based in San Francisco, California. The service enables users to see archived versions of web pages (including Wikipedia) across time, which the Archive calls a \\"three dimensional index\\". Internet Archive bought the domain waybackmachine.org for their own site. It is currently in its beta test. ** Wikipedia on the Wayback Machine * Founders of Wikipedia ** Larry Sanger - chief organizer (2001‚Äì2002) of Wikipedia. He moved on and founded Citizendium. ** Jimmy Wales - historically cited as a co-founder of Wikipedia, though he has disputed the \\"co-\\" designation, declaring himself the sole founder. Wales serves on the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit charitable organization he helped establish to operate Wikipedia, holding its board- appointed \\"community founder seat\\". * Academic studies about Wikipedia - In recent years there have been numerous academic studies about Wikipedia in peer-reviewed publications. This research can be grouped into two categories. The first analyzed the production and reliability of the encyclopedia content, while the second investigated social aspects, such as usage and administration. Such studies are greatly facilitated by the fact that Wikipedia's database can be downloaded without needing to ask the assistance of the site owner. * Flagged Revisions - software extension to the MediaWiki wiki software that allows moderation of edits to Wiki pages. It was developed by the Wikimedia Foundation for use on Wikipedia and similar wikis hosted on its servers. On June 14, 2010, English Wikipedia began a 2-month trial of a similar feature known as pending changes. In May 2011, this feature was removed indefinitely from all articles, after a discussion among English Wikipedia editors.  Wikipedia-inspired projects  * Citizendium - is a wiki for providing free knowledge where authors use their real, verified names. * Conservapedia - is an English-language wiki encyclopedia project written from an American conservative point of view. * Infogalactic - is intended to have less alleged politically progressive, left-wing, or \\"politically correct\\" bias than Wikipedia, and to allow articles or statements that would not be allowed on Wikipedia because of problems with Wikipedia's policies on reliable sources, or due to alleged biases held by Wikipedia editors. * Knol - was a Google project that aimed to include user-written articles on a range of topics. * Scholarpedia - is an English-language online wiki-based encyclopedia with features commonly associated with open-access online academic journals, which aims to have quality content. * Uncyclopedia - is a satirical website that parodies Wikipedia. Its logo, a hollow \\"puzzle potato\\", parodies Wikipedia's globe puzzle logo, and it styles itself \\"the content-free encyclopedia\\", which is a parody of Wikipedia's slogan, \\"the free encyclopedia\\". The project spans over 75 languages. The English version has approximately 30,000 pages of content, second only to the Portuguese.

Critics of Wikipedia  * Murat Bardak√ßƒ± - on Turkish television, he declared that Wikipedia should be banned. * Nicholas G. Carr - in his 2005 blog essay titled \\"The Amorality of Web 2.0,\\" he criticized the quality of volunteer Web 2.0 information projects such as Wikipedia and the blogosphere and argued that they may have a net negative effect on society by displacing more expensive professional alternatives. * Jorge Cauz - president of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc.. In July 2006, in an interview in The New Yorker, he stated that Wikipedia would \\"decline into a hulking, mediocre mass of uneven, unreliable, and, many times, unreadable articles\\" and that \\"Wikipedia is to Britannica as American Idol is to the Juilliard School.\\" * Conservapedia English-language wiki project started in 2006 by homeschool teacher and attorney Andy Schlafly, son of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, to counter what he called the liberal bias of Wikipedia. * Gay Nigger Association of America - anti-blogging Internet trolling organization.

It was the mirror image of the equivalent court in England. The Court of Exchequer was one of the four royal courts of justice which gave their name to the building, which is still called the Four Courts, in Dublin. The Four Courts, present day History According to Elrington BallBall, F. Elrington. The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921. London: John Murray, 1926 the Irish Court of Exchequer was established before 1300, and by 1310 it was staffed by the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and at least one associate Baron of the Exchequer. The early Barons were not required to be qualified lawyers, and in 1400 complaints were made about their lack of legal expertise. In 1442 it was suggested that the administration of the Irish Government would be improved if the Chief Baron was a properly trained lawyer. This criticism was principally aimed at Michael Gryffin, the incumbent Chief Baron, who apparently had no legal qualifications. Later in the fourteenth century the Court moved briefly to Carlow, which was then closer to the centre of the Pale (that part of Ireland which was under secure English rule) than was Dublin, but local disturbances in Carlow soon brought it back to Dublin. Although the workload of the Court of Exchequer in the early centuries was less heavy than that of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), it became notorious for slowness and inefficiency; an eighteenth-century Baron, John St Leger, spoke of the Court being in a state of \\"confusion and disorganisation almost past remedy\\". Due to its inefficiency, it lost a good deal of business to the other courts, especially to the Court of Chancery, in the course of the eighteenth century. The death of Thomas Dalton, the Chief Baron, in 1730 was believed by his friends to have been hastened by his heavy workload.Letter from Hugh Boulter, Archbishop of Armagh to Sir Robert Walpole 24 June 1730 The Court of Exchequer's reputation was further damaged by its judgment in Sherlock v. Annesley. In itself a routine property dispute between two cousins, the lawsuit revived the long-standing quarrel between the English House of Lords and the Irish House of Lords as to which House was the final court of appeal from the Irish courts. The decision of the Barons of the Exchequer that they were obliged to implement the decree of the English House infuriated the Irish House, which imprisoned the Barons for contempt. To resolve the matter the British Government passed the Declaratory Act 1719, removing the power of the Irish House of Lords to hear appeals. This Act became notorious in Ireland as the Sixth of George I, and quite unfairly the judges of Court of Exchequer bore the brunt of the blame for it: as one of the Barons, John Pocklington, remarked \\"a flame burst forth, and the country's last resentment was visited upon us.\\" By the mid nineteenth century the Exchequer had overtaken the Court of King's Bench as the busiest common law court, and the death of Chief Baron Woulfe, in 1840, was widely blamed on his crushing workload (indeed Woulfe, who suffered from chronic ill health, had been warned that the job would kill him, and had been most reluctant to accept it). Abolition On the passing of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877, the Court of Exchequer was merged with the other Courts of common law and the Court of Chancery (Ireland), and became a division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland.Delaney, V.T. H Christopher Palles Allen Figgis and Co Dublin 1960 In a further reorganisation of the Court system in 1897 the Exchequer Division was abolished. The last Chief Baron, Christopher Palles, retained his rank until he retired in 1916, by which time his reputation for judicial eminence was so high that, despite his advanced age (he was eighty-four) and increasing physical frailty, the Government only accepted his resignation with great reluctance.Delaney Christopher Palles See also *Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer *Christopher Palles References Sources * Citations Exchequer Category:Courts and tribunals established in the 13th century Category:12th-century establishments in Ireland Category:1877 disestablishments in Ireland Category:Courts and tribunals disestablished in 1877 ","title":"Court of Exchequer (Ireland)"},{"id":"33965918","text":"Blocher's Run is a Pennsylvania stream which flows from Oak Ridge (triple watershed point at ) on the Gettysburg Battlefield eastward to the Rock Creek () through and near areas of the Battle of Gettysburg, First Day.

In the summer of 1969 they released Bob Dylan \\"GWW\\" Great White Wonder with a white fold out cover and white labels. Another 9 titles followed before they in 1970 created the \\"farm pig\\" logo and the TMQ label was a fact and they began fastening round fluorescent stickers on the outside of their rubber stamped jackets which read 'Trade Mark Of Quality,' and bore the profile of a farm pig. The Frank Zappa - 200 Motels release was the first to bear such a sticker. Over time, custom pig labels were added along with xerox insert covers. In late 1971 the two split up the partnership and started a \\"friendly competition\\". In the beginning, Ken's releases were ( nearly ) exact copies of Dub's. They were made with the same stamping plates, similar labels, stickers and inserts. During 1973, Dub went to deluxe covers to differentiate between his and Ken's records. Ken, at the time, had no way to duplicate the deluxe covers. Also during 1973, Ken began using the smoking pig logo on his labels instead of the farm pig. Dub went until 1974 and brielfly returned in 1976 and 1977 with a small series of deluxe covered titles before dropping out entirely. Ken continued with his \\"Smoking pig\\" label until 1976.

History  The IFA-Tulln was founded in 1994 as a joint research institution of three major universities in Vienna, the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna (VetMed), the Vienna University of Technology (TUW) and the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU). The idea has been to enable the collaboration of scientists with complementary background in the interdisciplinary area of agrobiotechnology under one roof. Their expertise covers modern biotechnology in plant and animal production, environmental biotechnology, animal nutrition, food- and feed science and (bio) analytics and biopolymers. Today about 150 BOKU employees, guest scientists and students are working in 6 institutes at the IFA-Tulln which has become a department of the BOKU in 2004.  Organisation  IFA-Tulln, which is a department of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU), was founded in 1994 as a joint research institution of the BOKU, the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and the Vienna University of Technology to enable the collaboration of scientists with complementary background in the interdisciplinary area of agrobiotechnology. The department is organised into 6 institutes: * Institute for Biotechnology in Plant Production * Institute for Natural Materials Technology * Center for Analytical Chemistry * Institute for Environmental Biotechnology * Institute for Biotechnology in Animal Production * Institute of Animal Nutrition, Products and Nutrition Physiology  Location  The first 5 Institutes of the department IFA-Tulln are located in the IFA-Tulln building in Tulln an der Donau on the Campus Tulln Technopol. The sixth Institute (Institute of Animal Nutrition, Products and Nutrition Physiology) is located in Muthgasse, Vienna. The IFA-Tulln building, together with the other working groups of BOKU in the UFT-building (University Research Center Tulln), is forming the ‚ÄúBOKU location Tulln‚Äù. Campus Tulln Technopol is part of Technopol Tulln which was founded in 2006 by Ecoplus. Further partners of Technopol Tulln besides BOKU, are: AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Technopark Tulln GmbH, Technologiezentrum Tulln GmbH, Agrana Research & Innovation Center, University for Applied Sciences Wiener Neustadt Campus Tulln and the city of Tulln.  Institutes at the Department IFA-Tulln   Institute for Biotechnology in Plant Production  In its research, the Institute for Biotechnology in Plant Production focuses on basic and applied research in the areas plant breeding, plant genetics and phytopathology. The logical overlaps between these topics are plant-pathogen interaction, genetics of disease resistance and breeding research for disease resistance. The institute almost exclusively performs its own research work on agricultural crop plants.  Institute for Natural Materials Technology  The research focuses on the utilization of natural resources as well as of idle waste material for reinforcements of polymers or for use as thermoplastic matrices. The main processing technologies used in composites- production are extrusion and injection moulding. To a lesser content the Institute also applies compression moulding.  Center for Analytical Chemistry  The Center for Analytical Chemistry (CAC) is aiming to perform cutting edge scientific research and to develop advanced methods in the field of (bio)analytical chemistry. The CAC with its two Christian Doppler Laboratories is pursuing a highly interdisciplinary approach for the determination of chemical contaminants including mycotoxins and allergenic proteins in food. By employing metabolomics based approaches the CAC studies entire biological systems with a special emphasis on plant-fungi interactions. There are five research groups within the Institute: * Metabolomics and Bioactive Substances * Mycotoxins and Mycotoxin Metabolism * Immunoanalytics and Food Allergens * Water Analysis and Quality Assurance Systems * Molecular Diagnostics  Institute for Environmental Biotechnology  Focus of research activities at the Institute for Environmental Biotechnology is given to the application of microbial metabolism to safeguard the quality of life and preserve natural resources. On the one hand, emphasis is put on degradation or detoxification of pollutants (in soil, water and waste) or the development of monitoring methods to evaluate the success of restoration technologies. On the other hand, the best possible utilization of existing resources by establishment of sustainable material cycles is the central aim of research conducted. Practical application and process development for technical implementation are a primary concern independent from fundamental investigation of the underlying microbiological activities. Examples are the scale up of fermentation processes, the development of technical remediation methods and the testing of innovative combined biological-physical processes (e.g. use of membrane bioprocesses) in environmental technology. There are 6 research groups established at the Institute for Environmental Biotechnology: * Anaerobic digestion (biogas) * Contaminated land management * Feed additives * Fermentation and pilot plant * Microbiology (incl. molecular biology) and * Water and wastewater treatment  Institute for Biotechnology in Animal Production  With respect to methodological and research competence at the department IFA Tulln the institute for Biotechnology in Animal Production concentrates on advanced tissue culture technologies for the in vitro production of embryos. There are three research groups at the Institute for Biotechnology in Animal Production * Proteomics of Gametes Maternal Interaction * Genetics of mtDNA * In vitro Production of Embryos  Institute of Animal Nutrition, Products and Nutrition Physiology  The Institute of Animal Nutrition, Products, and Nutrition Physiology (APN) represents the start of the supply chain of food of animal origin. It focuses on adequate feeding of agricultural livestock and the significant impact of animal nutrition on quality and safety of primary products, such as milk, meat and eggs. Aside from nutrients, special emphasis is paid on secondary effects of feed and feed/food components on digestion, metabolism and health. The Institute has condensed its mission and structure towards three intrinsic topics: * animal nutrition * animal products * nutrition physiology References  Sources *Website of Dept.

Briefwisseling van Hugo Grotius. Deel 8 (ed. B.L. Meulenbroek); note 2 on page. The period of the Synod of Dort In 1615 Niellius defended Simon Goulart the Younger to the Walloon Consistorium of Amsterdam. Goulart was accused of heterodox theological views. The defence was unsuccessful. Niellius was one of the Remonstrants summoned to the 1618 Synod of Dort (Dordrecht), set up to decide on the divisive theological issues in the Dutch Reformed Church. NNBW article. At the Synod, Niellius protested at the end of the 57th session, which expelled the Remonstrants there from further participation.Charles Butler, The Life of Hugo Grotius (2007 reprint), p. 56; Google Books. He is now represented in one of the stained glass windows in the Grote Kerk, in Dordrecht. In exile After he was dismissed in February 1619 by the Utrecht authorities from his post, Niellius was banished on 6 July from Waalwijk. He took part in the expatriate Remonstrant Brotherhood founded by Nicolaas Grevinckhoven, Johannes Wtenbogaert, Johannes Arnoldi Corvinus and others. :de:s:ADB:Episcopius, Simon With Willem Lomannus he looked into the opportunity offered in Holstein for the foundation of a Remonstrant settlement. In prison With Eduardus Poppius he was betrayed and arrested in January 1623 in Haarlem; and he was imprisoned in Loevestein from 1623 to 1631. Biografisch lexicon voor de geschiedenis van het Nederlands protestantisme. Poppius died there. On 19 July 1631 the group of Remonstrant ministers in the castle were in effect released, with an arrangement that they were to be allowed to escape. The reconstruction of a Remonstrant church followed shortly in The Hague.Willem Nijenhuis, Ecclesia reformata: Studies on the Reformation (1994), p. 150; Google Books. The other six released with Niellius were: Theodorus Boomius (Dirk Boom), Simon Lucae Bysterus, Petrus Cupus, Arnoldus Geesteranus, Paulus Lindenius, and Bernardus Vezekius. Correspondence of Hugo Grotius, note 5. In Amsterdam Niellius returned to the service of the Remonstrants, and was employed from 1 March 1632 in Amsterdam. He took on inspection of churches, and the supervision and instruction of Remonstrant students. When Simon Episcopius died, √âtienne de Courcelles eventually succeeded him, in the chair at the Remonstrant seminary; but there was a transitional committee including Niellius who eventually retired, with Albertus Huttenus and Bartholomaeus Praevostius.Toon Houdt, Self-presentation and Social Identification: the rhetoric and pragmatics of letter writing in early modern times (2002), p. 249 note 7; Google Books. Works He translated into French as Balance pour peser en toute √©quit√© the anonymous pamphlet in Dutch Weegh-Schael (1617, by Jacobus Taurinus). It was an attack on Sir Dudley Carleton's intervention in the politics of the Netherlands on the side of the contra-Remonstrants and Maurice of Nassau. Niellius added a satirical introduction and portrait of Carleton.Anthony Milton, The British Delegation and the Synod of Dort (1618-1619) (2005), p. 63; Google Books.

Background Military and political situation The Confederate forces in northern Virginia were organized into two field armies. Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard was appointed commander of the Confederate Army of the Potomac in northeastern Virginia to defend the rail center of Manassas Junction; while General Joseph E. Johnston commanded the Army of the Shenandoah near Harpers Ferry in the Shenandoah Valley. The Manassas Gap Railroad connected the two forces and allowed for the quick transfer of reinforcements between the two armies.Davis, pp. 20, 28‚Äì29, 34. During the months of June and July, Beauregard sent Confederate President Jefferson Davis several proposals for offensive operations into Maryland, involving the various Confederate armies in Virginia, but Davis rejected them for being impractical, saying the Confederates lacked the proper resources to support any of his offensive plans.Detzer, pp. 88‚Äì91. Following the Union occupation of Alexandria, Virginia, the Union forces in Virginia were organized into the Department of Northeastern Virginia, commanded by Brigadier General Irvin McDowell, who was ordered to advance on the Confederate national capital of Richmond, Virginia. Meanwhile, Robert Patterson was assigned to command the Department of Pennsylvania and was ordered to tie down Johnston's forces in the northern Shenandoah Valley, preventing him from reinforcing Beauregard.Davis, pp. 6‚Äì7, 9, 43.Gottfried, p. 4. Patterson advanced into the Valley in early June, forcing the evacuation of Harpers Ferry on June 17. Johnston retreated back to the town of Winchester, where he was reinforced by home guard units and local militia, which caused Patterson to think he was outnumbered. During this time, Patterson was having difficulty receiving supplies from Pennsylvania; also his regiments of three‚Äìmonth volunteers were nearing the end of their enlistments and were refusing to stay any longer. The Union general‚Äìin‚Äìchief, Brevet Lieutenant General Winfield Scott, was pressing him to send his Regular Army units to McDowell's army.Detzer, pp. 60-64, 97‚Äì103. During the months of June and early July, the armies of McDowell and Beauregard engaged in several skirmishes in northeastern Virginia while the Union government and military leadership debated the proper course of action for McDowell to take. Scott favored concentrating a Union army to capture the Mississippi River valley, while McDowell viewed his army as too inexperienced to attack Beauregard yet. Due to Pressure from U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and the Union press, McDowell started his campaign against Manassas Junction on July 17.Gottfried, p. 4.Detzel, pp. 77‚Äì78. Johnston received orders the next day to start transferring his army to Manassas Junction to reinforce Beauregard; using the Manassas Gap Railroad, his army arrived on July 20 and 21.Gottfried, p. 8. Opposing forces Union Confederate Battles Hoke's Run Following the Confederate abandonment of Harpers Ferry on June 15, Johnston sent Colonel Thomas J. Jackson's brigade to establish a camp near the town of Martinsburg, so to both serve as a warning of a Union advance and to delay Patterson's force. On July 2, Patterson crossed the Potomac and advanced on Jackson's position. Outnumbered and outflanked, Jackson fell back slowly, giving time for his supply train to escape before retreating to rejoin Johnston's main army.Gimbel, pp. 10, 49‚Äì50.Davfis, pp. 84‚Äì85. Blackburn's Ford McDowell's army arrived at Centreville during the morning of July 18, led by Brigadier General David Tyler's division. Under orders to reconnoiter the Confederate defenses near Blackburn's Ford but not to bring on an engagement, Tyler launched an attack with Colonel Israel B. Richardson's brigade but was repulsed by the brigades of James Longstreet and Jubal Early.The battle ended with an artillery duel which lasted until dark, at which time Tyler withdrew back to Centreville.Gottfried, pp. 14‚Äì18. First Bull Run (Manassas) Following Tyler's defeat, McDowell decided to attempt an attack on the Confederate left flank. Starting about dawn on the 21, one Union division started a diversionary attack on the Stone Bridge on the Confederate left and two other divisions demonstrated against the Confederate center and right, while two other divisions marched around the Confederate left flank to launch an attack on the Confederate rear. The Union flanking column was spotted and Confederate reinforcements were rushed to Matthew's Hill but were driven back to Henry House Hill. A new Confederate defensive line, using brigades from Johnston's army, was formed along the hill, where they held against repeated Union attacks during the afternoon. A Confederate attack on the Union left flank in the late afternoon forced McDowell to retreat back to the defenses of Washington, D.C.Robertson, pp. 12‚Äì14. Aftermath Davis arrived on the Manassas battlefield soon after the battle ended. Although he attempted to organize a pursuit of the Union army, he was convinced that the Confederate armies were too disorganized to mount an effective pursuit. The dispute between Beauregard and Davis over who was responsible for the failed pursuit resulted in Beauregard's transfer to the Western Theater.Davis, pp. 243‚Äì244.Gottfried, p. 75. In October, Johnston's and Beauregard's commands were merged into the Department of Northern Virginia, with the combined army retaining the name \\"Army of the Potomac\\".Davis, p. 257. Following First Bull Run, McDowell retreated to Centreville and set up a rearguard. At a council of war held after sunset, a majority of officers urged a retreat, which started that night. In August, the Department of Northeastern Virginia was merged with other departments in Maryland to form the Department of the Potomac, commanded by George C. McClellan. McDowell was demoted to commanding a division.Davis, p. 242, 257. Patterson was blamed for allowing Johnston to reinforce Beauregard and was also relieved of command.Gottfried, p 76.

The road was past both the Rock Creek Church and 1761 Samuel Gettys tavern where Gettysburg would be surveyed in 1786. The highway was built over the South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania) via Nichol's Gap () and down the Devils Racecourse into the Cumberland Valley, allowing access to the 1762 Hagerstown, Maryland. Called the \\"Hagerstown Road\\" during the Battle of Gettysburg, parts of the road are now designated (east-to-west): U. S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania Route 116 (Fairfield Road to Fairfield, Pennsylvania), Iron Springs Road, Gum Springs Road, and Old Route 16 (the summit section through Nichol's Gap--\\"Fairfield Gap\\" during the American Civil War‚Äîno longer has a roadway.) History The Nichol's Gap Road was established westward by a Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Act of 1781, crossing an Indian trail on which a road had been established by 1749 southward from Paxton, Pennsylvania, to the area of the Carroll tracts near Maryland. The 1786 Fairfield Inn on the Nichol's Gap Road was established on the east side of the South Mountain (Millerstown was surveyed in 1801), and the 1792 \\"Oxford Town\\" was laid out near the road's east end by Henry Kuhn at the 1763 Kuhn Tavern. The 1805 Harbaugh homestead was built at the base of the road's west slope near the 1760s Mason‚ÄìDixon line. The 1809 Gettysburg and Petersburg Turnpike crossed the Nichol's Gap Road at the Gettysburg borough, and the 1812 Black Horse Tavern (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania) was established on the road at the Marsh Creek (Monocacy River) stone arch bridge. In 1818, the York and Gettysburg Turnpike Company established the turnpike on eastern portions of the Nichol's Gap Road, and the 1820 Waynesboro-Emmitsburg Turnpike crossed the Nichol's Gap Road west of their summits. (a toll gate was at the crossroads). The 1822 Maria Furnace was established along the road at the foot of the east slope, and Herman Haupt located the 1836 Tapeworm Railroad course to cross the Nichol's Gap Road west of Toms Creek (Monocacy River). In addition to excavations for parts of the Tapeworm bed, the Commonwealth built a single- arch stone roadway bridge over Tom's Creek for the Nichol's Gap Road (the 1888-9 Western Extension by the Baltimore and Harrisburg Railway still uses a stone arch bridge over the road at Iron Springs, Pennsylvania.) The 1863 Fight at Monterey was a Gettysburg Campaign engagement at the toll gate near the summit (one Union body was buried at the site and re-interred by 1913 in the Gettysburg National Cemetery.) In 1913, the original Lincoln Highway was designated on the portion of the route between Gettysburg and Cross Keys and in 1920, the Commonwealth offered the toll house west of Fairfield for sale. The modern highway between Fairfield and Gettysburg was constructed in 1927 (\\"Fairfield Road\\"), replacing single-lane stone bridges at Muddy Run and \\"at Plank's\\".

Development of pharmaceutical formulations requires understanding how the ingredients blend with each other and how the blending progresses through different stages. It is also important to establish in a scientific manner when the blending is considered complete, establishing the margins of blending performance, so that in production the blending is complete before the blending process stops. Optimal blending In order to achieve optimal blending, the micromixing process must be studied to determine mixing parameters such as blending time, blending speed, type and size of blender. When blending is performed too long, overblending may occur, with particles re-aggregating, resulting in segregation of the previously ideal blend. Tools Formulation scientists and technologists need tools to select ingredients for new formulations. Tablets contain multiple ingredients beyond the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) such as fillers, tableting agents, disintegrants, and absorption enhancers or agents that slow down and control absorption. Choice of materials is important to assure the flow characteristics, potency, and absorption of specific formulations. In addition, proper particle size grades of the ingredients must be selected to produce an optimum blend for capsule filling. Methods In order to study the rate and uniformity of blending, destructive analytical methods, such as dissolution followed by chromatographic separation and detection are often used. These methods require samples to be pulled from the blend, followed by time-consuming laboratory analysis. In production, such analysis delays may lengthen time required for production formulation development. Hyperspectral imaging Near-infrared hyperspectral imaging can show the distribution of ingredients in pharmaceutical tablets. In addition to laboratory analysis, imaging of near line pull-samples has been used to indicate whether the mixing endpoint has been achieved. However, such measurements were performed once blending was completed, and therefore, did not yield information about the progression of micromixing during the blending process.Micromixing Analysis for Formulation Developers, Gabor J Kemeny, Gina Stuessy, Natalie Crothers; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) Annual Meeting and Exposition, October 2011, Washington, DC (poster ) References Further reading * Marbach, Ralf.

We had to establish credibility with people again.\\" Background Phish, founded in Burlington, VT by Trey Anastasio (guitar), Page McConnell (keyboard), Mike Gordon (bass guitar), and Jon Fishman (percussion), is a jam band known for its extensive jamming and musical fusion of different genres. Previous to the three shows played in Hampton, Phish hadn't performed live together since August 2004 at their concert festival Coventry located in Coventry, VT. Previous to the Coventry Festival, Phish had announced plans to break up. This proved to be temporary once Phish launched its reunion announcements in October 2008. It was said that the band decided to break up because they were \\"exhausted by touring and the strain of Anastasio's substance abuse.\\" However, during the band's break, Trey's consistent problems with drugs and alcohol harmed him worse than he had expected. On December 16, 2006 Trey Anastasio was pulled over at 3:30 AM one night in Whitehall, NY for failing to keep right. He was found in possession of heroin and bottles of prescription painkillers bearing someone else's name and was sentenced to 14 months in the Washington County, New York drug court. After his time spent in drug court, Trey came out clean from drugs and alcohol. Then in 2008, the band decided to start organizing a series of reunion shows in Hampton.

It forms part of a series of moral essays (or \\"Dialogues\\") composed by Seneca. De Beneficiis concerns the award and reception of gifts and favours within society, and examines the complex nature and role of gratitude within the context of Stoic ethics. Meaning of title Although the title is typically translated as On Benefits, the word Beneficiis is derived from the Latin word beneficium, meaning a favor, benefit, service, or kindness.Latin Word Study Tool [Retrieved 2015-03-13] Other translations of the title have included: On gifts and services; On the Award and Reception of Favors;Review by Oleg V. Bychkov, St. Bonaventure University of Seneca, On Benefits, Miriam Griffin and Brad Inwood (trs.) in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews Retrieved 2015-03-12 On Favours; and On kind deeds. The work is dedicated to Aebutius Liberalis who is also the subject of Letter 91. Dating of the writing It is considered that the work was very likely written between the years 56 and 62 AD. Mario Lentano provides a collation of a number of sources who posit different periods of about these years in Brill's Companion to Seneca. Seneca mentions the completed work in his Letters to Lucilius (81. 3) indicating that it was finished by 64.(Translated by J Solodow) Nero was emperor during the time of writing.PG Walsh writing from translation of Cicero - On Obligation (xxxiv) Oxford University Press, 2000 [Retrieved 2015-3-14] Influences The Greek language term for giving and receiving is Œ¥œåœÉŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œª·øÜ(Œº)œàŒπœÇ.

While there are several anecdotes of different cultures practicing placentophagy in varying contexts, maternal placentophagy started in the US in the 1970s, with little to no evidence of its practice in any traditional or historic culture. Midwives and alternative-health advocates in the U.S. are the primary groups encouraging post-partum maternal placentophagy. Maternal placentophagy has a small following in Western cultures, fostered by celebrities like January Jones. Human placentophagy after childbirth is touted by some as a treatment for postpartum depression and fatigue, among other health benefits, given its high protein, rich iron and nutrient content. However, scientific research is inconclusive as to whether consuming the placenta prevents or treats postpartum depression or to any other health benefits. The risks of human placentophagy are also still unclear, but there has been one confirmed case of an infant needing hospitalization due to a group B strep blood infection tied to their mother's consumption of their placenta. Placentophagy can be divided into two categories, maternal placentophagy and non-maternal placentophagy. Maternal placentophagy Maternal placentophagy is defined as \\"a mother‚Äôs ingestion of her own placenta postpartum, in any form, at any time\\". Of the more than 4000 species of placental mammals, most, including herbivores, regularly engage in maternal placentophagy, thought to be an instinct to hide any trace of childbirth from predators in the wild. The exceptions to placentophagy include mainly humans, Pinnipedia, Cetacea, and camels.  Ingestion in time period immediately after birth  Midwifery practices anecdotally document the practice of consumption of a small portion of the raw placenta with honey to resolve postpartum hemorrhage, succeeding in instances where conventional administration of Pitocin did not fully resolve bleeding.  Ingestion in postpartum period  Preparation of the placenta for consumption can include domestic culinary recipes such as for p√¢t√©, or may involve outsourcing to encapsulation specialists for the freezing, cooking, and drying of the placenta, and crushing it into pill form. There is the question of whether the drying process affects the potentially beneficial proteins and hormones; there has even been one specific case in which a newborn developed sepsis after the mother consumed contaminated capsules and the centre for disease control thus issued a warning behind the practice. Mothers planning on keeping their placentas after birthing in hospitals may need to check with hospital policies regarding authorization to do so. Non- maternal placentophagy Non-maternal placentophagy is defined as \\"the ingestion of the placenta by any person other than the mother, at any time\\". Such instances of placentophagy have been attributed to the following: a shift toward carnivorousness at parturition, specific hunger, and general hunger. With most Eutherian mammals, the placenta is consumed postpartum by the mother. Historically, humans more commonly consume the placenta of another woman under special circumstances. Historical occurrences of human placentophagy In a 1979 volume of the Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine, William Ober's article \\"Notes on Placentophagy\\" evaluates the possibility that certain ancient cultures that practiced human sacrifice may also have practiced human placentophagy, including Egyptians, Tasians, Badarians, Amrateans, Gerzeans, Semainians. Placentophagy might have occurred during the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC), due to the excessive famine experienced by the Judeans, according to scholar Jack Miles in his Pulitzer Prize-winning God: A Biography. Miles argues that the curse in , written in the form of prophecy, is far too vivid not to have been seen personally by the author of the verses. In early Brazil, there is extensive reportage of cannibalism among the Tupinamba.* It is recorded about the natives of the captaincy of Sergipe in Brazil: \\"They eat human flesh when they can get it, and if a woman miscarries devour the abortive immediately. If she goes her time out, she herself cuts the navel-string with a shell, which she boils along with the secondine [i.e. placenta], and eats them both.\\"E. Bowen, 1747: 532  Traditional medicine  Human placenta has been used traditionally in Chinese medicine, though the mother is not identified as the recipient of these treatments. A sixteenth-century Chinese medical text, the Compendium of Materia Medica, states in a section on medical uses of the placenta that, \\"when a woman in Liuqiu has a baby, the placenta is eaten\\", and that in Bagui, \\"the placenta of a boy is specially prepared and eaten by the mother‚Äôs family and relatives.\\" Another Chinese medical text, the Great Pharmacopoeia of 1596, recommends placental tissue mixed with human milk to help overcome the effects of Ch'i exhaustion. These include \\"anemia, weakness of the extremities, and coldness of the sexual organs with involuntary ejaculation of semen\\". Dried, powdered placenta would be stirred into three wine-cups of milk to make a Connected Destiny Elixir. The elixir would be warmed in sunlight, then taken as treatment. It is not known exactly how traditional this remedy was, nor exactly how far back it dates. Ober also identified many cultures known to have practiced placentophagy for medicinal purposes, and one for its flavor. The Araucanian Native Americans of Argentina dried and ground a child's umbilical cord, giving the child a little of the powder when it was sick. In Jamaica, bits of placental membranes were put into an infant's tea to prevent convulsions caused by ghosts. The Chaga of Tanganyika place the placenta in a receptacle for two months to dry. Once dry, it is ground into flour from which a porridge is made. The porridge is served to old women of the family as a way of preserving the child's life. In Central India, women of the Kol Tribe eat placenta to aid reproductive function. It is believed that consumption of placenta by a childless woman \\"may dispel the influences that keep her barren\\". The Kurtachi of the Solomon Islands mixed placenta into the mother's supply of powdered lime for chewing with the areca nut.  Cultural and spiritual beliefs  Beliefs behind the practices of consuming the placenta, whether in part or in whole, commonly reflect acknowledgment for the vast work of this organ for the baby in utero, serving as its 'protector' and providing critical vital functions for the baby before birth. The placenta can be seen as the Tree of Life, as a genetic 'twin' to the fetus, an angel, and reasons for ingesting the placenta may reflect spiritual beliefs as much as the pragmatic ones listed above. Traditional practices to revere and honor the placenta that do not include consumption may include placenta burial, such as in Saudi Arabia. Such traditions reflect human birthing practices wherein umbilical cords may not have been severed while the cord is still pulsing, avoiding blood loss and infection, and may include practices that retain the placental connection until after it has been delivered and the baby is already nursing. Modern placentophagy A slice of placenta, being prepared for consumption. Modern practice of placentophagy is rare, as most contemporary human cultures do not promote its consumption. Placentophagy did receive popular culture attention in 2012, however, when American actress January Jones credited eating her placenta as helping her get back to work on the set of Mad Men after just six weeks. Midwife and 2011 CNN Hero of the Year Robin Lim, founder of Yayasan Bumi Sehat birthing center and author, accounts for the medical use of eating a small portion of the placenta accompanied by some honey to successfully control postpartum hemorrhage. There are anecdotal reports of this working after herbal remedies or the typical administration of oxytocin only temporarily stopped bleeding. Dried human placenta as medicine - Ziheche (Á¥´Ê≤≥ËΩ¶) Instances of placentophagy have been recorded among certain modern cultures. In the 1960s \\"male and female Vietnamese nurses and midwives of Chinese and Thai background consum[ed] the placentas of their young, healthy patients\\" for reasons unspecified, as reported by a Czechoslovakian medical officer in at the Hospital of Czechoslovak-Vietnamese Friendship in Haiphong. Placentas were stripped of their membranous parts and fried with onions before being eaten. A more recent cross-cultural ethnographic study by researchers at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas surveyed 179 contemporary human societies, and identified only one culture (Chicano, or Mexican- American) that mentioned the practice of maternal placentophagy. This account, centering on Chicano and Anglo midwifery in San Antonio, Texas, stated, \\"cooking and eating part of the placenta has‚Ä¶been reported by a couple of midwives. One Anglo mother ... was reported to have roasted the placenta.\\" This instance, however, may not be indicative of any larger cultural trends, as no other records of placentophagy were found in the Chicano culture. This same study also recorded three references of non-maternal placentophagy: *Placenta prepared in a stir-fry with broccoliTraditional Gullah medicine dictates that when a baby is born with a caul, with amniotic membranes over the face at birth, the placenta is made into a tea and then consumed by the child to \\"prevent them from seeing spirits that would otherwise haunt [them]\\". *Practice of paternal placentophagy was identified in the Malekula of Melanesia. \\"In Espiritu Santo, the new father [eats] a pudding made from the cooked placenta and blood.\\" *Oral administration of the placenta was reported in Sino-Vietnamese medicine to aid the recovery of those suffering from tuberculosis. In a follow-up study, the UNLV researchers were joined by colleagues at the University of South Florida, and surveyed women who had engaged in maternal placentophagy previously. Of the 189 placentophagic women surveyed, the researchers found that 95 percent of participants had \\"positive\\" or \\"very positive\\" subjective experiences from eating their own placenta, citing beliefs of \\"improved mood\\", \\"increased energy\\", and \\"improved lactation\\". The authors themselves, however, state that \\"exceedingly little research has been conducted to assess these claims and no systematic analysis has been performed to evaluate the experiences of women who engage in this behavior.\\" Recent examples of placentophagy in the popular media include Time Magazine‚Äôs \\"Afterbirth: It‚Äôs What‚Äôs for Dinner\\", and USA Today‚Äôs \\"Ingesting the placenta: Is it healthy for new moms?\\" Current beliefs among placentophagists Nutritional benefits Placentophagy advocates claim that the placenta provides an excellent source of dietary iron, and may therefore improve maternal postpartum iron status. However, a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study conducted by researchers at UNLV found that consuming a commonly recommended daily intake of encapsulated placenta (approximately 3,000 mg per day) only provides about one-quarter of the RDA for iron for lactating women. The study found no differences in maternal iron status over a three-week postpartum period between women consuming 3300 mg/day of cooked, encapsulated placenta, and study participants taking a placebo. The placenta transports nutrients to the fetus during gestation. Proponents of modern placentophagy argue that the placenta retains some of these nutrients after delivery, and that consumption of the placenta by the mother will help her recover more quickly following childbirth by replenishing nutrients and hormones lost during parturition. One birthing website run by two Minnesota doulas lists possible health benefits including replenishing lost nutrients, increasing milk production, curbing postpartum depression and slowing postpartum hemorrhage. However, the placenta evolved to deliver the maximum amount of nutrients to the growing fetus, and is very efficient at not retaining them in order to maximize the baby's nutrition and growth. Placenta contains high levels of CRH (corticotropin- releasing hormone), which releases the stress hormone cortisol from the adrenal glands. Though CRH is normally secreted by the hypothalamus, during pregnancy production of CRH by the placenta dramatically increases levels of CRH in the blood stream, which peak at delivery. Even postpartum, the placenta still contains very high levels of CRH, and some believe that it is beneficial to eat it despite CRH being known to increase the body's stress response. Consumption of the placenta is also believed by the placentophagy community to cause the release of the chemical oxytocin in the brain. Oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions leading to the onset of labor, and after childbirth can also cause the uterus to contract and sooner reach its pre-pregnancy size. Preparation In many areas a placenta encapsulation specialists can be found to professionally prepare the placenta for consumption. Also, many online alternative health sources give instructions for preparing it personally. One common method of preparation is encapsulation. The encapsulation process can be one of two ways: steamed or raw. With the steamed encapsulation process, the placenta is gently steamed with various herbs (ginger, lemon, frankincense, myrrh, etc.), then fully dehydrated, ground into a fine powder, and put into capsules. The raw method does not involve steaming first. The placenta will be fully dehydrated, then ground and put into capsules. Other options for placenta consumption are tinctures and smoothies. There are also meal recipes include lasagna, spaghetti, stew, and pizza. Controversy Many researchers remain skeptical of whether the practice of placentophagy is of value to humans. A 2015 review of the last 64 years of placentophagy research found that while a minority of women in western countries perceive placentophagy as reducing the risk of postpartum depression and enhancing recovery, there is really no evidence that this is the case. The same study also found inconclusive evidence that placentophagy was of any benefit to facilitating uterine contraction, resumption of normal cyclic estrogen cycle, and milk production. As well, the authors stated that the risks of placentophagy also warrant more investigation. A researcher who had previously researched why animals eat their placentas stated in 2007 that \\"people can believe what they want, but there‚Äôs no research to substantiate claims of human benefit. The cooking process will destroy all the protein and hormones. Drying it out or freezing it would destroy other things.\\" Two recent studies by researchers from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, however, appear to be at odds with such claims. UNLV researchers found that some essential nutrients and steroid hormones remained in human placenta that was cooked and processed for encapsulation and consumption. The fee charged by encapsulation specialists for processing human placenta in a woman's home is typically $60 - $90. Although human placentophagy entails the consumption of human tissue by a human or humans, its status as cannibalism is debated.Hall, Harriet.

Researchers assert that the risks of placenta consumption still warrant further investigation.

Biography Little record survives of Avellaneda's early life, although he achieved notoriety in his time as a playwright. In 1660, he is known to have been in Valladolid for the festivities surrounding the transfer of the holy image of Mar√≠a de la Soledad (English: \\"Our Lady of Solitude\\"). In 1664, he published an account of the festival, along with his comedy El divino calabr√©s. El divino calabr√©s was a collaboration with Juan de Matos Fragoso. Avellaneda later became well known as a specialist in collaborative comedies.  Works  Avellaneda became known for writing smaller pieces, such as short farces, dances, loas, entrem√©s, and the farcical puppet shows known as mojigangas. He also wrote several pieces in collaboration with a number of partners. Juan de Matos Fragoso was a frequent collaborator; they worked together on El divino calabr√©s as well as San Francisco de Paula. In 1661, he published Cuantas veo tantas quiero with Sebasti√°n de Villaviciosa. Working with Fragoso and Villaviciosa, he published La Corte en el valle, which was performed for King Philip IV in Valladolid in 1660, and Solo el piadoso es mi hijo, released in Madrid in 1661. Many of his shorter theatrical pieces have been at times incorrectly attributed to other authors. Las casas de placer, for example, is often attributed to Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca, while La boda de Juan Rana has been ascribed to Jer√≥nimo de C√°ncer. Other, better-remembered solo works include Lo que es Madrid, Los gansos, and El ni√±o de la Rollona. El plenipapelier was presented in 1667 at the court of Vienna, accompanied by a Calder√≥n play entitled Amado y aborrecido. El hidalgo de la Membrilla was first presented in 1661, also accompanied by a work of Calder√≥n, El hijo del Sol. He also wrote the loa Loa por papeles para palacio. Dances he is known to have composed include Las casas y El tabaco, the j√°cara La Flores y el Zurdillo and La Rabilla, and the mojiganga El titeretier, for the 1678 festival of Carnival. He also composed El capuchino escoc√©s, Volverse el rayo en laurel, and the mythologically-inspired zarzuela El templo de Palas, with music by Juan Hidalgo de Polanco. El templo de palas was presented on July 26, 1675, at the court of Mariana of Austria. The play deals with a war between the children of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polinices. On the same occasion, he also presented a loa, La flor del sol, an entrem√©s, El triunfo del vellocino, and a mojiganga, El mundi novi. This set was later published in Naples in 1675.

He was also known as John Van Lindley, but as an adult preferred the name J. Van Lindley. He was the second son of Joshua Lindley, one of the earliest pomologists in both Indiana and North Carolina and a prominent Quaker. He was the great-great-grandson of Thomas Lindley, Sr., on whose land the Battle of Lindley's Mill was fought. J. Van Lindley's family moved to North Carolina when he was three years old. J. Van grew up first in Chatham County (now Alamance County) and then Guilford County. In Guilford County he was part of the Quaker New Garden Monthly Meeting. His strong Quaker upbringing led him to take up the Union cause and he served three years during the civil war with the 4th Regiment of the Missouri State Militia (Union) Cavalry. Following the war, he returned to Greensboro, NC where he restarted his father's nursery business, paid off the $5,000 of debt accumulated during the war, and then started Pomona Hills Nursery about 1877. J. Van built his nursery business deliberately until he owned over 900 acres in the town of Pomona, on the west side of Greensboro. Not satisfied with the 22,000 customers he had by the early 1900s when he re- incorporated as J. Van Lindley Nurseries, he also branched out into other businesses. He started Pomona Terra Cotta with Angus Smith in 1886. In 1892 he started the J. Van Lindley Orchard Company, bought 1,000 acres of land west of Southern Pines and planted 60,000 peach trees; starting the large-scale peach industry in Moore County. He donated 60 acres for a recreation complex including a man-made lake, named Lindley Park, in Greensboro, NC in 1902. He started several insurance and banking companies in Guilford County and Forsyth County, including the Security Life and Annuity Company of Greensboro, which merged in 1912 with Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company, later becoming Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Company. He also owned 1,000 acres in Harnett County which were sold in the 1930s to Isabel Rockefeller and are now part of Fort Bragg. He died at his home in Pomona on June 13, 1918.

He held a variety of positions within gerontology and was an contributing author of many articles that examined aging. He has been described as \\"an architect of the field of gerontological education-an academic who spent most of his career in the federal government as an advocate for the development of aging education, training, and research programs in institutions of higher education.\\"  Biography  Tibbitts was born in 1903 and died at the age of 82 in October 1985. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the Lewis Institute in 1924 and did graduate work at University of Chicago. He retired at age 83, after 35 years of government service. He worked as deputy director of the Office of Aging 1960-66, director of training for the Administration of Aging 1966-74, director of the National Clearinghouse on Aging 1974-76, special assistant to the Commissioner on Aging 1976-1982, both that have roots from Tibbitts' original committee on aging.  Career  Tibbitts was director of the institute for Human Adjustment at the University of Michigan for 12 years before moving to Washington D.C. in 1949. He then served as specialist for aging, before any agencies were dedicated to the aging population. He was the author of many articles and texts on gerontology and aging. He was an advocate for government resources for the aging population, at a time when the average life expectancy in the United States was growing rapidly with assistance from advances in medicine and technology. He examined the social and psychological aspects of aging that had not been previously studied or explored because of the low life expectancy up until the mid twentieth century.  Accomplishments  > He played a major role in planning, organizing, and convening many > international conferences on aging from the 1950s through the 1980s. He > authored more than 100 publications; the most notable, undoubtedly, was the > Handbook of Social Gerontology: Societal Aspects of Aging, which for a > decade was the principal textbook on aging.

It is named after a French botanist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars (1758‚Äî1831). Description The stem of this cycad resembles that of a palm, and grows 4‚Äì10 meters tall and up to 45 cm in diameter. The large photosynthetic leaves have spiral arrangement on the stem and are interspersed with many brown, hairy, triangular scale-like leaves. The photosynthetic leaves are pinnate, dark-green, somewhat glossy, and usually 150‚Äî300 centimeters long, with 60-120 leaflets per side. The leaflets are c. 17 cm long, lanceolate, with a slightly bent margin, and a midrib that is more prominent on the paler lower surface. The leaf-stalk is 40‚Äì50 cm long, and has two rows of spines along almost its whole length. The emerging leaves are hairy and show involute vernation; and the young leaves have a distinct bluish tint, which distinguishes it from its relatives C. rumphii and C. circinalis. The pollen cone is spindle-shaped, 30‚Äì60 cm high and 10‚Äì15 cm in diameter, and varies in color from orange to pale brown. The pollen cone scales have a sharp apical spine. The ovulate cones are composed of overlapping, yellow, hairy megasporophylls, each 29‚Äî32 centimeters long, with 5-13 marginal teeth per side, and bearing 4-10 ovules along their edges. The seeds are ovoid, 50‚Äî60 millimeters in size with an red-brown fleshy seed coat, and a spongy endocarp. This spongy endocarp is characteristic of this species, and allows the seeds to float.

It is also found along the coasts of Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania. According to de Laubenfels and Adema, the plant is also found in Sri Lanka, but this may be confusion with the closely related Cycas circinalis. The tree grows 200 meters above sea level, in light forests and their borders, or near coastal sites on sandy soil or coral formations. These areas have annual precipitations varying from 1000 to 3000 millimeters per year. The plant is quite rare both as an individual and in group communities, and populations were impacted by collectors, the growth of the seaside resorts and agriculture development. However, there is no immediate threat to this species, and it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Cultivation As a relatively fast-growing cycad, Cycas thouarsii is occasionally grown in horticulture as a specimen plant. It requires moist but well-drained soil, and will tolerate shade, partial shade, and sun (with sufficient humidity). It is hardy to only a very light frost but can tolerate brief exposure to temperatures down to ‚àí3.9 ¬∞C (25 ¬∞F - UDSA hardiness zone 9b) but this results in leaf scorching.

Disruption of the normal scapulothoracic mechanics causes this problem. The most common cases are found in young, active patients who tend to excessively use the overhead or throwing motion. Cause One source of snapping scapula is when the muscles underneath the scapula (the subscapularis muscle) atrophies. This causes the scapula to become very close to the rib cage, eventually causing rubbing or bumping during arm/shoulder movement. Another cause is bursitis, which is when the tissues between the shoulder blade and thoracic wall inflame. Muscle and bone abnormalities in the shoulder area can also contribute to the pain. Diagnosis Treatment Non-Surgical Doctors often recommend physical therapy in order to strengthen the subscapularis muscle, and prescribe anti-inflammatory medications. For extreme cases, cortisone injections would be utilized. Surgical Surgery is usually only used if the non-surgical treatments have failed. Bone abnormalities may need surgical attention. The most common surgery for snapping scapula requires the surgeon to ‚Äútake out a small piece of the upper corner of the scapula nearest to the spine.‚Äù  References  *\\"A Patient's Guide to Snapping Scapula Syndrome.\\" eOrthopod, n.d.

After receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Miami, he received his Ph.D. in the psychology - zoology program at Duke University. He observed the differences in bird development, by both observing egg hatching and manipulating variables important to bird development, including calls. Gottlieb's major contribution to the field of psychology was his theory of probabilistic epigenesis, which explains that there is no predetermined path to trait development. Gottlieb died 13 July 2006 in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA; outlived by his wife, Nora Lee Willis Gottlieb, his children, Jonathan B.Gottlieb, Aaron L. Gottlieb, and Marc S. Gottlieb, and his grandchildren.  Life and career  Gottlieb was born in Brooklyn, New York on 22 October 1929. He received the Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Child Development Award from the Society of Research in Child Development in 1977. in 1982 he was an Excellence Foundation Professor and Head of the Department of Psychology at the university of North Carolina at Greensboro. After this he received his Ph.D. in Duke's joint psychology-zoology program, allowing him to further his research on birds. In 1856 the Dorthea Dix Hospital opened as the \\"Insane Hospital of North Carolina\\"; Gottlieb was involved in the research section of the hospital. Gilbert Gottlieb died July 13, 2006.  Research  As a graduate student Gottlieb studied behavior imprinting of ducklings. He noticed that duck eggs laid at the same time hatched at different times. He expanded the research by Eckhard Hess by \\"plott[ing] the bird's responsiveness in terms of developmental age - the age from the beginning of embryonic development\\" (p. 446). The problem that Gottlieb found with Hess' research is that he would not replicate what Hess called the \\"critical period\\" for imprinting. The developmental age that Gottlieb measured characterized this \\"critical period\\" with an \\"appropriate\\" independent variable. Gottlieb suggests that imprinting may be the result of a series of complex and subtle feedback processes.Klopfer, P. H. (2001). Parental care and development. In S. Oyama, P. Griffiths & R. Gray (Eds.), Cycles of Contingency: Developmental Systems and Evolution (pp. 167-173). Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. Gottlieb continued his research involving birds by depriving mallard ducks of auditory sensory stimulation experienced in normal development. He then exposed them to both chicken and mallard calls. He found that instincts do not solely depend on experience, but influential social situations. Gottlieb's major contribution to psychology was his theory of probabilistic epigenesis, which states that behavioral development does not have a predetermined course. He described \\"experiential effects as facilitating, inducing, and maintaining development\\" (p. 163).Oyama, S. (2000). The ontogeny of information: Developmental systems and evolution. (2nd ed.).

It is usually held in early March and is partially funded by LIT-Tipperary's Centre for Entertainment & Game Technology Research. Additional supporters include Microsoft, EA, and Demonware. History Games Fleadh was originally a competition called RoboCode Ireland Challenge, which was an artificial intelligence programming language challenge for first year college students. Teams of students designed a robot that would compete against another colleges robot, and with the robot with the best algorithm receiving the Robocode Marshal title. As this competition grew, Games Fleadh was established as an overarching event. Games Fleadh started in 2008, by the festivals driving force Philip Bourke, a lecturer of Games Design and Development at LIT- Tipperary, when he saw no other strong festival for the growing Irish Games design industry. It started off small, with a small number of colleges being invited to participate. RoboCode is now an event inside the convention of Games Fleadh. Since 2014 Dr Liam Noonan a lecturer in the Limerick IT Campus has taken over coordination of this event and with the support of other third level Irish colleges, students every year design and develop games based around a theme.

Site Information  Excavated and surveyed by a team of archaeologists from Commonwealth Associates, Inc. under contract from the Atlanta Interagency Archaeological Services Division of the National Park Service, the Rucker's Bottom site was occupied from the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods through to the Mississippian Period. The original survey took place in 1970 and was followed by three field seasons of excavation from 1980 to 1982. The site was destroyed by the construction of the Russell reservoir. The site spans 60,000m¬≤.  Archaic Occupation  Paleoindian and Early Archaic deposits were examined through the excavation of a 160 square meter block, in 1x1m units. A Clovis point, and Hardaway Dalton, and some 28 side and corner-notched Early Archaic points were found.  Mississippian Occupation  The Mississippian period occupation lasted continuously from 1200 to 1500 CE, although the structure of the village changed substantially over time. The excavation showed a large number of structures as well as a plaza at the center of the town and a stockade surrounding the area. There was one large public house fourteen meters in diameter, the building shows similarities to historical accounts of public buildings that featured fire pits at their center. Excavation showed several rock pits in the plaza that could have been used as trophy pits or as the basis for a game. The stockade encircled the houses as well as the public spaces. On the North end of the site the stockade showed a row of posts 50 to 120 centimeters deep, a ditch was also uncovered around the stockade. Stockades are often used to defend areas from attacks during warfare. The town would have been in a swampy area, possibly ox-bow lake, this would have given the residents access to both swamp and riverine resources. Adding these resources to agriculture would have provided a varied diet. Over the three hundred year occupation the site changed significantly in structure. By the end of the occupation the residences were laid in a rectangular layout around the public square.

Since that time CVGR have conducted many test transmissions. CVGR is an inter-denominational non-profit gospel radio station fully supported and operated by local Christian volunteers.  History  CVGR‚Äôs earliest application was for an ‚ÄòS‚Äô (Special) Class licence. The first transmissions being from the channel 8 TV site on Mt Alexander in Harcourt. Training of presenters was conducted before the test transmissions began on 3 December 1984. Fog, snow and ice were endured during some of these broadcasts. The only equipment CVGR owned was a small mixer which was donated. The transmitter was on loan from Melbourne Christian Radio. All other equipment was borrowed from presenters and supporters. The studio and a 2.5 ton transmitter with a 75 ft tower were transported to the top of Mt Alexander where they were assembled by a team of men, about twenty in number and then disassembled and transported off site when transmissions were complete. Test transmissions lasted a week at a time running 24 hrs with presenters broadcasting on 104.7 FM. By the time the broadcast was completed all expenses were met. The test programmes were short for a start, they were extended over the years to periods of twelve months, most were on a site north of the transmitter hut that we now use today. As time progressed some equipment was donated in memory of a loved one while other items were gradually purchased as support for the station increased. When things looked more promising CVGR purchased a link transmitter which enabled the broadcasts to have the studio down in Harcourt at several locations, which made the job much better and safer. On Wednesday, 20 May 1998 a permanent site for the studio was obtained in the Harcourt valley, just 6 km west as the crow flies from the original broadcasting site in the town of Harcourt. Further advances have been made with the introduction of automated play lists and used when presenters are unavailable.

Early career During his university years Stirano was a rally co-driver and used to contribute to the motor sports pages of the daily newspaper Tuttosport. In January 1976, after graduating in aeronautical engineering in 1975 at the Politecnico di Torino, he was hired by Osella Race Team as Sports Director and then went on to take on the role as Team Manager and Project Manager. At the time Osella raced in Formula 2, a category which they had entered into for the first time during the 1974 season after a period of minor successes in Italian sports car races and hillclimbing. When the young Stirano started working at Osella, he was given the assignment of managing all the projects relating to the sport competitions, including Formula Super Ford, Formula 3, Formula 2 and sport. In the winter of 1978, Stirano designed an evolution of the old Osella FA2 for the 1979 season: this new car allowed Eddie Cheever to win races at Silverstone, the Pau Grand Prix and Zandvoort.

Cheever was announced driver of the Osella FA1 which had its debut at the Argentina GP. The Osella FA1, did not achieve good results, only a 12th place at the San Marino GP and Imola collecting 9 drop outs and 4 failed qualifications. To compensate for the start-up flaws, a second version of the car, the FA1B, was designed and built in collaboration with Giorgio Valentini. Stirano, together with Valentini designed the 1981 car, the FA1C, which was entrusted this time to two private drivers, Beppe Gabbiani and Miguel-Angel Guerra. The inexperience of the two drivers brought about very poor results that season. (Guerra failed to qualify at almost all the races and was involved in a serious accident). Despite the change of designers and the withdrawal of Stirano around the middle of 1981, the team never achieved good results, to the point of disappearing altogether in 1990. Designing Meanwhile, Stirano went on to dedicate his time to activities parallel to the world of motor racing : together with three partners he founded Alba Engineering and started building a car for Formula 3, test driven by Enzo Coloni. In 1982 Alba designed a car to race in the new C Group championship for the Carma of Martino Finotto and Carlo Facetti . The car, which was fitted with a turbo charged four-cylinder engine participated at the FIA World Championship and won the FIA Cup for C Junior cars in 1983 and in 1984. These \\"custom\\" cars were also exported to the United States where they participated at the IMSA Championship with drivers such as Gianpiero Moretti, Jim Trueman and others at the wheel. Engineering Stirano returned to the world of Formula 1 in 1984, as the consultant of Alfa Romeo, and in the years to follow he participated in the design and planning of the one-make training racing car CSAI Alfa Boxer. In 1986 he founded PTI Alba Tech, an engineering company specializing in the planning and building of special competitive cars, and by doing so was able to expand the boundaries of the service provided to the mechanics of chassis and suspension of prototypes. Stirano, along with Giugiaro and his Italdesign, collaborated in the designing of the Machimoto, a concept-car which was presented at the Salone dell'automobile di Torino. He also participated in the designing and planning of Giugiaro‚Äôs Nazca, Blitz (an electric racing car, designed by Bertone and ZER and holder of the speed record for electric cars), and of Pininfarina‚Äôs Ethos (a 1992 prototype for an environmental friendly car). In 1993 he collaborated with Alfa Corse to design the Alfa 155 TS, which took part in the Italian Tourism Championship with the drivers Gabriele Tarquini, Gianni Morbidelli and Tamara Vidali, meanwhile he was also involved with the Alfa Romeo team as Leading Engineer. In 1994 Tarquini won the BTCC with the Alfa 155 TS . The return to Formula 1 After the accident that cost Ayrton Senna his life during a race in 1994, Stirano was appointed by Williams as expert surveyor on the side of the Williams team, which was being accused of causing the accident due to them having created an undersized steering column. The enquiry, which started in 1997, had Stirano, Diego Milen, Roberto Vitali and Giovanni Saccenti (the surveyors team for Williams) up against Tommaso Carletti and Mauro Forghieri. On officially returning to Formula 1 in 1995, Stirano, during his short adventure in this affluent championship, was first appointed as Sports Director and then as Team Manager of Forti Corse : the team lined up drivers such as Pedro Paulo Diniz and Roberto Moreno. It was here that he developed the FG01 vehicle, originally designed by Sergio Rinland, which gained seventh place at the Australian GP driven by Diniz. This was Stirano‚Äôs last race in a Formula 1 pit box. That following winter together with the help of Chris Radage, Stirano designed the Forti FG 03, a much more modern and lighter vehicle. Unfortunately, they never got around to building it due to the economic crisis which led to Forti eventually going bankrupt in 1996. In 1999 he worked together with the members of Euroteam in the STW championship with Stefano Modena‚Äôs Alfa Romeo 156. From 2002 to 2005 Stirano was the consultant of the race team Opel Euroteam (OPC Opel DTM team), managing the races of the Opel Astra of Jeroen Bleekemolen and Laurent Aiello. In the same period he was also providing technical assistance with the creation of Gloria, a company founded by Enrico Glorioso and specializing in the building of racing cars for Junior Championships. In 2006 Stirano founded the company, Albatech Monaco, an atelier of design and engineering providing consultancy in the automotive and nautical fields Stirano was for a long time a member of ACI CSAI, the Italian racing cars Federation, in the Technical Subcommittee and, as Italian Deputy Member, in the FIA Technical Commission, President of the Motorsport Safety Council until 2006, and Advisor SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) for Italy from 1993 to 2000. He is currently involved as commentator and news analyst for television programs regarding the world of racing. Since 2001 he has been co-author for the Formula 1 yearbook published by Vallardi Editore. In 2003, together with Michael Ling, he edited the yearbook Formula 1 Championship 2003 Yearbook: The Complete Record of the Grand Prix Season. In 2006 together with Paolo D'Alessio and Mirco Lazzari, he published Formula 1 - La cronaca e le foto pi√π belle del campionato, editing the technical part of the book. In 2007 Stirano and Paolo D‚ÄôAlessio published the book \\"Red Passion\\" which speaks about the 60-year history of Ferrari races and in 2008 he and Paolo D‚ÄôAlessio published the book ‚ÄúGran Prix‚Äù which is about the ‚Äòmodern‚Äô Formula 1.

These arms were adopted by John Russell c. 1215 at the start of the age of heraldry Sir John Russell (died c. 1224) of Kingston Russell in Dorset, England, was a household knight of King John (1199‚Äì1216), and of the young King Henry III (1216‚Äì1272), to whom he also acted as steward. He served in this capacity as custodian of the royal castles of Corfe (1221 and 1224) and Sherborne (1224) in Dorset and of the castles of Peveril and Bolsover in Derbyshire. He served as Sheriff of Somerset in 1223-1224. He was granted the royal manor of Kingston Russell in Dorset under a feudal land tenure of grand serjeanty. Between 1212 and about 1215 he acquired a moiety of the feudal barony of Newmarch, (shared with John de Bottrel/Bottreaux) the caput of which was at North Cadbury, Somerset, in respect of which he received a summons for the military service of one knight in 1218.Sanders, Feudal Military Service, pp.150-1 Debt to Jews Russell had obtained a loan from Aaron the Jew of Lincoln (died 1186), the greatest of the Jewish financiers licensed to trade in England, and on the seizure of Jewish assets by King Henry II (1154‚Äì1189) in 1186 his debt became due to the crown. It appears the Treasury was content for a while to leave these debts uncollected, but the position changed following King John's peace treaty with King Philip II of France (1180‚Äì1223) signed in May 1200, which required the English king to pay Philip the sum of 20,000 marks. Thereupon John levied a carucage tax on the kingdom and adopted a more active policy towards collection of Aaron's debts, then dealt with on account of their magnitude by a separate specially formed Exchequer of the Jews. In 1200 John Russell rendered his account for his debt to Aaron of ¬£12 14s 8d and paid into the Exchequer on account the sum of 20s (i.e., ¬£1). For the balance he was given respite by royal writ until 1207/8 when he rendered his account for ¬£5 12s 8d and paid 6 marks into the Treasury. He obtained the king's writ for quittance of the remainder.Wiffen, p.103-4 Marriage At some time before 1201 he married Rohesia (or Rose) Bardolf, widow of Henry II de la Pomeroy, feudal baron of Berry Pomeroy in Devon Sanders, 1960, pp.106-107, Berry Pomeroy. Sanders (p.107) gives the date of death of Henry II de Pomeroy as 1207, which clearly conflicts with the fact of John Russell having married his widow in 1200 and sister of Doun Bardolf (1177‚Äì1205), lord of a moiety of the feudal barony of Shelford, Nottinghamshire, inherited from his mother Rose de Hanselin, who had married Thomas Bardolf (died between 1188 and 1194).Sanders, 1960, pp.76-77, Shelford The de la Pomeroy family came from La Pommeraye, Calvados, near Falaise, Normandy.Sanders, 1960, p.106, quoting \\"Anglo-Norman Families\\", p.78 The English barony of Berry Pomeroy was a large one, its 1166 Cartae Baronum return having reported 32 knight's fees.Sanders, 1960, pp.106-7, note 10 As the widow of a tenant-in-chief, Rohesia's marriage became the property of the crown to dispose of, and in 1201/2 John Russell agreed to pay 50 marks to the royal treasury for the hand of his bride. He paid the sum over a period of time, having made a payment on account of 8 ¬Ω marks in 1207/8, which still left a balance of 5 marks due. Rohesia brought to Russell as well as her person a life interest in her dower lands, which would have comprised by custom 1/3rd of the lands of her former husband. The division of the latter's lands gave rise to a dispute with Rohesia's son Henry de la Pomeroy jnr., and the matter came before the royal court in 1200, a year before the formal obtaining of the marriage licence, when Russell and Rohesia, already termed his wife, sued Henry regarding certain lands in Devon and Cornwall.Wiffen, pp.104-108, quoting Plea Rolls of John 2, Michaelmas term The resulting agreement was that Russell and Rose should retain Ayscombe and Stockleigh PomeroyWiffen calls it \\"Stockledge\\" whilst Henry should have UpotteryWiffen: \\"Uppotori\\" There arose later a dispute with the Abbot of St Mary du Val in Bayeux who claimed that the advowson of Stockleigh had been given to his abbey amongst the gifts by charter of Josceline (Goslin) de Pomeroy (died post 1123) and Henry I (died 1165) his son, Constable of NormandySanders, 1960, p.106, date of death of Josceline; Date of death of Henry I derived as 1165, date of payment of feudal relief by Henry II to acquire his inheritance, Sanders, p.106;Constabe of Normandy: English Historical Review, vol 24, p.209 which gifts had been confirmed by a charter of Bartholomew, Bishop of Exeter (1161‚Äì1184) and later by Henry III (died 1222), Rose's son. Russell claimed in their defence that his wife had confirmed her own title to the Advowson because she herself had exercised her right of presenting a new priest, which appointment had been accepted. The outcome of the dispute is not recorded.Wiffen, pp.104-108 The following two charters of the Augustinian Abbey of St Mary du Val, Bayeux, were published in 1899 by J.

It will be remarked that by pure coincidence here is mentioned as one of the witnesses the \\"Hugo de Rosell\\" seized upon by Wiffen as the ancestor of John Russell. It was thus perhaps as a result of his investigations into the background of Russell's wife that Wiffen fortuitously fell upon the name of \\"Rossel\\". The Hugo in question was probably lord of the Normandy manor of Rosel, 35 kilometres north of La Pommeraye, and was thus within the same social and geographic sphere as the de la Pommeraye family. The Russells of Kingston Russell were never referred to in ancient records with a French particulier \\"de\\", which might have connected them with a manor called Rosel etc. somewhere in France, but gained the name more likely from the ruddy (Latin: rossellus) hair or complexion of some distant ancestor. After Russell's death in 1224 his widow Rohesia obtained royal licence of the king, at the suit of Ralph de Blundeville, Earl of Chester and Lincoln (1172‚Äì1232), to marry whomsoever she pleased, so long as he should be a faithful subject of the crown. This was perhaps merely a formality to give her freedom from \\"troublesome solicitations of the king's courtiers\\" and no records survive of any subsequent marriage having occurred.Wiffen, pp.104-108 Awarded Kingston Russell The manor of Kingston in Dorset was held by John Russell in-chief from the king by grand serjeanty, the particular service due to the king was originally to be Marshal of the Buttery (i.e.store of wine barrels), as the entry in the Book of Fees dated 1211 records for the Hundred of \\"Alvredesberge\\" (since dissolved), Dorset:Book of Fees, vol.1, 1920, p.92 :Johannes Russel tenet Kingeston pro dimidia hyda terre de domino rege ex tempore Willelmi Bastard quondam Rege Anglie per serjanciam essendi marescallus buteilerie domini regis ad Natale Domini et ad Pentecosten. (\\"John Russell holds Kingston for half a hide of land from the Lord King from the time of William the Bastard sometime King of England through the serjeanty of being marshall of the king's buttery at Christmas and at Pentecost\\") It is not recorded when the Russells obtained Kingston, yet the lack of any sure record of the family before the time of John Russell suggests he was the first to come to prominence and the first to hold it, probably as a reward from King John. Acquires Little Bedwyn In 1211 Russell acquired the manor of Little Bedwyn, newly subinfeudated from the royal manor of Bedwyn, Wiltshire, which had been held by the crown from the 8th century. Russell held it by the feudal land tenure of grand serjeanty of providing 2 bushels of wine for the king Red Book of the Exchequer, Rolls Series, vol. 2, p. 484, 488 (quoted by Victoria County History of Wilts., vol. 16, Little Bedwyn) Advowson of Puleham Church In 1213 a certain \\"John Russell\\" was awarded by King John what Wiffen termed \\"the advowson\\" of Puleham Church in Dorset.Patent Rolls 14 John (1213), m.2, no. 5 This had belonged to Cirencester Abbey from whom it had lapsed to the crown demesne. J. Horace Round was dubious as to whether this John Russell was the same person as the king's knight, and ascertained that the record in fact quite obviously related to a clerical appointment, not an advowson which it was usual for lay persons to hold. Here was another example, concluded Horace Round, of Wiffen's deliberate fabrication of a long pedigree for the family of Russell. Awarded wardship of co-heiress of Barony of Newmarch  James de Newmarch, feudal baron of North Cadbury died in 1216 leaving 2 daughters as his co-heiresses. The wardship of Isabel the eldest was granted to John Russell by King John. This was a very valuable grant as the barony comprised several manors, amounting to some 17 fees, and it is unclear whether it was a grant by way of royal reward to Russell or whether he purchased it.Rutter, the historian of Gloucestershire, states it to have been a purchase, as quoted by Robinson, W.J. West Country Manors, Dyrham, p.73 The land tax assessment of 1200 shows that he possessed some wealth prior to this grant, yet possibly not of sufficient amount to make the purchase of the wardship of a moiety of a barony comprising several manors. The marriage of the younger daughter Hawise was awarded to John de Boterell, and the two new holders of the barony split it into moieties, dividing the constituent manors between themselves. De Boterell died in 1230 without having produced any issue and was replaced as the husband of Hawise by Nicholas de Moels, whose descendants held his moiety until the 16th century. Russell married off, as was his right, his ward Isabel to his eldest son Ralph Russell (died c. 1250), who thus became a feudal baron. However before Ralph was of sufficient age to appear himself for the military service demanded from the barony, John Russell as his father was summoned in his place. Summoned for military service Due to his holding of a moiety of the barony of Newmarch, Russell became liable to provide one knight to the royal army for a fixed number of days per annum. Even before this grant it appears Russell held other lands by military tenure as in a Chancery document he is recorded as proffering knight service in 1213-14, but the size of his contingent is not legible.Sanders, Feudal Military Service, p. 156, note 19 quoting \\"Chancery Miscellaneous, C.47/5/11\\". Sanders implies that the service was in respect of North Cadbury, yet the date appears too early being before the death of James de Newmarch in 1216 He received such a summons in 1218, as one of seven others in Somerset and Devon, one of 115 England-wide, to attend the royal army at Stamford on St John the Baptist's Day (15 July) in the third week of Henry III (1218). The army was to be used for the siege of Newark Castle, which was held against the king by Robert de Gaugy, a Flemish lieutenant of Philip Marc.Sanders, Feudal Military Service, Appendix II, p.113, A Summons to Service in 1218, Scutage Roll C.72/2, m.22 The scutage roll states: Johannes Russel mittat unum militem pro terra qui fuit Jacobi de Novomercato (John Russell sent one knight in respect of the land which was of James de Newmarch (Latinised to \\"New-Market\\")). Below this entry is the record of a summons to John de Bottrel, who held the other moiety of the barony of North Cadbury: Johannes de Botereauls veniat pro eadem terra (John de Bottrel came in respect of the same land). Appointed steward of Henry III The following royal order to the Sheriff of London is recorded: \\"To give John Russell our steward, for the king's use, 300 lbs of wax, a hanaper of almonds and 2 frails of figs\\"R. Gorges, p.26 Appointed King's Knight of Henry III At Christmas 1217 Henry III gave robes to his military knights, which then numbered just 7, greatly reduced due to his lack of finance from the number in excess of 50 retained by his father King John.Carpenter, Minority of H III, p.52, quoting RLC, 345b The supposition that John Russell was probably one of them is confirmed by the similar order of the next year 1218 by King Henry III to his chamberlain, recorded in the Close Rolls, commands to be given to 5 of the king's knights, including John Russell, \\"5 robes of green or burnet, namely a tunic and mantle with supertunics of fine linen\\" Close Rolls, 2 Henry III, m.14; R. Gorges, p.26; A list of King John's military knights is given in British Library Additional MS 41, folio 479, used as the basis for the work of Stephen Church (Quoted by Carpenter, Minority of H III, p.52, footnote 4) Recovers Princess Joan Hugh X de Lusignan (died 1249), a magnate of Poitou then nominally but tenuously ruled by King John as the inheritance from his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, had been betrothed to John's daughter Princess Joan (1210‚Äì1238), by his second wife Isabella of Angouleme. The reasons for this betrothal were twofold. Firstly, to create a dynastic alliance to persuade Hugh to use his great influence in Poitou to the benefit of the English crown. The other reason is more complex: in 1200 King John had stolen away for his own second wife the great heiress Isabella of Angouleme (1188‚Äì1246), betrothed shortly before in the same year to Hugh's father Hugh IX de Lusignan. Isabelle was one of the greatest beauties of her age, and John appears to have formed a strong attachment to her person, although then aged only 12, as well as to her inheritance. To assuage the anger of Hugh IX it was agreed that his son Hugh X should marry a daughter resulting from the marriage of John and Isabelle. This daughter was Princess Joan, born in 1210, who as an infant was duly betrothed to Hugh X, at least 15 years her senior. The infant Joan was sent to live at the court of Hugh X until she was old enough to enter into matrimony as agreed. Hugh X was also given possession of his betrothed's maritagium (marriage portion) of Saintes, the Saintonge and the Isle of Oleron. However, when she was aged just 6, in 1216, King John her father died, leaving the still young and attractive Isabelle of Angouleme a widow. Hugh X thereupon decided, before 22 May 1216,Carpenter, Minority of Henry III, p.193 to the great surprise of the English royal court and without royal licence, to marry Isabella in place of her daughter Joan, which action would have entitled him to a life interest in her dowry as Queen of England, had he obtained the required royal licence to marry a king's widow. King Henry sent him a formal congratulatory letter dated 22 May 1216, which included the request for his sister Joan to be returned to England. Yet in order to obtain his new wife's dowry, Hugh held the Princess Joan as hostage in Poitou and refused to return her to England. Isabella demanded of the regency council of her young son King Henry III the seizin of her dowry lands of Niort in Poitou, Exeter Castle and Rockingham Castle. The position thus appeared at a stalemate. In 1220 Hugh was invited by the king to come to England to attend the great ceremony of the translation of Thomas Becket due to occur in Canterbury Cathedral on 7 July 1220, and was assured that all outstanding issues would then be resolved. Hugh did not accept the invitation, but rather sent to Canterbury his messengers and started to oppress towns in Poitou, in an attempt to persuade Henry to concede to him both Isabella's dower and Joan's maritagium.Carpenter, Minority of H III, p. 200 A letter from Pope Honorius dated 25 September 1220 threatened Hugh with spiritual penalties if he did not surrender both the princess and her maritagium.Carpenter, Minority of H III, p.217, quoting Patent Rolls, 250; RL, 536-7 Since King John had made himself a vassal of the papacy, which gave it the ultimate ownership of his kingdom, the pope had taken a great interest in the preservation of English royal possessions. In an attempt to break the deadlock, the regency council decided on 5 October 1220 to release Isabelle's English dower to Hugh, which included Berkhampstead Castle and probably also Rockingham Castle Carpenter, Minority of Henry III, p.221 In compensation for her dower lands in Normandy however, she was granted the Stannaries in Devon and the revenue of Aylesbury for a period of 4 years, with ¬£3,000 paid for arrears in her pensionCostain, Thomas B. The Magnificent Century, New York, 1959, pp.38-9 In return for these concessions the following stern royal order dated 6th. October 1220 was issued by Henry to Hugh, nominally his subject as ruler of Poitou, recorded in the Patent Rolls:Calendar of Patent Rolls, IV Henry III, p.255; Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum in Turri Londinensi Asservati, ed. Duffus, Hardy T., Record Commission 1833-4, vol.1, 432b > ‚ÄùMandatum est H. de Lezinan quod veniat ad dominum regem in Angliam et > adducat secum sororem domini regis et si eam secum ducere non poterit tunc > liberet eam in villa Rupelle Johanni Russel, Radulfo Gernun et Godefrido de > Craucumb, vel duobus ex illis, si ipsi tres simulm esse non possunt.

(It is commanded of Hugh de Lusignan that he should come to the > Lord King in England and that he should bring with him the sister of the > Lord King and if he is unable to bring her with him then he should release > her in the town of La Rochelle to John Russell, Ralph Gernun and Godfrey de > Craucumb, or to two of those if the same three are not present at the same > time. Witnessed as above (i.e. in the previous royal order of that day)). These three persons were household knights of Henry III. They were received cordially by Hugh, who delivered Joan into their custody, whilst excusing himself on account of illness from coming in person to England.Carpenter, p.221 The agreement excluded the delivery of Isabella's dower in Niort by Henry and the surrender by Hugh of Joan's maritagium of Oleron, which provided seeds of future conflict.Carpenter, p.221 Commissioner for marriage of King Alexander The main reason why Henry III wished to recover the custody of his sister Joan from Poitou was that he had promised her in marriage to King Alexander II of Scotland. As part of a peace treaty signed by the two kings at York on 15 June 1220, Henry committed himself to give Joan in marriage to Alexander \\"if we are able to recover her\\", and if not he promised Alexander his second sister Isabelle. He promised furthermore to find husbands from the English nobility for Alexander's own sisters Margaret and Isabelle, all matches to be effected within a tightly defined time scale. The agreement was signed by several of King Henry's entourage, including John Russell, who promised that they would ensure the agreement was put into effect. The text is as follows: > De rege Scocie.

Custodian of Corfe and Sherborne Castles In 1224 John Russell was appointed custodian of Corfe Castle and of Sherborne Castle together with the forests and sheriffdom of Somerset and Dorset, in place of Peter de Mauley, who had rebelled against the king's order to surrender them at the king's pleasure. The town of Corsham in Wiltshire and its revenues were granted to him to support him in these duties. He retained these offices until his death later in the same year of 1224. Sources *Wiffen, J.

BBC Choice   Choice of Three (1998‚Äì2000)  BBC Choice launched on 23 September 1998 as a digital channel aimed at the young adult market. Offering a choice of programming from specially commissioned programming to repeats from BBC One and Two. The launch identity was created by Lambie-Nairn and revolved around the idea of three objects, people, or characters with a central theme. Five were made and focused on: * Fan ‚Äì a football fan, a hand fan and an electric fan. * Heart ‚Äì a Heart of stone, represented by a heart carved out of stone, a light heart, represented by a heart shaped electric current, and Heartburn, represented by a burning heart shape. * Mouse ‚Äì a mouse, a computer mouse and a clockwork mouse. * Punch ‚Äì Mr. Punch from Punch and Judy, a punch represented by a boxing glove and Punch the drink. * Trumpet ‚Äì a trumpet, the trumpet of a Daffodil and the call of an elephant, as seen by an elephant's trunk trumpeting. In these idents, all three elements are seen individually close up before been seen together. The subjects are all seen on primary coloured backgrounds and feature a simple, one line logo below consisting of the BBC Logo and the name 'Choice' in upper case after the name in the font Gill Sans. Promotions also followed this form, with the BBC Choice logo at the bottom of the screen throughout the promotion and programme information appearing at the end in the Gill Sans font above the logo. This style is the same as all of the BBC channels at the time. The station also utilised a Digital on-screen graphic (DOG) in the top left-hand corner of the screen, which featured the BBC Choice logo. For the first few years of the station's existence, regional variations for the BBC nations existed, although originally only between the hours of 10pm and midnight. Each region retained the individual idents, with the addition of the region name below the BBC Choice logo. This allowed the nations to add additional programmes without disrupting the main schedules of BBC One and Two significantly. Notably, BBC Choice Northern Ireland utilised in-vision continuity prior to the idents, in which an announcer would appear in person to talk about the upcoming programmes.  Single Heart (2000‚Äì2001)  On 10 July 2000, BBC Choice began to air programmes directly targeting the young adult audience, following an alteration to its remit. As a result, the original idents needed altering to match the new programming on the channel. The new idents built on the previous idea of the heart ident. The ident featured a single heart, usually the stone or fire heart, in the centre of a fluorescent background from which other hearts emanate. These include smaller hearts and an outlined heart 'beamed' out directly to the screen. The BBC Choice logotype was retained following the rebrand, as were promotion styles, the DOG and the national opt-outs for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. However, the concept of a rotating triangular prism featuring the words 'Now on Choice' on each of the sides was used in promotions and to showcase upcoming programmes. The website address was added under the DOG in November 2000.  Three Boxes (2001‚Äì2002)  An example of the Three Boxes On 6 July 2001, BBC Choice rebranded again. This time, the hearts aspect was dropped in favour of three orange boxes set in a blue and green world. The boxes would often interact with each other, roll over and adjust their own shape. The BBC Choice logotype remained at the bottom of the screen throughout the idents and as the DOG, although the DOG was altered to add the BBC Choice URL below the logo. These boxes were used in many aspects throughout the channel, such as Now, Next and Later pointers to upcoming programmes. The promotions also changed; the BBC Choice logo still remained at the bottom of the screen throughout the promotion, however information was now purveyed through the boxes. As each detail, such as the programme title, day and time of broadcast, was announced, a box appeared in top right of the screen with the detail written next to it. All three boxes were shown stacked atop each other in the top right of the screen at the end of the promotion. The channel at this time also started to change its format: a result of the BBC wanting to rebrand and reposition BBC Choice as BBC Three. All regional variations of the channel ceased and the channel was split into two distinctive segments: BBC Choice starting from 7pm and CBBC on Choice from 6am.  Construction (2002‚Äì2003)  Following the approval of BBC Three by the government, the identity began to change to reflect the new channel coming soon. First of all seen were variations of the current idents within which a wrecking ball would hit the screen, causing it to shatter, revealing a building site behind it. In December 2002, the whole ident package changed outright to two builders on the construction site seen previously. Scaffolding and blue sheeting obscure the upper case 'THREE' that would provide the backdrop to the BBC Three launch idents. The builders themselves would often interact with elements of the identity, such as placing their mug of tea on the BBC Choice logo. Over the Christmas period, the channel's first Christmas idents were created featuring a builder taking his hat off to reveal a pair of reindeer antlers against the construction site lit with lights round the scaffolding. On 19 January 2003, a countdown was added to the exterior of the scaffolding, outlining the weeks and days until the relaunch.  BBC Three   Blobs (2003‚Äì2008)  A BBC Three 'blob' ident BBC Three launched on 9 February 2003. The new identity for the channel was devised by Lambie-Nairn and featured 'blobs' set in a blue environment with a towering three-dimensional 'THREE' in the background. Contains videos of BBC Three presentation. The blobs were designed to be characters within the ident and not presenters and never commented on the upcoming programme. Each blob was computer generated, created by Stefan Marjoram at Aardman Animations, and given a voice from the BBC Sound Archive. The brown blobs parallel the CBBC green and CBeebies yellow blobs used at the time and showing a progression through age groups. The channel's logo consisted of a BBC logo above a slanted, upper case, Three set inside a white box. The contents of the box itself, however, were transparent, so that the ident could be seen through the logo. The box structure itself is similar to the other BBC Channels, but the slanted text is different from all of the other channels, who at the time had the channel name in Gill Sans below the BBC logo. In 2005, the box colour was changed from white to blue with white text. The channel's original DOG consisted of the style previously used on the BBC's channels, using the BBC logo follower by an upper case 'THREE' in the font Gill Sans. This lasted until 2005, when it was replaced by a DOG proclaiming the channel as 'Channel of the Year' in upper case and in the same font as the BBC Three logo. The BBC Three logo itself was adopted after this. Contains example of DOG in corner of image The channel used a variety of promotions and stings. Prior to the launch, the channel made use of the song \\"Three Is the Magic Number\\", based (only the lyrics are copied) upon Schoolhouse Rock! played in the background. Other trailer animations showed one blob standing in front of the figure 'THREE' shouting \\"Three!\\", before another 'THREE' rises up from underneath the original, toppling it. Contains example of promo as seen through progressive images. Promotions originally ended with a gradient blue stripe over the programme promotion containing the information and BBC Three white logo; this was however changed with the logo to a three-dimensional blue block seen from a corner with programme information on one side. The channel occasionally used slides for continuity; one used each day at startup featured a still from one of the idents along with the simple message 'BBC Three gets going in a moment', however, some were used to link to upcoming programmes. These slides featured the programme picture in the centre of the screen with the 'THREE' clearly visible behind it in the background with the BBC Three logo and programme information directly below the picture. According to The Guardian, the blobs were eventually replaced because viewers found them \\"cold and shouty\\". Their departure was marked with special idents featuring celebrities such as Matt Lucas voicing the blobs.  Media World (2008‚Äì2013)  One of the channel's new idents In 2008, Danny Cohen, the controller for BBC Three at the time, unveiled a new cross-platform brand for BBC Three. The new logo would feature on the revamped BBC Three website, mobile site and on the channel itself. The links between the three media would only increase with time as emphasis was placed to watch the channel on all three platforms. \\"The thinking behind this rebrand of the channel is that we have, in effect, created a BBC Three world in which our content can move seamlessly between TV, online and mobile\\", he explained. \\"We have a fantastic line-up of programmes and we are going to make them available wherever young people want them.\\" The rebrand cost GBP 380,000, described as \\"relatively little\\" by Cohen. The look was designed by Red Bee Media along with agencies MPG and Agency Republic with music and sound design by creative audio company Koink. The idents themselves featured a new look BBC Three logo; a continuous pipe containing pink liquid spelling out 'three' in lower case below a BBC logo. In the idents, the logo is seen on its own as an object in the 'Three world'. However, the logo is occasionally seen contained within a purple box for cross channel promotional purposes. The idents themselves contain a surreal world where technology is seen in large scale, with plug sockets, phones, televisions along with other objects such as fire extinguishers, sunglasses, high heeled shoes, lipstick all linked together by pipes containing multicoloured liquid. Pools of this liquid is also seen in a number of the idents when pipes breach. The plainly surreal nature of these scenes conveys the nature of the programmes themselves as they take a different view of life. Following the 12 February 2008 relaunch, the channel began to use in-vision continuity, with announcers such as Jose Vanders announcing the upcoming schedule in the early evening. In addition to this, members of the public could record and upload links into programmes shown in the late evening or alongside the announcer in the early evening. This was however suspended in Summer 2008. The channel changed its DOG at the time of the relaunch to a full-colour version of the new logo, a controversial decision at the time. The DOG was originally placed to the centre left of the screen so that viewers without a widescreen television would still be able to see the logo. However, in 2011, the DOG's of all BBC channels was moved to the far left corner of the screen. BBC Three's promotional style initially featured a scene of the 'Three world' at the conclusion of the promotion, containing the BBC Three logo, promotion information and a clip from the programme seen from a suspended television. The end clip was dropped after a while however, with a plainer look utilised instead. Programme slides are still utilised by the channel, however it is primarily used on other channels. The slide design features a picture from the programme above the BBC Three logo and programme information contained within a purple box all inside a billboard design. Discovery (2013‚Äì2016) The latest idents were introduced in October 2013 The latest idents and presentation style was introduced on 1 October 2013, retaining the logo from 2008. The idents follow the theme of \\"discovery\\", and were designed by Claire Powell at Red Bee Media. The soundtrack for the idents was composed by Chris Branch and Tom Haines at Brains & Hunch. Remix of BBC Three (2016) The latest idents were introduced in January 2016 before moving to online-only on 16 February 2016 On 4 January 2016, BBC Three got a new look, before the television channel moved to online only on 16 February.

Despite being called a 'battle' by some, the raid was essentially a massacre of Indians by colonial British troops. Captains Johnson Harmon, Jeremiah Moulton, and Richard Bourne (Brown) led a force of two hundred colonial New Englanders, which attacked the Abenaki village of Narantsouak, or Norridgewock, on the Kennebec River; the current town of Norridgewock, Maine developed near there. The village was led by, among others, the sachems Bomazeen and Wel√°kwansit, known to the English as Mog. The village's Catholic mission was run by a French Jesuit priest, Father S√©bastien R√¢le. The raid was undertaken to check Abenaki power in the region, limit Catholic proselytizing among the Abenaki (and thereby perceived French influence), and to allow the expansion of New England settlements into Abenaki territory and Acadia. New France defined this area as starting at the Kennebec River in southern Maine. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Other motivations for the raid included the special ¬£100 scalp bounty placed on R√¢le's head by the Massachusetts provincial assembly and the bounty on Abenaki scalps offered by the colony during the conflict. Casualties, depending on the sources consulted, vary, but most accounts record about eighty Abenaki being killed. But both English and French accounts agree that the raid was a surprise nighttime attack on a civilian target, and they both also report that many of the dead were unarmed when they were killed, and those massacred included many women and children. As a result of the raid, New Englanders flooded into the lower Kennebec region, establishing settlements there in the wake of the war.  Historical context  The memorial monument for Father S√©bastien R√¢le at the Norridgewock battle site in Madison, Maine. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which ended Queen Anne's War, had facilitated the expansion of New England settlement. The treaty, however, had been signed in Europe and had not involved any member of the Wabanaki natives. Since they had not been consulted, they protested this incursion into their lands by conducting raids on British fishermen and settlements. For the first and only time, Wabanaki fought New Englanders and the British on their own terms and for their own reasons and not principally to defend French imperial interests. In response to Wabanaki hostilities toward the expansion, the Governor of Nova Scotia Richard Phillips built a fort in traditional Mi'kmaq territory at Canso, Nova Scotia in 1720, and Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute built forts on traditional Abenaki territory at the mouth of the Kennebec River. The French claimed the same territory on the Kennebec River by building a church in the Abenaki villages of Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and a church in the Maliseet village of Medoctec on the Saint John River. These fortifications and missions escalated the conflict. By 1720, Massachusetts had placed a bounty on R√¢le. In the winter of 1722, New England rangers raided Norridgewock, trying to capture R√¢le. While he escaped, the rangers destroyed the church and mission house. As revenge for the first raid on Norridgewock, the Mi'kmaq laid siege to the Lt. Governor of Nova Scotia John Doucett in May 1722 at Annapolis Royal. On June 13, 1722, in present-day Maine, the tribe and allied groups burned Brunswick at the mouth of the Kennebec, taking hostages to exchange for those of their people held in Boston. Consequently, on July 25 Shute declared war on the eastern Indians. But on January 1, 1723, Shute abruptly departed for London. He had grown disgusted with the intransigent Assembly (which controlled funding) as it squabbled with the Governor's Council over which body should conduct the war. Lieutenant-governor William Dummer assumed management of the government. Further Abenaki incursions persuaded the Assembly to act in what would be called Father Rale's War.  The Raid  In August 1724, a force of 208 soldiers (which split into 2 units under the commands of captains Johnson Harmon and Jeremiah Moulton) left Fort Richmond (now Richmond, Maine) in 17 whaleboats to go up the Kennebec. At Taconic Falls (now Winslow, Maine), 40 men were left to guard the boats as the troops continued on foot. On August 21, the Rangers killed Chief Bomoseen, fatally wounded his daughter, and took his wife captive. On August 22, 1724, Captains Jeremiah Moulton and Johnson Harmon led 200 rangers to the main Abenaki village on the Kennebec River, Norridgewock, Maine, to kill Father S√©bastien R√¢le and destroy the settlement. On the 23rd, there were 160 Abenaki, many of whom were killed as they tried to escape. The Rangers fired on the canoes filled with families. Harmon noted that at least 50 bodies went downstream before the rangers could retrieve them for their scalps. At least 31 Abenaki chose to fight, which allowed the others to escape. Most of the defenders were killed. Lieut. Richard Jacques killed R√¢le in the opening moments of the battle; Chief Mog was killed, and the rangers massacred nearly two dozen women and children. The English had casualties of two militiamen and one Nauset. Harmon destroyed the Abenaki farms, and those who had escaped were forced to abandon their village and moved northward to the Abenaki village of St Francois (Odanak, Quebec). Many of the Indians were routed, leaving 26 warriors dead and 14 wounded. Harmon's son-in-law Lieutenant Richard Jacques scalped Fr. R√¢le. Chief Wissememet was also killed.Williams. The soldiers mutilated R√¢le's body; his scalp was later redeemed in Boston with those of the other dead. The Boston authorities gave a reward for the scalps, and Harmon was promoted. Thereafter, the French and Indians claimed that the missionary died \\"a martyr\\" at the foot of a large cross set in the central square, drawing the soldiers' attention to himself to save his parishioners. The English militia claimed that he was \\"a bloody incendiary\\" shot in a cabin while reloading his flintlock. A Mohawk named Christian, who accompanied the troops, slipped back after they had departed and set the village and church ablaze.  Aftermath  The 150 Abenaki survivors returned to bury the fallen before abandoning Norridgewock for St. Francis and Becancour, Quebec. Some later returned to the area. R√¢le was interred beneath the altar at which he had ministered to his converts. In 1833, Bishop Benedict Joseph Fenwick dedicated an 11-foot tall obelisk monument, erected by subscription, over his grave at what is today St. Sebastian's Cemetery at Old Point in Madison, Maine.

He played college football for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and earned consensus All- American honors. He was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft and has also played for the Cleveland Browns. Early years Zeitler was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He attended Wisconsin Lutheran High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and played for Wisconsin Lutheran Vikings high school football team. A three-year letterwinner in football, Zeitler was honored first-team all-conference, first-team all region and second-team all-area as a junior. In his senior year, he gathered first- team all-conference, conference lineman of the year, first-team all region, and first-team all-area honors. Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Zeitler was ranked the No. 39 offensive guard prospect in his class. Coincidentally, the No. 1 offensive guard in this class was Trevor Robinson, who would later play alongside Zeitler for the Cincinnati Bengals. Having numerous offers, Zeitler narrowed his decision down to Wisconsin and Michigan, before eventually picking the Badgers. College career Zeitler attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and played for the Wisconsin Badgers football team from 2008 to 2011. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, having been named to the first teams of the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), the Associated Press and Pro Football Weekly as a senior in 2011. Zeitler joined teammates Montee Ball and Peter Konz as AFCA All-Americans. Professional career Even though \\"not a nifty or nimble lineman\\", Zeitler was described as \\"a solid prospect with the ability to be used in a power running offense.\\" Projected to be a second round selection, Zeitler was ranked No. 4 among guards available in the 2012 NFL Draft by Sports Illustrated. Zeitler himself expected to be a second-rounder, having scheduled a draft-party for Day 2 of the Draft, before being surprised by the Bengals' late first-round selection. Zeitler was the eighth UW offensive lineman taken in the first round of an NFL draft since 1976, after Dennis Lick, Ray Snell, Paul Gruber, Aaron Gibson, Chris McIntosh, Joe Thomas, and Gabe Carimi. Cincinnati Bengals In his rookie season, Zeitler started all 16 games at right guard for the Bengals. He gave up only four sacks all season, and graded highest among Bengals linemen. In his five seasons with the Bengals, Zeitler started 71 of 72 games played at right guard. Cleveland Browns On March 9, 2017, Zeitler signed a five-year, $60 million contract with the Cleveland Browns, making him the highest paid guard in the NFL. New York Giants On March 13, 2019, the Browns traded Zeitler and Jabrill Peppers to the New York Giants, along with their first and third-round (originally acquired from the New England Patriots) picks in the 2019 NFL Draft, in exchange for Odell Beckham Jr. and Olivier Vernon.

Kroh History  History of Kroh began as the administrative center of Kingdom of Reman (part of the State of Patani), which is located at the eastern boundary of Kedah. However, King of Reman invaded Klian Intan and undertook mining in the area, until the onset of a series of disputes with the Perak Government which initiated a number of agreements between the British, Siamese and Perak. In 1902, Siamese government moved in to abolish the monarchy of the State of Reman. After the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, the Siamese transferred the northern part of Hulu Perak district to the Federated Malay States, of which Perak is part of. Hulu Perak district delivery ceremony was held at Kroh on 16 July 1909. Kroh now known as Pengkalan Hulu. History of Kroh's name starts with a small river that flows through this area. This river comes from a village called Selarong. Selarong means 'elephant trail' in Arabic. The river and covered with mud baths, the elephant belonging to King Reman, the number reach hundreds. To facilitate the elephant bath, King Reman was ordered that dams built to contain water. The river flows became a small lake with the water that is murky. Due to this city that was named Kroh in the past. On 4 January 1984, during the reign of the Sultan of Perak 33 of the late Sultan Idris Al-Mutawakkil Alallahi Shah (Sultan Idris Shah II), he has consented to amend the name of the Kroh to Pengkalan Hulu, because this place is a transit point when he went to Hulu Perak district . Today, the remains of a small lake has been developed by the district administration as a recreational park named Taman Tasek Takong. The relationship between elephant with Kroh's name has also been immortalised by the District Council logo Pengkalan Hulu, Perak Darul Ridzuan.

An estimated 50 people were killed in the stampede that left another 74 injured.B.K. 2005, p. 190 The festival was attended by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalitha, who had a holy dip in the tank. The Tank and the Mahamaham festival The Tank is located in the heart of Kumbakonam town. It covers an area of 6.2 acres and is trapezoidal in shape. The tank is surrounded by 16 small Mandapams (shrines)Bansal 2008, p. 126 and has 21 wells inside the tank. The names of the wells carry the name of Hindu god Shiva or that of Rivers of India. Govinda Dikshitar, the chieftain of Ragunatha Nayak of Thanjavur, constructed the sixteen Mandapams and stone steps around this tank.V. 1995, p.120 Masimaham is an annual event that occurs in the Tamil month of Masi (February‚ÄìMarch) in the star of Magam. Once in twelve years, when the planet Guru (Jupiter) enters the sign Si·πÉha (Leo), the Kumbh mela festival of South India is celebrated at Mahamaham tank.S. 2004, p. 240 Vast crowds gather at Kumbakonam to have a dip in the tank, along with saints and philosophers. All the rivers of India are believed to meet at the tank on this day and a purificatory bath at this tank on this day is considered equal to the combined dips in all the holy rivers of India Festival deities from all the temples in Kumbakonam arrive at the tank and at noon, all the deities bathe along with the devotees - it is called \\"Theerthavari\\".International Dictionary of Historical Places 1996, p. 503 The purificatory bath is believed to remove sins and after the dip, pilgrims offer charitable gifts in the hope of being rewarded in the current life and subsequent lives. The temple cars of major temples in Kumbakonam come around the city on the festival night. During the Mahamaham of 1992, the number of devotees reached 1 million. Night view of the Mahamaham tank Stampede On 18 February 1992, the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalitha and her friend Sasikala had a holy dip in the tank at around 12:15 p.m. The proceeds were initiated by the Shankaracharya of Kanchi Mutt, Jayendra Saraswati. Tens of thousands of pilgrims thronged the event and in the heat of the situation, 47 people were crushed to death when a building collapsed. This resulted in a stampede that resulted in another 50 getting injured. At least 15 people were reported killed in the rubble, and others were apparently crushed in fleeing crowd as reported by the Press Trust of India. Of the killed, 30 were reported to be women, three were children and the rest were men. Some of the newspapers reported the stampede took place soon after the chief minister reached the tank. This is attributed by the fact that the stampede occurred 200 metres away from the special bathing ghat arranged for the chief minister. The whole accident occurred within a span of 5 minutes with pilgrims rushing up for a holy dip in auspicious time, and also for viewing the chief minister as reported by The Hindu on 19 February. Most newspapers also reported that the western and southern sides were cordoned off for security purposes and people could enter and exit only through the northern and eastern sides. Walter Devaram, the inspector-general of police is quoted as saying \\"a concrete superstructure of a building on the northern bank of the bank collapsed under the weight of those standing on it to watch the festival\\". The final official number of victims stood at 50Vanita 2005, p.258 with another 74 getting injured. Aftermath File picture of yearly Masimaham festival The Government of Tamil Nadu announced a compensation of one lakh (100,000) rupeesThol 2004, p. 14 for the deceased, which included a sum of 30,000 rupees given by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party that ruled the state that time. It was widely criticised by the media that a government announcement was made together with a party announcement. On 18 February, after much demands for a judicial enquiry, the Government of Tamil Nadu announced a magisterial enquiry with the additional collector heading it. On 20 February, the government issued a detailed press note indicating * the arrangements for the 1992 festival were the same as that of 1968 and 1980. The entry of pilgrims were allowed from the northern and southern sides and exits from the eastern and western sides. * that \\"the unfortunate situation developed when a grill over the compound wall abutting the Bangur Dharmashala and the pillars collapsed on the northern tank owing to the enormous pressure of people who had assembled on both sides of the compound wall\\". * that the Bangur Dharmashala was used by Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a Hindu party, as a clinic and for distributing food packets. * that the food packets were thrown out to the pilgrims, resulting in the initiation of the crowd causing the grill and concrete to break, resulting in the stampede. * that there was not a single death due to drowning in the tank * that the allegation that the stampede occurred on account of lathicharge was totally baseless as no lathi charge was made throughout the festival. * that the incident took place at 1:00 p.m. long after the chief minister left the place at around 12:15 p.m. * that the chief minister's enclosure was very small one being 20' X 12' and the newspaper reports of lathicharge on people eagerly viewing the chief minister leading to stampede is malicious. * finally the Vishwa Hindu Parishad was making unfounded allegations as it wanted to take credit of the smooth conduct of the festival. 2004 event A section of tank during Masimagam festival The Mahamaham event of 2004 passed off without any mishaps. The state government spent nearly 50 crores (Rs500 million) for developing the local infrastructure of Kumbakonam. It included 88 lakhs (Rs8.8 million) sanctioned for carrying out public health measures and sanitary arrangementsGovernment of Tamil Nadu G.O. (4D) No.8, 15 Oct 2003 21 shutter gates were set up at the approaches to the tank and the exits were clearly identified.The Telegraph, 2004 Closed circuit surveillance television was employed for video surveillance and crowd control. Tamil Nadu Police employed closed to 20,000 security personnel for the estimated 20 lakh visitors. The festivities were spaced out to 10 days to allow pilgrims to take sacred bath from day one. Around 3000 railway police personnel were employed for the 17 Feb function. Southern railways operated additional trains via Kumbakonam in the new broad gauge converted railway lines from Villupuram to Kumbakonam. Around 5-6 lakh railway travel tickets were sold for the event compared to the 1.5 lakh for the 1992 event. In the aftermath felicitation event held on 30 March in Trichy, the retired Deputy General of Police, Walter Davaram was quoted as saying \\"I take moral responsibility for the fiasco during the mahamaham held in 1992. But I must say that these police officials have done a much better job than that during my time,\\". He also insisted on documenting the event proceedings that involved meticulous planning and execution of security arrangements. Doordarshan, the national television channel, telecast the event live for the first time. Keeping the eventualities in mind, Jayalalitha, the chief minister during the 2004 festival also, stayed away from the function.The Indian Express, 8 March 2004 See also * 2004 Kumbakonam School Fire Notes References   Category:Kumbakonam Category:1990s in Tamil Nadu Category:Disasters in Tamil Nadu Category:Human stampedes in India Category:1992 disasters in India Category:Human stampedes in 1992 ","title":"Mahamaham stampede"},{"id":"33967944","text":"The 18th Cruiser Division may refer to: *18th Cruiser Division/Cruiser Division 18 of the Imperial Japanese Navy *Cruiser Division 18 of the United States Navy ","title":"18th Cruiser Division"},{"id":"33967954","text":"Prune Nourry is a French multidisciplinary artist currently working at the Invisible Dog Art Center in Brooklyn, NY.

It was pioneered by E. J. Corey and D. Enders in 1976, and was further developed by D. Enders and his group. This method is usually a three-step sequence. The first step is to form the hydrazone between (S)-1-amino-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine (SAMP) or (R)-1-amino-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine (RAMP) and a ketone or aldehyde. Afterwards, the hydrazone is deprotonated by lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) to form an azaenolate, which reacts with alkyl halides or other suitable electrophiles to give alkylated hydrazone species with the simultaneous generation of a new chiral center. Finally, the alkylated ketone or aldehyde can be regenerated by ozonolysis or hydrolysis. Enders' SAMP/RAMP Hydrazone Alkylation Reaction This reaction is a useful technique for asymmetric Œ±-alkylation of ketones and aldehydes, which are common synthetic intermediates for medicinally interesting natural products and other related organic compounds. These natural products include (-)-C10-demethyl arteannuin B, the structural analog of antimalarial artemisinin, the polypropionate metabolite (-)-denticulatin A and B isolated from Siphonaria denticulata, zaragozic acid A, a potent inhibitor of sterol synthesis, and epothilone A and B, which have been proven to be very effective anticancer drugs.  History  Regioselective and stereoselective formation of carbon-carbon bonds adjacent to carbonyl group is an important procedure in organic chemistry. Alkylation reaction of enolates has been the main focus of the field. Both A. G. Myers and D. A. Evans developed asymmetric alkylation reactions for enolates. Myer's and Evans' Asymmetric Alkylation The apparent shortcoming for enolate alkylation reactions is over-alkylation, even if the amount of base added for enolization as well as the reaction temperature are carefully controlled. The ketene formation during the deprotonation process for substrates possessing Evans' oxazolidinone is also a main side reaction for the related alkylation reactions. Development in the field of enamine chemistry and the utilization of imine derivatives of enolates managed to provide an alternative for enolate alkylation reactions. In 1963, G. Stork reported the first enamine alkylation reaction for ketones - Stork enamine alkylation reaction. A specific Stork enamine alkylation reaction between cyclohexanone and an electrophile. In 1976, Meyers reported the first alkylation reaction of metallated azaenolates of hydrazones with an acyclic amino acid-based auxiliary. Compared with the free carbonyl compounds and the chiral enamine species reported previously, the hydrazones exhibit higher reactivity, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Hydrazone alkylation developed by Meyer. The combination of cyclic amino acid derivatives (SAMP and RAMP) and the powerful hydrazone techniques were pioneered by E. J. Corey and D. Enders in 1976, and were independently developed by D. Enders later. Both SAMP and RAMP are synthesized from amino acids. The detailed synthesis of these two auxiliaries are shown below. EndersSAMP 2  Mechanism  The Enders SAMP/RAMP hydrazone alkylation begins with the synthesis of the hydrazone from a N,N-dialkylhydrazine and a ketone or aldehyde The hydrazone is then deprotonated on the Œ±-carbon position by a strong base, such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), leading to the formation of a resonance stabilized anion - an azaenolate. This anion is a very good nucleophile and readily attacks electrophiles, such as alkyl halides, to generate alkylated hydrazones with simultaneous creation of a new chiral center at the Œ±-carbon. Mechanism of hydrazone alkylation The stereochemistry of this reaction is discussed in detail in next section.  Stereochemistry   Stereochemistry of the azaenolate  After the deprotonation, the imine turns into an azaenolate with lithium cation chelating both the nitrogen and oxygen. There are two possible options for lithium chelation. One is that lithium is antiperiplanar to the C=C bond (blue colored), leading to the conformation of ZC-N; the other one is that lithium and the C=C bond are at the same side of the C-N bond (red colored), leading to the EC-N conformer. There are also two available orientations for the chelating nitrogen and R2 group, being either EC=C or ZC=C. This leads to four possible azaenolate intermediates (A, B, C and D) for the Enders' SAMP/RAMP hydrazone alkylation reaction. Stereoselectivity of the generation of the azaenolates Experiments and calculations show that one specific stereoisomer of the azaenolate is favored over the other three possible candidates. Therefore, although four isomers are possible for the azaenolate, only the one (azaenolate A) with the stereochemistry of its C=C double bonds being E and that of its C-N bond being Z stereochemistry is dominant (EC=CZC-N) for both cyclic and acyclic ketones.  Stereochemistry of alkylation  The favored azaenolate is the dominant starting molecule for the subsequent alkylation reaction. There are two possible faces of accessing for any electrophile to react with. The steric interaction between the pyrrolidine ring and the electrophilic reagent hinders the attack of the electrophile from the top face. On the contrary, when the electrophile attacks from the bottom face, such unfavorable interaction does not exist. Therefore, the electrophilic attack proceeds from the sterically more accessible face. Stereoselectivity for the alkylation step of the Enders' reaction  Variants  The chelation of lithium cation with the methoxy group is one of the most important features of the transition state for Enders' hydrazone alkylation reaction. It is necessary to have this chelation effect to achieve high stereoselectivity. The development and modification of Enders' hydrazone alkylation reaction mainly focus on the addition of more steric hindrance on the pyrrolidine rings of both SAMP and RAMP, while preserving the methoxy group for lithium chelation. The most famous four variants of SAMP and RAMP are SADP, SAEP, SAPP and RAMBO, whose structures are shown below. Variants of SAMP/RAMP with bulkier groups attached In 2011, several N-amino cyclic carbamates were synthesized and studied for asymmetric hydrazone alkylation reactions. Both the stereochemistry and regioselectivity of the reactions turned out to be very promising. These new compounds consist of a new class of chiral auxiliary based on the carbamate structure and, therefore, no longer belong to the family of SAMP and RAMP. But they do provide very powerful alternatives to the traditional pyrrolidine systems. N-Amino cyclic carbamates  Scope  Hydrazones are usually very stable toward hydrolysis or other solvolysis conditions, suggesting that they require rather vigorous reaction conditions to be ripped off from the products. So far, three kinds of methods for cleaving the hydrazones have been reported. Oxidative cleavage is the most frequently used method due to its high yields, but most oxidants incorporated would also react with the olefinic moieties and other oxidizable functional groups. The oxidants most used are ozone, sodium periodate, mCPBA, and peracetic acid. Many of them are capable of cleavaging electron-rich olefins and inducing Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Although hydrolytic cleavage is the mildest method, usually the low yields for relatively complicated substrates is a big problem. The reagents that are frequently used are methyl iodide with aqueous hydrogen chloride, cupric salts, and other Lewis acids. Reductive cleavage is only restricted to a handful of special substrates, such as ferrocene based hydrazones. For those carbamate-based hydrazones, the cleavage is much easier, possibly due to the decreased electron density caused by the carbonyl group adjacent to one of the two nitrogens. With para-tosylate acid added, the hydrazone compounds can be transformed to the corresponding ketones with almost quantitative yields. 550px  Conditions  Ender's hydrazone alkylation reaction is usually run through a sequence of three steps. The first step should always be the synthesis of the hydrazones. The ketone or aldehyde is mixed with either SAMP or RAMP and allowed to react under argon for 12 hours. The crude hydrazone obtained is purified by distillation or recrystallization. At 0 degree celsius, the hydrazone is transferred into the ether solution of lithium diisopropylamide. Then this mixture is cooled down to -110 degree celsius and is slowly added the alkyl halide. This mixture is then allowed to warm up to room temperature. After 12 hours of reaction at room temperature, the crude alkylated hydrazone is allowed to react with ozone in a Schlenk tube to cleave the C=N bond. After distillation or column chromatography, pure alkylation product can be obtained.  Applications   Synthesis of zaragozic acid A  K. C. Nicolaou and coworkers at Scripps Research Institute generated the chiral hydrazone through Enders' hydrazone alkylation reaction with high stereoselectivity (de > 95%). The subsequent ozonolysis and Wittig reaction led to the side chain fragment of zaragozic acid A, which is a potent medicine for coronary heart disease. Synthesis of Zaragozic Acid  Synthesis of denticulatin A and B  Ziegler and coworkers reacted an allyl iodide with the azaenolate to generate a chiral hydrocarbon chain. To avoid loss of the enantiomeric purity of the product, the authors used cupric acetate to regenerate the carbonyl group, obtaining only moderate yield for the cleavage of C=N bond but good enantioselectivity (ee = 89%). The ketone was transformed after several steps into denticulatin A and B - polypropionate metabolites isolated from Siphonaria Denticulata. Synthesis of Denticulatin A&B;  Synthesis of the derivative of arteannuin  (-)-C10-demethyl arteannuin B is a structural analog of the antimalarial artemisinin. It exhibits potent antimalarial activity even against a drug- resistant strain. Little and coworkers obtained the alkylated hydrazone in diastereomerically pure form (de > 95%) through the Enders' alkylation reaction. This intermediate was then elaborated into (-)-C10-demethyl arteannuin B. Synthesis of Arteannuin B  Synthesis of epothilone A  Epothilone A and B are reported to be highly effective anticancer drugs. Several of their structural derivatives show very promising inhibition against breast cancer with only mild side effect and some of them are now under trials. In 1997, K. C. Nicolaou and coworkers reported the first total synthesis of both Epothilone A and B. Ender's alkylation reaction was utilized at the very beginning of the synthesis to install the stereogenic center at C8. The reaction proceeded with both high yield and high diastereoselectivity.

The Baptist, Episcopal and Roman Catholic faiths used specially fitted railroad cars called chapel cars, to provide religious services and information via these special cars from the 1890s to the 1930s. The cars were designed to provide both a place for religious services and as living quarters for the missionary pastors. The fronts of the cars were fitted out as churches on wheels with altars, pews, and in some cases, stained glass windows. The concept William David Walker was appointed Episcopal Bishop of North Dakota in 1883 and was faced with overseeing an enormous territory with few settlers and the fact that Western towns often were born or died as a result of the fortunes of those living in them. A discovery of gold could mean that a town would spring up almost overnight as others sought to become part of the newly found riches; merchants established businesses to cater to those connected with the mining. Conversely, the news that the ore vein was spent meant people would move on to the next opportunity, merchants needed to close their doors due to lack of business, and the town was in danger of becoming deserted. With this type of volatile situation, if money could be donated to establish a church in a town, there was no guarantee there would continue to be enough people and donations to sustain it. After an 1889 tour of Siberia and visiting the chapel cars of the Trans-Siberian Railway,The best-known chapel car on the Trans-Siberian Railway was built in 1896 by the Putilov Works in St. Petersburg. Illustrations of it appeared in Burton Holmes' account of his travel on the Trans-Siberian Railway in 1901, and also in Le Patriote Illustr√© (Paris) of 19 June 1904. Holmes' travel account included photographs of both the exterior (showing that it had been modified with the addition of a side door) and the interior (looking toward the iconostasis). The lithograph from Le Patriote Illust√© also depicted the iconostasis. A photograph of the car as originally built is available at the Sibiria [sic] Photo Archive: http://archive.yourmuseum.ru/project/sib-foto/transsib/stations/st6.htm Walker had the idea of building a railroad chapel car that could travel through his diocese which would conduct services and other business of the church. He thought that while most non-mobile churches would not survive if built, a traveling church car would be able to accomplish the same tasks and be sustainable. Walker took his idea to those in the East with a plea for contributions to build this type of railroad car. The Episcopal Church was inspired by Walker's concept and held many fund-raising events for the chapel car throughout their Eastern dioceses. He also received a large donation for this purpose from Cornelius Vanderbilt, himself the president of the New York Central Railroad. When Walker had raised $3,000, he was ready to build his chapel car and ordered it from Chicago's Pullman Company, naming it The Church of the Advent‚ÄîThe Cathedral Car of North Dakota. Episcopal chapel cars Photo of the Baptist chapel car, Glad Tidings, on a railroad siding. This was where services were held. The Church of the Advent‚ÄîThe Cathedral Car of North Dakota The car, measuring 60 feet in length, had two sections, one for worship services, complete with an organ, and the other for living quarters and an office for Walker. It was ready for transport to Fargo, North Dakota, on November 13, 1890, and Walker hosted a number of Chicagoans who toured the car before it made its way to North Dakota. (PDF) Walker was able to travel his diocese by the local railroads' willingness to pull the chapel car without charge. He would notify locales in advance of his arrival, and the car would be pulled to a siding near the local railroad station, where he would then conduct services. When the car was retired from service in 1899, Walker and his successor, Bishop Edsell, had traveled 70,000 miles throughout North Dakota with it. The car was permanently based in Carrington, North Dakota, before being sold in 1901; St. Mary's Church in Guelph, North Dakota, received the baptismal font and lectern from the chapel car. Diocese of Northern Michigan Chapel Cars Bishop Mott Williams, head of the diocese of Northern Michigan, faced the same problems as Bishop Walker regarding reaching communicants who were often far from a church. He did not have the same financial opportunities, so his choice was to purchase two retired rail coaches and have them converted into chapel cars, which served this diocese from 1891 to 1898. When a fire destroyed most of the town of Ontonagon, Michigan in 1898, the town's churches were also lost. The Chapel Car of Northern Michigan provided a temporary home for services to all faiths whose churches had been destroyed. Baptist chapel cars Boston Smith, who was one of the key persons in Baptist chapel car work. By 1891, the first of the American Baptist Publication Society chapel cars made its debut. Based on the research regarding children's attendance of Sunday schools and increasing church membership by Boston W. Smith, businessmen Charles L. Colby and Colgate Hoyt donated the funds to build and outfit the Society's first chapel car, Evangel, built by Barney & Smith. (PDF) Hoyt, whose brother, Wayland, was the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Minneapolis, was a vice-president and board member of many American railroads. While on a cross-country railroad trip, a discussion between the two brothers became the beginning of the Baptist chapel car project. Hoyt also organized other wealthy businessmen into what was known as the \\"Baptist Chapel Car Syndicate\\"; one of these members was John D. Rockefeller. (PDF) The Baptist chapel car fleet grew to a total of seven cars, all built by Barney & Smith during the years 1890 to 1913. Thomas Edison, though not a member of the church, donated phonographs for all the chapel cars. Evangel The Evangel was similar to the Episcopal The Church of the Advent‚ÄîThe Cathedral Car of North Dakota in size and in layout, with half of the car used as a chapel and the other half for living quarters. The car was dedicated May 23, 1891 at Cincinnati's Grand Central Depot and it made its way to St. Paul, Minnesota, where local church members provided linens, rugs, silver and dishes. The Baptist young peoples' societies raised the money to have the car's windows screened, which sent it back to the shop for a time while they were fitted. The Estey company donated an organ. Inventor William Coffin Coleman and his workmen with the chapel car Evangel. Coleman outfitted the car with new lighting in 1911. Boston Smith, who was initially aboard Evangel, had been provided with a letter from William Mellen, the general manager of the Northern Pacific Railway, which granted him and the chapel car free passage throughout the railroad's system. However, just as Smith was to set out on his first trip, railroad officials inquired whether the chapel car had been fitted with special wheels designed to prevent accidents. The railway's rules were that all special cars be fitted with them instead of the ordinary iron wheels used by other railroad cars. The Evangel was equipped with plain iron wheels but was allowed to travel as far as Livingston, Montana, before the wheels had to be changed. At Portland, Oregon in December 1891, Smith turned the car over to its first missionaries, the Wheelers. By 1892, the chapel car was called upon to serve the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. In 1894, Evangel was brought to serve the Southern United States. From 1901 until 1924, the chapel car traveled the rails of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska before being retired to Rawlins, Wyoming, where the old car was incorporated into the design of the local Baptist church by 1930. The church, Chapel Car Bible Church has started a remodel project in hopes of uncovering parts of the original train that have been hidden and to highlight the chapel car and its missionary history. The church is open for visitors to view the chapel car upon appointment. The church is located on the corner of 12th and W. Maple Street in Rawlins, Wyoming. Emmanuel The car was being built during the financial panic of 1893. While Barney & Smith was able to build the Evangel at cost, it was now a public corporation and was struggling to stay solvent. The price quoted for the car did not include any of the interior necessities. Many items that went into the building of the Emmanuel were donations from corporations: brakes from Westinghouse Air Brake Company, various springs and wheels, along with flatware, blankets and a range for cooking. Still others were donated by the various Baptist organizations; the car's furnishings were a gift from the women of the First Baptist Churches of Oakland and San Francisco. The car, which was ten feet longer than the Evangel, was dedicated in Denver, Colorado, on May 24, 1893. The Wheelers, who were the first missionaries aboard the Evangel were also the first to travel with Emmanuel. In 1895, the chapel car was sent into the shop for repainting and repairs, making it necessary for the Wheelers to vacate it while the work was done. While making their way home to Minnesota, the train they were aboard was involved in a wreck and Mr. Wheeler was killed. As a memorial to him, a stained glass window was created and mounted in the door leading to the living quarters section of the car. The car traveled in the Western and Northwestern states and territories until 1938, where it sat on a spur in South Fork, Colorado. In 1942, a decision was reached to move the aging chapel car to a Baptist camp at Swan Lake, South Dakota, where it sat for thirteen years before being sold for scrap. The old car was then used for storage by an engineering company. While there, a carpenter for the Prairie Village park saw the car and realized its potential to be restored. The Emmanuel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and was fully restored by 1982. Its permanent home is at Prairie Village.

Glad Tidings A gift of businessman William Hills, the car was dedicated in Saratoga, New York, on May 25, 1894. Hills placed one condition on his gift: that matching funds to build a fourth chapel car be raised before the end of the year. The first missionaries for the car, the Rusts, were newlyweds at the time of their assignment. Two of their five children were born on Glad Tidings. The car traveled in the Midwestern states and territories served by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In 1905, the Rusts left chapel car work and Glad Tidings was turned over to chapel car missionaries serving in Colorado, Wyoming and Arizona. Various restrictions, including those of World War I, kept the car in Douglas, Wyoming, for the years 1915 through 1919. Because it had been sidelined for a period of years, the car was sent for some needed maintenance in 1920 before being assigned to a new Arizona route. The chapel car continued its work in Arizona until 1926, when it was brought to its final destination of Flagstaff. There its wheels and trucks were removed and it was placed on a foundation as the \\"Glad Tidings Baptist Church\\" until it was dismantled in the early 1930s.

Dedicated in Saratoga Springs, New York, on June 1, 1895, the car was sent to serve the growing population of Texas and worked in cooperation with the Texas Baptist Convention. At the time of the 1900 Galveston hurricane, the missionaries were in the city, but the chapel car was in the Galveston Santa Fe Railroad shop for work. It was damaged but not destroyed by the storm as a result; the damage made it necessary to ask for special donations from Texas Baptist congregations to pay for the additional repairs. By 1905, its mission service area had been changed to routes in Missouri and Colorado, later continuing on to the West and Pacific Northwest, where it continued to travel for another twenty years. In 1938, it was time to find the car a permanent foundation, and it was parked behind the hotel in Boyes Hot Springs, California. The car was discovered in the same spot in 1998 and was scheduled to be removed to private property and restored by a businessman. Messenger of Peace Messenger of Peace was also known as the \\"Ladies' Car\\" because it was built with $100 donations from 75 Baptist women. Even though economic times were still difficult for the car's manufacturer, Barney & Smith, the company was able to provide this car at cost. It was dedicated on May 21, 1898, in Rochester, New York. In 1904, it went on display at the Palace of Transportation at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition where it received first prize for a railroad car exhibit. The chapel car traveled in the Midwestern states until 1910, when it was sent to serve the YMCA for a year. During that time, it also traveled to Boston for a Protestant missionary exposition. By 1913, it was on its way to the Pacific Northwest, where it worked in Washington state through two world wars. The car was retired in 1948 and was turned into a diner after being sold. It was discovered on private property being used for storage in 1997; ten years later, it was donated to the Northwest Railway Museum, where it was under restoration by master craftsman Kevin Palo until December, 2012. Herald of Hope This car, which was the last made of wood, was called \\"The Young Men's Car\\" because the young men of Detroit's Woodward Baptist Church had raised the first $1,000 of its costs. Dedicated in Detroit on May 27, 1900, it served the Midwestern states. In 1911, it was reconditioned at the Barney & Smith factory at Dayton, Ohio, and in 1915, embarked on a new mission to West Virginia, serving there until its last missionary, William Newton, died in 1931. His wife, Fannie, refused to leave the chapel car, as she considered it her home. She remained there until 1935. (PDF) After 1935, the fate of the chapel car was unknown until 1947, when a photograph was obtained of the car without wheels, which had been used as an office for an abandoned coal company in the Quinwood, West Virginia, area where the Newtons had last served as missionaries.

Grace This was the last of the Baptist chapel cars built and the only one that was constructed of steel. Donated by the Conaway family in memory of their daughter, Grace, it was also built by the Barney & Smith factory in 1915, at a cost of over five times the price paid for the first chapel car, Evangel. The car was dedicated in Los Angeles in 1915 and was on display at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco before beginning work in California. Grace also served in Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado before being placed on permanent display at the American Baptist Assembly at Green Lake, Wisconsin, in 1946.

Father Francis Kelley became the president of the newly formed Catholic Church Extension Society in 1905. Kelley, who had visited the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition and toured the Baptist chapel car, Messenger of Peace, while there, was impressed with what the chapel car was able to do for the Baptist faith. Since the mission of the Extension Society was to bring the Catholic faith to those in remote areas, he believed the use of chapel cars would be an effective way to accomplish this. In an article for Extension Magazine, he wrote, \\"If the Baptists can do it, why not the Catholics?\\", and asked for someone to donate a railroad car for this purpose. From 1907 to 1915, three chapel cars were given to the Extension Society. Two of the cars were built by the Pullman Company while one was built by Dayton's Barney & Smith. St. Anthony The first of these cars was St. Anthony, donated by Ambrose Petry and Richmond Dean, who was a Pullman Company vice-president. The car, originally built by Pullman in 1886, was refitted by Dean at the Pullman factory as a chapel car with a living area for its priests. (PDF) The 72 foot long car was dedicated and blessed in 1907. It served in Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and also in the West and Pacific Northwest. By 1909, it made its way to Oregon, where it was credited with creating more than 80 Catholic parishes. The car was taken from railroad service in 1919, when railroads no longer would handle wooden passenger cars.

St. Peter When Dayton businessman Peter Kuntz visited the St. Anthony chapel car, he asked the Extension Society why it did not build a fine chapel car instead of the wooden, refitted one. Kuntz then donated $25,000 to fund a Barney & Smith built steel chapel car in 1912 named St. Peter. At the time it was built, it was one of the longest railroad cars in the world. This car was in service from 1912 into the 1930s and was displayed at the 1915 Panama- Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, coupled with the Baptist chapel car, Grace.

St. Paul The last and largest of the Catholic chapel cars, the St. Paul was also donated by Peter Kuntz. Measuring 86 feet long, it was built by Chicago's Pullman Company. Dedicated in New Orleans on March 14, 1915, it served primarily in Louisiana, Texas, North Carolina and Oklahoma. By 1936, both St. Peter and St. Paul were in storage, with St. Paul being sent to the Bishop of Great Falls, Montana, for use in the diocese. The chapel car was sold to Montana state Senator Charles Bovey for his railroad museum in 1967. In 1996, the chapel car was involved in a trade between the museum and the Escanaba- Lake Superior Railroad.

The family also owned a shrinking mill (for shrinking and drying cloth) opposite of the saw/grist mill. Capt. Trull used one of his fields as the training ground for drilling his company of minutemen.Ask Now of the Days that are Past: A History of the Town of Tewksbury, Massachusetts, 1734-1964, pp. 114, 117-21, 127, 136, 141, (http://www.tewksburyhistoricalsociety.org/Archives/books/index.html), Retrieved 12-4-11.Ye Towne Book: Two Hundredth Anniversary, August 25, 26, 27, 1934, p. 68, Tewksbury, MA (http://www.tewksburyhistoricalsociety.org/Archives/books/index.html), Retrieved 12-4-11.  The \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" ‚Äì Lexington & Concord  On the night of April 18, 1775, Paul Revere and William Dawes left Boston to warn of the British troops coming to capture the colony's supply of arms and powder at Concord, and possibly arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were staying in Lexington. Revere and Dawes set off a chain reaction of other alarm riders, who fanned out across Massachusetts.Neilson, Capt. Larz, \\"Capt. John Trull, Minuteman,\\" 1987 (), Retrieved 12-4-11.

Ancient tradition has it that the galloping horseman depicted on the Tewksbury Town Seal is this rider. Trull quickly fired off three shots, purportedly from his bedroom window, which was a prearranged signal to Capt. Varnum, of the Dracut minute company, who lived across the Merrimack River.Neilson, Capt. Larz, \\"The March to Lexington and Concord,\\" Wilmington Town Crier, 8-5-2011 (http://homenewshere.com/wilmington_town_crier/news/article_7cb0d29e-beb6-11e0-aa7f-001cc4c002e0.html), Retrieved 12-4-11.Fischer, David Hackett, Paul Revere's Ride, p. 139, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1994.Coburn, Frank Warren, The Battle of April 19, 1775, in Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville and Charlestown, Massachusetts, pp. 41-44, Lexington Historical Society, Lexington, MA, 1922. After hearing Capt. Varnum's shots in response, Trull rode rapidly to the village, where some of his men had already gathered and armed themselves. Trull placed himself at their head and marched them off toward Concord. His company and others positioned themselves near the road between Lexington and Concord at Meriam's Corner. Their exertions there turned an orderly British retreat into a rout.Pride, Edward W., Tewksbury: A Short History, pp. 35-7, North Tewksbury, 1888 (http://www.tewksburyhistoricalsociety.org/Archives/books/index.html), Retrieved 12-4-11.Fischer, David Hackett, Paul Revere's Ride, p. 139, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1994. The Regulars had already exchanged fire with the militia at Lexington, then marched on to Concord, where more shots were fired. A growing swarm of irate militia convinced the British commander that it was time to get back to Boston. The topography at Meriam's Corner forced the British flanking parties back to the road, and thus proved to be a perfect ambush point for Trull and the other colonists.Galvin, Gen.

Meriam's Corner (between Lexington and Concord), MA. As the day went along, minute and standard militia companies would find a place providing good cover from which to attack the passing British column. After firing a volley, they would then leapfrog ahead through fields, to another good spot and repeat the process. Other companies followed the column putting fire into its rear. As Trull later recalled, the Regulars \\"ran well\\" under this galling fire.Fischer, David Hackett, Paul Revere's Ride, pp. 249-60, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1994.Hurd, D.

Trull's and other companies chased the British all the way back to Charlestown, with the number of angry colonists shooting at the Regulars growing with every mile. If British Gen. Gage in Boston, had not sent out an additional 1,000 reinforcements, along with two field pieces, the original expeditionary force of 700 would likely have never made it back. As an old man, Eliphalet Manning, who was one of Trull's minutemen, related the story to one of Trull's grandchildren this way, \\"I fought with your grandfather from Concord to Charlestown.

Subsequent Developments  The Trull farmhouse overlooked the Merrimack River. It was located on Stickney Hill, also known as River Road Hill, near the intersection of River Road and Trull Road. It survived until about 1912, when it burned. A descendant, Bailey Trull, converted about 125 acres of the family farm into the Trull Brook Golf Course in 1963. The original Trull barn was used as a temporary clubhouse. The land has been in the family for over 200 years and 14 generations.

Plot  Act 1  The scene is the Paris flat of the singer Lucette. Her lover, Fernand de Bois-d'Enghien, is engaged to be married to Viviane, daughter of the Baroness Duverger, but is too cowardly to break the news to Lucette. As the morning continues more characters arrive at the apartment. Bouzin is a notary's clerk who dabbles in song-writing. Although he does not know Lucette, he brings along a song he has written for her. Lucette dismisses his song as stupid and sends him away. A bouquet and ring are delivered for her, with Bouzin's card attached. They have been sent anonymously by Lucette's admirer General Irrigua, a South American exile, but Bouzin has surreptitiously planted his business card in the bouquet. When he returns for his forgotten umbrella, Lucette is more welcoming, sending him back to his flat to retrieve the song. The general enters. He says he will kill anyone who comes between him and Lucette. Bois-d'Enghien tells him Bouzin is her lover. Bouzin returns, the general attacks him, and when it emerges that the bouquet and ring were from the general, Lucette thows Bouzin out.  Act 2  alt=man in evening dress found in a wardrobe by two shocked-looking women At the baroness's town house they are preparing for a party to mark Viviane's engagement. Viviane is not enthused about marrying Bois-d'Enghien: she thinks him a milksop and is attracted only by dashing, disreputable men. Bois-d'Enghien arrives, and is appalled to find that Lucette has been booked to sing at the party. She arrives, and he hides in a wardrobe, where she discovers him. Bois-d'Enghien tries frantically to conceal the news of his engagement, but eventually she discovers it. She takes a thistle from a bouquet and rams it down the back of his neck. Behind a screen he takes off his shirt to remove the thistle, and Lucette removes her dress, makes loud protestations of love, knocks down the screen and embraces him. The uproar brings in the assembled guests who look on, apalled.  Act 3  Bois-d'Enghien arrives at his apartment. He is in the middle of changing his clothes when Bouzin arrives. The latter had been the notary's clerk at the betrothal, and is delivering a bill and a copy of the contract. The general arrives, and there is a chase scene before Bois-d'Enghien sends the general in the wrong direction. Lucette arrives and unsuccessfully tries to regain Bois-d'Enghien's affections. She feigns a suicide bid with what turns out to be a toy pistol, and leaves shortly before the general returns. Bois-d'Enghien tells the general he can win Lucette, sending him running after her. Bois-d'Enghien is trapped, trouserless, when the apartment door shuts behind him, leaving him in the corridor. He uses the toy pistol to forge Bouzin to surrender his trousers. The concierge comes up the stairs with policemen looking for a man in his underclothes, and Bouzin flees as Viviane arrives, to the surprise of Bois-d'Enghien. Having discovered that Bois-d'Enghien does in fact have the scandalous reputation she desires she is determined to marry him. The baroness soon discovers them and is forced to agree that as Viviane has compromised herself by coming to Bois-d'Enghien's apartment, their marriage is inevitable. ::Source: Pronko, Georges Feydeau.Pronko, pp. 109‚Äì113 Reception alt=man with trousers but no shirt surrounded by horrified people in correct evening costumeThe authors of Les Annales du th√©√¢tre et de la musique said that they despaired of conveying to their readers how funny the piece was.No√´l et Stoullig (1895), p. 321 In Le Figaro Henry Fouquier took mild exception to jokes about a minor character's bad breath, but concluded, \\"I came out dizzy, shaking with laughter\\" at the sheer youthful delight of the piece, which gave \\"the rare and charming impression\\" that the author had enjoyed himself writing the play as much as the audience had enjoyed watching it.Fouquier, Henry. \\"Palais-Royal\\", Le Figaro, 10 January 1894, p. 6 The Paris correspondent of the London paper The Era reported that the play \\"sent us away tipsy with laughing ‚Ä¶ a side- splitting piece whose broad fun renders criticism superfluous\\".\\"The Theatre in Paris\\", The Era, 13 January 1894, p. 9 Revivals and adaptations During Feydeau's lifetime the play was revived in Paris, at the Th√©√¢tre Antoine in 1911, with Marcel Simon as Bois-d'Enghien, Armande Cassive as Lucette and MSulhac as Bouzin.Stoullig (1912), p. 335 It ran for 111 performances.Stoullig (1912), p. 345 Feydeau's work underwent years of neglect after his death, and Un fil √† la patte was not given a major revival in Paris until 1961, when Jacques Charon directed it for the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise.

Part of the disused mine was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its geological interest in 1991 and is also a Geological Conservation Review site of national importance for the minerals on the site. History Documentary evidence from 1508 of a mine known as Cog-an-bans (Higher Work) or Goghan Bras (Great Coffin) may relate to this pit. The veins or network of veinlets of tin in this section of the mine are close to the surface and known as the Conqueror branches. The miners followed these veinlets, some of which are still visible through the overgrown vegetation although scarcely wide enough for a man to climb through. The modern mine was first active from 1855, producing copper until 1884, tin until 1906 and zinc from 1860 until 1876. Arsenic and tungsten were also extracted for short amounts of time. First, a 45-inch pumping engine was in use, later to be replaced by a 70-inch engine on the Harvey's Engine Shaft. By 1864 the mine employed 457 people. Five lodes were worked at Wheal Fortune. The prefix Great was added to distinguish the mine from the other sixteen or so mines of the same name. In the northern section the Carnmeal lode adjoins Wheal Vor and reached a depth of 150 fathoms. The main part of the mine, 300m to the south and considered to be of great antiquity, is a large openwork (known as a gunnis or coffin) divided in two by a narrow ridge. In 1868 the Carnmeal lode was abandoned and five engines in the southern part of the mine were put up for sale although the mine managed to carry on until 1912 under different companies, and in 1908‚Äì09 under the name New Great Wheal Fortune. Only three people were employed at the mine in 1907. In the 1950s a lone miner is said to have worked the burrows (waste tips) and taken two sacks of wolfram daily to Camborne for sale.

The apparent magnitude of this star is 12.51, so it cannot be seen with the unaided eye. Viewing it requires a telescope with an aperture of or more. It is slightly smaller than the Sun, with 94% of the Sun's radius and about 91% of the Sun's mass. The effective temperature of the photosphere is slightly cooler than that of the Sun at , giving it the characteristic yellow hue of a stellar class G8 star. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, is approximately the same as in the Sun. It may be older than the Sun, although the margin of error here is relatively large. Planetary system Size comparison of Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f (artist's impressions) with Venus and Earth (actual photographs) On December 20, 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of a five-planet system containing three small gas giants and the first two Earth-sized extrasolar planets, Kepler-20e (the first known extrasolar planet smaller than Earth orbiting a main-sequence star) and Kepler-20f, orbiting a Sun-like star.http://kepler.nasa.gov/news/nasakeplernews/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&NewsID;=172 Although the planets are Earth-sized, they are not Earth-like in the respect that they are much closer to their star than Earth, and are hence not near the habitable zone, with expected surface temperatures of and , respectively. The three other Neptune-sized planets in the system, Kepler-20b, Kepler-20c, and Kepler-20d, all orbit similarly close to the star. Kepler-20g is a non- transiting Neptunian world. The masses of e and f are expected masses. Their masses are uncertain as they are too small to detect via radial velocity with current technology. All planets are at small near resonances; proceeding outwards, they are 3:2, 4:2, 2:1, 4:1. The planetary orbits in current form are highly sensitive to perturbations caused by outer planets, therefore assuming stability, no additional gas giant planets can be located closer than 30 AU from the parent star.

The incident in 1973 occurred when a sixteen-year-old, Leroy Jones, was cutting grass for Helen Washington, who was taking a nap on her porch in the Diamond community. The plant released a plume of gas. A spark from the lawnmower ignited the plume of gas and the flames that resulted engulfed Leroy Jones and Helen Washington. The second explosion occurred in 1988. An early morning explosion from the plant killed seven Shell workers, destroyed homes in the Diamond community, and released of chemical waste into the atmosphere. Residents still suffer from early illnesses and deaths as a result of the toxic fumes. Citizens ‚Ä≥have fought Shell Oil since the 1973 explosion. On June 11, 2002, the Concerned Citizens of Norco finished open discussions and negotiations with Shell Oil. The settlement created two programs, the Property Purchase Program and the Home Improvement Program. These programs allow the citizens to either sell their property to Shell at fair price or benefit from programs aimed at improving the Diamond community.  Background Information  Norco, Louisiana is located along the Mississippi River approximately west of New Orleans. The community is in between a chemical plant and an oil refinery. Norco is a part of what is known as \\"Cancer Alley\\". Norco is named for the New Orleans Refining Company. In 1916, a Shell affiliate built an oil refinery on the site of an antebellum plantation. In 1953, Shell bought a second plantation site. The property that Shell bought was the site of a major slave revolt in 1811. Black sharecroppers were farming the land when Shell announced that they were building a chemical plant. The black sharecroppers moved across the road from the plantation and into a subdivision that became known as Diamond. Sharecroppers originally welcomed Shell because they thought that the company would bring more jobs. This wasn't the case. Shell hired predominantly educated white workers who were able to read and understand operating manuals. These workers moved into the nicer neighborhoods of Norco.\\"Concerned Citizens of Norco Reach Agreement with Shell Chemical.\\" Corpwatch: Holding Corporations Accountable. 20 June 2002. Web. 30 Nov. 2011. .  Explosion of 1973  The explosion occurred on a summer day in 1973. A Shell pipeline began to leak. The pipeline ran along Washington Street in the Diamond community. The pipeline also forms a fence line between the industrial facility and the Diamond community. Many residents recall seeing a white cloud of gas traveling down Washington Street. Nearby, Leroy Jones, a sixteen-year-old in the Diamond community, was cutting the grass at the home of Helen Washington, an elderly citizen of the Diamond community. Helen Washington was taking a nap on her front porch when Leroy Jones decided to take a break from cutting grass so he could talk to his neighbors. When he started the lawnmower again, a spark from the lawnmower ignited the fumes that had leaked from the Shell pipeline. This led to an explosion that severely burned Leroy Jones and burned down Helen Washington's house.Rosen, Ruth. \\"Toxic Terror.\\" Dissent MagazineCommonweal. Web. 30 Nov. 2011. Leroy Jones was taken to the hospital by emergency workers and was treated for injuries. He eventually died a few days later in the hospital. Helen Washington burned in her house and died immediately. It is unknown exactly how much the victim's families were compensated for the deaths. Several citizens claim that relatives of Helen Washington received $3,000 for her destroyed house and the land surrounding it. Citizens claim that the mother of Leroy Jones was paid $500 for the death of her son. There is no record of the fatalities and there is no mention of the accident in the Shell Norco Museum.Lerner, Steve. \\"Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor.\\" Crisis in American Institutions. Eds. Jerome H. Skolnick, and Elliott Currie. Print.  Explosion of 1988  At 3:37 a.m. on May 5, 1988, an explosion occurred in the catalytic cracking unit (CCU) of an oil and gas refinery. The explosion apparently was the result of corrosion of an vapor line. This vapor line, under pressure, ran from a header that originated as the main overhead vapor line from the depropanizer column. The apparent instantaneous line failure released approximately of hydrocarbon vapor for approximately 30 seconds. A possible ignition source could have been the unit's superheater furnace. The damage pattern indicated that the explosion was probably an aerial explosion with an epicenter located in the area between the depropanizer and the CCU control room. Employees #1, #2, #4, #5, and #7 were found fatally injured inside the CCU control room as a direct result of the blast. Employee #3 was found fatally injured approximately outside the west side of the CCU control room as a direct result of the blast. Employee #6 was fatally injured while he was exiting the GO-1 South control room.https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=100478866 Damage from the explosion radiated from the center of the explosion and debris could be found as far as from the center of the explosion. The blast could be heard approximately away in New Orleans. There were reports that the blast set off burglar alarms in New Orleans. The explosion caused a fire to burn for eight hours at the oil refinery before it was brought under control. Chemicals that escaped during the explosion resulted in cars and homes being covered by a black film. The governor declared a state of emergency in Norco and St. Charles Parish. Seven shell workers were killed during the explosion and 48 residents and Shell workers were injured in the explosion. The explosion released of toxic chemicals into the air, which led to widespread damage and the evacuating on 4,500 people.Lerner, Steve. \\"Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor.\\" Crisis in American Institutions. Eds. Jerome H. Skolnick, and Elliott Currie. Print.  Health Related Illnesses  Many of the residents of the Diamond community suffer from sickness and illness associated with the oil refinery. Many residents claim that they suffer from headaches, nausea, dizziness, congestion, sore throats, and difficulty breathing on a regular basis. Residents claim that when they leave the Diamond area, their health improves. Once they return, their health begins to deteriorate again. A study was done in 1997 by Xavier University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice. The study concluded that 34% of children in the Diamond area suffer from asthma problems. One- fourth of all the women and children surveyed had to visit the hospital due to respiratory problems.\\"Norco: Profile.\\" Louisiana Bucket Brigade: Clean Air. Justice. Sustainability. 18 Oct. 2002. Web. 30 Nov. 2011. Residents also claim to suffer from psychological issues associated with the explosions of 1973 and 1988. Some of the residents claim that they sleep in their clothes so that they will be ready to evacuate in the case of another explosion. Residents also claim that they have flashbacks of the 1973 and 1988 explosions.  Concerned Citizens of Norco  Since the explosion of 1973 and 1988, a group called the Concerned Citizens of Norco has attempted to engage in open discussions with Shell Chemical LP. The group has tried to resolve difference with Shell regarding the Voluntary Property Purchase program, \\"a program designed to create greenbelt space along the fence lines of the Shell and Motiva Enterprises (Motiva) facilities in Norco, Louisiana that was offered to residents living on two of the four streets that make up the tight- knit and historic Diamond neighborhood.\\" The discussions have resulted in Shell having a greater appreciation for the Diamond community. Both sides have also talked about the Shell and Motiva Good Neighbor Initiative, which contains programs that aim to enhance the quality of life for the citizens of Norco and Diamond. Shell has created a program that consists of a Property Purchase Component and a Home Improvement Component. The Home Improvement Component gives residents of Diamond the opportunity to stay in the community and take advantage of the Good Neighbor Initiative. The component is designed to improve the lives of the citizens, help the community grow, and preserve the history of the community. The Property Purchase Component allows Diamond residents to sell their property to Shell at a fair price and leave the community. The difference between the two community of Diamond and Shell has been solved and both sides have agreed to more open discussion if the need arises. The agreement was signed into effect of June 11, 2002.\\"Concerned Citizens of Norco Reach Agreement with Shell Chemical.\\" Corpwatch: Holding Corporations Accountable. 20 June 2002.

They live by fishing and farming, raising cassava, banana and kola nuts. They are related to the Kusu people, only separating from them in the late 1800s after the arrival of Arabs and Belgians in the region. Both the Batetela and the Kusu are subgroups of the larger Mongo group.Kisangani and Bobb 501 The name Motetela comes from a god named Motetela, meaning either \\"he who laughs not\\" or \\"he at whom one may not laugh.\\"Torday 372‚Äì373 History According to Emil Torday (who studied the tribes of the Congo between 1908 and 1909),Turner 606 the Batetela originated on the right bank of the Lomami River and migrated to their present territory at some unknown date.Torday 372 In 1869‚Äì70, some Tetela groups came into contact with Tippu Tip, an Arab slave trader from Zanzibar.Turner 599; Note that Turner stresses the mutability of ethnic labels in this period, and argues that the term \\"Tetela\\" once referred to groups of the Songye people. Following this, the chieftain Gongo Lutete began working with Tip and the Arabs to lead the Batetela in slave raids against the Luba people in Kasai.Turner 587 In the Congo Arab war of 1892‚Äì1894, the Batetela fought for the Arabs, but later defected to the Belgians.Edgerton 98 Gongo Lutete was executed by the Belgians in 1893, however, and this caused the Batetela to revolt in 1895 in the first of the Batetela Rebellions. Successive uprisings followed, lasting until 1908.Renton, Seddon, and Zeilig 34 During the period immediately following independence, Patrice Lumumba, a Tetela, was a prominent politician and the first Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo before his assassination in 1961.

It is extracted in the 2019 anthology New Daughters of Africa.Busby, Margaret (9 March 2019), \\"From Ay√≤b√°mi Ad√©b√°y√≤ to Zadie Smith: meet the New Daughters of Africa\\", The Guardian.New Daughters of Africa contributors, Myriad Editions. Story The novel is about Remi Foster, an intelligent Yoruba girl who, at the age of six, journeys from her home and privileged life in Lagos, Nigeria, to receive an education in England. After years of living abroad, Remi begins to consider herself an Englishwoman rather than a Nigerian, despite facing considerable discrimination in English private schools. A bildungsroman (coming-of-age novel), the book focuses on issues of identity in the postcolonial period. The Yoruba people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, making up 21 per cent of that country's population. Major characters Remi Foster - A Nigerian girl sent at the age of six to attend a boarding school in England, Remi is the titular protagonist and narrator. The novel follows her from childhood to adulthood, chronicling her education within several English private schools, her experiences staying with various English families, and her eventual return to Nigeria. Remi is smart, sharp and well educated, though somewhat na√Øve due to her age, particularly in the first half of the novel. During her stay in England, she grapples with cultural indoctrination and racial bigotry, as well as her peers‚Äô views of stereotypes of black Africans. Miss Pickering / \\"Bigmama\\" ‚Äì An Englishwoman who married into the Foster family, Miss Pickering ‚Äî known to Remi as Bigmama ‚Äî helps to prepare Remi for life in England. Bigmama, who married a Nigerian man, has experienced at first hand the racial and cultural conflict present in post-colonial England. Knowing full well that a Nigerian child will face racial discrimination in London, Bigmama does her best to groom young Remi for English society. Though well-meaning, her efforts often come off as callous to the reader. Miss Smith ‚Äì A short, youthful English woman who \\"tutors\\" Remi on board the ship to Liverpool. Miss Smith berates Remi for wandering the ship unattended, dismisses the young girl's intelligence, and generally serves as a nuisance to Remi during the voyage. Mr Lowther ‚Äì A boatswain on the cargo liner to Liverpool, Mr Lowther forms an unlikely friendship with the protagonist. He shows Remi around the ship and its crew quarters, remarking that only the two of them can \\"move freely\\" between the cargo liner's dual worlds. Kind and considerate, Mr Lowther serves as a foil to the unsympathetic Miss Smith. Remi's parents ‚Äì Absent for most of the novel, Remi's parents first appear only to send Remi off to England for an education. They meet with Remi once again, much later, this time bringing along Remi's younger sister, Aduke, and younger brother, Tunji. As head of an upper class Nigerian family, Remi's father's behaviour in public is a frequent source of shock for English strangers. Families ‚Äì During her stay in England, Remi houses with many different families, all of them acquaintances of the Foster family. In general, these families are a source of discontent for Remi, who feels out of place and unwanted in their homes, particularly later in the novel. Aduke ‚Äì Remi's younger sister, who serves as a foil to Remi in the final quarter of the novel. While Remi has decided, by this point in the narrative, that excessive flattery and charm is the best method by which to deal with new English families, Aduke refuses to assume such false identities. She views Remi's efforts to charm strangers and conform to English culture as not only vain but embarrassing. Plot synopsis The novel begins with Remi Foster, aged six, living with her grandparents and their foster children in Nigeria. When her parents return home from a wedding reception, they bring surprising news: she is being sent to live in an all-girls boarding-school in England. \\"Bigmama\\", an Englishwoman who married into the Foster family, will bring Remi along on her return trip to Liverpool. Remi is shocked by the news; she knew \\"everyone went to England\\", but she never expected to leave at such a young age. Although overcome with excitement at the prospect of attending an English school, she is understandably disheartened by some of the measures Bigmama takes to ensure that her transition into English society goes as smoothly as possible. Bigmama insists that Remi's hair be cut short, as she believes English hairdressers won't know how to style it properly. She also purchases an oversized raincoat and matching hat for Remi to wear, both of which are large enough to conceal her skin colour from prying eyes. Remi, at her young age, does not fully understand the reasoning behind the outfit, nor its implications. Remi and Bigmama set sail for England on a cargo liner. On the first morning, Remi leaves her cabin and explores the ship, clad in nothing but her nightgown. She is discovered by Miss Smith, who drags her back to Bigmama, offering to tutor Remi during the voyage. Remi feigns illness to escape Miss Smith, sneaks out of her cabin, and stumbles into the crew quarters, where she meets Mr Lowther. She spends most of the remaining voyage with Lowther, learning about the ship and listening to the crew's stories. Upon arriving in England, Remi meets Aunty Madge, Bigmama's sister, and Uncle Reg. Remi learns that she will be staying with Aunty Betty and Uncle Theo, though the two are reluctant to house her. Shortly afterwards, Remi moves into the boarding school. Though initially shunned because of her skin colour, which one girl claims will \\"rub off\\" on anyone who brushes against her, Remi manages to gain the trust of her schoolmates, by fabricating exotic, stereotypical tales of Africa, and pretending that her father is a chieftain. Years pass, and Remi transfers from school to school. She is now more English than Nigerian, and her home in Lagos seems a distant memory. She has become wiser, jaded, somewhat cynical. She is, by all accounts, an Englishwoman, yet her skin colour makes her an outsider. During the novel Remi never returns to Nigeria, where she would no longer be a strange outsider to be shunned, but an intriguing and cultured individual among her peers. Themes Race Race is an important theme in Yoruba Girl Dancing as it is perhaps the largest obstacle facing the main character. During Remi's time in Lagos, race is less evident as an issue, since almost everyone she has contact with is black; however, there are a few key moments during which the reader begins to understand the role of race in Nigeria. Remi and her family are distinguished as unique and wealthy because they live in an area where mostly wealthy expatriates and white people reside. Furthermore, the fact that the inclusion of a white woman from England in their family is such an affront to Remi's conservative grandmother shows that the stigma of race goes both ways, not just of white people towards black people. However, this is turned on its head once Remi arrives in England. Before going to boarding-school she spends time in London with her white step-grandmother, Bigmama, and some of her relatives. Remi takes a liking to these people and asks to see them during her school breaks but it is made clear that her white ‚ÄúAunt‚Äù is uncomfortable with this because of what others will think of a white woman serving as the guardian for a black girl. Remi faces more of such prejudice once she arrives at school. The white women running the school have little sympathy for the six-year-old and the harshness of the transition she is facing as a young Nigerian girl coming to a posh boarding-school where she is not only the single African but the only black girl. Furthermore, the school uniform is referred to as being \\"nigger\\" brown, and the girls she must share living quarters with are under the assumption that her blackness is contagious. By the end of the novel Remi comes to the satisfying conclusion that, despite all the strife she has faced in Britain, she is in fact British. She is able to overcome her internal issues regarding race and firmly declare herself within one of the two realms that she has always straddled. The total effect of the many moments in the novel concerning race is to inform the reader of exactly how severe the stigma of blackness in 1950s London was, one that no amount of money or education would allow a black person to completely escape. Socio-economic class When the reader is introduced to Remi, she is living with her very wealthy grandparents in Lagos, Nigeria. They have an enormous colonial style home with multiple floors and many servants, who live in separate quarters on the grounds. Wealth isolates Remi from those around her. Her maids, close to her in age but so different in their means and class, are the nearest things she has to friends, yet there is always a level of disconnect among them, made even more evident when Remi takes a trip to the marketplace with one of the servants who works in her grandparents' home. Remi is dressed in English-style clothing and is taunted by some girls for it. Also, the scale, lavishness, and attention that the wedding of one of her family members receives indicates just how wealthy her family is and the high-profile this wealth affords them. When six-year-old Remi makes the trip from Nigeria to England she stays with some relatives of her step-grandmother, Bigmama. Remi immediately notices that they do not have servants and the woman of the house does the housework herself. Remi assumes that they are poor. Following her stay in London with these distant relatives, she goes to boarding-school with other affluent girls. However, because of her race, these girls do not believe she could possibly have lived a lavish lifestyle in Nigeria and she is isolated from her classmates. The divide that socio-economic status causes in Remi's life underscores her constant feeling of isolation. She is never among those who are like her, and in order to adapt to the rifts caused by her race and socio- economic class, she must develop into a strong and somewhat cynical young woman. Colonialism Colonialism and post-colonialism are major themes of the novel.Hodapp, James, \\"The Proto-Afropolitan Bildungsroman: Yoruba Women, Resistance, and the Nation in Simi Bedford's Yoruba Girl Dancing\\", The Global South, Volume 10, Number 1, Spring 2016, pp. 130‚Äì149. Coming from a wealthy family in colonial Lagos, Remi basically lives in a European African culture ‚Äì she lives in Africa yet everything around her has European influence. She lives in a big house with servants and is part of the Nigerian upper class for whom British culture is a dominant influence. Colonization by the British has a huge impact on Remi and her family in almost everything, including a European style of beauty. Remi compares herself to European actresses and wishes she looked like them. She wears English clothes. Early on in the novel, she makes the mistake of wearing her English clothes to the market, where she runs into girls who are not of the same class as she is and are wearing traditional African clothes. They corner her and tease and harass her for following what the Europeans do and letting them colonize her even more. It is almost disrespectful to them that she is wearing English attire ‚Äì clothes from a country that colonized theirs. Remi going to boarding-school in England is another representation of colonialism and the British influence over Africa. Her wealthy family believe that being educated in Europe is a way for Remi to better herself. Cultural references The story in Yoruba Girl Dancing of Remi Foster's eventful journey to London from Nigeria closely relates to the life of author Simi Bedford, who experienced a similar childhood. In addition to being partially autobiographical, the novel also alludes to other books, singers, and aspects of culture that proved to have an influence on the writing of Yoruba Girl Dancing. When Remi auditions for her school choir, she turns out to be an awful singer, and after the audition the teacher perplexed says: \\"I assumed you would have a beautiful voice like Paul Robeson, like all your people\\" (125). Such gross generalizations recur elsewhere in the book, as Remi struggles to achieve equality with her classmates.. One classmate, Anita, convinces the other girls that Remi's skin colour rubs off (86). Such incidents plague Remi's early life in the foreign country. Towards the end of the novel, Remi compares her life to that of Shakespeare's Othello. In the Tragedy of Othello, Desdemona‚Äôs father could not fathom why she would love a black man. When talking to her friend Phoebe, Remi notes of her teacher: \\"I‚Äôm sure he thinks I‚Äôm using some kind of voodoo to woo the language to me in the same way Brabantio accused Othello of using spells on Desdemona\\" (172). Remi realizes that she has spent her whole life trying to become an Englishwoman, just as Othello attempted to become a Venetian, before ultimately committing suicide. She concludes that she has lost sight of who she once was. At this moment, she is aware that she will never be fully accepted in English society. Despite the friendships made while studying abroad, there will always be people who stare at her and question her upbringing and race. In the book's last pages, as Remi is dancing with her friends and family, her life comes full circle. She is once again with her native culture, after experiencing the difficulties of living in a foreign country, and is completely content. The final line of the novel states: \\"Is there a sight more beautiful, the older women said, than a Yoruba girl dancing?\\" Remi's genuine happiness to be reunited with her mother, brothers, sisters, and friends shows through her exotic, cultural dancing. Historical background The story is set in 1950s' Nigeria and England. Nigeria gained its independence from Britain in early 1960. After the many years of colonization and invasion by the European nation, the country was later freed from foreign control. Although Independence marked a monumental achievement for the country, Nigeria still had prolonged foreign influence or rule. The author of the novel relates the issues of colonialism, class, and race to the main character's life and as well as their key role in Nigerian society. All these themes relate to one another and exemplify the nation's attitude in the 1950s. For example, Remi is sent to England by her parents to further her education in the belief that the opportunity to study abroad is a way to better oneself. Throughout the novel, issues such as class and race also appear, showing the struggles faced both by Remi and the Nigerian people. The atmosphere surrounding Remi parallels the nation's struggle with colonization, race, and the class system. For instance, her battle with her identity specifically highlights racial issues. As the students in her classroom mock her for her very different appearance, Remi tries to look more like everybody else. At one point, the pressures of society make her hate her African features and favour the popular European look. The novel's intriguing title, Yoruba Girl Dancing, directly signals to readers who Remi is, where she is from, and her cultural background: she is a Yoruba girl dancing in the midst of confusion as to where to belong, struggling with her identity, whether she is British or African. Represented in this novel is the rich and complex history of Nigeria interacting with foreign influences, and the many underlying issues this brings about. Reception and reviews * Publishers Weekly emphasises the racial issues that Yoruba Girl Dancing addresses: \\"...she is deposited at the upper-crust Chilcott Manor School (where the uniform tunic is 'nigger brown')... [the] family must endure the scrutiny and derision of her classmate, one of whom spreads the word that 'the black rubs off'...\\" The review concludes: \\"Bedford, a native of Nigeria who moved to Britain as a child and now lives in London, has written a wise and provocative book that might even prompt some soul-searching in the social circles she has skewered.\\"\\"Yoruba Girl Dancing\\" (review), Publishers Weekly, 28 September 1992. * Kirkus Reviews‚Ä≤ description said: \\"Funny, touching debut ....

Although, Giutna states that the book is an easy read, she posts that Yoruba Girl Dancing would not appeal to adults because of the immaturity within the characters and their relationships with one another in the story.\\"Amazon Customer Reviews: Alicia Giutna, 19 May 2002. * GoodReads: Barbara loved the book and compares it to the story Revolutionary Road.

Al-Rikabi became the Secretary of Iraqi Regional Command of the Ba'ath Party in 1954 and held the post until 1959. Throughout his term of leadership, the Iraqi Regional Branch expanded its membership and became a leading party in Iraq's political landscape. Following the 14 July Revolution of 1958 which toppled the monarchy, al-Rikabi was appointed Minister of Development in Abd al-Karim Qasim's unity government. As soon as the government was established, a power struggle quickly began between Qasim, an Iraqi nationalist who was supported by the Iraqi Communist Party, and Abdul Salam Arif, an Arab nationalist. Al- Rikabi supported the latter. Along with other cabinet members, al-Rikabi resigned in protest when Arif lost the power struggle in late 1958. Al-Rikabi and the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party came to the conclusion that the only way to expedite Iraq's entry into the United Arab Republic was to assassinate Qasim. The assassination attempt failed, and most of the leading Ba'athists and co-conspirators, including al-Rikabi, fled to Syria. Shortly after, on 29 November 1959, the Iraqi Regional Command was dissolved. Al- Rikabi supported the Nasserist faction‚Äîsupporters of Gamal Abdel Nasser‚Äîin a power struggle within the Ba'ath Party in the late 1950s against the Aflaqites, supporters of Michel Aflaq. He agreed with Abdullah Rimawi's observation that the National Command, the ruling organ of the Ba'ath Party, had deviated from Ba'athist thought. Al-Rikabi tried but failed to get the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party to break away from the National Command, and on 15 June 1961 he was expelled from the party. From then on al- Rikabi was a prominent Nasserite, active first in Rimawi's Revolutionary Ba'ath Command and then in Arif's Arab Socialist Union. Following the Ba'ath Party's seizure of power in the 17 July Revolution of 1968, al-Rikabi was arrested. He was killed by fellow inmates according to an official account, media unaffiliated to the Iraqi state claimed he was killed by the Iraqi security services. Early life and career Al-Rikabi was born into a Shia Muslim family in Nasiriyah in 1932. He attended the engineering school in Baghdad. The Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was established either in 1951 or 1952. While there is some confusion between the various sources, some historians claim Rikabi became Regional Secretary in either 1951 or 1952 and was the Iraqi Regional Branch's first head, others claim that he took the post first in 1954 (succeeding Fakhri Qadduri). The party initially consisted of a majority of Shia Muslims, as al-Rikabi recruited supporters mainly from his friends and family, but it slowly became Sunni-dominated. Between 1952 and 1963, 54 per cent of the members of the Ba'ath Regional Command were considered Shia Muslims. This majority is largely explained by al-Rikabi's effective recruitment drive in Shia areas. Between 1963 and 1970, after al-Rikabi's resignation, Shia representation in the Regional Command dropped to 14 percent. However, of the three factions which existed within the Ba'ath Party, two had Shia leaders. According to police records membership of the Iraqi Regional Branch had increased to 289 by 1955. Two years later al-Rikabi affiliated the Iraqi Regional Branch with the National Front, an opposition group that consisted of the Iraqi Communist Party, the National Democratic Party, and the Istiqlal Party. The front welcomed the 14 July Revolution of 1958, which toppled the Iraqi monarchy. Following the revolution, Iraqi Regional Branch membership increased; 300 people had joined the party, 1,200 were organized helpers, 2,000 were organized supporters, and an estimated 10,000 people were unorganized supporters according to al-Rikabi. Qasim years A cabinet headed by Abd al-Karim Qasim as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence was established shortly after the 14 July Revolution. Al-Rikabi, who represented the Ba'ath Party, was appointed Minister of Development. Shortly after the new government took control, a power struggle began between Qasim, who represented the Iraqi nationalists and the communists, and Abdul Salam Arif, who represented the interests of the Arab nationalists. Iraq had been invited to join the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union consisting of Egypt and Syria. Michel Aflaq, the principal founder of Ba'athism, the Ba'ath Party, and the UAR, visited Iraq by the end of July 1958 to try to convince Qasim's government to join the UAR. Arif lost the power struggle, and on 30 November 1958 he was forced to resign from his posts of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior. This in turn led to a clampdown on Arab nationalist activities, which included the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party. To protest Arif's forced resignation and the increased authoritarian behaviour of Qasim's government, a number of cabinet members, including al-Rikabi, resigned in protest. The failure of both Arif and the 1959 Mosul Uprising by the pro-UAR colonel Abd al-Wahab al-Shawaf led al-Rikabi and the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party to conclude that the only way to secure Arab nationalist rule was by assassinating Qasim. Following a slump in Qasim's popularity, the Iraqi Regional Branch set their assassination attempt for 7 October 1959. The attempt failed, and most of the leading Ba'athists and leading figures in the conspiracy, including al-Rikabi, escaped to Syria. The Ba'ath Party's organisation was weakened following the failed assassination attempt, and on 29 November 1959 the Regional Command was dissolved. Expulsion Rikabi with his wife on their wedding day in Egypt in 1963, sitting alongside Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser (left) During the era of the UAR, the Ba'ath Party was split into two factions; Aflaqites‚Äîthe followers of Aflaq‚Äîand Nasserists‚Äîthe followers of Gamal Abdel Nasser. In this conflict, al-Rikabi supported the Nasserist faction against the Aflaqists, who controlled the party leadership. The conflict escalated when Abdullah Rimawi, the Secretary of the Jordanian Regional Command of the Ba'ath Party, was deprived of his party posts and established the Revolutionary Ba'ath Command, which opposed the influence of the Aflaqites. Al-Rikabi openly confronted the National Command, the leading organ of the Ba'ath Party, in June 1959. On 24 June he held a press conference in Beirut where he stated that the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party had broken its relations with the National Command. The reason he gave was that the National Command was led by deviationists. He cited as proof the dissolution of the UAR, the National Command's collaboration with anti-Arab nationalist groups such as the communists, and the expulsion of members who held national revolutionary views. Al-Rikabi also believed that the National Command had lost faith in its Ba'athist beliefs, while the Iraqi Regional Branch needed it the most. The Iraqi Regional Branch was involved in the Mosul uprising of 1959. The National Command replied to these accusations by declaring that al- Rikabi was unqualified to speak for the party, and furthermore that he had lost his right to speak on the behalf of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party when the Iraqi Regional Command was dissolved on 29 November 1959. The reconstituted Iraqi Regional Command passed a resolution on 2 February 1962 which expelled al-Rikabi from the organisation and appointed Talib Hussein ash-Shabibi as Secretary General. Attacks on al-Rikabi continued, and the Iraqi Regional Congress in July 1960 called the National Command to initiate an investigation against him. At the fourth national conference in Beirut, the National Command passed a resolution stating that al-Rikabi had henceforth no responsibilities in Ba'ath Party affairs. On 14 October 1960 the Ba'ath Party ordered al-Rikabi to reply to the accusations leveled against him by the Iraqi Regional Congress. Al-Rikabi was expelled from the Ba'ath Party on 15 June 1961 for his failure to reply to the accusations leveled against him, his support for the Revolutionary Ba'ath Command, and his distribution of anti-National Command thoughts not through the proper party organs. Shortly after al-Rikabi's first confrontation with the National Command, Rimawi published a statement on behalf of the Revolutionary Ba'ath Command that he supported al-Rikabi in his struggle against the National Command. Following the dissolution of the UAR in 1962, the Voice of the Arabs (Radio Cairo), referring to al-Rikabi as \\"[Secretary General] SG of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party of Iraq\\", announced that they opposed the UAR's break-up. Al-Rikabi was reported to be a member of the Revolutionary Ba'ath Command early in 1962. Nasserist years Rikabi (last from right) with Iraqi President Abdul Salam Arif (second from right), 1960s Together with Rimawi and other Palestinian defectors from the Syrian Regional Branch, al-Rikabi formed the Socialist Unionists Movement, a Nasserist political movement. Al-Rikabi became Minister of Rural Affairs under President Abdul Salam Arif (who overthrew Qasim in 1963) until he resigned in 1965. Arrest and death He was arrested in 1971 and was subsequently killed in prison by the Iraqi security service. The official explanation of his death was that he was killed by fellow inmates. The free Arab press, however, blamed the Iraqi government for it.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Jack King. The short was released on December 12, 1934, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Summary The film opens to Buddy, who, ambling through a Mexican town, strums a guitar and sings \\"Monterey\\" (to the tune of \\"Madrid\\"). He walks off of a balcony and falls on the myriad hats worn by a hat salesman, trapping him therein. A swift kick in the pants from Buddy, and the salesman is on his way. Buddy attempts to enter the sleepy Cantina El Moocher, but is physically rebuffed by the enormity of snores within, and compelled instead to enter through an open window. Everywhere men sleep, even at a checkers table, where jumping beans play for them. Buddy slips one of the lively beans into the mouth of a man at the bar's piano, and he begins to play with his toes. The people are roused by this, and begin happily dancing and drinking; a makeshift mariachi band plays in tune. Buddy is apparently able to play his guitar with his teeth; his guitar can also play itself; Buddy also can play while his feet hang in the air. Enter the outlaw Pancho, (a dead ringer for \\"Viva Villa\\" star Wallace Beery) who does some fancy gunwork to frighten the townsfolk. After tying his horse's tail to a hole in a stake (licking the hair in place much like threading a needle), the villain steps into the saloon and starts firing. The patrons (except Buddy) scatter and shout \\"Pancho!\\" \\"Pancho!\\" \\"Pancho!\\" Then, appearing from an unfolding Murphy bed, the four Marx brothers shout: \\"Zeppo!\\" \\"Harpo!\\" \\"Chico!\\" \\"Groucho!\\". But Pancho makes a mistake in shooting and destroying Buddy's banana. Our indignant hero boldly squeezes the remainder of the fruit in his adversary's face. Pancho puts one of his guns to Buddy's head, but declares that he likes the little fellow, and commands him to play the piano (into which he has been backed.) Cookie, heretofore absent, begins to dance to Buddy's tune, \\"Famabella\\". Pancho proves himself a dancer as well, to the anger of an upstaged Cookie, and requests a kiss from her. Of course, the scoundrel winds up with his backside through the canteen door, and back again into the canteen by the fury of a cranky goat. Pancho again makes an advance on Cookie, and an annoyed Buddy fires a serving fork at Pancho's behind by means of a cello. \\"I kill you to little pieces!\\" shouts Pancho. But both of the dastard's pistols are blocked by a two-pronged candelabra thrown, with marvellous accuracy, by Buddy. Pancho shows his whip, and with it snags Buddy from across the room; Buddy punches his captor in vain. Eventually, Our Hero grabs a ceiling fixture that spins both competitors round and round, flinging them finally into an easily breaking counter. The cartoon concludes on a friendly note; in the fashion of Beery's character Butch from The Big House (1930 film) Pancho takes Buddy by the shoulder and announces that he was \\"only fooling.\\" The competitors heartily laugh together. Cookie's appearance In those Buddy shorts supervised by Jack King, Cookie generally has blond, braided hair; it is odd, then, that this cartoon should feature Buddy's sweetheart with her more traditional black hair. The Marx Brothers This marks the only appearance of the Marx Brothers in a Buddy cartoon: notably, it features Zeppo, who by this time had already played a part in his final film with his brothers, Duck Soup. Uniqueness of the title This is the only Looney Tune starring Buddy whose title does not begin with some form of the main character's name. Dating discrepancy Sources differ on the release date of this short and of the order of its release.

Early life Lee Wulff was born on February 10, 1905 in Valdez, District of Alaska to parents Charles and Lilly Wulff of Brooklyn and Staten Island, New York respectively. Charles Wulff left Brooklyn around 1900 to seek gold in Alaska but soon became dependent on other work and settled in Valdez. In Valdez, Lee's father was a deputy sheriff and newspaper publisher in the small frontier town. Lee's mother was a Norwegian immigrant from Staten Island who eventually traveled to Valdez to marry Charles. They had three children, Henry (Lee), Audrey and Lillian. Lee learned to fish at an early age in the rivers and saltwater surrounding Valdez. By age 10 he was learning how to fly fish with lancewood/greenheart rods and silk fly lines and leaders. During the Winter of 1915-16, Charles Wulff moved the family back to Brooklyn to assume management of his deceased grandfather's coal business. Lee Wulff disliked the big city of Brooklyn and longed for the outdoors of Valdez. However he did well in Brooklyn public schools achieving honor student status. In 1920, Charles Wulff sold his interest in the Brooklyn coal company and moved the family to San Diego, California. Lee quickly adapted to the local saltwater fishing in the San Diego region and routinely fished for sea bass, corvina and yellowtail in the kelp beds along the Pacific Ocean beaches with his high school friends. He graduated from San Diego High School on January 27, 1922 at the age of 18. He attended two years at San Diego State College before transferring to Stanford University to study engineering. At San Diego State he played varsity and lettered in football, basketball and track. He graduated from Stanford on June 21, 1926 with a degree in engineering. Despite having a degree in engineering, Lee Wulff did not want to be an engineer and with the reluctant support of his father, he decided to pursue a career as an artist. Paris In the summer of 1926, at the age of 21, Lee Wulff traveled to Paris, France to study art. He eventually enrolled in the Acad√©mie Delecluse in Montparnasse. Wulff enjoyed art school and got promising reviews on his work from two exhibitions in July and September 1927. While in Paris, he met another American art student, Helen Riha. Helen was a graduate of the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts and from Schenectady, New York. Helen would become Lee's first wife. Despite pressure from his father to pursue engineering work, on September 13, 1927, Lee Wulff left Paris to return to New York and start a career as an artist. New York Lee Wulff arrived in New York on September 25, 1927 and found lodgings in Greenwich Village where most young artists lived at the time. With only $100 in his pocket, he began seeking employment as an artist. Sustained with a few part-time jobs through the winter of 1927, he finally obtained regular employment with an advertising agency in January 1928 at a salary of $50 per week. Lee found time from his work to fish the Esopus and Beaverkill rivers in the Catskills. He began to tie flies, meet and discuss fly fishing with other New York anglers, one of which was Dan Bailey who became a celebrated fly angler in Montana. In the Spring of 1928 he was reunited with Helen Riha who had been working in New York for over a year. They both liked fly fishing and spent a lot of time together in the Catskills. In the Fall of 1928 they became engaged and were married in Greenwich, Connecticut on June 1, 1929. The Wulffs quit their New York jobs to embark on a three-month honeymoon by car through the Southwest to San Diego to see Lee's parents returning to New York via the northern Rockies and Midwest. They returned to New York in late September 1929 both unemployed. Although they both found jobs, the stock market crash on October 29, 1929 led to cuts in pay. Early in 1930, the couple moved to Louisville, Kentucky to work for an advertising agency there. By August 1930 they had returned to New York, Lee being very disappointed with both the job and the fishing in Kentucky. The early 1930s found Lee and Helen fishing more and working less, but sustaining themselves with free-lance work. Lee was making acquaintances with future notables in the fly angling and outdoor business world-John McDonald, Fortune Magazine writer and author of Quill Gordon, illustrators Mead Schaeffer and John Atherton and artist Norman Rockwell. He was writing a few articles, teaching fly tying and giving talks on fly fishing to various clubs gradually becoming respected as an authority on the subject. Learning about salmon In 1933 Lee and Helen made a trip to the Margaree River in Nova Scotia where he landed his first fly caught Atlantic salmon on a bi-visible dry fly. Taking fly fishing to the general public, he created a sustainable business. Two key ideas helped him make fly fishing into a profitable business. In 1939, Lee Wulff released the book, Handbook of Freshwater Fishing, where he maps out the principals of catch and release fishing. The way he puts catch and release is that there will be more fish in the rivers, so you can come back again and again and catch fish. Also he says that the fish get smarter making them harder to catch and making the fisherman have to be more accurate with his casts. Lee Wulff is considered the premier proponent of catch and release fishing. The second part of the business model is setting up organizations such as Trout Unlimited and other like it to protect the habitatsWulff, Lee. \\"The Bright Future of Trout Fishing.\\" A Gamefish Too Valuable. 1978. 261-70. Print. that the trout live in and making the beautiful places where fishermen fish stay beautiful. Newfoundland Lee Wulff's first visit to Newfoundland came in 1935 when he fished for salmon on the Grand Codroy River northeast of Channel-Port aux Basques. In 1946 he established fishing camps at River of Ponds and Portland Creek with the idea of sharing clients with Ella Manuel at Killdevil Lodge near Lomond (where her sons, Antony Berger and Jonathan Berger, spent their summers). Lee Wulff and Ella Manuel were married in Corner Brook in 1947, shortly after he obtained his pilot's license. He sold his camps in 1954. Lee Wulff is credited with being one of the first people to suggest the establishment of what eventually became Gros Morne National Park. Joan Wulff Although previously acquainted through some sportsman shows, in 1966, Lee worked with Joan Salvato Cummings on an ABC's The American Sportsman television film on Blue Fin Tuna fishing in Newfoundland. Joan was a world class fly casting champion and avid fly angler. Later that year they worked together on another American Sportsman episode on bass fishing in Florida. Despite Lee's three divorces and Joan's previous marriage, Lee and Joan were married in 1967. They settled with Joan's two boys, Douglas and Stuart, in Keene, New Hampshire. Wulff School of Fishing Lee and Joan Wulff moved their home from New Hampshire to Lew Beach, New York on the Beaverkill river in 1978. The couple set up the Wulff School of Fly Fishing in 1979 on the Beaverkill River in New York. According to the school's website, Joan explained the couple's reason for open the school. \\"Lee's and my dream to share, with willing enthusiasts, the skills and lore of our wonderful sport. Lee will be with you through his words, films, and philosophy.\\" Wulff series of flies Royal Wulff dry fly In 1930, Lee Wulff designed three innovative dry flies to fish with on the Esopus and other Catskill rivers. He called the flies the Ausable Gray, Coffin May and Bucktail Coachman. They were high floating, full bodied flies with hair wings and tails. They proved exceptionally effective for trout and salmon in fast rivers. At the time, he was fishing regularly with Dan Bailey, a science teacher at Brooklyn Polytechnic. Both men were tying and selling flies in their spare time to supplement their incomes. Wulff considered the traditional English and Catskill style dry flies that were the staple of the fly trade were far too skinny and \\"anemic\\" to be effective for American trout thus he created this stocky, robust style of fly. Angling author Joseph D. Bates Jr. in his seminal work on Atlantic Salmon Flies and Fishing (1970) credits Wulff with \\"establishing a distinct American style of dry fly.\\" He collaborated with Dan Bailey during the development of the patterns and Bailey encouraged him to rename the flies. The original Ausable Gray, Coffin May and Bucktail Coachman became the Grey Wulff, White Wulff and Royal Wulff. Three additional patterns were created by the end of 1930, the Blonde Wulff, Brown Wulff and Black Wulff. The series would gain prominence after Wulff introduced them to Ray Bergman, another fly angler and outdoor writer who became the Fishing editor for Outdoor Life magazine. Bergman embraced the flies and included them his two editions of Trout (1938, 1952). Wulff considered the pattern somewhat generic and encouraged variation and evolution of the pattern instead of rigid adherence to a precise recipe. Dan Bailey, who fished regularly in Montana and eventually established a fly shop and mail order business in Livingston, Montana in 1938 promoted the series extensively to western fly anglers. The Wulff flies, especially the Royal Wulff, are still a staple in angler's fly boxes around the world. Angler and writer John Gierach believes the Royal Wulff is one of the most popular dry patterns over the last half century. Death Lee Wulff died on April 28, 1991 near Hancock, New York when the Piper Super Cub he was piloting crashed into trees at the end of the runway during a landing. He was on a check-ride with his flight instructor Max Francisco. Wulff was dead at the crash site. Francisco survived the crash but with very serious injuries. About 30 minutes after the crash, Francisco was located and helicoptered to a nearby hospital. He recovered to fly again. Francisco related that he believed Wulff, a pilot with 44 years experience, lost control of the plane because of an acute medical situation and was possibly dead at the controls when the plane crashed. Obituaries in The New York Times, The Guardian and other major newspapers leveled nothing but praise on Lee Wulff and his life and career. Shortly after Wulff's death Charles Kuralt, then host of the CBS television show Sunday Morning publicly commented: \\"Lee Wulff was to fly fishing what Einstein was to physics\\". Nelson Bryant, Longtime outdoor editor, often called the dean of outdoor writers, of the New York Times wrote of Wulff: Outdoor writer and humorist Ed Zern wrote this in his tribute to Lee Wulff during a memorial at the New York Angler's Club on June 25, 1991.

The town was founded in 1880 as a mining town, following the discovery of gold and silver in the nearby Cerrillos Hills. It was later abandoned sometime in the early 1900s. Later in the twentieth century, The Bonanza Creek Movie Ranch, which contains a movie set depicting a late 19th century mining town, was built near the ruins of Bonanza City. Kid Nation, a 2007 television series taking place in a fictionalized version of Bonanza City, was filmed on the movie ranch. Background Miners in the Cerrillos Hills. The Cerrillos Hills are a grouping of hills in modern-day New Mexico containing deposits of valuable resources including silver, gold, lead, copper, and turquoise.Julyan 2006, p. 102.Disbrow & Stoll, p. 52. The Pueblo have mined for turquoise in the hills as early as the 900s AD. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the colonizing Spanish used Pueblo slave labor to mine turquoise, as well as lead and silver. In 1680, the Pueblo revolted against the Spanish and temporarily drove them from Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico (modern-day New Mexico); with the exception of a few sporadic mining operations, wide-scale mining would not occur again until the late 1800s. Ownership of the Cerrillos Hills region passed to Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence and then to the United States in 1848 following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In May 1879, the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant began selling land in New Mexico, including the Cerrillos Hills region, to the American public. Later that year, two miners from Colorado discovered gold and silver deposits within the Cerrillos Hills, which lead to a mining boom and the establishment of numerous mining towns around the Cerrillos Hills. In September 1879, the Los Cerrillos Mining District was established to regulate mining claims within the region.Hayward, p. 9. By the end of 1880, at least 500 mining shafts had been opened within the district.Hayward, p. 6. Original town A possible photograph of Bonanza City during the early 1880s Bonanza City was founded in 1880 by John Mahoney, the former US consul to Algiers. Bonanza is Spanish for \\"prosperity\\" or \\"rich ore pocket\\";Julyan 1996, p. 45. Bonanza City was one of the many mining towns founded after the discovery of valuable minerals in the Los Cerrillos hills.Hayward, p.5. By July 1881, the town contained a store, post office, hotel, and smelter; Bonanza City also had a church and priest at some point in the early 1880s. The town however lacked important amenities such as a barbershop, shoemaker, and a general merchandise store. Bonanza City had a population of up to 2,000 people, presumably at some point from 1880 to 1883. In 1883, the Bonanza City post office closed, while the smelter was transported to Albuquerque after Bonanza failed to provide enough ore.Greene, p. 126. The population of Bonanza City dropped to 200 by 1884, although some demand for miners existed for another year or so. The town went into further decline following 1885 and was largely abandoned by 1890.Secord & Milford, p. 25. Bonanza City experienced a temporary revival in the early 1900s after the construction of a small smelter, but was ultimately completely abandoned at some point in the early 20th century. Today, all that remains of the original town are building foundations and the ruins of the smelter. Use as a filming location The Bonanza Creek Movie Ranch is located near the ruins of Bonanza City. The Hughes family obtained the ranch during the 1940s.Seymore, Jami (8 May 2019), Santa Fe‚Äôs Bonanza Creek Ranch Movie Sets Catching the Eye of Netflix. KRQE. Retrieved 2 January 2020. Archived from the original 2 January 2020. The family has used the ranch as a filming location since the early 1950s, when scenes from The Man from Laramie were filmed there. Dozens of films, including Silverado, The Legend of the Lone Ranger, and A Million Ways to Die in the West, have since been filmed in part or entirely on the ranch. The 2007 television show Kid Nation, which aired for one season on CBS, was also filmed on the ranch. The series tasked forty children, ranging in age from 8 to 15, with revitalizing a fictionalized version of Bonanza City and correcting the supposed mistakes of the city's original residents.Cianci, pp.366-367. The show proved controversial and faced claims of child exploitation.Cianci, p. 365. The earliest films produced on the ranch either took place outdoors or used facades. Starting in the 1980s, a permanent movie set was constructed on the ranch by the Hughes family and various production companies. The set consists of complete, free standing buildings that are supplied with water and electricity. Notes References Bibliography  Greene, Chas. W. (1883). \\"Progress of Mining Industry\\".

It is a single-storey limestone building and forms part of the historic Arthur Head Reserve precinct. History The building was constructed in 1884 by Harwood & Son as a dangerous-goods store, for the storage of kerosene. At the time, kerosene was used extensively for street lighting and heating. It is a single- storey limestone building with a hipped iron roof. In 1919 it was used by the state government's Harbour and Light Department as a warehouse and later as a shipwright's shed. In 1972, the building was saved from demolition and restored as a space for the creative arts. In 1975 it was used by local artist and potter Joan Campbell MBE as a pottery studio and gallery until her death in 1997. The site and building were vested in the City of Fremantle in 1982 and restored as part of the Commonwealth-funded Arthur Head Bicentennial Project in 1986‚Äì87. Heritage value The Old Kerosene Store is classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA) with the following statement of significance: \\"A good example of an early colonial building and one of the few remaining buildings of its type in WA. Along with the Round House and the Government Stores, the buildings form an interesting group.\\" The building was given an interim listing on the State Register of Heritage Places by the Heritage Council of Western Australia on 20 November 1992. It is also listed on the City of Fremantle's Municipal Heritage List. Bathers Beach location ‚Äì taken from the north ‚Äì the building in mid-left, fishing boat harbour behind Current use In 1998 it was leased by the artist Joanna Robertson, founder of the Kidogo Art Institute, who established a popular, multidisciplinary independent art centre there. In 1998 the building was renamed the Kidogo Arthouse. Kidogo is Swahili for \\"small\\". In 2010 the City of Fremantle received a Lotterywest grant to undertake conservation and interpretation works at the Old Port precinct, including the former Kerosene Store, prior to the 2011 ISAF Sailing World Championships. During the event, as a result of temporary relaxations to the liquor licensing laws, the Kidogo Arthouse housed a small bar, the Kelp Bar. Kelp Bar Since the success of the Kelp Bar during the ISAF Championships the operator of Kidogo Joanna Robertson has been endeavouring to have the bar operating as a permanent fixture of the gallery. One of the major issues in obtaining a license for the premises has been the inclusion of ablution facilities, as of November 2013 the City of Fremantle still declined permission to apply for the installation of toilets facilities within the heritage building, on 13 December 2013 the City of Fremantle granted permission for an occasional liquor license without the requirement for permanent toilets. Kelp Bar re-opened on 20 December 2013 and will operate on weekends through January 2014.

She was introduced in Razor #1 in October 1992, by writer/creator Everette Hartsoe. Fictional character biography Initially a victim of both of her father and her sister's deaths, the young Nicole Mitchell vowed to clean up the scum of Chinatown by herself as the superheroine Razor, named for the blades she wears on her arms, which evidently brings her into the eye of Roman Van Drake, the man who destroyed her family. In a twist of fate, it is revealed that not only is Nicole's sister, in fact, alive, but also she is Drake's favorite assassin, Stryke. In a play of power, Drake sends Stryke after Razor, who in the following battle comes to the conclusion that Razor is her sister. Angered at Drake's treachery, Stryke kills him, hoping to reconnect with her sister. But when Nicole shuns her like a stranger, Stryke kills her out of anger. Eventually resurrected by her descendant Poizon, Razor is called upon once again to battle with the newly resurrected Drake, alongside her sister Stryke, and Poizon, herself. In a four-issue series, published from April to September 1998, Razor teamed with James O'Barr's Eric Draven character from The Crow in The Crow/Razor: Kill the Pain. In October 1998, a #0 issue followed. In January 1999, a magazine titled The Crow/Razor: Nocturnal Masque, featuring artwork of both characters and quotes attributed to each was released. In February 1999, two additional issues titled, The Crow/Razor: Kill the Pain: Finale and The Crow/Razor: The Lost Chapter were published. Powers and abilities Prior to her death, Razor was shown as a capable martial artist and gymnast who usually carried a pair of bladed wrist gauntlets. After death, the blades were surgically inserted into Razor's arms and painfully extend from her flesh. Creation and reception Hartsoe first published Razor after founding London Night Studios with $1200 that he received in an income tax refund. With the book's violent content and \\"pin-up friendly\\" artistic style, Razor is often considered part of the \\"bad girl\\" genre that rose in popularity during the early-mid-1990s. Razor Annual #1, published in 1993, contained the first appearance of Shi. Writer-artist Eric Powell's first paid job in comics was drawing three issues of Razor. The series also featured early artwork by Georges Jeanty. She had a Swimsuit Special in 1995 (a pin-up edition with various artists including Mike Wolfer) Film adaptation It was announced in 2009 that Arclight Films and Jeff Most Prods. ‚Äì the production company behind The Crow ‚Äì have partnered to produce a live-action film based on the Razor series, with Jeff Most and Gary Hamilton producing. The adaptation, for which filming was planned to begin in Australia in 2010, was reported to have a $15 million budget. During the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, it was announced that Rob Cohen will write and direct the film. The film will feature Emma Dumont as the lead character.

He is credited as being the inventor of the month-going regulator of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, Germany, made about 1786. Biography Despite the poor living conditions of his parents, the young Johann Andreas was able to achieve an extraordinary level of education. Being an extremely talented man, very clever and really useful for anything, he joined the watchmaking industry as an apprentice to his father after he left school. In 1785 he married Friederica Eleonora Diedrich and had three sons, Karl Friedrich Felix Klindworth, who continued his work as a clockmaker, Carl August Klindworth, builder of mathematical, physical and optical instruments, Georg Klindworth, one of the most influential secret diplomats of his time, and daughter Johanna Dorothea Caroline Klindworth. He attended Georg Christoph Lichtenberg's lectures on physics and on his persuasion, moved on from the watchmaking mechanics to the large electrophorus, which was evidently Klindworth's work by judging from Lichtenberg's letters.In contemporary literature they are always mentioned - Lichtenberg, the inventor, Klindworth, the builder. They almost merge into each other. Klindworth, titular mechanic of the Duke of Gotha, who had been working for Lichtenberg since 1776. He then became his assistant at his experimental lectures until 1791 when he was substituted by Johann Hermann Seyde.

These essays were previously published in The Atlantic, City Journal, Foreign Affairs, The Guardian, Newsweek, New Statesman, The New York Times Book Review, Slate, Times Literary Supplement, The Wall Street Journal, The Weekly Standard, The Wilson Quarterly, and Vanity Fair. Arguably also includes introductions that Hitchens wrote for new editions of several classic texts, such as Animal Farm and Our Man in Havana. Critics' reviews of the collection were largely positive. Reception In a highly positive review, Fred Inglis of The Independent called Hitchens a \\"prose master\\" and lauded the author's skill as a polemicist, writing that various figures are \\"lined up, arraigned, swiftly appraised and, with a perfect and merciless justice, judged and sentenced.\\" Inglis also praised the essays of literary criticism as \\"very well written, so funny and fluent, so loving and so pungent.\\" In Kirkus Reviews it was written, \\"Sometimes his pieces concern passing matters, though they are seldom ephemeral themselves [...] Vintage Hitchens. Argumentative and sometimes just barely civil‚Äîanother worthy collection from this most inquiring of inquirers.\\" Charles Foran of The Globe and Mail lauded Arguably as \\"750 pages of bright, witty, nearly always charged reportage and argument\\", and wrote that the work \\"lays the foundation for Hitchens's enduring relevance as an essayist and commentator.\\" Bill Keller of The New York Times called Hitchens \\"our intellectual omnivore, exhilarating and infuriating, if not in equal parts at least with equal wit\\", describing his range as \\"extraordinary, both in breadth and in altitude.\\" Nicholas Shakespeare of The Daily Telegraph praised the book as \\"tremendous\\" and wrote, \\"I can‚Äôt think of anyone who brings to such a diverse range of subjects Hitchens‚Äôs mobilising wit, intelligence and passion.\\" In the New Statesman, John Gray criticized Hitchens's views on 21st century terrorism and said the author sometimes \\"blanks out reality when it fails to accord with his faith\\", but nonetheless referred to Arguably as \\"the testament of a prodigiously gifted mind\\" and lauded him as \\"one of the greatest living writers of English prose\\", especially praising the essay \\"The Vietnam Syndrome\\". In a mixed review for The Observer, Finton O'Toole called Hitchens a \\"supremely evocative reporter\\" and \\"the most readable journalist of his time\\", but accused the journalist of \\"huge but unargued claims\\" and warned, \\"There are many sad moments when thought has withered into vacuity or bombast, moments in which we can see what Hitchens might have become ‚Äì just another purveyor of American super-patriotic orthodoxies.\\" O'Toole concluded that Hitchens \\"emerges here [...] as a great journalist fallen, for a while, among neocons.\\" In 2016, James Ley of The Sydney Morning Herald listed Arguably among the collections from Hitchens that \\"[represent] the best of his work as a journalist, literary critic and cultural commentator.\\" Awards and honors * 2011 New York Times Best Books of the Year * 2012 PEN/Diamonstein- Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay, winner Books reviewed * Moral Minority: Our Skeptical Founding Fathers, by Brooke Allen * Jefferson's Secrets: Death and Desire at Monticello, by Andrew Burstein * Power, Faith and Fantasy: America in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present, by Michael Oren * Benjamin Franklin Unmasked, by Jerry Weinberger * John Brown, Abolitionist, by David S.

In 2010, DARPA initiated a program under the same name (Cyber Insider Threat (CINDER) Program) to develop novel approaches to the detection of activities within military-interest networks that are consistent with the activities of cyber espionage. The CINDER threat is unlike other vulnerability based attacks in that the action taken by the initiator is not based on unauthorized access by unauthorized objects or authorized objects, it is based on the concept that authorized access by authorized objects will normally occur (along with their subsequent actions) within the security boundary. This object action will not be viewed as an attack, but normal use when analyzed by standard IDS-IPS, logging and expert systems. The CINDER Mission will be seen as an unauthorized disclosure once data exfiltration has been realized. At that time, the resultant CINDER Case would change all object actions related to the disclosure from \\"Authorized Use by an Authorized Object\\" to \\"Unauthorized Use by an Authorized Object\\". Note: For the initial CINDER case, the controlling agent will still be seen as an Authorized Object based on the fact that the security system has passed an evaluation for Assurance and Functionality. The Cyber Insider Threat has continued to be a known issue since the mid-1980s. The following NIST material dated March 1994, \\"Internal Threats\\", shows how it was defined in its infancy. > \\"System controls are not well matched to the average organization's security > policy. As a direct result, the typical user is permitted to circumvent that > policy on a frequent basis. The administrator is unable to enforce the > policy because of the weak access controls, and cannot detect the violation > of policy because of weak audit mechanisms. Even if the audit mechanisms are > in place, the daunting volume of data produced makes it unlikely that the > administrator will detect policy violations. Ongoing research in integrity > and intrusion detection promise to fill some of this gap. Until these > research projects become available as products, systems will remain > vulnerable to internal threats.\\" CINDER behaviors and methods CINDER prerequisites There are many prerequisite dimensions to CINDER activity, but one primary dimension must always be met. That is one of System Ownership. Prerequisite principles of system ownership and information dominance within the area of object action must be part of any CINDER mission. CINDER system ownership and object action In CINDER action, each mission dimension and each resulting case issue can be distilled down to one entity, one agent. and one action. At the specific time an agent completes an action, that entity, agent and action owns the environment they are transiting or using. And if they are successful in committing that specific transaction and are not interrupted or at least measured or monitored by the owner, that entity will have, if for only a moment in time, dominance and ownership over that object. CINDER detection methods Methods for detecting past CINDER actions To detect past CINDER activity when an exposure has been realized, one must reconcile all object actions (any exchange or transaction between two agents that can be measured or logged) and analyze the result. Methods for detecting current and future CINDER actions Present concepts of how one detects current or future CINDER activity has followed the same path as detecting past CINDER activity: A reconciliation of all data from all object action, then the application of heuristics, expert system logic and mining models to the data aggregated. But building automated logic and analysis models have proved difficult since once again, the insider does not attack they use (authorized access by authorized objects). Breaking this \\"use\\" and \\"how they use\\" out in a system that has low assurance and a low percentage of reconciliation will always cause the system to produce far too many false positives for the method to be acceptable as a true CINDER security solution. One main tenet of CINDER detection has become that only a system that has high assurance and high reconciliation can be controlled (Owned) to the extent that current and future CINDER actions can be identified, monitored or terminated. Ongoing projects to detect CINDER action Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA DARPA has an ongoing Cyber Insider Threat or CINDER program to detect insider threats to computer systems. It is under DARPA's Strategic Technology Office (STO). The project was timed to begin around 2010/2011. In comparison with traditional computer security, CINDER assumes that malicious insiders already have access to the internal network; thus it attempts to detect a threat's \\"mission\\" through analysis of behavior rather than seeking to keep a threat out. The government documentation uses an analogy of the \\"tell\\" idea from the card game of poker. According to Ackerman in Wired, the impetus for the program came after WikiLeaks disclosures such as the Afghan War documents leak. Robert Gates' philosophy of information in the military was to emphasize the access for frontline soldiers. In the face of mass-leaking, the CINDER type of response allows the military to continue that philosophy, rather than simply cutting off access to information en masse. The project was started by Peiter Zatko, a former member of the L0pht and cDc who left DARPA in 2013.

Scientist Benjamin Libet was the first to study it, discovering that brain activity predicts the action before one even has conscious awareness of his or her intention to act upon that action. Daniel Wegner later defined the three criteria of self-agency: priority, exclusivity, and consistency. According to Wegner, priority means that an action must be planned before the action is initiated. The interval between the action and the effect is known as the intentional binding. Another criterion for self- agency is exclusivity, which means the effect is due to the person's action and not because of other potential causes for the effect. The last criterion Wegner suggested was consistency. Consistency means that one's planned action must occur as planned. Internal motor cues are also an indicator in deciding whether an action occurred through self-agency, and can be measured by the generation of movement. If the predicted sensory state matches the actual sensory state, then self-agency has likely occurred. No models that predict agency have ever been proved.  Self-Agency as inference under uncertainty  Fritz Heider and Mary-Ann Simmel (1944) conducted seminal work on the perception of external causal events. Work on attribution of agency to oneself, however, began with Benjamin Libet's demonstration that brain activity predictive of action precedes conscious awareness of the intention to act (Libet, Gleason, Wright and Pearl 1983; Libet 1985). Since this demonstration psychologists have been trying to determine the relationship between the sense of agency, also known as the phenomenal will, and actual self-agency. Daniel Wegner‚Äôs book The Illusion of Conscious Will (Illusion of control; 2002; see also Wegner 2003 and 2004) posits the phenomenal will as the illusory product of post hoc inference. Sense of agency, on this view, is a product of fallible post hoc inference rather than infallible direct access to one's conscious force of will. The attribution of self-agency is made most strongly when the following three conditions are met: priority, exclusivity, and consistency. Thus, one's action must be the exclusive potential cause of the event (exclusivity), one must have had prior thoughts or plans about the action before it occurred (priority), and the action the occurred must match the action that was planned (consistency). An inference of self-agency is thus made under at least three parameters of uncertainty.  Uncertainty in Wegner‚Äôs three conditions: postdictive accounts of agency  Most studies of self-attribution of agency can be categorized as examining one or more of Wegner's three conditions of priority, exclusivity, and consistency. By manipulating these three parameters in systematic ways, researchers have shed light on the role that each plays in self-attributions of agency.  Priority  Wegner suggests that temporal order is critical to attributions of self- agency; the agent must have planned or thought about the event/action before it occurred it in order to feel that he has willed it. This is a natural extension of the commonsense notion that a cause cannot occur after its effect. However, a range of findings have shown that, beyond the basic requirement of cause preceding effect, the specifics of the timing are important. Moreover, judgments of timing (and thus priority) can be influenced by variation of other parameters, chiefly Wegner's consistency condition. The experience of causing an event alters the subjective experience of their timing. For instance, actions are perceived as temporally shifted towards their effects when they are performed volitionally, but not when involuntarily evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (Haggard, Clark, and Kalogeras 2002). This distortion of the perceived interval between movement and effect is known as intentional binding and is considered an implicit measure of the sense of agency. Moore, Wegner, and Haggard (2009) show that supraliminal priming affects intentional binding. This effect contains an inferential ‚Äò‚Äòpostdictive‚Äù component, because the effect shifts the perceived time of action, even when the probability of the effect's occurrence is low (Moore and Haggard, 2008). Gentsch and Sch√ºtz-Bosbach (2011) find top‚Äìdown modulation of visual event-related potentials (ERPs) by both self agency and priming of self-agency, suggesting that both efferent information and prior thoughts about action consequence inform the sense of agency. Furthermore, Engbert et al. (2008) showed that intentional binding occurred only when the movement of the response lever was actively generated by the subject; passive movements (initiated by the response lever) did not result in intentional binding. They take these results to suggest that efferent motor commands, rather than just priority and consistency (see below), is key to self-agency attributions. Intentional binding may not be exclusive to self-agency, however; Strother, House, and Sukhvinder (2010) found intentional binding in a shared action situation where other agents with similar goals and actions were present.  Exclusivity Wegner's exclusivity condition posits that attribution of self- agency occurs most strongly in the absence of other potential causes. The presence of other potential causes in temporal and spatial proximity to the event will, all else being equal, result in a diminished sense of self-agency. Dijksterhuis and colleagues (2008) found that nonconscious priming with first- person singular pronouns increased feelings of self-agency, while nonconscious priming with other potential causes (computer, God) decreased feelings of self-agency. Hindriks et al. (2011) have proposed a computational Bayesian inference model of self-attribution of agency that deals mainly with the exclusivity dimension. (For another Bayesian approach to agency and control, see Huys and Dayan, 2009.)  Consistency Wegner argues that the event must match the planned action; attribution will be low if the outcome does not match the perceived cause. Wegner and Wheatley (1999) demonstrated that priming participants with thoughts relevant to a movement just before it was made by another person caused participants to feel they had caused the action themselves. Ebert and Wegner (2010) also showed that manipulating consistency enhanced both judgments of self-authorship and temporal binding between cause and effect (see also Haggard, Clark and Kalogeras, 2002; Moore, Wegner and Haggard, 2009). Other studies have shown that consistency between prior thought and subsequent action can produce a sense of vicarious agency for another person's actions (Wegner, Sparrow and Winerman, 2004), increase self- agency attributions for one's own actions (Pronin, Wegner, McCarthy and Rodriguez, 2006), and even produce changes in self-attribution when the prior thought is unconscious (Aarts, Custers and Wegner, 2005) or the result of nonconscious priming (Aarts, Custers and Marien, 2009).  Internal motor cues: predictive accounts of agency  Wegner's account is a leading example of a postdictive or inferential account of the attribution of self-agency. On this type of view, the feeling of self-agency emerges entirely from post hoc inference and does not track or emerge from anything directly related to the actual causation of the action. Computational models of motor control, by contrast, hypothesize that the sense of agency for a given action arises most directly from internal motor representations associated with generating the movement. An internal forward model based on efference copy, for example, can predict the sensory consequences of a motor command and compare them with the actual sensory state after that action has been initiated (Blakemore, Wolpert and Frith, 2000, 2002; Haggard, 2005). If the actual sensory state matches the predicted one, self-agency is (likely to be) inferred. Indeed, the intentional binding effect (described above) may depend on the motor efference command; Engbert, Wohlschl√§ger and Haggard (2008) provide data suggesting that compression of estimated intervals between action and effect occurs only for volitional actions initiated by the self and not for passive actions or for actions performed by others. These authors maintain an efferent motor command is necessary for a sense of agency. Indeed, omitting the effect of an action does eliminate intentional binding, so long as the probability of an effect given an action is sufficiently high (Moore and Haggard, 2008).  Attempts to synthesize predictive and postdictive accounts of agency  Synofzik, Vosgerau and Newen (2008) review findings on comparator models and argue that they cannot account for either a feeling of agency or a judgment of agency. Their multifactorial model separates feeling from judgment and discusses the conceptual level of processing that is added to the latter. Their discussion concerns explicit judgments of agency, however, which may differ from results obtained using implicit measures (e.g., Engbert, Wohlschl√§ger and Haggard 2008). Moore, Lagnado, Deal and Haggard (2009) investigated whether statistical contingency alone could explain both predictive and inferential ‚Äò‚Äòpostdictive‚Äù intentional binding effects. Both predictive and ‚Äòpostdictive' shifts in the time of action perception depended on strong contingency between the action and effect, suggesting that the experience of agency involves causal learning based on statistical contingency. Although predictive and postdictive accounts of agency are often cast as competitors, they may in fact be reconcilable when attributions of self-agency are viewed within the framework of cognition under uncertainty. In particular, a comparator model based on efference copy can be seen as a more sophisticated way of characterizing Wegner's consistency parameter and the computations that are likely to be a part of it. Basing outcome predictions on motor commands, rather than just higher-level representations of the goal state that an action is intended to bring about, is likely to provide finer-grained predictions with which to compare outcomes, thereby reducing uncertainty in agency attributions. This higher predictive resolution, in turn, could be useful in making exclusivity judgments (Wegner's second condition): even if a particular goal state is brought about, if the way it is brought about does not closely match the motoric prediction, the attribution of agency may be reduced or blocked entirely. Similarly, given evidence (discussed above ‚Äì see Haggard, Clark and Kalogeras 2002) that whether or not an action is volitional affects intentional binding, motoric representations and predictions seem also to affect Wegner's priority parameter. As such, predictive and postdictive accounts may simply differ in emphasis and in the level at which they describe the phenomenon, rather than being fundamentally incompatible.

The grey-capped fruit bodies are generally found singly or in small groups in deciduous woodland on chalk-based soils. Taxonomy Tricholoma atrosquamosum was described 1837 by French naturalist Fran√ßois Fulgis Chevallier as Agaricus atrosquamosus. It has also been classified as a subspecies of the related T. terreum by George Edward Massee. It lies within the section Terrea within the subgenus Tricholoma within the genus Tricholoma. Two varieties are recognised, var. atrosquamosum is generally a larger mushroom and squarrulosum smaller. Tricholoma atrosquamosum is commonly known as the dark-scaled knight. Description The cap is wide and covered with dark grey-brown scales. Young specimens have more conical caps which become convex to flat with maturity. It is generally darker than other grey-capped tricholomas. The stout stipe is high and wide and has no ring. It is grey with tiny blackish scales either all over or restricted to the apex. The base of the stipe can be tinged greenish or pinkish, and becomes reddish upon drying. The pale grey-brown gills are adnate or free (unattached to the stipe). The mushroom has a mealy smell and taste, though there can be a fruity, peppery or spicy edge to the former. The spore print is white. Distribution and habitat Tricholoma atrosquamosum is found in North America and Europe. It is generally rare in Europe, and in danger of extinction in the Netherlands. The fruit bodies appear under deciduous and coniferous trees, particularly beech and spruce on chalky (calcareous) soils. Variety squarrulosum is also rare (though more widely distributed in southern Europe), and associated with oak, pine and spruce on chalk soils, with its fruit bodies appearing September to November. Both subspecies are rare in the British Isles. Edibility Both subspecies are edible, and highly regarded by some. They can be confused with darker specimens of the poisonous T. pardinum, which is generally a larger mushroom and lacks the peppery aroma.

Music and lyrics \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" is credited solely to Robbie Robertson. However, Levon Helm claimed years later that the song was a group effort. The song has an improvised feel. The Band initially attempted to record the song in a straightforward manner, but it didn't sound right to Robertson. So drummer Levon Helm moved to play mandolin, pianist Richard Manuel played drums, bassist Rick Danko played fiddle and producer John Simon played tuba, while organist Garth Hudson played upright acoustic piano in a ragtime fashion. Helm also sang the lead vocals. Although a favorite with fans, the band didn't originally think that highly of the song, recording it almost as an afterthought.

It emerged in the field of social psychology. Forced compliance theory is the idea that authority or some other perceived higher- ranking person can force a lower-ranked individual to make statements or perform acts that violate their better judgment. It focuses on the goal of altering an individual's attitude through persuasion and authority.  Festinger and Carlsmith  Leon Festinger and James M. Carlsmith (1959) conducted an experiment entitled \\"Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance\\". This study involved 71 male students from Stanford University, of which 11 students were disqualified. The students were asked to perform a tedious task involving using one hand to turn small spools a quarter clockwise turn. The purpose was to make the task uninteresting and unexciting enough that none of the participants could possibly find it enjoyable.Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance Essay, Classics in the History of Psychology The experimental condition involved telling the subject before the experiment started that it would be fun, while the control condition did not set any expectations for the task. The control subjects were asked to go to a room to be interviewed. The experimental condition involved giving either $1 or $20 to try to convince the next participant that the experiment was fun. The results showed a significant difference between the groups in how they much they reported to enjoy the experiment. Another large difference was observed between the $1 and $20 groups. However, no significant difference emerged between the $20 group and control group. The results indicate that when an individual is motivated by reward to say something contrary to their private belief, their private belief tended to change as a result. When the reward was small, (beyond what is necessary to elicit the desired behaviour) the magnitude of the dissonance was higher and as a consequence so was the pressure to reduce the dissonance. In summary, the study demonstrated that when individuals experience a conflict of cognition they will tend to shift their private belief to reduce dissonance.  Cognitive dissonance theory  Forced compliance theory is essentially a subset of cognitive dissonance theory. Cognitive dissonance theory describes the unpleasant feeling that results from believing two contrary ideas at the same time. It is most persuasive when it comes to feelings and thoughts about oneself. It is also a strong motivational tool in influencing us to choose one action or thought over another. Forced compliance theory is being used as a mechanism to help aid in projections of cognitive dissonance theory. Supporting research  Study 1  Helmreich and Collins conducted an experiment entitled \\"Studies in Forced Compliance: Commitment and Magnitude of Inducement to Comply as Determinants of Opinion Change\\". This study consisted of sixty-sixty male college students who were asked to record a counter-attitudinal statement concerning a serious issue. Variables included multiple levels of commitment. These levels included making an anonymous audio recording, a non-anonymous video recording, and a non-anonymous video recording with no chance to withdraw their statement. Half of the participants were asked to make the recording, while the other half was asked to make the counter statement. The participants were paid for their tasks. For the two highest levels of commitment (identified video recordings) participants who received low pay exhibited more attitude change. However, within the lower commitment level (anonymous audio recording) participants, higher pay yielded more attitude change.  Study 2  Ashmore and Collins conducted an experiment called \\"Studies in Forced Compliance: X. Attitude Change and Commitment to Maintain Publicly a Counter-attitudinal Position\\". In this study, researchers manipulated three variables that were expected to influence attitude change under compulsion. These three variables were public-private, true-persuasive, and high-low financial motivation. At the beginning of the study, \\"public\\" subjects signed a document in which they vowed to preserve their counter- attitudinal position outside of the study. Results showed that public subjects were more likely to exhibit attitude change than private subjects.  Study 3  French researchers Jean-Leon, Bungert and Mariette conducted a study entitled \\"Forced Compliance: Commitment to Compliance and Commitment to Activity\\". This study consisted of two experiments. One involved 200 adolescents and adults and another involved 176 high school-aged participants. The study built on previous research that stated when individuals are not granted the freedom to agree or disagree with the task, signs of dissonance are not detected.

He was the starting quarterback for Michigan's undefeated, national championship 1903 \\"Point-a-Minute\\" football team that outscored opponents 565 to 6. James later went into the manufacturing business. He was the founder of The Motor Foundry Co., a manufacturer of automobile parts in Detroit, and the James Motor Valve Company, which developed the innovative \\"James Valve\\" in the mid-1920s. He also served as the general manager of the Monarch Steel Castings Co., an innovator in the Solvay process. Early years James was born in Ohio in 1881. He was raised in Detroit and attended the Detroit University School. He was the captain of the school's football team during the 1900‚Äì1901 academic year. He was also captain of the track team during the 1899-1900 and 1900‚Äì1901 academic years. University of Michigan He enrolled at the University of Michigan in the fall of 1901. He was captain of the All-Freshman football team in 1901 and of the reserve football team in 1902. In 1903, and despite weighing only 142 pounds, James took over as the Wolverines' starting quarterback. At the start of the 1903 season, expectations were low, as the team had lost most of its starters, including the two leading scorers and starting quarterback Boss Weeks. With only eight veterans returning, team captain Curtis Redden wrote that \\"[n]o season in the history of Michigan football has opened with a gloomier outlook\\" than that of 1903.1904 Michiganensian, p. 138. Despite the low expectations, James led the 1903 team to an 11-0-1 record while outscoring opponents 565 to 6. The 1903 team was the third of Fielding H. Yost's legendary \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams and has been recognized retrospectively as a national championship team for 1903 by the National Championship Foundation. The season was not without its challenges for James. Before a key game against Wisconsin, rumors spread that Yost was considering replacing James with Fred Norcross. At a rally the night before the Wisconsin game, Yost was asked directly whether he would keep James, whose wrist was bound in a splint, at quarterback. Yost replied succinctly, \\"Yes. He is the better player.\\" Michigan defeated Wisconsin 16‚Äì0, but the team had difficulty reaching Wisconsin's goal and relied on Tom Hammond to kick two field goals. On Hammond's first kick, the snap to James was high, but he was credited with pulling it in and placing it accurately to allow Hammond to convert the kick for a 5‚Äì0 lead. Before the final game of the season, the Thanksgiving Day rivalry game with Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons, rumors returned that Yost might replace James with Norcross. The night before the game, Yost revealed that James had won the quarterback job over Norcross. James started and played the entire Chicago game, leading the team to a 28‚Äì0 victory. After the game, Yost said the team's play against Chicago was \\"the best he had ever seen by a Michigan team during his three years here.\\" The Detroit Free Press called it \\"the most severe drubbing ever administered to the Maroons in the history of football of that institution.\\" The Wolverines compiled a perfect record with James at quarterback. The team's sole setback during the 1903 season was a 6‚Äì6 tie on the road against Minnesota. James did not appear in the Minnesota game, as Yost played Norcross at quarterback for the entire game. In its overview of the 1903 season, The Michigan Alumnus praised James: > James's work at quarter merits praise. It was a difficult task to set any > man -- that of filling the key position in the team acceptable to those who > were demanding another Weeks.

History Built in 1940, this building was originally named \\"South Hall\\", but in 1952 a new wing was added to honor a former faculty member of the School of Education, Frances Gibson Richard.http://www.lib.muohio.edu/epub/building/richard/richard.html Frances Gibson Richard Frances Richard was born in Falling Springs, PA on March 29, 1866. After attending National Normal University at Lebanon, OH with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1889, and then a Bachelor of Arts in 1891, Richard received a Master of Arts degree in 1893 from Bloomfield Academy of Franklin College. It was in 1902, when she accepted a position at Miami University as an instructor in English. This was a moment that would not only change her life, but all faculty members and prospective students‚Äô lives as well. From the years 1907‚Äì1936, Frances served as Associate Professor for the School of Education. Throughout those years, Richard proved herself as a talented and inspiring writer at Miami University. In March 1909, she was the author of the monograph, English for the Grades, which was published in the Miami Teacher's Bulletin. She is also recognized for her libretto for Act III of The Emperor's Clothes, published in 1928. Those who knew and worked with Ms. Richard expressed her well-cultivated personality with characteristics such as her able intellect, ability to deal with facts, quiet in manner and her sense of humor. Frances was known to have a great ability and passion for public speaking in Southern Ohio. Frances was eighty-six years old when she died at Hamot Hospital in Erie, PA on April 1, 1952, after celebrating her birthday two days before. After leaving a phenomenal mark at Miami University, a conference was held in her honor, including sixty-three fellow faculty members who urged to have the building be named after her. Frances Richard taught the ‚Äúart of living‚Äù and was one of the ablest and inspiring teachers in the University. On December 6, 1952, South Hall was renamed Richard Hall, and it will forever honor the inspiring and intelligent professor that devoted her abilities to the University. Building record Located on 501 South Oak Street, Oxford Ohio, this building houses numerous sorority girls and has various sorority suites within it, such as Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Phi, Alpha Xi Delta, Delta Gamma, Delta Zeta and Phi Mu.

Explores impact of social movements and popular opinion upon legislative decision-making, as well as industry lobbying and broader social context. Argues that Ontario's incrementalist approach to policy-making was often challenged by the need for rapid change in alcohol policy, and examines the government's attempts to construct hasty compromises. Posits that the continued existence of the LCBO past the time when it was a large contributor to net general revenue indicates not only its importance as a patronage tool and means to appease powerful alcohol producers, but also represents a reflection of government's enduring belief that the restriction of market forces is permissible if it protects society. * Lukin Robinson. \\"The Ontario Election and After.\\" MonthlyReview 47.9 (1996): 19.

Compares six casestudies including California, Wisconsin, New York, Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick and focuses on political agendas as the driving force behind such social policies. Establishes that workfare is largely unsuccessful due to the failures of policy makers in implementation; unions, special interest groupsand other resistors; and little public attention and support. Concludes that the difficulties and hazards found in the workfare example can similarly be foundin other social policy ideas in the areas of education, child care, healthcare, pensions and unemployment insurance. Argues that before established practice can be reformed, understanding of these hazards and possible solutionsmust be found. * Sid Noel. Essays on Governing Ontario: Revolution at Queen's Park.

Looks at welfare reform under the Liberal and NDP governments, compares the Liberal's Red Book to the Conservative's Common Sense Revolution and what they meant for the 1995 election, and finally examines the effect of workfare in Ontario post-election.

Focuses on the approach to restructuring that the Social Contract takes paying particular attention to unionization and collective bargaining and cooperativeness between labour and management. Concludes by arguing that optimal restructuring outcomes were achieved when the collective concerns of workers were heard. Further states that majority of local unions and managers were able to find compromise under the Social Contract Act which was not the case when compared to Conservative restructuring causing prolonged strikes. * Robert Drummond. \\"The Provincial Perspectives: Ontario.\\" Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs, 1995.

An overview of the 1995 general election in Ontario and record of the Speech from the Throne as well as the first session of the 36th Ontario provincial parliament. Focuses on establishing the facts rather than an in depth analysis of the election; determines that the major issues of the election were welfare, taxand spending cuts, and employment equity. Notes that Conservative victory due to a platform with promises (unlike the NDP), no half measures (unlike the Liberals), the poor performance of the NDP incumbent government, a shrewd advertisement campaign, votes from Reform supporters, and NDP and Liberals attacking one another rather than the Conservatives. Concludes with a record of the new government quickly fulfilling its campaign promises allowing it continued major public support and the introduction of an omnibus bill proposing amendments to approximately 40 statutes. Such amendments included allowing the government to close hospitals, direct doctors to practice in certain areas, and facilitate the merger of municipal governments.

This article provides a theoretical explanation of the models that Ontario public education policy has followed throughout the history of its development. Despite changes in centralization over the years, the article notes that under Harris and his Common Sense Revolution, the education policy system reached unprecedented levels of politicization and centralization. The \\"administrative agency\\" model is touted as the traditional model for the public education system. In this context, an examination of the Common Sense Revolution model will help to show whether or not it was a break from the political and policy tradition. The article also provides elucidation on the difference between the neo- conservative and neo-liberal ideological approaches. It concludes that educational policy-making has changed dramatically; although perhaps not solely because of the Common Sense Revolution. * Croteau, Jean-Philippe. \\"History of Education in French-Speaking Ontario: A Historiographic Review.\\" Canadian Issues (2014): 23-30 online * Gaffield, Chad.

This book chronicles the Ontario education system from the mid-century royal commission, chaired by Justice John Andre Hope that set the post-war educational landscape, to the changes presented by the Harris government at the end of the century. Gidney presents these two points as his beginning and conclusion while describing all the educational developments in between these two eras of drastic change. Gidney uses this period to present and explain three motifs of focus: governance, educational finance, and curriculum. Rather than focusing on specific issues such as separate school funding and French language schooling, he attempts to explain such issues through the aforementioned overarching general themes that he argues are crucial to understanding the Ontario education system and its intricacies. * Shapiro, Bernard. \\"The Public Funding of Private Schools in Ontario: The Setting, Some Arguments, and Some Matters of Belief.\\" Canadian Journal of Education. 11:3 (1986): 264-77. In this article, Bernard Shapiro provides a description of the debate surrounding public funding of private schools in Ontario. He presents the three main arguments of both those in favour and those against public funding for private schools. The arguments of the former camp are as follows: First, parents should have the right to choose the best education environment for their children. Second, it is discriminatory to fund catholic schools and no others and third, parents who send their children to private school should not have to pay taxes for public schools. The counter arguments presented against these points deal with: The financial constraint of the province, the issue of a growth of population segregation, and that it denies equality of education by creating a two-tier education system. Shapiro offers an in-depth analysis of these issues presenting supporting points for both camps. This analysis as examined through a set of personal beliefs as to what education should represent, Shapiro concludes with his own argument that Ontario should modify its current arrangements with regards to private schools. * Stamp, Robert M.

This book provides a historical background of separate schools in Ontario. It outlines a chronological table of the development of separate schools beginning with the 1841 act which established \\"common schools\\" for those of a different faith. It lists several other acts, notable developments and their significance to the issue. The list concludes with a 1984 statement made by Premier Davis, which establishes full funding for Catholic schools through grade 13. In addition to this list, the book provides a narrative account of significant issues and the development of the separate school system during this period. * White, Linda. \\"Liberalism, Group Rights and the Boundaries of Toleration: The Case of Minority Religious Schools in Ontario.\\" Canadian Journal of Political Science. 36:5 (2003): 975-1003. Examines the issue of separate school funding in Ontario as a question of balancing community and individual rights and the obligation the province has in finding an equilibrium between maintaining its liberal institutions and supporting the rights of those cultural groups affected by the status quo. Article proposes a solution to balance these issues in Ontario while offering an argument in support of funding for faith-based schools based on the notion of the right to culture for minority groups. * Zinga, Dawn. \\"Ontario's Challenge: Denominational Rights in Public Education.\\" Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy. 80 (2008). In this article, Dawn Zinga discusses the separate schooling issue and the challenge it presents towards denominational rights. Zinga structures this paper through a focus of three areas. It begins with a description of how Catholic schools came to be publicly funded in Ontario. Zinga then examines how Ontario has dealt with the issue of denominational rights in education and looks at what other challenges Ontario faces given the change of Canadian society since confederation. Through these areas of focus the issue is examined both from a historical perspective and as a current political issue with particular focus on the influence of the issue during the 2007 election. Concludes with the idea that it is up to the province going forward and any changes to the educational system will depend on how Ontario chooses to address this issue.

Challenges one-sided male domination approach to studying social policy by arguing that women played an active positive role in the shift from the private sector to the welfare state in Ontario. Looks at how social and economic contexts such as industrialization, urbanization and immigration led to increase concerns and anxieties about the future of the society. The industrialization created two classes of women: working and middle class. The political discourse of the time put women in the center of family. Middle-class women followed that discourse and through their gender and class loyalty fought for improved living (and to lesser extent working) conditions of other women, and pressured for government activity. Argues that women as workers for the state had limited influence in state services; women as clients comprise the largest group of recipients whose needs were rarely meet by the state programs. * Chenier, Elise Rose.

Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1994. Argues that the concept of motherhood was central in creating Ontario welfare state. Highlights the important role leaders of the orphanages and child welfare advocates played in creation of OMA, (such as Kelso and Bryce). Overcrowding and high death rates were prominent within these institutions, while poverty pushed many working mothers to give their children away. World War I provided political context for mobilizing government, as new citizens were needed. While Canadian Patriotic Fund served as a guideline for OMA, characterized by strict supervision, work with local communities and absence of stigma of charity. Out of moral concerns, women leaders were the most forceful advocates to limit financial assistance to widows only. After implementation, municipalities and counties were responsible for half of the cost so they had some influence on OMA Commission. However, the Commission only considered their advice on the matters of potential \\"unworthiness\\" of the client. Justified in the interests of the children and rhetoric of motherhood as a service to the state, the program was never sufficient enough to alleviate poverty for even most deserving mothers, subordinating women only further by constant surveillance and threat. * John Ibbitson.

The article provides a treatment of environmental policy reform resulting from the Common Sense Revolution but focuses specifically on the budget cuts to the Ontario Ministry of Environment. It attempts to track the level of funding and staffing since the MOE's inception in the 1970s, reviews the impacts of the cuts that occurred in the mid-90s, and theorizes which forces were the most pervasive in causing its decline. Though the article examines the effect of party politics, public pressures, and other socio-political forces, it concludes that the primary cause of the decline was the ideology underlying the Common Sense Revolution. This article concerns itself with \\"neo- conservatism\\" instead of the \\"neo-liberalism\\" mentioned by Olakanmi, Prudham, Little, etc. The Common Sense Revolution resulted in far-reaching changes to traditional environmental policy and the primary mobilizing factor was this ideology. * Kushner, Joseph, and David Siegel.\\"Citizen's Attitudes Toward Municipal Amalgamation in Three Ontario Municipalities.\\" Canadian Journal of Regional Science. 26.1(2003): 49-59.

Though the article is not specifically focused on whether or not the Common Sense Revolution was a break from tradition, it does provide pertinent information. It notes that, the emphasis on \\"workfare\\" was an ideological and philosophical approach to welfare policy that was brand new to Ontario. In addition, the obsession with welfare fraud prevention was a significant change to past practices. The article notes the almost impossible amount of detail required to prove need and emphasizes that the moral element of making certain that no one could gain the system was also new to Ontario policy-making. The article concludes that Common Sense Revolution did not only feature a new ideological approach to Ontario politics but also represented a stricter form of moral policing especially with regard to welfare policy. * MacDermid, Robert. \\"TV Advertising in the 1995 Ontario Election.\\" Revolution at Queen's Park: Essays on Governing Ontario.

Argues that Ontario state policies grew out of private welfare activities and at the early stage even relied on the private agencies to help the government in administration of the OMA. States that, while liberal democratic states adhere to strict division between private and public realms and do not interfere with the former, Ontario government with the help and active participation of voluntary organizations facilitated in internalization of the maternal ideology by the citizens. This allowed government to control the impoverished women, by relaying on the opinions and experience of organizations such as Children's Aid Society, National Council of Women and Toronto Local Council of Women in administering and delivering state services. * Margaret J. H. Little, \\"No car, no radio, no liquor permit: The moral regulation of single mothers in Ontario, 1920‚Äì1997\\". Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1998. Provides in-depth account of moral regulations of OMA recipients. Traces the origins of the program, its implementation and administration. Argues, that it was created with the classist, racist, gendered ideology of the middle-class men and women. Looks at the role of maternal ideology in debates around mother's allowance. In contrast to Andrew, argues that women had influence in the administration of the state policy. The U.S and Canadian provinces already had a similar policy in action. Women could vote for the first time, so Drury's Conservative government wanted to secure that vote by implementing mother's allowance. State took responsibility of moral control of its citizens by strict eligibility criteria of the OMA. While some aspects of the welfare state became routinized and bureaucratized, it remained to be highly subjective. Sexual life, personal hygiene, housekeeping, race/ethnicity of the applicants were under scrutiny by the citizens and the government officials. At the same time, family violence and women's health were rarely considered. * Marks, Lynne. Revivals and Roller Rinks: Religion, Leisure and Identity in Late Nineteenth-Century Small-Town Ontario.

The book concludes by accusing the Revolution and its supporters of attempting to weaken government such that it was incapable of exerting influence; that Mike Harris and his supporters did not govern for the people and changed too much too quickly. * Montigny, Edgar-Andre, and Lori Chambers, eds.

This article examines the effects that the Common Sense Revolution had on several social institutions including the public education system. The article notes the neo-liberal foundations of the Revolution and that Mike Harris deliberately promoted \\"disaster capitalism\\" to impact policy. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of neo-liberal doctrines and thinkers on the large-scale changes that occurred with regards to public education policy. The article is critical of the changes and argues that neo-liberal ideology has damaged unions, the school boards, and led to dramatic underfunding; it concludes, however, that a change in ideology could see positive reforms to public education. Examines the effect of the CSR on Ontario's public school system, a decade after it was implemented. While most PC policies were neo-liberal (which generally holds that education should be as privatized as possible, albeit with government funding), their approach to education involved more regulation of schools, including administrative, curricular, and working conditions, while reducing the amount of money spend. This could be considered an attempt to reduce the power of public unions, of which teachers are among the most visible and influential. \\"Consequently, it carried out a strategic plan to undermine the authority, knowledge, and integrity of those within the education system in order to further its agenda. * Ontario Bureau of Statistics and Research.

This article places its emphasis on Common Sense Revolution environmental policy and explores the Walkerton Tragedy within the context of this policy. Justification for this focus is provided through the article's showing that much of the Revolution was nature-centered. Though the Harris cuts were building on the cuts by the Rae government, they went far deeper and damaged many core programs; in addition, the Harris cuts were motivated primarily by an ideology that was new to Ontario governance. The combination of policy like the Red Tape Reduction Bill with the immense cuts and the rhetorical attacks against the public sector produced a never- before-seen devolution in environmental oversight. The article concludes by reiterating that the Common Sense Revolution directly gave rise to the conditions that allowed the Walkerton Tragedy to occur. * Ralph, Diana; R√©gimbald, Andr√©; and St-Amand, N√©r√©e, eds.

Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 1997. The book provides a chronological overview of key events during the Common Sense Revolution as well as contextual explanations for these events. The authors argue throughout that there was a multinational, corporate agenda underlying Mike Harris' policies; a factor that had never been so pronounced in Ontario policymaking. Although the book touches on similar subjects to the other presented sources, it also offers unique points. For example, it notes that, there has been a tradition in Ontario of legislation combatting racism and anti-Semitism since the 40s, but that the Common Sense Revolution represented a break from this due to the elimination of various pieces of equity legislation. The book ultimately argues that the underlying sociology of the Revolution and its emphasis on a new, business-like model of government produced massive changes in many different parts of Ontario policymaking. Examines how the CSR was designed by, and heavily favours, corporations instead of people. Discusses, in three sections, the routes of the revolution in Thatcherism and American conservatism; the impact it has had on the province including social programs, Franco-Ontarians, and labour organizations; and ways in which opponents can respond to the government. * Reginald Pelham Bolton. \\"An Expensive Experiment: The Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario\\".

The second part of Promised Land examines the Ontario PC Party after they had one majority government in 1995 with attention on the consequences of instituting the CommonSense Revolution in Ontario and the impact it had on various segments of society.

This is a book written as an autobiography by Bob Rae outlining his life in politics. The book starts off with an introduction briefly describing Mr. Rae's first year as premier. Throughout the book he discusses the trials and tribulations that he had to endure and overcome as premier, including the recession in Ontario in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his party politics, and issues with Quebec independence sentiments. The book discusses how Bob Rae got into politics and a brief history of his childhood. Rae goes through each of his elections in the 80s and 90s. He describes the outcomes of each election and the consequence that it had on his life on the path to becoming in NDP Premier in Ontario for the years of 1990 to 95. The book continues to talk about the many major and minor mistakes that his party had made throughout his leadership, such as party members \\"losing their cool\\" in parliament or getting a staff member to sign a document on a cabinet member's behalf. The book concludes with Bob Rae talking about how he lost his premier seat to Mike Harris and his congratulation speech. * Thomas Walkom. \\"Rae Days\\". Toronto: Key Porter book Ltd, 1994.

The book continues to describe Bob Rae as a leader and the decisions he made with his party. Most of these decisions were said by critics to have been Rae's downfall and the NDP's dramatic fall in popularity with the population. The book quickly discusses Rae's personal life as well and describes him as \\"a liberal in sandals\\". The book continues to discuss personal and political events through the NDP party starting from winning on election night in 1990. * Bob Rae. \\"Lessons to be learned: the report of the Honourable Bob Rae, independent advisor to the minister of public safety and emergency preparedness, on outstanding questions with respect to the bombing of Air India Flight 182\\". Air India Review Secretariat. Her majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2005. This report is a policy-based inquiry into the event of the Air India Flight 182 bombing. The report is written by Bob Rae and takes into consideration the inquiries of the public with respect to the bombing. The report discusses the terrorist group that was behind the bombing and how the bombings took place. The report then goes on to discuss the outcome of the trials for the people responsible for the bombing. A brief history and background outlines a brief history on the turmoils of the Sikh population in Canada and in India and why the Sikh population had wanted to assert themselves as an independent state. There was also an overview as to what the Canadian government should do to correct the situation and to put in place certain policies and procedures. Rae questions the government as to why the events of 9/11 was the catalyst to bringing forth the Anti-Terrorism act instead of the Air India Act that directly affected many Canadian lives on Canadian soil. The report ends off by Rae explaining that further review should be held for questions that still have no answer, for example was the assessment by Canadian government officials in the potential threat of Sikh terrorism in the period prior to 1985 adequate in light of the information reasonably available at the time even though the government received numerous warnings of the activities of this terrorist group. This book is a good review of national security policies and procedures and changes that should occur to the Canadian government. * Paul Kaihla. \\"Rating Bob Rae.\\" Maclean's. Volume 104: Issue 34 (1991): 14. This article is a brief overview of the first year of Rae's achievements and setbacks as Premier of Ontario. This is a brief overview of Rae's role in government and how Ontario has changed for the better or worse. Many of the citizens interviewed in the article state that they are still waiting on improvements that were promised to them in the social service sector. The article discusses the slow pace of change and the people's hopes and dreams for change in policies before Rae was elected. So far nothing has come forth yet. The author has stated that Rae has yet to make good on his word to be a more involved politician. Some of the strides made by Rae in politics have been the signing of the letter of agreement stating that the First nation residents shall possess an inherent right to self-government, a first declaration ever made by any Ontario Premier. The article continues to discuss the implications of the recession for the Ontario economy with the lack of jobs that were supposed to be created under the Rae government. The article continues to describe the conflicts in inter party politics and the debate on the auto insurance issue of scrapping the no fault auto insurance plan. * Paul Kaihla and Ross Laver. \\"Bob Rae's Revolution\\" Maclean's. Volume 105: Issue 37 (1992):20 ‚Äì 24 This article is about the social reform changes that the Rae government had made or tried to make during their rule. The policies that were made during the Rae government that affected social aspects of Ontario were the Consent to treatment act which gave permission to children aged 12 and over to refuse medical treatment without parental consent, a very progressive labour legislation that would make private companies throughout Ontario hire visible minorities, women and disabled people. The article emphasizes the Rae party's policies to change deep seated social injustices in Ontario. The article continues to discuss other policies in the labour field and the educational field. The article concludes with the author discussing Rae's commitment to fighting social injustices and changing the power balance in Ontario to giving power to less advantaged people according to race and gender. * A comparison between Bob Rae's NDP government and Mike Harris's PC government and their policy attitudes towards organized labour in Ontario. A decade of data ranging from 1987 to 1998 is used to compare the effects of government change over which note the contrasting certification/decertification activity as well as number of complaints regarding unfair labour practices and focus is put on how these issues were significantly impacted with the election of the Ontario PC government in 1995 and remained in sharp contrast throughout the Harris years. The study the article examines is a reflection of left-right party positions on organized labour which became a major issue of Mike Harris's terms in government.

An analysis of whether the CSR constitutes a temporary 'correction' to the nature of regional government and economic planning, or if the CSR is a permanent change that would fundamentally alter it. A global trend shows regional level of governments attaining greater economic control away from the national level. Harris fought for greater provincial autonomy, but was disinterested in representing Ontario on a global level and was more inward looking than his predecessors across the spectrum. PC policies such as \\"the best creation program is a tax cut\\" have both distinctly neo-liberal and Keynesian characteristics. * Downey, Terrence J. \\"Provincial Agendas, Local Responses: The 'Common Sense' Restructuring of Ontario's Municipal Governments.\\" Canadian Public Administration. 41:2 (1998): 210-238. A study on the results of the PC proposals to restructure six municipalities in southern Ontario. 'Restructuring' has turned a simplistic process of amalgamation and eliminating the new redundancies, and the provincial government failed to adequately work with municipalities, instead implementing some proposals unilaterally. Questions Harris claim that restructuring local government could have an effect on local growth, as if the design of the beauraucracy is more substantial than its policies. The actual implementation of some parts of the plan was forced upon municipalities to take on themselves, and there were varying response ranging from compliance to outright resistance. * Duchesne, Scott. \\"Mike the Message: Performing the Common Sense Revolution.\\" Theatre Research in Canada. 20:1 (1999). The article examines the political dimension of how the Common Sense Revolution was promoted and enacted. Particular emphasis is placed on Mike Harris as the catalyst of the reforms and the positive and negative feedback that he and his party received as a result. The article focuses on in-depth analysis of Conservative propaganda commercials and provides insight into how certain wide-scale reforms that diverged from tradition were seemingly accepted by the Ontario population and why policies like Bill 103 were so stringently opposed. The article concludes by noting that Harris' image may have been more damaging to the Revolution than his far- reaching changes to the Ontario policy tradition. * Felice Martinello. \\"Mr. Harris, Mr. Rae and Union Activity in Ontario.\\" Canadian Public Policy. 26: 1 (2000):17‚Äì33. * Rapaport, David.

Taking place in a fantasy world, The Meek focuses on protagonist Angora, a young girl with a magical ability to control plants, as she is trying to reach a place she refers to as \\"the center\\". However, The Meek follows multiple narratives with several different characters from across the world. Each chapter separately follows one of these narratives. Development Der-shing Helmer is a trained biologist and educator, writing The Meek in her spare time. In a 2009 interview, Helmer stated she draws inspiration from biology when designing the world of The Meek. Helmer created the first draft of her webcomic entirely with a mechanical pencil and marker, but quickly switched to Photoshop CS2 for the final version. She uses a Wacom Intuos tablet to create the comic, and her creation process has become more streamlined since she built a template for her pages. Plot The Meek follows multiple narratives with several different characters from across the world. Each chapter separately follows one of these narratives. The main characters are: *Angora - The protagonist, an enthusiastic 15-year-old girl living alone in a jungle, aided by her plant manipulation powers, until she embarks on her quest to save the world. She has little use for clothes, and will only wear a pair of cut-off shorts. *Luca - An emperor and leader of a group of people called the Pasori. Murder drives him to switch from peaceful negotiation to war against another country. *Soli ‚Äì A bandit who is searching for her ex-boyfriend, so she can kill him. *Pinter - Angora's companion, a wandering, alcoholic cartographer who meets Angora and, out of concern for her safety, travels with her. *Rana, Suda and Hyla - Luca's children. *Alamand - Soli's companion, a skilled young boy. The plot of The Meek concerns a war that is brewing between several of the world's nations, notably the Carissi and the Pasori people. Reception Caitlin Rosberg of The A.V.

In 1968, Ruhe proposed that this area underwent a dramatic erosive event during the Late Wisconsinan. Geological history Most of the region is underlain by pre- Illinoian till, with an age of greater than 0.5 Ma. A thin blanket of Late Wisconsinan aged loess covers the in some places. The relief of the IES itself is generally flat with broad, peculiar interfluves sitting atop of it. The broad elliptical interfluves are commonly referred to as paha and are oriented in a NW-SE (northwest to southeast) direction while each paha is generally isolated or at a distance from one another on the IES.Iannicelli, M.

The NW-SE orientation is attributed to Pleistocene-era oriented snowdunes that melted over the permafrost table, which then eroded and formed oriented depressions in the terrain. This was followed by episodic blankets of paleo-snow and its snowmelt to wear back the rim or scarp of the depressions which resulted in the broad, leveled, erosional plain called the Iowan Erosion Surface.Iannicelli, M.

It operated until 1869.Good Shepherd College website, Our History (retrieved 6 December 2011) From his arrival in 1838, Pompallier had worked energetically to train priests locally for his new mission. In April 1850 he returned from a trip to Europe with ten seminarians and established a seminary in Auckland to complete their formation.Michael King, God's Farthest Outpost: A History Of Catholics In New Zealand, Penguin Books, Auckland, 1997, p. 73. The completion of the training of the new seminarians was carried out quickly so that within five weeks all but one of them were ordained. The seminary, which he named \\"St Mary's College\\", had Pompallier's Vicar General, the Rev. Louis Rozet, S.M., as its first Rector. It was first established on the North Shore of Auckland but was moved across WaitematƒÅ Harbour to Ponsonby in 1852. The Seminary survived for 19 years, until Pompallier retired and left New Zealand in 1869. St Mary's Seminary educated at least twenty-four priests (not counting the initial ten seminarians?), all of them European and some of them already part-trained in Ireland or France. The college also educated many MƒÅori catechists, some of whom were encouraged to stay on for training for the priesthood. One, Keremeti Pine from Okaihau, was even sent to Rome, where for three years among seminarians from Africa and Asia, he spoke Latin and passable Italian. However, no MƒÅori candidate for the priesthood was ordained at this time. The MƒÅori catechists, however, proved to be the backbone of the development of the Catholic faith among the MƒÅori during the remaining decades of the 19th century.

He was the father of architect Ludwig Theodor Choulant (1827‚Äì1900). He studied medicine at the Collegium Medico-chirurgicum in Dresden and at the University of Leipzig, followed by work in 1817 as a physician/obstetrician in Altenburg. During the same year he joined the staff at the Medizinischen Realw√∂rterbuch of Johann Friedrich Pierer (1767‚Äì1832). In 1821 he was a physician at the K√∂niglichen Katholischen Krankenstift in Dresden-Friedrichstadt. In 1822 he began work as a lecturer at the K√∂niglich Chirurgisch-Medizinische Akademie (Royal Surgical-Medical Academy) in Dresden, where during the following year he became a professor of theoretical medicine. In 1828 he became a professor of practical medicine, and from 1843 to 1860 was rector of the Royal Surgical- Medical Academy. From 1844 onward, he served as medical officer in the Saxon Ministry of the Interior. Herder's Conversations-Lexicon. Freiburg im Breisgau 1854, Volume 2, p. 106 (biography, translated from German) In addition to his work involving the literary history of medicine, Choulant made many contributions to the Saxon Medizinalordnung (medical code).

Its utility is to predict possible congestion and prevent it. This protocol works with TCP. When a router wants to signal congestion to the sender, it adds a bit in the header of packets sent. When a packet arrives at the router, the router calculates the average queue length for the last (busy + idle) period plus the current busy period. (The router is busy when it is transmitting packets, and idle otherwise). When the average queue length exceeds 1, then the router sets the congestion indication bit in the packet header of arriving packets. When the destination replies, the corresponding ACK includes a bit of congestion. The sender receives the ACK and calculates how many packets it received with the congestion indication bit set to one. If less than half of the packets in the last window had the congestion indication bit set, then the window is increased linearly. Otherwise, the window is decreased exponentially. This technique provides distinct advantages: * Dynamically manages the window to avoid congestion and increasing freight if it detects congestion. * Try to balance bandwidth with respect to the delay. Note that this technique does not allow for effective use of the line, because it fails to take advantage of the available bandwidth. Besides, the fact that the tail has increased in size from one cycle to another does not always mean there is congestion.

Accordingly, there are no written references to them produced prior to the 1970s. In 1976 and again in 1983 they were attacked by the Parakan√£.

The Garuda is a large mythical bird-like creature or humanoid bird that appears in both Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Garid is a rank in traditional Mongolian wrestling meaning \\"mythical bird\\" as well as the name of the pet eagle of Genghis Khan. Mongolian Wrestling Rank Wrestling in the 2005 Naadam festival near Ulaanbaatar. As of 2003, garid became a rank in traditional Mongolian wrestling Mongolian wrestling has a seven thousand-year history and continues into the present during the annual Mongolian festival of Naadam. Cave paintings in the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia dating back to Neolithic age of 7000 BC show grappling of two naked men and surrounded by crowds. The art of B√∂kh appears on bronze plates discovered in the ruins of the Xiongnu empire (206 BC‚Äì220 AD). Originally, B√∂kh was a military sport intended to provide mainly strength, stamina and skills training to troops. Genghis Khan (1206‚Äì1227) and the all later Emperors of the Mongol Empire (1206‚Äì1368) and also the Emperors of later Khanates were keen to support the sport for this reason so wrestling events were included in local festivals, or Naadam. Wrestling became a key factor when deciding the candidate rankings in imperial martial exams plus outstanding wrestlers were entitled to high distinctions. The winners are of the wrestling competitions at the Naadam festival are honored with ancient titles: the winner of the fifth round gets the honorary title nachin (\\"falcon\\"), of the seventh and eighth rounds zaan (\\"elephant\\"), and of the tenth and eleventh rounds arslan (\\"lion\\"). The wrestler who becomes the absolute champion is awarded the title of avarga (\\"titan\\"). Every subsequent victory at the national Naadam festival by a wrestler of the avarga rank adds an epithet to the title, for example Invincible Titan to be remembered by all. Beginning in 2003, the State Great Khural adopted a new law on Naadam, making amendments to some of the wrestling titles. The titles of Iarudi and Khartsaga (meaning \\"mythical bird\\" and \\"hawk\\" respectively) were added to the existing titles. Genghis Khan Genghis Khan, Mongol emperor The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under Genghis Khan they established a huge Eurasian empire through conquest. Genghis Khan came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of northeast Asia. After founding the Mongol Empire and being proclaimed \\"Genghis Khan\\", he started the Mongol invasions that resulted in the conquest of most of Eurasia. These included raids or invasions of the Kara-Khitan Khanate, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin dynasties. These campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations ‚Äì especially in Khwarezmia. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China. During this time Chinngis Khan had a pet eagle, garid, which was honored in 2003 through Mongolian State Great Khural naming as one of the esteemed titles in Mongolian wrestling after this eagle. Eagles remain popular pets in Mongolia and continue to be used for hunting, as evidenced by the popularity of annual festivals such as the Golden Eagle festival in the Bayan-√ñlgii aimag. During this festival, hunters catch small animals including foxes and hares by their trained eagles.

They lie 45 km north of the town of Katherine, and about the same distance south of Pine Creek. The site is important for Gouldian finches. Description The site is bounded by Nitmiluk National Park and the Arnhem Land Plateau in the east. It consists of rolling hills with thin, sandy loam soils overlaid by angular cobbles. The hills are covered by smooth-barked eucalypts with an understorey of native grasses. They are drained by a network of ephemeral streams which retain water through the dry season in small, scattered pools. Mean annual rainfall in the area is about 1000 mm, falling mainly from December to March. Key features of the habitat for the finches are that the lack of grazing, and few extensive hot fires, allow native grasses to seed; the persistent waterholes provide drinking water; the cavity-bearing trees provide nesting sites; and the perennial grasses on the adjacent lowlands provide seed during the wet season. Land tenure is primarily Aboriginal freehold land held by the Barnjarn Aboriginal Corporation and Wagiman Aboriginal Land Trust. Birds The site has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International principally because it is home to a population of endangered Gouldian finches. It also supports chestnut-backed buttonquails, bush stone-curlews, varied lorikeets, northern rosellas, hooded parrots, white-gaped, yellow-tinted, bar-breasted and banded honeyeaters, masked and long-tailed finches, and silver-crowned friarbirds. Other birds occasionally recorded from the IBA include the Australasian bittern, partridge pigeon, yellow-rumped munia and the northern subspecies of the crested shrike-tit.

He appears to have been the nephew of Martin Browne, whose townhouse doorway, the Browne doorway, now stands in Eyre Square. Browne was a graduate of the Franciscan house at Louvain, having studied at home in Galway and Ireland, and at the Irish College at Doui by 1617. In Louvain he became a lecturer in theology and in this capacity returned to Galway to teach novices. He served as minister provincial for Ireland from 1629 to 1633. Afterwards, he was guardian of Galway till as late as 1639, and in 1642 welcomed the Poor Clares order of the Franciscans to the town. In 1648 he was suspended from public ministry for opposing the papal nuncio, who had excommunicated supporters of the truce between the Irish Confederates and Lord Inchiquin.

It was the first church built in Buffalo, and one of the first two churches established in the northern part of the Wyoming Territory. Early history In December 1883, the Reverend Addison Blanchard, Superintendent of Missions for the Colorado and Wyoming Congregational Church, visited Buffalo. He spent three weeks preaching, and visiting almost every family in town. He found that there were a few families who wanted to participate in a \\"union church\\" on the \\"simple basis of pure Christianity in which minor differences of opinion and forms should be tolerated....\\" In February 1884, Buffalo's first resident pastor, Revenend George C. Rock of Philadelphia arrived, and he preached during the next eight months. On October 13, 1884, Superintendent Blanchard organized the Union Congregational Church of Buffalo, with ten founding members. The congregation met for services in the log schoolhouse located at what is now 138 North Main Street. However, they purchased some land from Mrs. Juliet Hart, and began to plan for their own building. Church Building The plans for the new church were drawn up by Thomas Hutton in 1885. Mr. Hutton was also hired to do the grading, build the foundation, and oversee the construction by the contractor, S. Sherrill. The church was built during the summer and fall of 1886, and was ready for occupancy on December 12, 1886. The cost of the building was $2469.87. The National Register nomination includes a description of the building: \\"Situated on the top of a steep hill, the church was a plain, gable-roofed, rectangular, frame structure about 26 x 29 feet, with the length running north south. The exterior finish was unusually narrow beveled siding (less than three inches weather exposure) which is preserved on the present church. On the south end of the building was an entry hall with a three-sided truncated hip roof. This entry ran the width of the building and was about 10 feet wide. There were two pairs of tall six-paned windows on the west, south, and east sides of the church, a main door on the south in the center of the entry hall/and a small belfry on the south end of the gable roof. The builders added some decoration in the exposed rafters which were carved and pierced and backed by a dentate-carved board, still visible today on the east side of the church. Expansion The church building was expanded in 1911 and 1912. A basement was dug on the lower slope of the hill to the west, and the church building was moved onto the new basement. The basement was 14 feet wider than the sanctuary, so it was possible to add another 14 feet to the room above. The gable roof over the addition runs west from the north-south alignment of the original roof. The north-south gable roof was extended to cover the entry hall, and the door to the building was moved to the east end of the entry hall. The two gables formed an angle where a belfry tower was built to a height of about two feet above the roofs. The square tower provides an entry to the basement, and a stairway to the church above. The basement, which opens out to the west, has space for meetings and social activities along with Sunday School classes. In 1913, the stained glass windows were added to the sanctuary. A fire in 1922 damaged the interior of the first floor, and destroyed the large stained glass window on the west side of the sanctuary. All of the other windows are original. Two other rooms were added north of the sanctuary in 1938 and 1958. In 1974, the exterior of the basement walls were faces with sandstone flagstones from an outcrop about 60 miles southwest of Buffalo. Parsonage The parsonage, built in 1910, is built on a level with the west side of the basement of the church. It is a frame structure with a gable roof and tall paired windows. There is a shed-like roof on the south side of the parsonage. Originally, it must have looked like a small replica of the church.

Adams Streets in Buffalo, Wyoming, United States. The church was built in 1899, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 as the Methodist Episcopal Church. It is located at the corner of Adams Avenue and Fort Street in Buffalo, Wyoming. Construction The Methodist Episcopal Church in Buffalo was organized on October 7, 1892, with the appointment of the first minister, Reverend H.A. Toland. Reverend E.J. Robinson was appointed as minister in 1895, and he supervised the construction of the church building. The building was built by members of the congregation, and the total cost was $2075.00. The design of the church probably came from an architectural pattern book. The cornerstone was laid on August 17, 1898, and laid within the stone were a Bible, a hymnal, a copy of the Church Discipline, several church papers, and some coins. The stone was made and presented by Z.T. Stocks, a stonemason. The interior of the church building follows the Akron Plan, which typifies many Methodist churches in the American West. The plan, which originated in Akron, Ohio, emphasizes good acoustics, good sight lines, and flexibility, with a focus on the pulpit and communion table. The elevated platform for preaching is placed in the corner of the audience room, with the seating in a circular pattern. The main room of the church measures 22' by 36', the lecture room measures 14' by 12', and the bell tower is 40' tall. The pews were obtained from the Methodist Church in Sheridan, Wyoming. The pulpit was donated by Dave Muir and the \\"Scotch Boys.\\" A basement was built in 1906 so that a hearing plant could be added. The stained glass windows were donated in 1916. An electric organ was donated by members of the church in memory of relatives. On December 19, 1923, a fire damaged the rear part of the building. When the basement the church was restored after the fire, the building was lengthened by addition 16 feet to the north. A small choir room was also added. Church History A Social Center was added in 1917, and that was connected to the main building in 1993. In 1939, the church's name was changed to the First United Methodist Church. A Sunday school building was added in 1959. The church is the current home of a congregation now known as the First United Methodist Church of Buffalo Wyoming.

It was built in 1889 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Early days St. Luke's Episcopal Church, as well as several other early Buffalo churches, had its beginning in the Sunday School which was held in the local schoolhouse in 1883. In 1884, Bishop John Spalding organized an Episcopal mission developed into the congregation. The first service was held in a private home in September 1884, and a group of wardens was chosen. Other services were held at the schoolhouse, and at a local hotel. Chaplain G.W. Simpson from Fort McKinney held services every Sunday at three o'clock. The first resident minister, Reverend F.C. Elred, served from 1887 to 1891. Church building In 1888, the congregation decided to build a church on Main Street, and acquired several city lots. The deeds were recorded on October 31, 1888. The cornerstone was laid in 1889. A local woman described the new building: \\"St. Luke's Church was built of red brick, the bricks made and burned in the brickyards of Curran Brothers. Its builder was Thomas Hutton, an ardent churchman as well as an artisan. The style of St. Luke's is Gothic It is considered the most perfect form of Gothic in the state. People from far and wide have stopped while passing through to study the architecture. The furniture of the chancel, the altar, and hangings were given by the Vanderbilit family of New York. This is the history of the gift. As you know, the officers of Fort McKinney helped to start St. Luke's. A young man, a Lieutenant Webb, was related to the Vanderbilt family. He knew that he could get the financial aid to buy the chancel furnishings. He wrote to New York with splendid results. The massive beams in the ceiling of the church were hewn in the sawmill of Martin Woodard who had his mill in the forests of the Big Horns. They were brought down from the mountains over steep and rugged roads by 'Yorkie' Waters who had a large freighting outfit.\\" History During the Johnson County War, several important funerals took place at St. Luke's. When Deputy Marshall George A. Wellman was murdered by the ‚ÄúTaylor Gang‚Äù, known as the ‚ÄúRed Sashes‚Äù, the outlaws did not want the lawman to have the honor of a Christian funeral at St. Luke's. The outlaws, however, did not reckon with the courage and determination of The Rev. Charles Duell, members of St. Luke's and the Masons, all of whom carried concealed weapons during the funeral. The funeral took place on May 13, 1892. In 1897, Dr. H.U. Onderdonk came to St. Luke's Parish as a lay reader. He studied for Holy Orders, and was ordained in 1900. Dr. Onderdonk served not only as physician and a clergyman, but also as a chemist, mathematician, nurse, and editor. The church hall, built in 1925, is named \\"Onderdonk Hall\\" in his memory.\\" On March 19, 1919, St. Luke's Church became a self-supporting regular parish. The church building is basically the same as it was when completed in 1889. Care has been taken to retain its basic design while maintaining it in excellent condition. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Services are held every Sunday.

It has traditionally been considered a southern European variant of the widespread northern pike (Esox lucius), but was described as a separate species in 2011. The southern pike is an important species for recreational fisheries and for its role as a top predator in freshwater ecosystems. Taxonomy Esox cisalpinus was distinguished from Esox lucius (northern pike) and described scientifically as a new species in 2011 independently by two research groups. The description by Bianco & Delmastro was printed earlier,Bianco, P. G. & Delmastro, G. B.

PDF and the name Esox cisalpinus is therefore accepted, whereas the alternative name published somewhat later by Lucentini et al., Esox flaviae, is considered a junior synonym. Lucentini et al. explicitly tested the hypothesis that the different phenotypes of the pike, geographically isolated in Europe, represent two different evolutionary entities. They analysed phenotypic and genetic differences, e.g. in the skin colour pattern and in meristic characters such as the number of scales in the lateral line, which distinguish the two species. They applied a coalescent- based approach to mtDNA phylogeny and evaluated the degree of historical admixture, testing overall genetic differences from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). The Italian southern pike turned out distinct from the northern pike, whose range extends from central and northern Europe across Asia to North America. The authors recommend stopping the stocking of pike in southern Europe using northern pike from other European countries, as this could greatly impact the survival of this newly discovered species in its native range.

It was established in June 1995 by J. D. Healy and Catherine Shultz with the museum's stated goal being \\"to make people happy to be alive\\". The museum was originally established in 1995 in San Diego, in a building the owners claimed was the city's first mortuary. It began as a hobby of the founders J. D. Healy and Catherine Shultz. They would write to serial killers they were interested in, and then show off the artwork their pen pals had created once a year at a specialist show. In 1995, after a few years of exhibitions, the collection, and many other materials, were made into a museum. In late 1999, the couple attempted to acquire a large amount of materials from the Heaven's Gate cult suicides. Although they had been able to purchase many items prior to the main police auction, their interest in buying enough merchandise to recreate the scene in its entirety, led to enormous press interest and publicity. They were subsequently evicted by their landlord, and moved to Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. Prior to the new Los Angeles building becoming a museum, the building was the home of Westbeach Recorders, and prior to that, Producers Studio, where Pink Floyd and others recorded. The walls include deadening agents to help with recordings, which now serve to lend a quiet acoustic setting for the various exhibitions.  New Orleans branch  , the couple had opened up a new branch of the museum in New Orleans called \\"Mus√©e de Mort Orleans\\". The new museum branch will have around 12,000 square metres of space, which will allow more of the collection to be displayed. The limited space at the California museum means that only a third of the items available can be shown at one time. Collection Henri Landru's. The museum displays a wide variety of art and artifacts surrounding the subject of death. Baby coffins are in one section, letters and artwork from various serial killers in another. There are films regarding autopsies as well as graphic photographs of crime victims. There is also a room filled exclusively with taxidermy of various types of animals. The museum's recreation of the Heaven's Gate mass suicide includes the original beds. However, the most notable item at the museum is the head of Henri Landru. In 2014 the museum also acquired Thanatron, one of the original suicide machines built by Jack Kevorkian. Once a year, the museum holds a Black Dahlia look-alike competition, where contestants have to dress as both pre and post-mortem Dahlia.

It passed both the North Carolina State Senate and North Carolina House of Representatives and was signed into law by Governor Beverly Perdue. The law was repealed in 2013. (In 1998 Kentucky had passed the first Racial Justice Act in the country. By comparison, it was more narrowly drawn than that in North Carolina.) Provisions North Carolina's act identified types of evidence that might be considered by the court when considering whether race was a basis for seeking or imposing the death penalty, and established a process by which relevant evidence might be used to establish that race was a significant factor in seeking or imposing the death penalty. The defendant had the burden of proving that race was a significant factor in seeking or imposing the death penalty. The state was allowed to offer evidence to rebut the claims or evidence of the defendant. If race was found to be a significant factor in the imposition of the death penalty, the death sentence would automatically be commuted to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.Senate Bill 461, General Assembly of North Carolina, Session 2009 The act applied retroactively to persons on death row, of which there were more than 145 in the state.

She said that while she supports the death penalty, she felt it was \\"simply unacceptable for racial prejudice to play a role in the imposition of the death penalty in North Carolina.\\" The state legislature did not have enough votes to override Perdue's veto. Major revision (2012) In 2012 the North Carolina General Assembly passed a major revision of the law authored by Rep. Paul Stam (R-Wake). The rewrite \\"severely restricts the use of statistics to only the county or judicial district where the crime occurred, instead of the entire state or region. It also says statistics alone are insufficient to prove bias, and that the race of the victim cannot be taken into account.\\" But studies have shown that when the victim is white, black defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death if convicted. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Perdue. But this time the legislature overrode the governor's veto.\\"Senate Overrides Veto of Bill Revamping Racial Justice Act\\" , Raleigh News & Observer, 2012 Repeal The North Carolina General Assembly voted to effectively repeal the entire law in 2013. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican elected in 2012, signed the repeal into law.\\"McCrory signs Racial Justice Act repeal\\" , Charlotte Observer, 19 June 2013 On June 5, 2020, the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled the repeal was unconstitutional. Appeals under act On April 20, 2012, in the first case appealed under the Racial Justice Act, Judge Greg Weeks, then-Senior Resident Superior Court Judge in Cumberland County (Fayetteville), ruled in favor of the plaintiff Marcus Raymond Robinson that racial bias had influenced his case, automatically commuting his death sentence to life without parole. Robinson contended that when he was sentenced to death in 1994, prosecutors had deliberately kept blacks off the jury. Robinson's lawyers cited a study from Michigan State University College of Law indicating that prosecutors across North Carolina improperly used their peremptory challenges to systemically exclude qualified black jurors from jury service. By 2014, three more cases had been successfully appealed. However, in 2015, the state's Supreme Court vacated the rulings on procedural grounds.

Zias, most commonly cited as Joe Zias, was the Curator of Archaeology and Anthropology for the Israel Antiquities Authority from 1972 until his retirement in 1997, with responsibility for items such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, pre-historic human skeletal remains, and artifacts from archaeological sites such as Jericho, Megiddo, and Gezer. He has appeared often in film and television documentaries regarding such artifacts and the subject of the Historical Jesus, including The Shroud of Turin for CBS, Who Killed Jesus on BBC in 1997 and Son of God on BBC in 2001, and is a frequent lecturer. Work Zias has little tolerance for those who let theology or sheer enthusiasm get in the way of science. \\"People think that our job as biblical archaeologists is to go out and try to prove or disprove the Bible. You couldn't be further from the truth. Our job is to try to understand past historical processes, that's it.\\" The PBS documentary Secrets of the Dead: Shroud of Christ, which aired in April 2004, presented new and controversial claims that the Shroud of Turin was the authentic burial cloth of Jesus. Several experts disputed these opinions, since carbon-dating tests performed in 1988 placed its origin 1300 years too late. Specifically, Zias noted that the shroud depicts a man whose front measures 2 inches taller than his back and said, \\"Not only is it a forgery, but it's a bad forgery.\\" In 2005, archaeologist Yotam Tepper was in charge of a dig near Megiddo, Israel, uncovering the ruins of what was clearly an early Christian church. The IAA, Zias's former employer, claimed that the site could be dated to the third century A.D., which would make it the earliest Christian church unearthed in the Holy Land, and possibly one of the earliest in the world, older even than the edict of Emperor Constantine which legalized Christian worship. Zias, however, disagreed in print: \\"My gut feeling is that we are looking at a Roman building that may have been converted to a church at a later date.\\" At a time when Roman authorities still prohibited Christian practice,\\"If I were a Roman soldier in the third century, I certainly wouldn't want my name on it,\\" he said. \\"This would not have been a good career move. In fact, it sounds like the kiss of death.\\" Historian Yiska Harani was similarly skeptical, wondering why early church historians would fail to mention a successful place of worship, if it were one. Years after archaeologist Yigael Yadin literally wrote the book on Masada, claiming that human remains found at the site were those of the last Jewish defenders of the stronghold, which lead the Israeli government to provide them a formal state burial in 1969, Zias and forensic expert Azriel Gorski presented evidence that the remains may, in fact, have been those of Roman occupiers. Hebrew University archaeologist Ehud Netzer, who participated in Yadin's Masada dig and later oversaw restoration work there, disputed the new findings, saying that Zias was \\"building a story on assumptions built on assumptions.\\" Similarly, Zias said that the original team \\"had the story and went around trying to find the proof.\\" Regarding the Discovery Channel program The Lost Tomb of Jesus, produced by director James Cameron and created by Simcha Jacobovici, which proposed that the Talpiot Tomb site was the actual tomb of Jesus and his family, Zias has said, \\"Projects like these make a mockery of the archeological profession.\\" References External links * * Category:Living people Category:Israeli anthropologists Category:Paleopathologists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Joe Zias"},{"id":"33970619","text":"Piagailoe Atoll is an uninhabited atoll in the State of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia, geographically part of the Caroline Islands.

Notable U.S. law regarding age discrimination The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) ( to ) is a federal law that provides certain employment protections to workers who are over the age of forty, who work for an employer who has twenty or more employees. For protected workers, the ADEA prohibits discrimination at all levels of employment, from recruitment and hiring, through the employment relationship, and through decisions for layoffs or termination of the employment relationship. An age limit may only be legally specified for protected workers in the circumstance where age has been shown to be a \\"bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business\\" (see ). In practice, BFOQs for age are limited to the obvious (hiring a young actor to play a young character in a movie) or when public safety is at stake (for example, in the case of age limits for pilots and bus drivers). The ADEA does not stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one, even when the younger one is over 40 years old. In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants' employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) is a United States law (codified at et seq.), enacted 28 October 1974, that makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, on the basis of (among other things) age, provided the applicant has the capacity to contract. The Older Americans Amendments of 1975 () is an Act of the 94th U.S. Congress amending the Older Americans Act of 1965. It prohibits discrimination based on age in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance, for instance, financial assistance to schools and colleges, provided by the U.S. Department of Education. In 1986, the Fair Labor Standards Act was amended to allow the United States Secretary of Labor to provide special certificates to allow an employer to pay less than the minimum wage to individuals whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury.\\"S.2884 ‚Äî 99th Congress (1985‚Äì1986)\\". United States Congress. October 16, 1986. These employees must still be paid wages that are related to the individual's productivity and commensurate with those paid to similarly located and employed nonhandicapped workers. Mandatory retirement due to age is generally unlawful in the United States, except in certain industries and occupations that are regulated by law, and are often part of the government (such as military service and federal police agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation). Minnesota has statutorily established mandatory retirement for all judges at age 70 (more precisely, at the end of the month a judge reaches that age). The Minnesota Legislature has had the constitutional right to set judicial retirement ages since 1956, but did not do so until 1973, setting the age at 70. The Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which became law in 1986, ended mandatory age-related retirement at age 70 for many jobs, not including the Minnesota judiciary; another exception was all postsecondary institutions (colleges, etc.) This exception ended on December 31, 1993. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X13497993 Sanjek, Roger (2009). Gray Panthers. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 185. The Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act (Public Law 110-135) went into effect on December 13, 2007, raising the mandatory retirement age for pilots to 65 from the previous 60. In the United States federal minimum wage laws allow for employers to pay lower wages to young workers. Many state and local minimum wage laws mirror such an age-based, tiered minimum wage.Questions and Answers About the Minimum Wage , US Department of Labor In the United States, a person must generally be at least 14 years old to seek a job, and workers face additional restrictions on their work activities until they reach age 16.Youth & Labor ‚Äì Age Requirements, US Department of Labor Many companies refuse to hire workers younger than 18. Some U.S. political offices have qualifications that discriminate on the basis of age. For example, the President of the United States must be at least 35 years old; a United States Senator must be at least 30; and a United States Congress member must be at least 25. The District of Columbia and twelve states (California, Florida, Iowa, Hawaii, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, and Vermont) define age as a specific motivation for hate crimes. (See page 1, section \\"Other\\", note 2) Retrieved on 21 May 2009 McClintock, Michael (See pages 84 and 122, Appendix 10, \\"Others\\", note 2) Retrieved on 21 May 2009 Notable U.S. court cases regarding age discrimination In Western Air Lines, Inc v Criswell 472 US 400 (1985) the United States Supreme Court held it was lawful to require airline pilots to retire at 60, because the Federal Aviation Authority forbid using pilots over 60 in aviation. But the Court held that refusing to employ flight engineers over that age was unjustified as there were no such FAA requirements. (Note that The Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act (Public Law 110-135) went into effect on December 13, 2007, raising the mandatory retirement age for pilots to 65 from the previous 60.) DeMarco v. Holy Cross High School 4 F.3d 166 (2nd Cir. 1993) was an employment discrimination case brought under the ADEA (Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967). The appellant, Guy DeMarco, was released from employment prior to his eligibility for tenure at the age of forty-nine. Holy Cross High School argued that it was not subject to ADEA laws, and if it were that this case against it was in violation of the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The defendant also argued that the plaintiff failed to utilize the administrative remedies available. The court noted that other anti-discrimination statutes were held to be applicable to religious organizations, with the exception of statutes that prohibited discrimination based on religious belief. Since statutes prohibiting discrimination by race, gender and national origin were already found applicable to religious organizations, it was logical (and a reasonable interpretation of the legislative history) to extend the prohibition against age discrimination to religious organizations as well.Id. Paragraph 24 The decision of the district court was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.Id. Paragraph 25 In Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000), the United States Supreme Court held that state employees cannot sue states for monetary damages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in federal court. The EEOC may still enforce the ADEA against states, and state employees may still sue state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief. In Gomez-Perez v. Potter (2008), the United States Supreme Court allowed federal workers who experience retaliation as a result of reporting age discrimination under the law to sue for damages. The United States Supreme Court, in Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab, 554 U.S. 84 (2008), held that the employer, not the employee, bears the burden of proving that a layoff or other action that hurts older workers more than others was based not on age but on some other ‚Äúreasonable factor.‚Äù In 2009, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion on Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.. In a 5‚Äì4 opinion, the Court ruled that private-sector plaintiffs must prove that age was the \\"but for\\" cause of the adverse employment action they are suing over. That is, the plaintiff must prove that age discrimination was the determining reason for the adverse employment action (e.g. the action would not have been taken 'but for' the plaintiff's age). However, the Supreme Court's opinion did not explicitly mention public-sector workers. A later opinion, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar (2013) applied the same 'but for' standard to retaliation claims. Babb v. Wilkie, No. 18-882, , 589 U.S. ___ (2020), is a case of the United States Supreme Court in which the justices considered the scope of protections for federal employees in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Specifically, the Court ruled that plaintiffs only need to prove that age was a motivating factor in the decision in order to sue. However, establishing but for causation is still necessary in determining the appropriate remedy. If a plaintiff can establish that the age was the determining factor in the employment outcome, they may be entitled to compensatory damages or other relief relating to the end result of the employment decision. Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), is a United States Supreme Court case involving the ministerial exception of federal employment discrimination laws. The case extends from the Supreme Court's prior decision in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2012) which created the ministerial exception based on the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the United States Constitution, asserting that federal discrimination laws cannot be applied to leaders of religious organizations. The Supreme Court case Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, along with the consolidated St. James School v. Biel (Docket 19-348), both arose from rulings in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that found that federal discrimination laws do apply to others within a religious organization that serve an important religious function but lack the title or training to be considered a religious leader under Hosanna-Tabor. One of those rulings in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was the ruling in Morrissey-Berru v. Our Lady of Guadalupe School, in 2019, in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit allowed a Catholic elementary school teacher's age discrimination suit to move forward.Morrissey-Berru v. Our Lady of Guadalupe School, 769 Fed. Appx 460 (9th Cir 2019). The religious organization challenged that ruling on the basis of Hosanna-Tabor. The Supreme Court ruled in a 7‚Äì2 decision called Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru on July 8, 2020 that reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, affirming that the principles of Hosanna-Tabor, that a person can be serving an important religious function even if not holding the title or training of a religious leader, satisfied the ministerial exception in employment discrimination.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/job-bias-catholic- schools-supreme-court.html Notable activism against age discrimination in the United States The Newsboys Strike of 1899 fought ageist employment practices targeted against youth by large newspaper syndicates in the Northeast. The strikers demonstrated across the city for several days, effectively stopping circulation of the two papers, along with the news distribution for many New England cities. The strike lasted two weeks, causing Pulitzer's New York World to decrease its circulation from 360,000 papers sold per day to 125,000.Nasaw, David.

Its stated mission is \\"to empower people to choose how they live as they age\\". It is an influential lobbying group in the United States focusing largely on issues affecting the elderly. The Gray Panthers was formed in 1970 by Maggie Kuhn, with a goal of eliminating mandatory retirement; they now work on many social justice issues including eliminating ageism.Kuhn, M., Long, C. and Quinn, L.

Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions formed in 1996 to advance the civil and human rights of young people through eliminating ageist laws targeted against young people, and to help youth counter ageism in America. The National Youth Rights Association started in 1998 to promote awareness of the legal and human rights of young people in the United States. The Freechild Project was formed in 2001 to identify, unify and promote diverse opportunities for youth engagement in social change by fighting ageism.

He became a member and organizer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1961, was a county organizer for 1964's \\"Freedom Summer\\", and assisted the efforts of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to unseat the regular Mississippi delegation from their chairs at the 1964 Democratic Party national convention in Atlantic City. He founded Southern Echo, a group that gives support to other grass-roots organizations in Mississippi. He also is a founder of the Mississippi Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement. Early life Watkins was born in July 29, 1941, in Lincoln County, Mississippi, USA, near the town of Summit. He is the youngest and twelfth child of sharecroppers John and Lena Watkins. His family purchased a farm about 1949, via a loan program started under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Watkins graduated from the segregated Lincoln County Training School in 1960. He was also a student at Tougaloo College. Tougaloo's commitment to the freedom movement was rare, as it was one of the few all black colleges that allowed any type of political activity; this was largely because it was one of the only all black schools at that time that wasn't run by a white segregationist. Watkins was part of the Work-Study Program at Tougaloo, which allowed students to be active in the movement while still earning credits towards a degree. During his youth Watkins attended National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) youth meetings led by Medgar Evers. In 1961 Watkins met Bob Moses who was organizing in Mississippi for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Watkins was asked by Bob Moses to join the Voter Registration Organization effort in McComb. Watkins became involved the next day. He joined SNCC, and began canvassing potential voters around McComb, Mississippi in Amite County. He soon became a mentor and role model for McComb High school activists. He participated in McComb‚Äôs first sit-in at a Woolworth's lunch counter in attempt to achieve integration, for which he was jailed for 34 days. During his time in jail, he was threatened on several occasions, including once being shown a noose and told that he would be hung that night. He kept his decision to participate in the sit in a secret from his parents knowing they wouldn't allow him to do so, but when his father found out he spoke at a mass meeting protesting their arrest. This support helped encourage Watkins during his difficult time in jail. Afterward he took part in a walk-out at McComb‚Äôs colored high school, along with dozens of other activists including Brenda Travis, which resulted in his being sentenced to 39 more days in jail. Watkins' activism also had a personal price. Many of his extended family ostracized him and would not recognize him in public for fear of losing their jobs; the White Citizens Council and other groups conducted economic boycotts against activist blacks, getting them fired, evicted from rental properties, and refusing loans and credit. Early career Vernon Dahmer, president of the Forrest County, Mississippi NAACP asked SNCC for help with voter registration, and Watkins moved to Hattiesburg, Mississippi to help with that project. Watkins worked half days at Dahmer's sawmill to pay his way, and spent the rest of the time organizing voter registration projects. He was rebuffed from efforts to meet at Hattiesburg's Baptist churches, but had success at the St. James Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. His first effort led to six people volunteering to try and register, including Victoria Gray Adams. At the request of Amzie Moore, he next went to Holmes County, Mississippi, where he began to canvass potential voters. He was willing to risk his life for this movement, for instance one day he went to a shack on a plantation to talk to them about voting, but ended up being chased away and shot at by the plantation owner, however, that didn't stop him from going back the next week. Supplied with equipment by CBS News, Watkins went to the clerk of court‚Äôs office with a hidden camera and microphone in order to film a typical encounter with voter registration officer Theron Lynd. CBS News was covering the movement. The footage of Lynd, and some of Watkins was aired as a \\"CBS Reports\\" program called \\"Mississippi and the Fifteenth Amendment.\\" It has since been re-released on DVD as \\"Mississippi and the Black Vote.\\" Watkins was with Hartman Turnbow and others when Turnbow tried to register to vote at the Holmes County Courthouse. That night there was a firebomb attack on Turnbow‚Äôs home. Turnbow was later accused by the sheriff of setting fire to his own house, and he, Watkins and others SNCC workers were arrested. It was during one of his jail terms that Watkins became noted as a leader and singer of \\"freedom songs.\\" Watkins led freedom songs with Lawrence Guyot. These songs provided people with joy, spirit, and honesty. It was a way to lift people's spirits and provide a sense of comfort. Watkins was involved in the voter registration in many ways. After becoming a SNCC field secretary he went to Hattiesburg and set up a three-month voter registration project with a budget of only 50 dollars. Watkins also went on to do movement work in Greenwood, Mississippi and other locations, working with Sam Block, Willie Peacock, Annell Ponder, John Ball and others. In addition to voter registration projects, Watkins taught voter education and basic literacy classes. In the early 1960s Watkins attended Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, a school which trained grassroots organizers. Later he served as a member of the board. That relationship continues today. He was in Washington D.C. at the time of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, but did not participate in the march. Instead, he, Bob Moses, and Curtis Hayes picketed the Department of Justice. While in Washington, Watkins met and talked with Malcolm X, leader of the Nation of Islam. Black people were constantly denied the right to vote. Watkins played an active role in trying to fix that. It was legal for African Americans to vote but they were denied the ability to vote because of their lack of education. The government purposefully set up required questions they knew the majority of black people could not answer. This led to Freedom Summers, set up by COFO (Council of Federal Organizations). The Freedom Summers set up freedom schools and community education centers for black citizens to teach them how to read and write. He gathered 750 people in the Greenwood area who would provide homes, food, protection, and support for the group of students coming from the north who were a part of the freedom summers. Watkins strongly believed in the power of local activism and control, which was the major reason for his opposition to 1964‚Äôs 'Summer Project' also known as Freedom Summer. He thought that bringing in outsiders would disrupt the growth of the grassroots programs that were already in place, and that after the volunteers left, it would be harder to get the local movements moving again. Once the project was agreed upon, however, Watkins did his best to make it succeed. He and other SNCC members trained participants at Miami University of Ohio. After blocking efforts by Stokely Carmichael to appoint a new arrival over him, he served as director of the Holmes County efforts. More than 50 volunteers moved to Holmes to canvass voters and to operate the freedom schools. For their safety he insisted they follow a set of strict rules, including no drinking, no dating locals, and no arguments with local segregationists. Perhaps because of these rules, Holmes County was relatively free of incident that summer. The community came to depend on the group from the north during freedom summer. They were educated and spoke well so people listened to them, but when they left everything became scattered and they had to pick up the pieces. Watkins was one of many people spied upon by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a tax-supported agency ostensibly formed to support the state image. Its staff and informers investigated civil rights workers and created files on them for government use, as well as passing material to local White Citizens Councils for reprisals against activists. Watkins‚Äô name appears in the files 63 times. Some of the reports refer to him as a communist, although he had little idea what that even meant at the time. In 1990, the state government made these papers accessible to public viewing. Watkins traveled to Atlantic City, New Jersey for the 1964 Democratic Party national convention in support of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party; it attempted to unseat the regular Mississippi Democratic Party (which was white dominated and maintained disenfranchisement of blacks) as the true representatives of state residents. He was present when Fannie Lou Hamer gave her testimony to the credentials committee, and later when Hamer argued with Martin Luther King over whether the MFDP should accept the compromise of the two seats at the convention offered by President Lyndon Baines Johnson. His efforts on behalf of the party led Victoria Gray to announce her candidacy for the U.S. Senate from Mississippi under the MFDP banner. Recent work and honors In 1988, Watkins returned to the Democratic Party National Convention, this time as a delegate for Jesse Jackson. Beginning in 1989 Watkins joined, and now serves as President of Southern Echo, a group dedicated to providing assistance to civil rights and education- reform groups throughout the south. He is also among the founders of the Mississippi Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement, which has worked to educate people about the movement and celebrate its work.l *In 2011 Watkins was honored by Jackson State University with a Fannie Lou Hamer Humanitarian Award. *On February 27, 2014, the acting mayor, Charles H. Tillman, and the City of Jackson Council honored Watkins with a resolution in City Hall chambers for his work on commemorating the Fiftieth Anniversary of Freedom Summer.Wikimedia Commons. retrieved February 27, 2014 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:LumumbaWatkinsTillmanBW.jpg *According to Watkins the most empowering thing is for people to feel a part of mobilizing and not being isolated, which motivates them to get things done. It very important to have community and unity, because it is empowering to help people overcome fear that is deep down. He states that you should not to allow fear to keep you from doing things. You are expanding the workforce when you feel empowered. People need to accept each other's differences, which will help overcome this massive burden and we can use this to build a massive movement.

This is part of a group of validity indices including the Davies‚ÄìBouldin index or Silhouette index, in that it is an internal evaluation scheme, where the result is based on the clustered data itself. As do all other such indices, the aim is to identify sets of clusters that are compact, with a small variance between members of the cluster, and well separated, where the means of different clusters are sufficiently far apart, as compared to the within cluster variance. For a given assignment of clusters, a higher Dunn index indicates better clustering. One of the drawbacks of using this is the computational cost as the number of clusters and dimensionality of the data increase. Preliminaries There are many ways to define the size or diameter of a cluster. It could be the distance between the farthest two points inside a cluster, it could be the mean of all the pairwise distances between data points inside the cluster, or it could as well be the distance of each data point from the cluster centroid. Each of these formulations are mathematically shown below: Let Ci be a cluster of vectors. Let x and y be any two n dimensional feature vectors assigned to the same cluster Ci. : \\\\Delta_i = \\\\underset{x , y \\\\in C_i}{\\\\text{max}} d(x,y) , which calculates the maximum distance. : \\\\Delta_i = \\\\dfrac{2}{C_i (C_i - 1)} \\\\underset{x , y \\\\in C_i, x eq y}{\\\\sum} d(x,y) , which calculates the mean distance between all pairs. : \\\\Delta_i = \\\\dfrac{\\\\underset{x \\\\in C_i}{\\\\sum} d(x,\\\\mu)}{C_i} , \\\\mu = \\\\dfrac{\\\\underset{x \\\\in C_i}{\\\\sum} x}{C_i} , calculates distance of all the points from the mean. This can also be said about the intercluster distance, where similar formulations can be made, using either the closest two data points, one in each cluster, or the farthest two, or the distance between the centroids and so on. The definition of the index includes any such formulation, and the family of indices so formed are called Dunn-like Indices. Let \\\\delta(C_i,C_j) be this intercluster distance metric, between clusters Ci and Cj. Definition With the above notation, if there are m clusters, then the Dunn Index for the set is defined as: : \\\\mathit{DI}_m = \\\\frac{ \\\\underset{ 1 \\\\leqslant i < j \\\\leqslant m}{\\\\text{min}} \\\\left.\\\\delta(C_i,C_j)\\\\right.}{ \\\\underset{ 1 \\\\leqslant k \\\\leqslant m}{\\\\text{max}} \\\\left.\\\\Delta_k\\\\right.} . Explanation Being defined in this way, the DI depends on m, the number of clusters in the set. If the number of clusters is not known apriori, the m for which the DI is the highest can be chosen as the number of clusters. There is also some flexibility when it comes to the definition of d(x,y) where any of the well known metrics can be used, like Manhattan distance or Euclidean distance based on the geometry of the clustering problem. This formulation has a peculiar problem, in that if one of the clusters is badly behaved, where the others are tightly packed, since the denominator contains a 'max' term instead of an average term, the Dunn Index for that set of clusters will be uncharacteristically low. This is thus a worst case indicator, and has to be kept in mind. There are ready implementations of the Dunn index in some vector based programming languages like MATLAB, R and Apache Mahout.

The French army was commanded by the Vicomte de Turenne and the imperial army was led by Prince Alexandre- Hippolyte de Bournonville. While the imperial armies were in their winter quarters, Turenne split up his army and traveled through the Vosges mountains before reforming it near Belfort. This helped confuse his enemy and gave his troops a surprise advantage over his opponents in Mulhouse on December 29, leading to French victory. Background Hermann, Prince of Baden-Baden, 1628-1691; Imperial commander at Mulhouse During the 1667-1668 War of Devolution, France captured most of the Spanish Netherlands but under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, it was forced to relinquish most of these gains by the Triple Alliance between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden. Louis XIV now moved to break up the Alliance before making another attempt on the Spanish Netherlands. In return for large subsidies, Sweden would remain neutral but also attack its regional rival, Brandenburg-Prussia if it attempted to intervene. In 1670, Charles II of England signed the Treaty of Dover, agreeing to an alliance with France against the Dutch, and the provision of 6,000 English and Scottish troops for the French army.Lynn 1999, p. 109-110. It contained a number of secret provisions, not revealed until 1771, one being the payment by Louis to Charles of ¬£230,000 per year for the services of this Brigade.J. P. Kenyon, The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), pp. 67-68. When France invaded the Dutch Republic in May 1672, it seemed at first that they had achieved an overwhelming victory. However, by July the Dutch position had stabilised, while concern at French gains brought them support from Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and Charles II of Spain. In August 1672, an Imperial army entered the Rhineland and Louis was forced into another war of attrition around the French frontiers.Lynn 1999, p. 117. The French army in Germany was led by Turenne, (1611-1675), considered the greatest general of the period. Over the next two years, he won a series of victories over superior Imperial forces led by Alexander von Bournonville and Raimondo Montecuccoli, the one commander contemporaries considered his equal. After 1673, it became a largely defensive campaign, focused on protecting French gains in the Rhineland and preventing Imperial forces linking up with the Dutch. France was over- extended, a problem that increased when Denmark joined the Alliance in January, 1674, while England and the Dutch Republic made peace in the February Treaty of Westminster. The Rhine near Basel, just to the south of Mulhouse Although the main campaign of 1674 was fought in Flanders, an Imperial army opened a second front in Alsace.Chandler, 1980, 40. In September, Bournonville was allowed to cross the Rhine at Strasbourg, with over 40,000 men, a diplomatic coup for Emperor Leopold; despite being a Free Imperial city and technically part of the Holy Roman Empire, the city had previously been neutral and its bridge was a major crossing point. Bournonville now halted, waiting for another 20,000 men provided by Frederick William; once combined, they would overwhelm the smaller French army and invade eastern France.Chandler, 1984, 7; Lynn, 1999, 110-111, 131. The campaign that began in June 1674 and ended with his death in July 1675 has been described as 'Turenne's most brilliant campaign.' Despite being out-numbered, he attacked Bournonville on 4 October; the Battle of Entzheim was indecisive but Bournonville withdrew, entering winter quarters around Colmar, where he was reinforced by Frederick William's troops.David Chandler, Marlborough as Military Commander (Staplehurst, Kent: Spellmount, 1984), 7; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 110-111, 131. It was normal practice at this time to avoid active campaigning during the winter, but Turenne now went on the offensive. He took his forces south, using the Vosges mountains and various deceptions to screen his movements from the Imperial commanders; on 27 December, he reached Belfort, at the southern end of the Vosges.Richard Brooks, ed., Atlas of World Military History (New York: Barnes and Noble Books, 2000), 84; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 132-133. Battle The Vosges mountains, Belfort at the bottom, Mulhouse bottom right, Colmar above Turenne's arrival at Belfort took Bournonville by surprise; he hoped to take advantage of this by a prompt attack into Alsace, but the need to gather food forced the main French army to halt. Interrogation of prisoners told Turenne that the Imperial forces and their allies had orders to concentrate in two groupings, one at Colmar and the other at Altkirch. Turenne determined to force his way between the two groups by advancing through Mulhouse, then a free city associated with Switzerland. He could take with him only 3,000 cavalry. A small force of infantry was to follow as rapidly as practicable.Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Gustavus Adolphus: A History of the Art of War from its Revival After the Middle Ages to the End of the Spanish Succession War, with a Detailed Account of the Campaigns of the Great Swede, and of the Most Famous Campaigns of Turenne, Conde, Eugene, and Marlborough (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1890), II: 628-29; A Relation or Journal of the Campaigns of the Marechal de Turenne, in the Years One Thousand Six Hundred Seventy Four, and One Thousand Six Hundred Seventy Five; 'Til the Time of His Death.

Bournonville hoped to hold the line of the Ill River to gain time for his army to fully assemble. The delay in the French advance allowed an enemy vanguard to occupy Mulhouse before Turenne arrived. This was part of a cavalry detachment of over 5,000 men that was marching north from Altkirch toward Colmar under the command of Margrave Hermann of Baden-Baden. This cavalry included men of Austria, Baden, and Munster. As soon as Turenne's small force reached the Ill near Mulhouse on December 29, he ordered Marechal de Camp Rene de la Tour, Marquis de Montauban, to reconnoiter the enemy position with two squadrons of French cavalry. Turenne followed and, when he rejoined Montauban, they saw two enemy squadrons posted near the river and five more squadrons in support nearby.Dodge, Gustavus Adolphus, II: 629; A Relation or Journal, 69; Anselme de Sainte Marie, Histoire Genealogique et Chronologique de la Maison de France, (Paris: Firmin-Didot, 1879), 9.2: 63. As the river was fordable at this point, Turenne ordered Montauban to attack the foremost enemy squadrons. The battle quickly escalated as Turenne and the enemy commanders sent in reinforcements. Turenne deployed a particularly large force on his right flank, giving the impression that the whole French army was arriving. The French cavalry advanced with as much fanfare as possible, with trumpets blaring and cymbals crashing. Suddenly, the cuirassiers of the Emperor turned and fled into Mulhouse. This led the whole enemy force to withdraw in disorder in several directions; some fled toward Basel to take refuge in Switzerland. Turenne had lost 60 men, including Montauban who had been captured. Sources disagree on the enemy's losses, but the casualties appear to have numbered at least 300.Dodge, Gustavus Adolphus, II: 629; A Relation or Journal, 69; de Perini, Batailles Francaises, V: 133-134. Dodge reports 300 men lost, whereas de Perini lists 300 dead and 1,000 taken prisoner; the latter figures seem inflated for a relatively small engagement. Aftermath Turenne returned to his main force at Belfort. The French army was finally ready to resume its advance in the first days of January. Turenne now marched on the enemy headquarters at Colmar. Nearby, he would win a decisive victory at the Battle of Turckheim that would force the Imperial army out of Alsace.Dodge, Gustavus Adolphus, II: 628; A Relation or Journal, 68. Mulhouse has grown into a city of over 100,000. As a result, the fields and fords of the 1674 battlefield largely have been obscured by cityscape.http://www.mulhouse.fr/fr/mulhouse-en- chiffres (accessed September 18, 2015).

(2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Genus Dauciconus Cotton, 1945 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is conical to elongate conical in shape. The protoconch is multispiral with 2.5 whorls, and the whorl tops are often concave and nodules usually do not persist on later whorls. The anal notch is deep to moderately deep. The periostracum is tufted, and the operculum is small to medium sized. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radula is roughly equal to the posterior section. The blade is fairly long and covers at least half the length of the anterior section of the radular tooth. A basal spur is present, and the barb is short. The radular tooth has serrations and the terminating cusp is internal. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the West Atlantic and Eastern Pacific regions. ::Feeding habits :::These species are presumed to be vermivorous (meaning that they prey on marine worms) based upon the aspect of the radular tooth.

It is currently referred to in English as Chicken Ramen by the company.https://www.nissin.com/en_jp/brands/ The product is sold in Japan with small amounts exported overseas by distributors. History Invention and early popularity Instant noodles were invented by Taiwanese-Japanese inventor Momofuku Ando in Japan. It was first marketed on 25 August 1958 by Ando's company, Nissin, under the brand name Chikin Ramen. Ando developed the production method of flash frying noodles after they had been made, creating the \\"instant\\" noodle. This dried the noodles and gave them a longer shelf life, even exceeding that of frozen noodles. Each noodle block was pre- seasoned and sold for 35 yen. Initially, due to its price and novelty, Chikin Ramen was considered a luxury item, as Japanese grocery stores typically sold fresh noodles for one-sixth their price. Despite this, instant noodles eventually gained immense popularity, especially after being promoted by Mitsubishi Corporation. Description Unlike Nissin's other noodles, the ramen does not have seasoning packets but are contained within the noodle itself.

This may be laminating film, packing film, agricultural covering film, bags or film for textiles and clothing, and other packing material. Technical information Parts include: screw and barrel, motor, inverter, heaters, die head, winder, and tower. The main motor may have frequency control of motor speed to improve speed regulation and save electricity. The screw and material barrel may be made from a nitrogen-treated chromium-molybdenum-aluminum alloy.http://www.sh-machinery.com/html_products/Double-head-Film-Blowing- Machine-Set-28.html  Process  At the beginning of the process, the polymer comes in the form of a pellet. it is heated and melted into a viscous liquid between rotating screws and barrels of the extruder. This allows for the polymer to be fed through a die that shapes it in the form of a tube. This tube is then carefully inflated, so there is no risk of tearing, into a bubble by injecting it with air. The bubble is simultaneously being cooled in its interior, via a cooling system, and on the exterior surface, through the use of an air ring, to solidify the material. A set of collapsing frames or guides are then used to collapse the bubble into two, more defined, layers within closer proximity. Now that the layers are close, a series of nip rollers flatten the layers together to form a two layered plastic film that are then winded up into a cylindrical roll for packaging purposes. This process may vary depending upon the specifications and models of the machines.  Bubble instabilities  In the case that the bubble formed from air injection is not handled with caution, the bubble may become unstable and deform in a number of different ways. * Draw resonance exists when the film velocity at which solidification occurs is much higher than the velocity of the melted liquid as it exits the die. This causes the melt to stretch too quickly and the bubble diameter starts to vary along its surface. One way to fix this situation is to increase the speed of the melt through the die. * Helical instability is noticeable when one side of the bubble is cooled more than the other due to the air ring. The bubble then starts to form a helical shape as it reaches the collapsing frames. This can be avoided by either lowering the melt temperature or increasing extruder output. * Freezeline height instability results in a variation of thickness of the bubble. This is caused by extruder motor amps and back pressure. To prevent this variation in thickness, improvements upon the feeding and melting of the material must be implemented. * Heavy-Bubble instability - Heavy-Bubble instability refers to the bubble sagging towards the bottom. When this occurs it means that the it is not being cooled enough. Lowering the freezeline height or lowering the melt temperature will assist the bubble in its cooling face causing less sag. * Bubble flutter appears below the freezeline when cool air impinges on the surface of the bubble. A higher freezline height, a lower melt temperature, and a narrower die gap can solve this problem. * Bubble breathing occurs when the volume of the air in the bubble keeps changing periodically. This causes a variation in film thickness. Some solutions include controlling the cooling system and sensors, a reduction of melt temperatures, or decreasing extruder output. * Bubble tear appears as a tear in the bubble, which happens when the force needed to draw up the bubble into the nip rollers is higher than the tensile strength of the melted film. A simple solution to this is to reduce extruder output or increase the die and melt temperature.

She was born in 1916 into an overseas Chinese family living in Trinidad. Her years as a dance teacher and educator helped China build a generation of dancers, choreographers, and educators. She is known in China as the \\"Mother of Chinese Modern Dance\\" for her contributions to the field of dance in China, including her early articulation of three core commitments that shaped dance in China during the second half of the twentieth century. Early life Dai Ailian was born in Couva, Trinidad to a third generation Chinese family, whose origins were in Xinhui, Guangdong Province. Born Eileen Isaac she never knew her family's Chinese surname as her paternal grandfather was given the surname Isaac upon his arrival in Trinidad. She used the name Eileen Isaac until her move to England when her teacher Anton Dolin asked her for her Chinese surname. Her mother selected the surname Dai after her father's nickname Ah Dai. Influenced by her mother, who loved music, even when she was very small she liked to dance. She began studying ballet in Trinidad from the age of 7. In 1931 at the age of 15, Dai Ailian moved to London to further her study of ballet under former Ballets Russes dancer Anton Dolin where she danced alongside Alicia Markova. 1930s London was a hub for major ballet talent and she also studied with Marie Rambert and Margaret Craske, the foremost discipline of Enrico Cecchetti. Inspired by German expressionist modern dancers, she joined the classes of Lesley Burrows-Goossens, one of the few modern dancers teaching in London at the time. She went on to study modern dance at Jooss Modern Dance School on full scholarship after it relocated to London. There she learned the theory and techniques developed by Rudolf von Laban including Labanotation, which she was later enthusiastic in spreading in China. In London Dai saw Indian dancer Uday Shankar as well as Japanese, and Javanese dances, but no Chinese dances, which inspired her to want to create Chinese dances. When she left London at the end of 1939 for China she spoke no Chinese. In this period, she choreographed a number of works, including a solo dance called Yang Guifei's Dance before the Emperor that she created in 1936 based on her interpretation of the famous concubine, a historical character that Dai learned about at the British Museum Library. Founding of modern Chinese dance In 1937, Dai performed in benefit concerts in London organized by the China Campaign Committee to raise funds for the Hong Kong-based China Defense League, which was headed by Soong Ching-ling, wife of Sun Yat-sen. After reading the book Red Star Over China by Edgar Snow during the Japanese invasion of China, she travelled to Hong Kong with the help of Soong in 1940. While in Hong Kong, she premiered her work East River in January 1941 in one of the concerts to raise funds for the war effort against Japanese invasion. After Hong Kong was attacked by Japan, she traveled to mainland China, where she participated in charity concerts and studied Chinese folk dances and operas. She created pieces based on folk traditions such as The Drum of the Yao People and The Old Piggybacking the Young. This was in line with her theorizing that dance should be rooted in local performance forms. Apart from creating, choreographing, performing dance pieces, she also taught dance all over China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Dai Ailian was at the center of the push to create new dance institutions. In 1949 she was named deputy director of the Central Song and Dance Ensemble, and in 1954 she became the principal of the new Beijing Dance Academy. She also served as director and adviser to the Central Ballet of China, and was the vice-chairman of the Chinese Dancers' Association. This period also saw the broadening of her artistic path. In the early 1950s, she became involved in the first ballet to be created in China: Dove of Peace, and was its leading performer in the piece. Dances with strong national flavor she created based on her studies of Chinese traditional dances, such as the Lotus Flower Dance, Flying Apsaras, Longing for Home, The Mute Carries the Cripple, Tibetan Spring, Anhui Folk Dance, and For Sale, became her trademark works. Two dances in particular, Dance of Lotus Flowers (based on a Shaanxi folk dance) and Flying Apsaras (inspired by the Dunhuang murals), received acclaim both at home and abroad and were awarded the gold prize at the World Youth Festival. These two dances were designated classics of 20th century Chinese dance by authoritative dance organizations in the 1990s. During the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976), performances of classical dances as well as some folk dances were not allowed in China. After it ended, China opened up to the world the 1980s, Dai again became influential in Chinese dance circle and was active in the international dance communities. She introduced renowned dancers such as Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn to teach in China, and she also promoted Chinese dancers around the world. Starting in the 1980s, she led Chinese dance troupes to international dance competitions, worked as a judge in many such international events, and attended many international dance forums. In 1982, she was appointed vice-chairman of the International Dance Council, an organisation within UNESCO, and attended its council meetings in Paris every year until her death on February 9, 2006. Personal life Dai Ailian with her first husband Ye Qianyu and stepdaughter Ye Mingming Dai met her first husband, the painter Ye Qianyu, shortly after arriving in Hong Kong in 1940. They married in January 1941 in Chongqing, however they divorced in 1956, and she later remarried. In 1941 Dai underwent surgery in Hong Kong that left her sterile and unable to have children of her own. Dai divorced her second husband in 1967. Dai stayed single the rest of her life, and said when asked if she felt lonely in 1982: \\"Life is interesting with its ups and downs. I am always occupied, so I have no time to feel lonely.\\" Choreographic Work London 1935-1939 * Beggar. Chinese dance (Solo). 1935 * March (Chinese: ÂâçËøõ ) .

Location Vlaardingen is a city in the Netherlands in the western outskirts of Rotterdam, on the north bank of the Maas River, and the Vlaardingse Vaart Bridge is located in the outskirts of Vlaardingen. It links two Vlaardingen suburbs, Holy-Zuid on the east side of the bridge and Broekpolder on the west side. The bridge has a span of 45 meters across the Vlaardingse Vaart, a canal that runs north from Vlaardingen to Schipluiden. Design The bridge's truss is made of 400 steel tubes, welded together and painted red (the color has since rapidly fadedPeter Spek, 'De Wokkel over Vlaardingse Vaart is aan een onderhoudsbeurt toe', Groot Vlaardingen, March 8, 2019.). The truss's rectangular cross-section twists through a 90 degree angle along the span of the bridge, so that it is nearly horizontal at both ends of the bridge but diamond-shaped in the bridge's center. This design creates an illusion from some points of view that the bridge has collapsed, but it also serves a functional purpose, damping vibrations from traffic on the bridge. History The bridge was designed by Dutch firm West 8 beginning in 2005, with structural engineering consultation from another firm, ABT. It was prefabricated and then lifted into place in early 2009, and officially opened in April 2009.

The first Sibal was hand-built by brothers Choi Mu-seong, Choi Hae-seong and Choi Soon-seong, based on the famous Willys Jeep. Initial demands for Sibal were low. However, after winning a presidential award, production began to flourish. Overview A replica Sibal constructed by an unknown museum. First produced in 1955, the Sibal was initially hand-built using mostly imported parts, and a body shell made from old oil drums. Based on the Willys Jeep, production was slow until the vehicle gained a presidential award, whereupon it became a relatively popular choice for Korean taxi firms. In 1962 the Korean government instigated The Automobile Industry Protection Act, forcing foreign manufacturers to create partnerships with existing automotive companies. As a result early versions of companies such as Kia, SsangYong and others gained cheap inroads to Korea, and the Sibal was discontinued in 1963.

Bogdan (December 16, 1918 ‚Äì March 27, 2011) was the founder of S.E. Custom Built, a company dedicated to the handmade construction of fly reels. Bogdan was born in Nashua, NH and lived there throughout his entire life.Keller, Mitch, [\\"Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92\\"], \\"New York Times\\", April 2001 He became interested in fly fishing at an early age when he began receiving outdated copies of a hunting and fishing magazine from a local sports retailer. At age 13, Bogdan was tying his own flies and would then become immersed in the sport.Hilyard, Graydon R., \\"Bogdan\\", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006 Upon graduating high school, Bogdan began work at Rollins Engine Company, a local engines manufacturer in Nashua. Later on, while working as a machinist, he began constructing some of the first prototypes for his reels. Stanley Bogdan died on March 27, 2011 and is survived by his son Stephen, and his daughter Cheryl Doughty. His wife Phyllis died in 1995.Keller, Mitch, [\\"Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92\\"], \\"New York Times\\", April 2001 While standing on the shore of one of his favorite rivers; The Grand Cascapedia, Mr Bogdan smiled and said: \\"I'd die if I could not fish anymore\\" shortly after Mr. Bogdan could no longer fish he succumbed to pancreatic cancer. 2009 S.E. Custom Built S.E. Custom Built fly reels are primarily known for their ability to greatly reduce drag.Keller, Mitch, [\\"Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much- Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92\\"], \\"New York Times\\", April 2001 This is mostly attributed to Bogdan's unique concept of the double-break shoe, known as the hallmark of any Bogdan reel. The company is mostly focused on the production of salmon reels, however there have been a few trout reel models made.Hilyard, Graydon R., \\"Bogdan\\", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006 Company History It wasn't until 1955 that Bogdan sold his first set of reels. At the New England Sportsmen's Show, he received $150 from Julian Crandall for a set of 10 reels (one of which Crandall gave to professional baseball player, Ted Williams). That same year Bogdan would make a deal with Abercrombie & Fitch, one of the day's leading marketers of sport's goods, for a set of 40 reels.Hilyard, Graydon R., \\"Bogdan\\", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006 The deal provided that: #Three different models were to be made: 100M, 200M, 300M #An identification code was to be stamped on each reel foot #Anodized gloss black for the reel feet and handles to be used instead of the aluminum serpentine #The reels would sell at $100 retail price granting Bogdan 60% of all salesHilyard, Graydon R., \\"Bogdan\\", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006 At this time, Bogdan would retire work at the factories and begin working entirely on his reel making company. From 1957 to 1977, S.E. Custom Built would have a relationship with Orvis including a deal similar to the one with Abercrombie & Fitch. The Orvis reels differed slightly because they decided to use Bogdan's original aluminum serpentine colors. Bogdan reels have since been marketed by many of the industry's major tackle merchants.Hilyard, Graydon R., \\"Bogdan\\", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006 Eventually demands came for a trout reel in the Bogdan style, so S.E. Custom Built released a 5-weight single-action, non-adjustable, pawl-drag reel in 1976. Demands would come for similar 3-, 4-, and 6-weight reels as well.Hilyard, Graydon R., \\"Bogdan\\", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006 Stephen Bogdan, Stanley's son, would join S.E. Custom Built in September 1973. Stephen purchased the company and became the sole owner in 1996.Keller, Mitch, [\\"Stanley Bogdan, Maker of Much-Coveted Fly Reels, is Dead at 92\\"], \\"New York Times\\", April 2001 Reels Two qualities of Bogdan reels that they are most known for are Bogdan's signature double- brake shoe and the 10 position lever provided that is used to regulate drag. They also have black anodized side plates with a pale gold anodized frame.Marchant, Douglas, \\"The Bogdan Story\\", \\"West Slope\\" The prices of a Bogdan reel range from $1,500 to $2,400, depending on the type of fish one plans to catch with it. Each Bogdan reel was handcrafted by either Stanley or Stephen.Hilyard, Graydon R., \\"Bogdan\\", Frank Amato Publications Portland, Oregon, 2006 These reels are in very high demand and it is not uncommon for one to wait several years to receive their order.

Education Owen was born in Oswestry, a few miles from the Welsh border within Shropshire, in the third quarter (ie July to September) of 1857,, son of George Owen (1827-1901), and educated at Oswestry School.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. Owen's father, listed on the same page of the work, was an earlier Shropshire county cricketer. He attended Trinity College, Oxford from where he graduated with a B.A. degree in 1878. He was selected to represent Oxford University against Cambridge at football but was unable to play because of illness, thus missing out on a \\"blue\\". Football career Described as \\"a fine athlete and a noted exponent of the dribbling game\\", Owen first played football for Oswestry in 1876, but his appearances were rather intermittent, as they were interrupted by his academic studies. In January 1879, he was one of nine players from Oswestry (including three who were spending a season with Oswestry as their own club, Druids, was temporarily without a ground) who was selected to represent Wales against England in the first international match between the two countries. The match was played at the Kennington Oval on 18 January and was shortened to two halves of only 30 minutes each because of the heavy snowfall. The match report in The Times said \\"In spite of the fact that a thick layer of snow covered Kennington-oval on Saturday, the match between England and Wales, announced for that day, was played.\\" England scored twice in the first half, with William Davies scoring the Wales reply in the 47th minute. Owen also represented North Wales against Sheffield in 1877 and against Lancashire in 1879, and Shropshire against Staffordshire in 1879.

They may be identified from archaeological remains, historical and ethnographic information or continuing oral traditions and encompass places where rituals and ceremonies were performed, occupation sites where people ate, slept and carried out their day to day chores, and ephemeral evidence of people passing through the landscape, such as a discarded axe head or isolated artefact. Victorian Aboriginal sites include shell middens, scarred trees, cooking mounds, rock art, burials, ceremonial sites and innumerable stone artefacts. These stone flakes represent the tools Aboriginal people used, such as knives, spear points, scrapers and awls, and the waste material left behind when they were made. Commonly referred to as stone artefact scatters such sites can be found on the surface or exposed by ploughing or erosion, or through careful archaeological excavation. Types of sites Scarred trees result from removing bark for the manufacture of shields, coolamons, shelters and other utensils can be found where appropriate species of tree of sufficient age survive. Some trees were marked with designs and symbols. A large river red gum with a canoe scar is located at Heide Gallery in Bulleen. Scar tree from removal of bark for a shield, near Wahgunyah There have been more than 60 rock art sites identified in the Grampians National Park which contains about 80% of the known Aboriginal rock art sites in Victoria, with a number of new discoveries after the fires of January 2006.Brochure, Grampians National Park (Gariwerd), Victoria , Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Accessed 25 November 2008 They depict humans, human hands, animal tracks and birds, while some are open to the public and are readily accessible including: Billimina (Glenisla shelter), Jananginj Njani (Camp of the Emu's Foot), Manja (Cave of Hands), Larngibunja (Cave of Fishes), Ngamadjidj (Cave of Ghosts, from the word Ngamadjidj), and Gulgurn Manja (Flat Rock). Nearby Bunjil's Shelter, which illustrates Bunjil, the creator, is in the Black Range near Stawell. A painting thought to be of a thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) is noted from Mt Pilot and the paintings at Mudgegonga rock shelter in north- eastern Victoria are possibly 3500 years old. A small part of the Wurdi Youang stone arrangement Ceremonial sites are rare, but two large stone arrangements have been found at Wurdi Youang near Mount Rothwell and Carisbrook. others have been identified from Oral tradition, although archaeological remains are no longer evident such as the Corroboree Tree at Richmond oval was a significant gathering place for the Wurundjeri people. A number of earth rings have been identified in Sunbury,Frankel, David 1982 Earth rings at Sunbury, Victoria. Archaeology in Oceania 17:83-89 which, although lacking historical or ethnographic evidence, have been interpreted as ceremonial Bora rings. Mount William Quarry Evidence of stone quarrying is rare, but the Mount William stone axe quarryArchaeological site at Mount William Lancefield Australia, Romsey Australia is one of a number of stone sources used for making tools which were traded long distances throughout central and western Victoria and into New South Wales.Coutts, P.J.F. & Miller, R (1977). The Mt. William archaeological area. Melbourne: Victorian Archaeological Survey, Government Printer Only a relatively small number of burials have been identified in Victoria, most of which are associated with sand dunes along the coast or in the north west of the state. Kow Swamp is particularly significant for evidence of 13000 year old burial rituals using a headband of kangaroo incisors similar to those worn by Aboriginal people until recently, and for consistent burial practices over a long period. A burial on the banks of the Werribee river has been dated to about 7300 years ago. Shell middens occur along most of the coastline and some lake-shores and river banks. Most of these were relatively recent (due to the mobile nature of sand) such as Seal Point and Moonlight Head in the Otway Ranges, although some like Mallacoota Inlet in eastern Gippsland have been dated to more than 2500 years ago, and Wilsons Promontory 6500 years ago. Large earth mounds were built up by deliberate transport of soil and the remains of clay heat retainers in hearths, the collapse of seasonally abandoned turf huts and camp activities. Examples have been found on the Hopkins River flood plain in central western Victoria, and in the Nyah Forest, the oldest is dated to about 2500 years ago.Peter Coutts and Jane Wesson, Victoria Archaeological Survey Summer Schools in Archaeology: An Evaluation, Australian Archaeology No. 11 (Dec., 1980), pp. 19‚Äì127 Fish and eel traps were constructed on many rivers, and while most were probably of organic materials and have left little trace, some, such as at Lake Condah in western Victoria reveal complex systems of excavated channels and stone weirs, dated to 3000 years ago. Stone artefacts found near the bones of now extinct megafauna at Lancefield in central Victoria have suggested Aboriginal people were living alongside giant marsupials 26,000 years ago. While rock shelters are often the sites of cave painting and other art, they also provide deeply stratified occupation deposits because they are protected from erosion. New Guinea II cave on the Snowy River near Buchan has deposits more than 10 000 years old along with delicate cave paintings and engravings. Rock shelters were occupied in the Cape Bridgewater area about 12,000 years ago. Cloggs Cave rock shelter near Buchan, Victoria was occupied about 18,000 years ago, where bone tools and animal remains were found. At the Keilor Archaeological Site a human hearth excavated in 1971 was radiocarbon-dated to about 31,000 years BP, making Keilor one of the earliest sites of human habitation in Australia, while at Box Gully on Lake Tyrrell, emu eggs and other artefacts have been dated to 27,000 years ago.Josephine Flood, Pleistocene Human Occupation and Extinct Fauna in Cloggs Cave, Buchan, South-east Australia Nature 246, 303 (30 November 1973); , Department of Prehistory, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University, Box 4, PO, Canberra, ACT 2600 Stone artefact scatters are among the most common site types and provide evidence of tool use and manufacture. These are often extensive surface scatters and deep stratified deposits of flaked finegrained stone, of lithic flakes. Much of this material is waste flakes, discarded during the manufacture process. Specific types of artefacts such as blades, scrapers or burins may indicate what the area was used for, for example processing animal skins. Stone artefact material is usually rine grained silcrete, chert, and quartz. Hornfels is an unusual and rare material, but is highly distinctive. Age and chronology Archaeological evidence points to people first arriving in Australia around 50,000 years ago and in Victoria shortly after. Sites over 22,000 years old have been found at Kow Swamp Archaeological Site and the Keilor archaeological site.Gary Presland, Keilor Archaeological Site, eMelbourne website. Accessed 3 November 2008 A cranium found at the site has been dated at between 12,000Peter Brown, The Keilor Cranium , Peter Brown's Australian and Asian Palaeoanthropology, Accessed 3 November 2008 and 14,700 years BP. The oldest archaeological site in the greater Melbourne area, and one of the most important, is at Keilor on the Maribyrnong River. A human skull discovered there in 1940 was later found to be around 13 000 years old, older than any other human remains found in Australia up to that time, and the find attracted worldwide attention. After small excavations in the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists from La Trobe University and the Victoria Archaeological Survey (VAS) began an excavation that continued for five years finding a sequence of stone tools and butchered animal bone. Occupation patterns Whilst most evidence of Aboriginal settlement is derived from camp sites where fireplaces, remains of stone tool making and sometimes structures such as mounds and huts can be found, and these sites are almost always located close to reliable water sources, the distribution of Aboriginal archaeological sites demonstrates occupation of all the climatic zones in Victoria, even during the extreme global climatic conditions at the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum when temperatures were colder, vast amounts of surface water were frozen in glaciers and sea levels were lower. Around 18,000 BP sea levels were about 65 metres below present day levels,John Mulvaney & Johan Kamminga, Prehistory of Australia, Washington, D.C. : Smithsonian Institution Press,1999 while archaeological evidence has shown that people were present in south‚Äêeastern Australia throughout all of the climatic changes of at least the last 30,000 years ranging from the deep gorges and highlands of East Gippsland such as at Clogg's Cave,Josephine Flood, Archaeology of the Dreamtime, J.

Influences and themes  thumb Jillian Tamaki photographed in 2017 in Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, Canada at the Drawn & Quarterly Bookstore. Tamaki read Archie comics and newspaper strips as a child. She submitted outfit designs into contests for Betty & Veronica comics. Her parents also had anthologies of other popular comics, including Far Side, Calvin and Hobbes, and Herman. In high school she made zines for fun, but she had stopped reading comics after outgrowing Archie. Her interest in alternative and indie comics began while she attended college. Some of her favorite comics during this time include Bipolar by Tomer Hanuka and Asaf Hanuka, a few Drawn and Quarterly artists including Julie Doucet, Chester Brown, Seth, Michel Rabahliati, as well as books by Will Eisner. She began making mini-comics after graduating in 2003, and her very first mini-comic appears in her first book, Gilded Lilies. Tamaki often acknowledges her influences as inspirations for beginning her work as they helped her learn the basics of cartooning. As a self-proclaimed feminist, Tamaki is often questioned about the role this plays in her work. She also grew up in an area of Canada where she was the only mixed-race child in her school. In multiple interviews, Tamaki explains that her identity shapes the lens that she sees through, but she does not make conscious effort to work these themes into her illustrations and designs. She is interested in the female experience and viewing women as whole human beings in an industry that often sexualized women‚Äôs bodies. Being shaped by feminism and race, her work aims to include diverse characters that readers can better identify with. Career Gilded Lilies (2006) is Tamaki's first published book and is a collection of Tamaki's illustrations and comic strips. The first part of the book comprises a carefully selected assemblage of paintings, personal drawings, illustrations and comics.

In 2015, Drawn and Quarterly published SuperMutant Magic Academy, a collection of Tamaki's web comic of the same name from 2010 to 2014. Previously, these comics won an Ignatz Award in 2012 for Outstanding Online Comic.http://mutantmagic.com/about In June 2017, Drawn and Quarterly published Tamaki's graphic novel Boundless, a collection of short stories. The book received rave reviews. A review in The Atlantic described the book as \\"an ambitious and eclectic set of tales, [that] focuses on the interior lives of unexpected subjects.\\" Other reviews called Boundless a \\"picture-perfect\\" collection and as \\"a showcase for Tamaki‚Äôs mercurial style.\\" NPR and Publisher's Weekly named Boundless as one of the best graphic novels of the year. Tamaki hand-embroidered three book covers for Penguin. The covers were designed for three classic literature books: Emma by Jane Austen, The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett, and Black Beauty by Anna Sewell. In her free time, she also makes quilts as a hobby.  Controversy  Tamaki became the centre of controversy when Mariko Tamaki alone was nominated for the Governor General's Literary Award for Skim. The comics community and others circulated an open letter to the Awards Committee that argued for Tamaki as a co-nominee, which was signed by notable comics artists such as Lynda Barry, Dan Clowes, and Julie Doucet.Tousley, Nancy (November 15, 2008). \\"Artist left out by awards\\".

Mariko attended Havergal College, an all girls' secondary school. She studied English literature at McGill University, graduating in 1994.\\"As comics become a cultural force, McGill graduates are making their mark\\" . McGill News, 17 June 2009. Career Tamaki has worked as a writer and performance artist in Toronto, including with Keith Cole's Cheap Queers and in the performance group Pretty Porky & Pissed Off with Joanne Huffa, Allyson Mitchell, Abi Slone, Tracy Tidgwell and Zoe Whittall.\\"Quirky Queers\\". NOW, 16 June 2005. Tamaki published the novel Cover Me in 2000. It is a \\"poignant story about an adolescent coping with depression\\". Told in a series of flashbacks, it is about a teenager dealing with cutting and feeling like an outsider in school. Skim, a collaboration with her cousin Jillian Tamaki, published in 2008 by Groundwood Books, is a graphic novel about a teenage girl and her romantic feelings towards her female teacher; the reciprocity of those feelings remains unclear in the text. The other central story is about the suicide of a classmate's ex-boyfriend who may have been gay. The text is fundamentally \\"about living in the moments of wrenching transition ...[and] the conflicting need to belong and desire to resist\\". Tamaki says she did not set out to \\"make a statement about queerness and youth\\": \\"Skim's in love, and kisses a woman, but heck, she's just a kid. She could go on to kiss many people in her future - some of them might be dudes, who knows? I think Skim is more a statement about youth, and the variety of strange experiences that can encapsulate.\\" According to one reviewer, \\"the expressionistic fluidity of the black and white illustrations serves the purpose of pages of prose\\"; there is little plot and spare dialogue. Tamaki writes that artists such as Herg√©, Igort and Vittorio Giardino as well as Asian art had an influence on her style but her storytelling was rooted in American comics like Daniel Clowes, Chester Brown, and Will Eisner. Skim was originally developed as a short play for Nightwood Theatre.\\"Skim, a beautiful graphic novel\\". Xtra!, 13 March 2008. Emiko Superstar, Tamaki's second graphic novel and first with illustrator Steve Rolston, is about a young woman who feels trapped in her suburban life. It was inspired by performance art and Girlspit, an open mic night event in Montreal. The protagonist is inspired to try performance art after visiting such a space. As one review says, \\"this is a story about finding oneself, one's voice, and one's true character amidst the trappings of counter-culture fame\\". In 2014 Tamaki again collaborated with her cousin Jillian Tamaki, on the graphic novel This One Summer, published by Groundwood Books. In 2016 it was announced that Tamaki would be writing a new Hulk series starring She-Hulk for Marvel Comics, and the mini-series Supergirl: Being Super for DC Comics. In 2017 she began writing novel adaptations of the Lumberjanes comic series.https://ew.com/books/2017/03/01/lumberjanes-unicorn-power-mariko- tamaki-brooke-allen/ Tamaki's graphic novel collaboration with artist Rosemary Valero-O'Connell, Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up with Me was released in May 2019 by First Second Books.

It was not a rock shelter, but a jumble of granite boulders or tors. These tors happened to create a shelter-like area. Due to poor land management in the 19th and 20th century associated with cotton farming, the shelter floor area is now underneath at least a meter deep of red clay and silt mud. The Native Americans at the site were most likely Hitchiti in ancestry.  Discovery  The Punk Rock Shelter was discovered by Greg Paulk and Dean Wood on November 15, 1974. They discovered it while conducting the Wallace Reservoir Archaeological Survey.  Excavation  On November 18, John Doolin accompanied Paulk and Chester DePratter to excavate a 1 by 2 meter deep trench between the back wall and the front entrance of the shelter. On November 20, Wood and DePratter returned to excavate a midden in the trench. On November 21, Wood and DePratter brought Paulk and Doolin to extend the trench 1 meter north, making it a 1 by 3 meter trench. On November 22, all four returned to do a detailed excavation of the eastern part of the trench with photographs, drawings, and backfill. The final excavation of the site was proposed in spring of 1977 within the Wallace Reservoir sites listed to be \\"more thoroughly excavated.\\" From June 14 to August 10 in 1978, Mark Williams led this final excavation, and it was an expansion on DePratter's 1974 excavation. According to this final excavation, the maximum size of the shelter is 7.5 meters long and 4.5 meters wide. The most peculiar find during this excavation was a large amount of quartz pebbles (usually found alongside concentrated areas of potsherds). These quartz pebbles were red. In Williams's previous research, he shows that red quartz usually meant that the pebbles were directly exposed to fire potentially for the use of indirect heating.  Dating  Through the analyses of the ceramic vessels and potsherds, the site dates to the Lamar and Savannah periods of the overarching Mississippian Period. The Punk Rock Shelter is the only known site producing a large collection of vessels from the Lamar and Savannah periods in the Oconee Valley. The vessels found in the Punk Rock Shelter span over a single phase (Scull Shoals) in the Savannah period and all four phases of the Lamar period (Duvall, Iron Horse, Dyar, and Bell). Traditional seriation was used to determine the dates of the Mississippian phases. Overall, the potsherds and the site would fall in between A.D. 1250 ‚Äì A.D. 1650. Distribution-wise in concern to the potsherds over the span of phases, Williams' report shows that potsherds were relatively evenly present in all the phases. This provides evidence that the shelter was used consistently over 400 years.  Usage  Potsherds show that site was used repeatedly over a long period of time. There was a lack of flora and faunal remains (other than burnt wood), lithic material, and structural remains making it unlikely that people lived or stayed there for long periods at a time. There was a large number of red quartz pebbles in correlation to areas with large amounts of potsherds. Williams recognizes that there are six potential explanations behind the usage of the Punk Rock Shelter: # A normal habitation area # A seasonal habitation area # A pottery production area # A spring site # A clay source # A \\"ceremonial\\" area Williams discounts the first five hypotheses and supports the last one based on his research. The actual ceremony that occurred at the site is still up for debate. There were no human remains or cremations found at the site. However, Williams does propose hypotheses. Although the people of the site were Hitchiti, they shared a lot of similar traditions with the Cherokee. The site, being between water (Riley Shoals and the Oconee River), would have drawn in Cherokee-like ceremonies for two reasons‚Äîthe plentiful food around water and the wariness the people had of rivers. This could have been a site where people would gather and teach the next generation the dangers of the shoals and rivers. Another applicable Cherokee tradition would have been sweat baths. Ceremonial sweat baths was considered a medical cure to diseases. Additionally, by \\"going into water,\\" Cherokee considered this to be a religious experience in itself. The Punk Rock Shelter could have easily been a site for sweat baths. The water-worn and red pebbles could have been used to heat up the bath. There would only be a need for a few skins to keep the steam in the shelter. The large rocks could have been seats for people or had fires built around the bases heating them. The pottery vessels could hold hot water, and the Oconee River is conveniently there for people to jump in and cool-off.

After a flood destroyed their house, the Crocketts moved to the Morristown, Tennessee area (1792) and built a tavern on a newly constructed stage road between Abingdon, Virginia and Knoxville, Tennessee. The Crockett Tavern Museum now stands on the site, housed in a reconstruction of the tavern. Young \\"Davy\\" helps out In 1798, when David was 12, Crockett hired him out to Jacob Siler to drive cattle. After young David fulfilled his original obligation to Siler, he returned to his father's home. The family sent Davy to a school that had been established nearby, but he did not like school and quit attending after a few days. The elder Crockett was drunk when he learned his son was avoiding school and he punished Davy severely, leading him to flee and stay away for years. David Crockett returned in 1802 and helped pay off his father's debts. Death It's not clear when Crockett died, though some genealogies have his year of death as 1834.

Biography He graduated in medicine on 3 March 1967 and over the years achieved three specializations: in 1971 in clinical orthopaedics and traumatology, in 1973 in orthopaedic physical therapy and in 1980 in sports medicine. He is the son of :it:Checco Costa who was one of the leading organisers of international motorcycle racing and the creator of the Imola circuit. His commitment in rescuing pilots starts right on the circuit of Imola, on 22 April 1957, when he saved the life of Geoff Duke, after a disastrous fall on the curve of the \\"mineral waters\\" while he was competing in the 500 class of the Golden Shell Cup on his Gilera. On that occasion, the young Claudio Costa managed to rescue the pilot dragging him off the track, and removed the bike out of it as well since it would have been a dangerous obstacle. During the Imola 200, organized by his father in 1972, Claudio Costa and his young colleagues (all good friends and fans of motorcycling) volunteered to provide emergency first aid to the pilots in the event of a fall or a crash. The innovative service became so popular that the pilots tried to convince the Dr. Costa and his team to follow them for the entirety of the championship. These young medics were so fond of motorbikes that ‚Äì as Costa himself admitted ‚Äì the team of doctors and physiotherapists was convinced \\"without too much toil\\". Among the first to realise the importance of having an expert on the track was Giacomo Agostini, who in 1974 wanted Dr. Costa at his side during the American debut at the Daytona 200. During the first year the service was carried out by car to reach the various circuits with medical bag in tow, but in 1976 Dr. Costa to imagined a vehicle specially equipped for first aid. This innovative idea was suggested to Gino Amisano, who fully funded the initiative and then created the now famous and celebrated \\"Mobile Clinic\\".

It does not have the rigid calcium carbonate skeleton possessed by the true corals but its stalks have an internal, axial skeleton which is stiffened by sclerites and covered by an outer layer, the coenenchyme. It has an upright growth habit with vertical, whip-like stems, sparsely branching near the base. These are uniform in colour, ranging from yellow and orange to shades of red and mauve. The polyps are arranged in several rows along both sides of each branch. They are translucent white and each has eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. The colony has a single siphonoglyph.

Distribution and habitat Leptogorgia virgulata is found growing on rocks at depths down to along the western fringes of the Atlantic Ocean. The range extends from Chesapeake Bay south to the Gulf of Mexico and the species also occurs in Brazil. It is found on shallow water reefs, and also in estuaries and bays as it can tolerate low levels of salinity. Biology The polyps are carnivores and extend their tentacles to catch zooplankton wafted past by the current. Colonies of Leptogorgia virgulata are gonochoristic, being either male or female. Gametes are released into the water column where they are fertilised. The larvae are planktonic and pass through a number of larval stages before settling on a suitable rocky substrate. Here they undergo metamorphosis and become feeding polyps which, in time, produce new polyps and develop into colonies. Mortality rates are high among new colonies.Reproduction in Octocorals (Subclass Octocorallia): A Review of Published Literature Anne Simpson, University of Maine. Retrieved 2011-12-05. Ecology Leptogorgia virgulata uses chemical defences to prevent algae, barnacles and bryozoans growing on the stalks. It exudes protective substances which inhibit settlement of larvae. These products have been investigated and are being considered for use as anti-fouling agents to prevent the growth of marine organisms on man-made structures. The snail Simnialena marferula feeds on debris around the coral and takes on the colour of the stems through assimilation of the pigments it contains. Larvae of the barnacle Conopea galeata tend to preferentially settle on the remains of the egg mass of the snail and the juvenile barnacle then becomes attached to the skeleton of the coral as the egg mass decays. In fact this barnacle is an obligate commensal and the coenenchyme of the coral grows to enclose it, leaving an aperture for the barnacle to feed and reproduce.Conopea galeata South Georgia University. Retrieved 2011-12-05. Leptogorgia virgulata sometimes grows in meadows of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum where it is often associated with the amphipod Caprella penantis. In winter, when the seagrass dies down, decapod crustaceans move into the area. The oyster Pteria colymbus is often found attached to the coral. Other animals are camouflaged to resemble the coral in shape or colour. These include the shrimp Neopontonides beaufortensis and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi, also known as the sea whip slug. It is colourless and its branching gills resemble the polyps on which it feeds. The sclerites and certain secondary metabolites produced by Leptogorgia virgulata deter predation by fish. One such metabolite has emetic properties and has been demonstrated to produce a learning response in fish.

Narry Kim is a South Korean biochemist and microbiologist, best known for her work on microRNA biogenesis. Her pioneering studies have laid the groundwork for the biology of microRNA and contributed to the improvement of RNA interference technologies. Background Kim was born in South Korea in 1969. Kim first became interested in science as a high school student. When asked why she chose science as a lifelong career, she said, ‚ÄúI was charmed by the simplicity of the principles underlying the complexity of life.‚Äù Education Kim went on to pursue a BA degree in microbiology, then followed by a M.Sc. degree in microbiology in 1992 and 1994, respectively, both from Seoul National University (SNU). After completing her masters under adviser Kang Sa-Ouk, Kim went to the United Kingdom to further her studies at the University of Oxford, studying the functions of retroviral proteins under Alan J. Kingsman. She graduated with a PhD in biochemistry in 1998. Career Her academic journey then took her to the United States, where she took a position at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia as a research assistant. After completing her postdoctoral research on mRNA surveillance in the laboratory of Gideon Dreyfuss, Kim finished her postdoctoral studies and returned to Korea in 2001. She then started working at Seoul National University as a research assistant professor. By the age of 35, Kim already had twenty-two of her papers published in well known and prestigious scientific publications, such as Science and Nature. In addition, Kim ‚Äúholds four patents based on her research activities, including one on a novel HIV-based gene delivery vector.‚Äù In 2008, she became an associate professor, then a SNU Distinguished Fellow in 2010, and a full professor in 2013. Located in Seoul National University, she began working with the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in 2012 as the founding director of the Center for RNA Research. her lab focuses on RNA-mediated gene regulation research, specifically investigating post-transcriptional gene regulation mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs). The lab employs biochemistry, molecular biology, genetic, biophysical, and computational approaches. Research is focused on miRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs involved in practically all working aspects of eukaryotic cells. Tight control of miRNA is vital to normal functioning cells. If dysregulated, miRNAs can often be linked to human diseases such as cancer. By focusing on the miRNA biogenesis, Dr. Kim's lab has made major contributions to the understanding of miRNAs are created and processed in animal cells. These studies can potentially open the doors to new forms of cancer treatment and stem cell engineering. In 2013, Kim, along with Professor Jin-Soo KIM of the SNU Department of Chemistry developed a new technology to eliminate specific microRNAs. This new technology has the promise of being potentially used to cure cancer and other illnesses in the future. In the research, TALENs (enzymes) were used to separate certain microRNA from a cell. TALENs had been used to create protein before, but this was the first time they have been used to separate microRNA. The team developed 540 different TALENs for this specific purpose. When this was applied to cancer cells, the proliferation rate of cancer cells dropped to one third of what it was. This discovery was published in the November 11, 2013 edition of Nature Structural and Molecular Biology. Kim's first paper as PI was published in 2002 in the EMBO Journal. In this highly cited work, she defined two separate processing steps (primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) processing in the nucleus and pre-miRNA processing in the cytoplasm), and proposed a model of the microRNA biogenesis pathway for the first time. Based on this model, her research group discovered that most microRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and that pri-miRNA processing is carried out by Drosha- DGCR8 complexes in the nucleus. Her research group further identified uridylation-meditated pre-miRNA degradation pathway by LIN28 and TUT4, contributing to a better understanding of how microRNA-mediated gene expression regulation is involved in embryonic stem cell maintenance and cancer cell development. She also discovered the molecular basis for pri-miRNA recognition and cleavage by the Drosha-DGCR8 complexes, and pre-miRNA processing by Dicer. These findings suggested several critical points to be considered for designing more efficient short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors and also contributed to the improvement of RNA interference technologies. The research team led by Narry Kim and Chang Hyeshik confirmed the predicted subgenomic RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 along with new RNA and dozens of unknown subgenomic RNAs. The interdisciplinary team was composed of virologists, microbiologists and computational scientists. Kim received L'Oreal-UNESCO Award for Women in Science (2008), Ho-Am Prize in Medicine (2009) and The Korea S&T; Award (2013). She is an active member of the RNA Society and the International Society of Stem Cell Research (ISSCR).

History In the 1920s, Frank Johnson, an assistant at the Sydney bookseller Dymocks, together with Norman Lindsay, his son Jack and Kenneth Slessor founded the arts and literary magazine, Vision. In July 1940 the Australian Government facing a US dollar shortage enforced a series of trade regulations and banned the importation of American comic material. This ban created the opportunity for local publishers and artists to enter into the market, creating what has been described as \\"the richest period in Australian literary history; thousands of titles were produced, millions of copies sold, and dozens of authors found gainful employment.\\" Despite wartime paper restrictions and lack of experienced comic book artists a local industry soon developed, with new publishing companies producing indigenous comic books. The first Frank Johnson Publication comic issued was Amazing, which was released in July 1941. Since wartime regulations prohibited the publication of new periodicals, Frank Johnson Publications published one-shot comics. They continued to release a new comic each week, which in order were Star, Marvel, Magic, Thrilling, Super, Mighty, Master, Victory, Winner, Conquer, Hero, Hot Shot, Crash, Thunder, Terrific, Ace, Bullet, Corker, Startling, Modern and Monster. They continued to change the title week after week and when they had exhausted their supply of titles they re-used the old titles by adding the prefix, 'New' (i.e. New Crash, New Magic etc.). Essentially Frank Johnson Publications were publishing four different comics a month and releasing one each week, with the stories in Amazing carrying on in Thrilling, Victory and Hot Shot; the stories in Star continuing in Super, Winner, Crash and so on. Most of the regular artists who worked for Frank Johnson Publications, were freelancers from The Bulletin, Smith's Weekly and other newspapers and included Unk White, Les Dixon, Norm Rice, Dan Russell, Bruce Cousins, Dick Alderton, Carl Lyon, Noel Cook, Frank Jessup, Rhys Williams, Ron Broadley, Phil Belbin, Stan Pitt, Gerard Lants, Moira Bertram, John Jensen, Peter Chapman, Lloyd Piper, Ralph Shelley and Emile Mercier. Generally the regular artists were paid 30 shillings per page and were guaranteed four to six pages a week. For some this represented a full week's wages, for others, particularly those moonlighting, it meant additional income. Whilst some artists handled their own storylines, the bulk of the early comics were written by Alfred Charles Headley (A. C. Headley or Alf or Chuck). Essentially after an artist had brought in their pages from the previous week they would confer with him, who would type a synopsis of the new story on the spot. The artist would then break down the story and supply or modify the dialogue as they saw fit. A similar approach would be taken by Stan Lee at the Marvel Comics Group thirty years later. Unk White was responsible for not only drawing the cover of the first comic but also the first adventure strip, \\"Blue\\" Hardy and Diamond Eyed Pygmies. Locally created comics, including Frank Johnson Publications, disappeared in the 1950s as a result of combined effect of import bans being lifted, a censorship campaign, and the introduction of television.

The first attack took place at the gate of a Shi'a shrine in Kabul and was caused by a suicide bomber. The second incident took place in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, where a bomb was affixed to a bicycle that exploded near a mosque shortly after the Kabul blast. The suicide blast in Kabul resulted in the deaths of more than 70 civilians, which included women and children, while the Mazar-i-Sharif blast claimed at least 4 lives. The third was in the southern city of Kandahar, where five people received injuries. The total number of dead in all the attacks reached about 80, while over 160 more were injured.  Attacks   Kabul  A suicide bomber attacked the Abu Fazl Mosque in the Murad Khane neighborhood of Kabul on 6 December 2011, which claimed more than 50 lives. Reports suggested that the suicide bomber was carrying a backpack and may have been full of explosives. The blast took place at around 12 noon (07 30 GMT) at the gate of the Abu Fazl shrine, which is a place mostly visited by Shias. Hundreds of Afghans had gathered to commemorate Ashura, the day on which Husayn ibn Ali the grandson of Muhammad along with 72 followers were murdered in Kerbala, Iraq. According to the statement released by Interior Ministry, a man wearing suicide vest blew himself up inside the shrine where Shi'ite mourners were observing the martyrdom of Hussayn.  Mazar-i-Sharif  The second bomb took place near the Blue Mosque in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, where four people were killed. The bomb was reportedly hidden on a bicycle, and went off shortly after the Kabul blast.  Victims  More than 70 people were killed following the explosion at the Abu Fazl Mosque in Kabul, while 4 people were killed in Mazar-i-Sharif, taking the total death toll to at least 74.Karzai Says Death Toll From Ashura Bombings Now At 80 Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

According to Mark Toner, spokesman for U.S. Department of State, \\"It's been responsible for many attacks within Pakistan. So it's clearly a threat to both countries, and it's precisely the kind of organisation that the secretary (of state) was trying to address when she went to Pakistan in calling for Pakistan to do more to combat this kind of extremist terrorist activity within its own borders.\\"US backs Karzai; UNSC slams attack In June 2012, two men from Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan named Rahim Gul and Habibullah confessed to transporting the suicide bomber from Peshawar, Pakistan. The Attorney General of Afghanistan, Mohammad Ishaq Aloko, stated that \\"The attack was planned and organized in Peshawar and executed on the holy day.\\" He said \\"the bombing was an attempt to create division between Afghan Sunni and Shiite Muslims\\", and alleged that \\"the Pakistani intelligence service was involved in the attack.\\" Initially, Afghan Interior Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi had accused the Taliban of organising the suicide attack inside a shrine in Kabul but Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied involvement. Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai said he would discuss the matter with Pakistan.Karzai Says He Will Talk to Pakistan Over Attacks. The News York Times. December 7, 2011. Reactions Hundreds of people had joined funeral processions held the next day. The attack was also condemned by leaders of different ethnic groups said that it was aimed at creating a sectarian war in the country but that they would not turn to violence and instead would stand united in condemning the attack. The United Nation Security Council also condemned the attack.

Life and work Wolley was born at Matlock on 13 May 1823. His father was Reverend John Hurt and his mother Mary was the daughter of Adam Wolley who was an antiquarian. After the death of his father-in-law in 1827, John Hurt assumed the name of Wolley. John Wolley obtained his early education at Mr. Fletcher's preparatory school in Southwell and then moved to Eton in 1836. He moved in 1842 to Trinity College, Cambridge. He had already become interested in nature and spent a lot of time in the woods and fens around Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Runes carved by John Wolley in Pajala, Sweden. In 1845 he travelled to Spain. He began to collect the eggs of birds both on his own and through other collectors. He graduated with a BA in January 1846 and moved to London with the intention of studying law at the Middle Temple. He spent a lot of time in the British Museum and took an interest in the study of the dodo, and became acquainted with H. E. Strickland. In 1846 he travelled through Germany and Switzerland, even climbing Mont Blanc. In 1847 he moved to Edinburgh and began to study medicine. In 1850 he was elected Senior President of the Royal Medical Society. He continued his egg collections, making trips to Orkney and Shetland in 1848. He wrote on the birds of the Faeroes and contributed to Sir William Jardine's \\"Contributions to Ornithology for 1850\\". He moved back to London and remained until 1853, studying the great auk. Memorial in Southwell Minster In 1853 he set off to explore the Arctic region of Lapland, Norway and Finland. After returning to England, his health declined with symptoms that included the loss of memory. He died after becoming unconscious on 20 November 1859. Legacy Wolley bequeathed his egg collection and notebooks to Alfred Newton who catalogued them in Ootheca wolleyana before donating the collection to the British Museum. Wolley had also donated a collection of about 120 Indian bird skins to the Norwich museum in 1858. One of Wolley's ideas was to conduct a comprehensive census of all the birds of Britain, an idea that foreshadowed bird atlases.

Allocentrism, therefore, has been used since by some scholars to describe personal collectivism, \\"the individual level analog of cultural collectivism,\\"Yamaguchi et al, 1995, p. 659 as a very broad cultural trait.Triandis, 1995 Allocentrism versus Idiocentrism Allocentrism is contrasted with idiocentrism, the psychological manifestation of individualism.Bettencourt & Dorr, 1997 As stated earlier, allocentrism includes holding values and preferences of placing higher importance on in-group needs and goals over one's own, defining oneself in terms of the in-group, and seeing oneself as an extension of the in-group. Idiocentrism, however, is an orientation whereby individuals hold quite different values and preferences from those with an allocentric orientation. Idiocentric people tend to focus more on their own goals and needs rather than in-group ones. They prefer self-reliance, to make their own decisions without worrying about what others think, and enjoy competition.Triandis et al, 2002 It seems people can be both allocentric and idiocentric, but how much they are either is dependent on the situation and how the individual defines that situation. Certain situations encourage more allocentric behavior. These are found more in some cultures than others. These situations include when people are rewarded by the social context for being group orientated, when cultural norms encourage conformity which leads to success, when goals are easier achieved through group action, and when there are not many options for acting independently.Triandis et al., 1995 Measuring Allocentrism When researchers measure collectivism, they tend to use large scale studies that look at the cultural level. They add up many people's responses within different cultures with the unit of analysis the whole culture; the N of these studies is the number of cultures.Triandis et al., 1995 This can be confusing when trying to measure collectivism on an individual level, which is why the term allocentrism has been suggested.Triandis et al., 1985 One way to measure allocentrism is to look at what it is correlated with which includes high affiliation with others, low need to be unique, and high sensitivity to rejection.Yamaguchi et al., 1995 Allocentrism includes a sense of self that is interdependent which can be measured by statements about the self-starting with \\"I am\\" or by using interdependence scales. If individuals answer the \\"I am\\" statements with statements about others and common fate with others, they are deemed to be more allocentric. This method was highly recommended for measuring allocentrism.Triandis et al., 1995 Another aspect of allocentrism is the priority of in-group goals over personal goals and this can be measured using the Collectivism Scale Yamaguchi et al., 1995 or scales that look at interdependence versus independence. Triandis et al., 1995 Allocentrism has been measured utilizing The Collectivism Scale in three cultures‚ÄîKorean, Japanese, and American‚Äîand found to have good concurrent and criterion validity and acceptable reliability (Cronbach's Alpha .77-.88). It is a ten item, five point Likert scale that assesses how much an individual acts in his or her own self-interest versus his or her group's interest. The group can be defined in various ways such as one's family, peer group, or work group.Yamaguchi et al., 1995 Allocentrism is a very broad construct and therefore cannot be measured using only a few items; therefore, it is suggested that it be measured with multi-methods due to the limitations of each method.Triandis et al., 1995Triandis, 1995 Culture Allocentrism tends to be found more in collectivistic cultures (about 60%) but can also be found in all cultures,Triandis et al. 2001 and in every culture there is a \\"full distribution of both types.\\" Triandis, 1995, p. 5 While individualism and collectivism are used on the broad cultural level, Triandis et al. (1985) suggested the use of idiocentrism and allocentrism respectively for conducting analyses on the individual level (within-culture analyses). All humans have both collectivist and individualist cognitive structures; people in collectivist cultures are exposed more to collectivist cognitive structures and hence tend to be more allocentric than those in individualistic cultures.Triandis & Suh, 2002 The amount of allocentrism an individual portrays depends in a large part on their culture; there is a possibility that an individual could be high (or low) on both allocentrism and idiocentrism.Triandis & Suh, 2002 Different people in the same culture can have different levels of allocentrism and it is both group and setting specific.Harry et al., 1985 Minorities in the US such as Hispanics and Asians tend to be highly allocentric.Triandis, 1983 There are certain personality dimensions that all allocentrics share despite whether they are from an individualistic (American) or collectivistic (Japanese and Korean) culture. These dimensions include high affiliation with others, being sensitive to rejection from others, and less of a need for individual uniqueness.Yamaguchi, 1995 Situation For allocentrics, the situation is of paramount importance and they tend to define themselves relative to the context. Priming people to think about commonalities that they have with family and friends gets them to be more allocentric.Trafimow et al., 1991 Allocentrics tend to be more cooperative in a collectivistic situation and less in an individualistic situation.Triandis, 2001 There are, however, also transituational aspects to allocentrism. Even when allocentrics are living in a more individualistic culture, they still will put more emphasis on relationships than idiocentrics through joining groups such as gangs, churches, and collectives.Triandis, 2001 Sociability Allocentrics tend to receive higher quality and more social support than idiocentrics;Triandis et al., 1985 they tend to be more social, interdependent with others, and pay a lot of attention to their in-group and family.Triandis & Suh, 2002 This could possibly be because some of the important values of allocentrics are cooperation, honesty, and equality.Triandis et al., 1985Hulbert et al., 2001 Allocentrics usually perceive that they have more and better social support than idiocentrics.Triandis et al., 1988 The amount of social support allocentrics receive seems to be related to their well-being with higher support indicative of higher levels of well-being and lower support with lower well-being.Sinha & Verma, 1994 Allocentrics tend to be less lonely, receive more social support (and are more satisfied with it), and are more cooperative than idiocentrics.Triandis et al., 1988Harry et al., 1985 Subjective well-being (SWB) is term psychological researchers have used when studying happiness Seligman, 2002 Amount of social support allocentrics in collectivist countries received seemed to be related to their well-being with higher support indicative of higher levels of well-being and lower support with lower well- being.Sinha & Verma, 1994 North Americans whose lifestyles are more allocentric tend to have higher subjective well-being than those whose life styles are idiocentric. In addition, allocentrics‚Äô evaluation of their in- group in addition to how they perceive others view their group is positively related to higher subjective well-being.Bettencourt & Dorr, 1997 Allocentrism had a greater effect on the SWB of African Americans than on Euro-Americans. Furthermore, idiocentrism was more negatively related to SWB for Euro- Americans than it was for African Americans.Kernahan, Bettencourt, & Dorr, 2000 Big Five Allocentrism is related to the Big Five personality traits. It is negatively correlated to Openness to experience and positively correlated with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness (Triandis, 2001). Ethnocentricism Allocentrics tend to be more ethnocentric in terms of showing more negative attitudes towards people who are not in their group and more positive attitudes to those in their own group. People who are in allocentrics‚Äô in-group are considered much closer than out-group members who are put at a much larger social distance.Lee & Ward, 1998 Allocentrics tend to minimize with-in group differences while preferring equal outcomes in social dilemmas.Hulbert et al., 2001  Consumer ethnocentrisim  Allocentric people tend to be more consumer ethnocentric (the tendency to prefer the products on their own countries when shopping). Huang et al., (2008) looked at consumer ethnocentrism (CET) and allocentrism among a group of Taiwanese participants in relation to Korean products sold in Taiwan versus national products. This study found that allocentrism with parents was positively correlated with higher CET. However, allocentrism with friends was negatively correlated with CET. Tourism and travel The term allocentrism has also been used in the travel field to have a different meaning from the way it is used in the psychological research. Here the term allocentric traveler refers to a traveler who is an extroverted venturer. This is contrasted with the term psychocentric traveler who is dependable, less adventurous, and cautious. They tend to be curious, confident, seek out novelty, and prefer to travel by plane and alone. They often visit locations that the average traveler would not consider visiting. There are an estimated 4% of true allocentric travelers among tourists, with the majority of travelers being midcentrics (halfway between psychocentric and allocentric).McKercher, 2005 Female allocentric travelers were found to be more neurotic and less extraverted than psychocentric travelers.Hoxter & Lester, 1987 American and Japanese college students who reported being more horizontally individualistic tended to prefer more allocentric destinations.Sakakida, Cole & Card, 2008 A gap was shown between the vacations that individuals ideally would like to go on and the ones they actually go on. It was predicted that about 17% of individuals would go to allocentric destinations, however it was found that only 3% did, quite rare. Indeed, it seems people tend to compromise ideal for practicality, however some people will choose allocentric locations at some point in their lives.Litvin, 2006 Notes . References Bettencourt, B.

History  Faro de Tost√≥n in 2007, prior to restoration The current lighthouse is the third in a succession of lights that have operated at the site on the promontory of Punta Tost√≥n, which is also known as the Punta de la Ballena (whale point). The original lighthouse was opened in 1897, and consisted of a 7 m high plain masonry tower on one corner of the single storey keeper's house. In the 1950s a new 15-metre concrete tower was constructed, which was also superseded by a taller tower in the 1980s. This distinctive 30 m concrete tower, which is white with red bands, has a focal height of 35 m above the sea. Its light can be seen for 14 nautical miles, and consists of a flash of white light every eight seconds. The original keeper's house has been renovated and reused as a museum with a small caf√©. Visitors to the museum which contains an exhibition describing the traditional fishing of the island, can also climb to the top of the 1950s concrete tower. A short c. 1 km self-guided walking trail circles the lighthouse. Multilingual signs describe the geology, shellfish and wildlife found on the headland. Most notable is the description of the Aljibe, a water collection system, next to the road leading to the lighthouse, which was used to provide drinking water for the keepers and their families.

The mound is now inundated by Lake Hartwell. The mound and village portion of the site was built by peoples of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture (a regional variation of the Mississippian culture) Site description The site is a mound and village that once sat on a natural levee about from the Tugaloo River at its confluence with the Chauga River. Site chronology There exist four distinct periods of occupation. The first period occurs during the Middle Archaic, as indicated by quartz and some scattered campsites. Phase two encompasses the first six levels of the mound and dates to the Jarett Phase (1100 to 1200), a local variation of the Etowah Culture. The third phase encompasses the final four stages of the mound construction and dates to the Tugalo Phase (1500 to 1600), a local manifestation of the Lamar Phase. The final period of occupation dates from the Estatoe Phase to the early 18th century. It is associated with the historic Cherokee, an Iroquoian-speaking people who migrated into this area from the north. Mound Diagram showing mound construction sequence Originally standing about in height, the platform mound was constructed in 10 stages. Extensive damage through erosion and amateur digging have resulted in only the first four stages to have distinguishable form and purpose, while also decreasing the height of the mound to . Stage 1 of the mound began as a low truncated rectangular pyramid about in height, which was probably used as a dance platform or dias. The fill for this mound came from the midden area of a previous Woodland period settlement; it was followed by a thinner semi-impermeable blue-grey clay cap. Stages 2‚Äì6 follow the same pattern. The clay cap had a low rim and trough around the base of the mound and in some cases extended to as much as from the base of the mound. The nature of the impervious clay and the trough to carry away rainwater helped to protect the interior basketloaded fill from erosion. At Stage 2 the mound was across at the base and with a summit roughly square and several feet higher than Stage 1. On top of this mound a structure was added. During these stages, smooth boulders from the river were incorporated into the mound, possibly to help stabilize the shape. Stages 7‚Äì10 did not have the clay cap feature and mound construction seems to occur only on the southern and eastern sides of the mound. These stages may have been to add an apron-like extension or ramp out from the main body of the mound. Village Burials There are more than sixty burials at the Chauga site, and more than thirty burials within the mound itself. The mound contains artifacts ranging from stone tools, potsherds and ornaments made of shells, copper plates, rocks and minerals, many of which were deposited as grave goods with the burials. Among the artifacts found at the site is a steatite plate with an anthropozoomorphic human-headed winged figure of a style often associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. Excavations Joseph R. Caldwell first excavated there in 1953 and he was later followed by Carl Miller in 1958. The most complete excavation took place under the leadership of Arthur R. Kelly and Robert S. Neitzel from August, 1958 to January 1, 1959. Kelly and Nietzel performed salvage archaeology on the site in conjunction with the U.S. National Park Service while working at the University of Georgia with the hope of salvaging as much information as possible before the Hartwell Basin flooded the site.

The major occupation of the people living at this place is agriculture. Etymology Ennayiram means eight thousand in Tamil. An inscription dated 1025 CE, belongs to the Rajaraja Chola mentions the name \\"Ennayiram\\". Hence the name \\"Ennayiram\\" is 1000 years old. It also refers to the caste name of Jain merchants. It has close connection with Ashtasahasram, a sub sect of Tamil Iyer community.

Transportation Town buses from Villupuram town bus stand (bus no: 20, 21) to Pidaripattu go through Ennayiram. Otherwise, one can alight at Nemur Koot road bus stop (all mofussil buses going from Villupuram to Gingee) and can take shared auto. About the village Ennayiram village has more than 1000 years old heritage. This village was a city during the Rajaraja Chola I period. It was dominated by Jains before the arrival of Ramanuja. It is also believed that Saint Ramanuja had converted eight thousand Jains to Vaishnavites here. It was called Rajaraja Sathuurvedimangalam in those times. The main importance of this village comes from Azhagiya Narasimma Perumal temple, a Vedic college and Ennayira malai which contains evidence for the past existence of Jain monks. Tamil poet Kalamegam was born in this village. Azhagiya Narasimma Perumal Temple Azhagiya Narasimma Perumal Temple This temple was built by Raja Raja Chola and Narasimma Perumal was considered as the family deity of Rajaraja Chola. The sanctum sanctorum has the idol of Lord Paramapathavasan and consorts Sridevi and Bhoodevi. The presiding deity is Lord Azhagiya Narasimmar. The temple also has a shrine for the six foot high idol of Lord Varahamurthy. Special pooja is performed in every Thiruvathirai Natchathiram day. Sadly, vandalism have dismembered the two hands of Lord Narasimmar which are made of green stone. The deity has been kept in a corner of the temple for the past 400 years. Saint Ramanuja visited this temple twice. Koorathazhwar also visited this temple. This temple contains many Tamil inscriptions on the walls and stairs. It is surrounded by three Shiva temples namely Padaleeswarar temple, Brahmmapuriswarar temple at Brahmadesam and Ramanatha Eswarar temple at Esalam. All three Shiva temples are within two kilometers. All these temples are now under the control of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Existence of ancient Vedic College The Vedic College functioned with 10 teachers and 340 students 800 years ago. The college provided free boarding to students and each student received one seer (unit) of rice per day which was sufficient for their daily meals. The teachers got a daily allowance of one kalam which was equivalent to the cost of food for 16 persons per day. They were also given half kalingu gold as bonus per year. The village was also called as rajaraja chaturvedi Mangalam because the vedic college taught chaturdasa (3 vedas with 6 angam and meemasa, nyayam, puranam and dharmasaasthram). References of the same is found in 1st Rajendra chola‚Äôs (11th century) Sassanam. Ennayira Malai (Ancient Jain cave, beds and inscriptions) Ennayira Malai Another attractive feature of this village is the presence of Ennayira malai or Ennayiram hill with Jain cave and beds, which is now called as Koodalur hill. The 23rd Thirthankarar of Jainism, Parshavanathar, was nicely carved on the rock. There are 35 stone beds, a natural cave and five Tamil inscriptions. Among the five inscriptions, one belongs to the period of the Pallava king Nirubathunga Varman (850 to 882 CE), while the remaining four belong to the period of Chola King Parantaka Chola I (907 to 953 CE). Near the hill, broken black and red painted pots from 1st to 2nd centuries CE were found in large numbers. See also * Jainism * Ramanuja * Cholapandiyapuram * Jambai (Tirukkoyilur) References *A.

From 1970‚Äì1996 Phelps taught anthropology at East Carolina University, which named an archaeology lab after him. Before teaching at East Carolina University Phelps had taught at Tulane University, Florida State University, and Briefly at the University Of Georgia, respectively in that order. Phelps worked on many archaeological sites, some of his more notable sites are the Tar River site, the Neoheroka Fort Tuscarora war site (near snow hill), Lake Phelps, Fort Raleigh (near Manteo), and Hatteras Island. Tar river showed evidence of human occupation more than 11,000 years ago. At the Hatteras island near Buxton a 16th-century signet ring that may have belonged to the lost colonists. In 1992 Lake Phelps was archaeologically explored and over 30 ancient canoes were found. Out of the 30 canoes only 23 have been measured and studied. The process of making these canoes is through splitting a Cyprus log and burning/scraping the interior until the desired shape is acquired. The earliest inhabitants associated with this region are represented by small spear points of the palmer type dating back to the period of 8000BCE ‚Äì 9000BCE. The late archaic period (3000BCE ‚Äì 1000BCE) was represented by such items as spear points, spear thrower weight and bi-facial blades. Cooking vessels made of soap stone. The three earliest dated canoes belong to this time period. The early woodland period was between 1000BCE- 300BCE) and was found to contain fabrics and artistic designs on paddles. Two of the canoes were found to belong to this period. The middle woodland period between 300BCE and 800AD and is classified as the most active time period for the site. 8 of the canoes belong to this time period. The late woodland culture from 800AD to 1650 is attributed with being the ancestral culture of the Carolina Algonkians. Only 3 canoes were found to belong to this time period. In 1998 Phelps discovered an unusual ball of clay that was later revealed to be a 10 carat gold signet ring. The ring is engraved with a prancing lion and is believed to date back to the 16th century. David Phelps, director of the East Carolina University Archaeology laboratory at the time, retired from East Carolina University in 2000 and moved back to Florida.

This description was discovered in 1911 (in the d=2,3 case) by Hermann Weyl for eigenvalues for the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator acting on functions that vanish at the boundary of a bounded domain \\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^d. In particular, he proved that the number, N(\\\\lambda), of Dirichlet eigenvalues (counting their multiplicities) less than or equal to \\\\lambda satisfies : \\\\lim_{\\\\lambda \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{N(\\\\lambda)}{\\\\lambda^{d/2}} = (2\\\\pi)^{-d} \\\\omega_d \\\\mathrm{vol}(\\\\Omega) where \\\\omega_d is a volume of the unit ball in \\\\mathbb{R}^d. In 1912 he provided a new proof based on variational methods.For a proof in English, see See chapter 11. Generalizations The Weyl law has been extended to more general domains and operators. For the Schr√∂dinger operator : H=-h^2 \\\\Delta + V(x) it was extended to : N(E,h)\\\\sim (2\\\\pi h)^{-d} \\\\int _{\\\\\\\\{ \\\\xi^2 + V(x) as E tending to +\\\\infty or to a bottom of essential spectrum and/or h\\\\to +0. Here N(E,h) is the number of eigenvalues of H below E unless there is essential spectrum below E in which case N(E,h)=+\\\\infty. In the development of spectral asymptotics, the crucial role was played by variational methods and microlocal analysis. Counter-examples The extended Weyl law fails in certain situations. In particular, the extended Weyl law \\"claims\\" that there is no essential spectrum if and only if the right-hand expression is finite for all E. If one considers domains with cusps (i.e. \\"shrinking exits to infinity\\") then the (extended) Weyl law claims that there is no essential spectrum if and only if the volume is finite. However for the Dirichlet Laplacian there is no essential spectrum even if the volume is infinite as long as cusps shrinks at infinity (so the finiteness of the volume is not necessary). On the other hand, for the Neumann Laplacian there is an essential spectrum unless cusps shrinks at infinity faster than the negative exponent (so the finiteness of the volume is not sufficient). Weyl conjecture Weyl conjectured that : N(\\\\lambda)= (2\\\\pi)^{-d}\\\\lambda ^{d/2} \\\\omega_d \\\\mathrm{vol} (\\\\Omega)\\\\mp \\\\frac{1}{4} (2\\\\pi)^{1-d}\\\\omega_{d - 1}\\\\lambda ^{(d-1)/2}\\\\mathrm{area} (\\\\partial \\\\Omega) +o (\\\\lambda ^{(d-1)/2}) where the remainder term is negative for Dirichlet boundary conditions and positive for Neumann. The remainder estimate was improved upon by many mathematicians. In 1922, Richard Courant proved a bound of O(\\\\lambda^{(d-1)/2}\\\\log \\\\lambda). In 1952, Boris Levitan proved the tighter bound of O(\\\\lambda^{(d-1)/2}) for compact closed manifolds. Robert Seeley extended this to include certain Euclidean domains in 1978.A sharp asymptotic estimate for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in a domain of \\\\mathbf{R}^3. Advances in Mathematics, 102(3):244‚Äì264 (1978). In 1975, Hans Duistermaat and Victor Guillemin proved the bound of o(\\\\lambda ^{(d-1)/2}) when the set of periodic bicharacteristics has measure 0.The spectrum of positive elliptic operators and periodic bicharacteristics. Invent. Math. , 29(1):37‚Äì79 (1975).

Appl. 14(2):98‚Äì106 (1980). This generalization assumes that the set of periodic trajectories of a billiard in \\\\Omega has measure 0, which Ivrii conjectured is fulfilled for all bounded Euclidean domains with smooth boundaries. Since then, similar results have been obtained for wider classes of operators.

Test results showed that the faculty's salary raises were stagnant despite a $177 million surplus in the budget the previous year. The University has yet to confirm this study's analysis. New federal and state health care laws are also affecting the rise in tuition costs. Legislations requiring full-time college and university students to have health insurance will subsequently raise the cost of minimum coverage provided by the University.Kypers, Neil P. \\"Health Care Laws up Cost of Tuition - The Daily Targum: News.\\" The Daily Targum: Serving the Rutgers Community since 1869.

Those with insurance can opt out of the hard waiver program, a change from the former policy regarding a mandatory fee on students' bills. Recent outbreaks at Rutgersfest have also worried students about tuition costs. Rutgersfest is an annual block party and concert hosting tens of thousands of people to celebrate the end of the school year. The event typically garners major artists to perform and provides a plethora of games for students to play. Students pay almost $1,200 in campus and student fees each year, of which a portion of the fees go to Rutgersfest.Marcus, Aaron. \\"Rutgersfest Further Damages U. - The Daily Targum: Columnists.\\" The Daily Targum: Serving the Rutgers Community since 1869.

Career Born into a musical family, her father Thomas Case Sterndale Bennett was a songwriter, entertainer and a grandson of the composer William Sterndale Bennett. Her mother Christine Bywater was a professional oratorio singer. After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and later with the American choreographer Buddy Bradley, she started with repertory in 1933 in Strange Orchestra at Worthing before moving to London's West End.. From 1938 she appeared in the Herbert Farjeon reviews Nine Sharp, Diversion, Light and Shade, In Town Again and the pantomime The Glass Slipper. In that same year at the invitation of Leonard Sachs she joined the Players Theatre which was to be the start of a forty-year association at the home of traditional music hall in London and which provided her with a platform to excel in that special direct relationship between the performer and audiences. In 1943 she made her film debut taking small parts in Anthony Asquith's We Dive at Dawn and as Rose in Bernard Miles's Tawny Pipit. In 1951, in collaboration with Hattie Jacques, she adapted Ali Baba, or, the Thirty-Nine Thieves and later wrote a Victorian pantomime based on Riquet with a Tuft as a special show for the Festival of Britain. After four years starring as the French schoolmistress in the musical The Boy Friend she made her Broadway debut at the Strollers Theatre Club in 1961 in Time, Gentlemen Please in which she was hailed as Britain's answer to Ethel Merman. In 1966 she gave a critically acclaimed performance as Mrs Banks in Barefoot in the Park to be followed by the long running comedy No Sex Please, We're British in London and South Africa. The BBC TV production in 1973 of The Noble Spaniard by Somerset Maughan saw her starring alongside Margaret Rutherford and Kenneth Williams. https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/7e58a32c82ca448a8f22f2948bf01017 Returning to her roots she regularly appeared in the BBC TV series The Good Old Days based on the formula used at the Players Theatre compered by Leonard Sachs. Prone to stage fright which was never apparent to her audiences, she declined several professional opportunities which might well have secured her greater recognition, as her abilities deserved. One critic remarked that, like so many actors, she suffered anguish behind the clown's mask. She was briefly married to the actor John Barron during the Second World War. She had no children. She retired early to become something of a recluse living with her stepmother Mary Maskelyne, a member of the famous illusionist family and later wardrobe mistress at the Players Theatre.

Regarded as a central work in Bengali literature and Dutta's greatest literary work, Meghnad Badh Kavya is based on the demise of Meghnad (a.k.a. Indrajit), son of Ravana, the king of Lanka in the classic Sanskrit epic Ramayana. The poem is divided into 9 cantos.Read the whole ballad in Bangla Each part exhibits different incidents. Starting from the death of Beerbahu, son of Ravana, it is continued till the sati-daha (the ancient Indian custom of burning the widows alive with the dead husband) of Prameela, Meghnad's beloved wife. The poem starts with the lines: Critical review Meghnad was a tragic hero in Ramayana. He was slayed by Lakshmana brutally, while he was worshiping Goddess NikumvilƒÅ, in the royal temple of Lanka, because of betrayal by Vibhishana, who was an uncle of Meghnad. Meghnad asked Lakshmana not to fight with an unarmed person, rebuking him as a coward; but Lakshmana did not hear him. This unfortunate hero twice endangered Rama as well as Lakshmana but could not survive himself in this unfair battle. This is the central theme of this epic. Meghnad was a patriot, a loving husband, a caring son and a friend to his countrymen. Here are some comments of a few pioneers of Bengali literature: #\\"...to Homer and Milton, as well as to Valmiki, he is largely indebted, and his poem is on the whole the most valuable work in modern Bengali literature.\\" -Bankim Chandra ChattopadhyayRead more about the poet #\\"The Epic Meghnad-Badh is really a rare treasure in Bengali literature.

But would you willingly part with it? Many here look upon that Book as the best among the five ...\\" (1860) #\\" ... I got a severe attack of fever and was laid up for six or seven days.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History In 1913, the state of Michigan authorized the construction of trunkline roads through the state. A main trunkline route through Baraga County was designated, extending from Michigamme to Chassell. By 1915, the trunkline had been completed, and the Baraga County Road Commission spent the remainder of the decade slowly improving the route, regrading segments and replacing some bridges. One of the improvements along the route was the construction of a bridge across the end of Keweenaw Bay, south of Baraga. The Michigan State Highway Department designed a long-span pony truss bridge for the crossing, designated State Trunk Line Bridge No. 86\\\\. In 1917, the department awarded contracts for the construction of the bridge: Smith-Sparks Construction Company was awarded $5,414.20 to fabricate the concrete substructure, and the Northwestern Bridge and Iron Company fabricated and installed the truss for $4,536.00. The structure was completed in 1918. In 1926, the trunkline road was incorporated into US 41\\\\. Traffic along the route increased, and eventually a replacement bridge was built nearby. The original bridge remains, in essentially unaltered condition, and is now a privately owned structure. Description The Old US 41‚ÄìBackwater Creek Bridge is a rigidly connected Warren pony truss, long with an roadway. The deck is constructed of I-beams bolted to the verticals and support stringers, over which a concrete roadway is laid. The trusses are supported by concrete abutments on all four corners, having angled wingwalls. The bridge is historically important as an early part of the region's infrastructure, and is technologically noteworthy as one of the earliest examples of a standard highway department pony truss design in the state.

It was designed and built in Russia where production continued until at least 2010. Design and development Design of the Sigma, then known as the Sigma-4, began in 1991 at the Sigma design bureau though it was later associated with the Albatros bureau. From 2003 it was marketed by Elitar, a bureau formed in 1997. Manufacture of the eighth and later aircraft has been at the Samara based VVV-Avia factory. The Sigma is a metal framed aircraft with largely composite skin, though with metal on the fin and fabric covering on the ailerons, which have GRP noses. The flaps are also GRP structures. The wing has constant chord, 1.5¬∞ of dihedral and a full span combination of flaps and ailerons. The exposed boom aft of the wing trailing edge is slender and carries the rectangular horizontal tail surfaces, large triangular fin and parallel chord rudder, plus a small ventral fin. A Rotax 912 ULS flat four engine is mounted above the wing position and forward of its leading edge.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 84.

The teardrop shaped pod is mounted below the wing and braced to it, with a single faired lift strut on each side from its lower part. Access to the side-by-side seating is by large glazed doors. There is a luggage area behind the seats and a rear transparency. The tricycle undercarriage is short, placing the Sigma close to the ground. All wheels are on cantilever spring legs and enclosed by fairings. The nosewheel leg is horizontal and the wheel casters. The Sigma can also be configured as a floatplane, the floats attached with a complex of struts. A MVEN K-600-00 ballistic recovery parachute is standard on Russian aircraft. Operational history Twelve or more Sigmas had been built by 2010. One, with a civil registration, flies at a Russian experimental station, another with an aero club in the Ukraine. Four kits have been delivered to New Zealand, three in 2005 and one in 2009. The type achieved LSA compliance in the United States under the name Samara VVV-Avia Elitar-Sigma C4E. There have been two Sigmas on the US civil register, one of them a sales demonstrator which was deregistered and returned to the manufacturers after the sales campaign was abandoned in 2006.

Career  Heiko Schramm started his musical career as the bassist for the Dresden- based band Freunde der italienischen Oper (FDIO) in 1988. Engaged for the stage production of Goethe's Faust at Staatsschauspiel Dresden in 1989, FDIO gained renown as the first rock band in the history of the state theater in 1991.Bernd G√ºrtler: \\"Ein gesellschaftliches Ereignis von Rang\\", S√§chsische Zeitung, 27 March 1991 Schramm collaborated on the FDIO albums Um Thron und Liebe as well as Edle Einfalt Stille Gr√∂√üe and left the band in 1992. Together with the original lineup, Schramm recorded a song for the German opera singer Ren√© Pape in 2005 which was featured in a documentary on Pape produced by the TV network Arte. In 1990, Schramm, singer and guitarist Jens Berger and drummer Tom Wolf formed the band Need A New Drug. They recorded the albums Greedy Moon (1990) and Santa Cruz (1992, produced by Jorge Cousineau). The cooperation with Berger was formative for Schramm's forceful yet melodic guitar-like bass sound that evolved from a close collaboration on arrangements, as well as from the reduced form of a trio in which the bass functioned in more complex compositions as a transmitter between the rhythm section on the one hand, and as a second melodic option on the other. Schramm moved to Berlin in 1993 and, together with Stephan Hachtmann and Ulrik Spiess, he formed the trio X.I.D., with which he recorded the albums X.I.D. (1994) and Stralsund (1995). After his return to Dresden in 1996, Schramm and Berger started to work again and formed the band Gaffa. Although inspired both by blues musicians that were issued on Fat Possum Records and, e.g., Bukka White, Skip James, Jesse Fuller, the band's sound however reflected the tristesse of their East German suburban background with which they had been coming of age. With Gaffa, Schramm recorded the albums Wilful Things (2000, production by Edgar M. Roethig) and Amusement Park (2004), and left the band in 2004. Parallelly, Schramm began teaming up with R√ºdiger P√§ssler, drummer Matthias Macht and Matthias Petzold under the name of Thermoking in 1999. In the following year, they recorded the album Fuego produced by Jorge Cousineau and Matthias Petzold, and recorded by Edgar M. Roethig. The same production team monitored the subsequent album of the band which bore the new band name Goldoni after P√§ssler left in 2001. Following an offer to set new music to the film Matrix and to perform it live including a DJ Team at the Dresden Kulturzentrum Scheune in 2000, Matthias Macht, Matthias Petzold, Schramm and DJ Studio 17 founded the band Tijuana Mon Amour Broadcasting Inc. The band existed beyond the instant success of their Scheune performance until 2009 and recorded the four albums, Tijuana Mona Amour Broadcasting Inc. (2001), Songs (2003), Day After, the Day Before (2004), and The Jubilee of the Snowqueen (2006). In 2001, Schramm met American singer and guitarist Chris Whitley, who invited him to play bass on the US promotion tour for the album Rocket House.Ann Powers: \\"Pop Review; Blues with a Scratch\\", New York Times, 12 June 2001 The tour lineup included also Tony Mangurian on drums (who also produced Rocket House), DJ Logic and keyboardist Etienne Lytle. Whitley and Schramm recorded the acoustic album Hotel Vast Horizon together with Matthias Macht in 2002. The song \\"Breaking Your Fall\\" featured on the album won the Independent Music Award in the category \\"Best Folk/Singer-Songwriter Song\\" in early 2004. The band promoted the album on an extended tour through the US as well as France and Belgium. During the recording session for the soundtrack of the film Pigs Will Fly (direction: Eoin Moore, 2003), Schramm, Whitley and Macht worked with the producers Warner Poland and Kai-Uwe Kohlschmidt. In 2004, the same lineup recorded Soft Dangerous Shores in Kingston, NY under the production of Malcolm Burn. In 2005, Schramm played bass as a member of Chris Whitley & the Bastard Club in Catskill, NY during the recording sessions for the album Reiter In, which was recorded by Richard Holbrook and produced by Kenny Siegal. Additional performers on Whitley's last album included also: Brian Geltner, Tim Beattie, Kenny Siegal, Sean Balin, Gwen Snyder und Susann Buerger. In 2008, Schramm and Matthias Macht toured the American Southwest together with Singer/Songwriter Paul Sprawl from Santa Cruz, California, and recorded the album Great American Opera at Studio Sutton Sound in Atascadero, CA. Since 2009, Schramm has worked on his own songs under the name of Blenderman, performing them solo and with different musicians like Matthias Macht, Studio 17 and Fran Dango. Since 2014, the albums created in this period have been published as a series titled The 9th-Floor Tapes  1-6, including Walk Down Memory Lane (2014) and To All The Locos (2014). In March 2016 followed God of Bitumen, the first album marked by the creative collaboration of Schramm and Dango in terms of music and lyrics. Further musicians next to Matthias Macht include e.g., Ralph Qno Kunze. The fourth album, a 4-track EP named Blenderman at Daft Audio was released in June 2016 followed by The Ralph in February 2017. The release of the EP The Thousand-Yard Stare in February 2018 concluded this series, again featuring musicians like Macht, Kunze, Studio 17 and Dango.https://blenderman.bandcamp.com/  Bands  * 1988‚Äì1992 Freunde der italienischen Oper * 1990‚Äì1996 Need A New Drug * 1993‚Äì1995 X.I.D. * 1996‚Äì2004 Gaffa * 1997‚Äì2000 Thermoking * 2000‚Äì2001 Goldoni * 2001‚Äì2005 Chris Whitley * 2001‚Äì2008 Tijuana Mon Amour Broadcasting Inc. * 2008‚Äì2009 Paul Sprawl / Worn Out West  Discography   Freunde der italienischen Oper  * 1990 Tape Mutma√üliche Terroristen in Haft.../Gott sch√ºtze den Innenminister * 1990 Tape Live in Munich * 1991 Tape Il Grande Silenzio * 1991 Tape Live im Schauspielhaus Dresden * 1991 Tape Live in Dresden * 1991 LP Um Thron Und Liebe * 1996 CD Edle Einfalt Stille Gr√∂√üe (Strandard63) * 1997 CD Um Thron Und Liebe (Strandard63 / What's So Funny About) * 1997 CD-Box Rare, seltene und r√§tselhafte Aufnahmen mit Um Thron und Liebe / Edle Einfalt, stille Gr√∂√üe (Strandard63 / What's So Funny About)  Need a New Drug  * 1990 LP Greedy Moon (Par Excellence) * 1992 LP/CD Santa Cruz (Berry Berry )  X.I.D.  * 1993 CD XID (Rough Trade) * 1994 CD Stralsund (Rough Trade)  Gaffa  * 2000 LP/CD Wilful Things (DOXA Records) * 2004 LP/CD Amusement Park (DOXA Records)  Thermoking  * 1999 CD Fuego (V√§ter & S√∂hne)  Goldoni  * 2001 CD Goldoni (Goo International)  Chris Whitley  * 2003 CD Pigs Will Fly (ulfTone Records) * 2003 CD Hotel Vast Horizon (Messenger Records /Fargo Records) * 2004 CD Soft Dangerous Shores (Messenger Records/Fargo Records) * 2005 LP/CD Reiter In (Down Town Records /Red Parlour Records)  Tijuana Mon Amour Broadcasting Inc.  * 2001 LP/CD Tijuana Mon Amour Broadcasting Inc.(Tijuana Music/Hobby de Luxe) * 2003 CD Songs (Tijuana Music/Hobby de Luxe) * 2004 CD Day After, the Day Before (DOXA Records/Remixes) * 2006 LP/CD The Jubilee of the Snowqueen (BURO/City Center Offices)  Paul Sprawl/ Worn Out West  * 2009 CD Great American Opera  Blenderman/HESH  * 2014: To Walk Down Memory Lane (Download) * 2014: To All The Locos (Download) * 2016: God of Bitumen (Download) * 2016: Blenderman at Daft Audio (Download) * 2017: The Ralph (Download) * 2018: The Thousand-Yard Stare (Download)  FDIO on TV  * ARTE: Der Bass Ren√© Pape ‚Äì Mein Herz brennt, direction: Sibylle Muth  References   External links  * Heiko HESH Schramm * Homepage of Tijuana Mon Amour Broadcasting Inc. * with Chris Whitley & DJ Logic live at Bowery Ballroom, New York City on YouTube * with Worn Out West live in Hamburg on YouTube Category:1971 births Category:German experimental musicians Category:German double-bassists Category:Male double- bassists Category:German bass guitarists Category:German rock guitarists Category:Male bass guitarists Category:German rock singers Category:German singer-songwriters Category:East German musicians Category:20th-century German musicians Category:Living people Category:20th-century bass guitarists Category:21st-century German singers Category:21st-century double-bassists Category:21st-century bass guitarists Category:20th-century German male musicians Category:21st-century male singers Category:German male guitarists ","title":"Heiko Schramm"},{"id":"33972769","text":"Mar√≠a √Ångeles Ferrer For√©s is a Spanish music education pedagogue and musicologist, awarded the Premio Acci√≥n Magistral (Master Action Prize) 2010 by UNESCO, as best professor of Spain.

Sports Livesay, a fly-half from Blackheath, played two Tests for England, both against Wales. They came in the 1898 Home Nations Championship and 1899 Home Nations Championship. A right handed batsman, Livesay played 26 first-class cricket matches for Kent, all but one of which came in the County Championship. The other was a fixture against the touring South Africans, at Canterbury in 1904, when he made a career best 78 in the first innings, before being run out. Military career Livesay was commissioned as a second-lieutenant in the Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment on 5 September 1896, and promoted to lieutenant on 18 May 1898. He fought in the Second Boer War between 1899 and 1902, where he took part in the Relief of Ladysmith, including the battles of Colenso (15 December 1899), Spion Kop (20-24 January 1900), Vaal Krantz (5-7 February 1900), and the Tugela Heights and Pieter¬¥s Hill (14-27 February 1900).

The Division‚Äôs success during the Battle of the Somme was due in part to the outstanding work of Livesay and The New Zealand Division‚Äôs performance was recognised by the French with the award of the Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the French Republic in May 1917. He was again conspicuous in his service at Messines and Passchendaele, before leaving the New Zealand Division to serve with the Americans and 61 Division.

Biography  Jonathan Garb was born in 1967 in Johannesburg, South Africa, and immigrated to Israel in 1973. In the 1980s, Garb studied Talmud and Kabbalah in the Lithuanian Yeshiva world, where he also studied Mussar with R. Shlomo Wolbe and R. Reuven Leuchter. He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees at the Hebrew University between the years 1990 to 2001, his M.A. and Ph.D. dissertations were advised by Prof. Moshe Idel. He was a post-doctoral fellow at Ben Gurion University of the Negev. He served as a guest lecturer at the L‚Äô√âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales in Paris. In 2010, Garb received the Hebrew University President‚Äôs Prize for Outstanding Researcher (Ben Porat/Pollack Family Foundation). During the academic year 2011-2012, he was fellow at the Tikvah Center for Law and Jewish Civilization at New York University.http://www.nyutikvah.org/fellows/fellows_11_12/jonathan_garb.html He was head of the Amirim Honors Program in the years 2013-2014.http://en.amirim.huji.ac.il In 2014, he received the Israel Academy of Science and Humanities' Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research. He is member of the editorial board of Kabbalah: Journal for the Study of Jewish Mystical Texts.http://cherub-press.com/ In 2019, he was a fellow at the Maimonides Center for Advanced Studies at University of Hamburg.  Scholarship  Garb‚Äôs research interests cover rabbinic thought, modern and contemporary Kabbalah, and the comparative study of mystical techniques and experiences, particularly Shamanism and Trance. From a geographical point of view, Garb‚Äôs scholarship has focused on Jerusalem, North Africa, and Prague. Recently, he focuses on Italy, particularly on the circle of R. Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto. He claims that other members of the circle may have written many texts attributed to Luzzatto.Jonathan Garb, ‚ÄúThe Authentic Kabbalistic Writings of R. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto.‚Äù Kabbalah: Journal for the Study of Jewish Mystical Texts 25 (2011). His research strongly draws from post-modern theory, especially the work of Michel Foucault and its antecedents.http://www.huji.ac.il/dataj/controller/ihoker/MOP- STAFF_LINK?sno=9728061&Save;_t= Following the phenomenological approach of his main teacher, Jonathan Garb is considered one of the leading students of Moshe Idel.See Boaz Huss, \\"The New Age of Kabbalah Research: Book Review of Ron Margolin, The Human Temple; Melila Hellner-Eshed, A River Issues Forth from Eden; Jonathan Garb, Manifestations of Power in Jewish Mysticism,‚Äù Theory and Criticism 27 (2005), pp. 246-253 and Zvi Leshem‚Äôs Review ‚ÄúDemystifying Kabbalah,‚Äù Jerusalem Post, 11/26/2009 (http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Article.aspx?id=161505 ).

Garb‚Äôs monographic studies significantly exceed the dominant philological-historical approach in the study of Jewish mystical texts applied by Gershom Scholem and his followers.

Garb‚Äôs third monograph, Shamanic Trance in Modern Kabbalah, offers an Ericksonian reading of sixteenth century Kabbalistic writings and Hasidic literature. His fourth monograph is an intellectual biography of the eighteenth-century Italian kabbalist R. Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto. His fifth book covers 'indigenous' psychological theories found in modern Kabbalah from R. Moshe Cordovero till today, focusing on the heart and soul. In his monograph, Modern Kabbalah as an Autonomous Domain of Research, Garb argues that modern Kabbalistic writings can be shown to reflect a strong awareness of its autonomy from pre-modern sources and practices. His seventh book, A History of Kabbalah: From the Early Modern Period to the Present Day, provides a narrative history of modern Kabbalah, stressing its exposure to the process of modernization and its role in the same process. Focusing on the last three centuries, it exposes numerous unknown texts, especially in the Sephardic world. In dozens of articles, he has discussed issues such as gender, language, antinomianism, poetics, magic, and sainthood.For an overview of Garb‚Äôs articles, see https://huji.academia.edu/JonathanGarb.

It serves primarily to establish the origin of Gladstone Gander's extraordinary luck. The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #1998-04; the first American publication was in Uncle Scrooge #310, in June 1998. Plot It is Gladstone Gander's birthday, and Daisy Duck is planning a big party for him at Grandma Duck's farm. However, Gladstone is nowhere to be seen. He is purposefully hiding from his relatives, because his birthday is the only day in the entire year when he is unlucky, and he wants to avoid coming to any harm. Not wanting Donald and Daisy to discover him, Gladstone heads away from Grandma's farm, but a sequence of extraordinarily improbable events foils each of his travel attempts, first in a taxicab, then in a train, and finally in an aeroplane. Gladstone is on a flight to Alaska, but he is accidentally evacuated from the plane, landing on a hot-air balloon, which takes him to Grandma's farm, against his wishes. At Grandma's farm, the origin of Gladstone's unlucky birthday is revealed. Way back when Gladstone's mother Daphne Duck was born, a travelling painter had painted a sign of a \\"triple distelfink\\" on the front end of Grandma's barn, keeping good luck in, and an upside-down version of the same sign on the back end, keeping bad luck out. Later, Gladstone was born on his mother's birthday, and during one of his childhood birthday parties, lightning had hit him while he had been hoisted on the upside-down distelfink sign by Donald. The event caused his birthday to become the only exception to his near-universal good luck. When Donald and Gladstone hear of this, both of them rush to the front end of the barn, trying to get hit by lightning again, but this time on the rightside-up sign. Donald hoists himself up first, but the part of the roof where the rope is attached is rotten and falls away, making Donald fall back down and flinging Gladstone up in the air instead. Lightning hits Gladstone on the rightside-up sign, and thus the bad luck is annulled, and Gladstone is now lucky throughout the entire year. The German word Distelfink means European goldfinch in English.

In 1974, prior to going to university, Price was an Assistant Scientific Officer at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, UK, researching dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopy. At the University of Cambridge, Price read Natural Sciences and graduated with a 1st Class Honours Bachelor of Arts from Clare College in 1977. From 1977 to 1980, he was a Natural Environment Research Council Research Student at the University of Cambridge, and received a PhD in 1981; his doctoral thesis was entitled Aspects of Transformation Behaviour in Olivine, Pyroxenes and Titanomagnetites. From 1980 to 1981, Price was a Fulbright-Hayes Scholar and Research Associate at the University of Chicago‚Äôs Department of the Geophysical Sciences, and, from 1981 to 1983, a Research Fellow at Clare College, University of Cambridge and Natural Environment Research Council Research Fellow, University of Cambridge Department of Earth Sciences. In 1983, Price became a Royal Society University Research Fellow at UCL, where he has since held a variety of academic and management positions. He discovered the mineral wadsleyite, which is believed to make up part of the transition zone of the Earth‚Äôs mantle, from a depth of 400 km to 550 km.

Price's implementation of the UCL Research Strategy  Price has led the development of three iterations of the UCL Research Strategy, in 2008, 2011 and 2019.  2008  In 2008, Price devised and introduced the first-ever UCL research strategy, Maximizing Impact and Influence Globally. It stated: ‚Äú[I]n the recent past, universities have not been seen major forces for social change. UCL‚Äôs new research strategy will help realise the radical vision of its founders, who, following [Jeremy] Bentham, believed that education, and hence universities, were the key to reform. ‚Ä¶ With its unique strengths and position, UCL has an opportunity and an obligation to develop and disseminate original knowledge to help provide solutions to the grand challenges faced by the world today and tomorrow.‚Äù The strategy's basis was that the collective expertise of the whole of UCL is greater than the sum of its subject-specific parts. By collaborating across disciplines, therefore, the university could address major problems most effectively.  2011  After publication of the 2011 version of the UCL Research Strategy, Times Higher Education described Price as asserting that \\"since the Thatcher era, universities had adopted the prevailing political view of them as \\"the engines of the knowledge economy\\", leading them to neglect wisdom, which he defined as \\"the judicious application of knowledge for the good of humanity\\". He cited the huge increase in maize prices prompted by the staple food crop's use as a source of biofuel as a \\"classic case of the application of very clever knowledge without developing a wise way of introducing it\\". The problem, he said, was that few universities possessed the breadth of top researchers necessary to generate wisdom, which required the \\"synthesising and contrasting of the knowledge, perspectives and methodologies of different disciplines\\".\\" The Times Higher Education article noted: \\"Another key concept in the research strategy is \\"leadership\\", which Professor Price distinguished from excellence on the grounds that it was active rather than passive. As well as being eminent researchers, their leadership obligations would also require senior UCL academics to \\"be putting back into their discipline by doing professional service, and into the institution by managing and developing strategic areas in their own departments and leading career development of younger colleagues\\". Younger academics, for their part, should be \\"developing their leading position in their subject and nurturing students\\". Price distinguished cross-disciplinarity ‚Äì \\"between experts in different disciplines, transcending subject boundaries\\" ‚Äì from \\"interdisciplinary generalism\\". The Times Higher Education article stated: \\"Cross-disciplinary collaboration did not necessarily happen \\"naturally\\", and this was where Professor Price's office justified its existence - by organising symposia, offering seed funding and even establishing cross- disciplinary institutes. \\"Some universities believe that just having excellence and enough people together [means] it will all happen. I believe excellence is a key thing, but you need also to give people a framework...to refer back to,\\" he said. He said his approach was not \\"dirigiste\\", but that he hoped to create an ethos of collegiality in which collaboration became the norm. ... \\"I am very happy to leave excellent people to get on alone, but we are providing them with an opportunity to do more.\\" This was an opportunity that increasing numbers of UCL academics were taking up\\". Price instituted pan-institutional research themes, relevant across disciplinary boundaries, in order to facilitate cross-disciplinary community-building and collaboration. He further enhanced UCL's cross-disciplinary capability by facilitating the foundation of thematic centres and networks, each bringing together a variety subject-specific expertise in order to address major problems with more sophistication. These included the UCL Computational Life & Medical Sciences Network, the UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, the UCL Energy Institute, the UCL Environment Institute, the UCL European Institute, the UCL Genetics Institute, the UCL Institute for Global Health, the UCL Institute of Origins, the UCL Institute for Risk & Disaster Reduction, UCL Systems Biology and the UCL Urban Laboratory. Price also conceived the UCL Grand Challenges ‚Äì Global Health, Sustainable Cities, Intercultural Interaction and Human Wellbeing ‚Äì through which concentrations of specialist expertise are brought together to address aspects of the world's key problems. The following were flagship UCL Grand Challenges initiatives: * in Global Health ‚Äì Population Footprints, the 2011 UCL‚ÄìLeverhulme Trust symposium on human population growth and global carrying capacity; and briefings to Commonwealth Ministers of Health and the World Health Organization following publication of the UCL‚ÄìLancet Commission on Managing the Health Effects of Climate Change * Sustainable Cities ‚Äì publication of Sustainability and the Megalopolis: Facing the urban reality of the 21st century, the synthesis of a seminar series addressing topics such as climate change, transport, energy and water infrastructure, sustainability, health, security, resilience, society, culture, economics, planning and governance * Intercultural Interaction ‚Äì inauguration of the UCL Global Migration Symposia Series and UCL Migration Week; and foundation of the UCL Centre for Early Modern Exchanges, 1450‚Äì1800, the UCL Institute for Human Rights and the UCL European Institute * Human Wellbeing ‚Äì international conferences on The Future of Healthcare in Europe and Literature, Welfare and Wellbeing: The poetics of the Scandinavian welfare state.  2019  In the Foreword to the 2019 UCL Research Strategy, Price wrote: ‚ÄúRegrettably, the key question for our generation of researchers has become: ‚ÄòHow will society survive to the 22nd century?‚Äô By survival, we do not mean simply the continued existence of the human race, but also of the environments, institutions, structures and values that underpin and enhance society and enable humanity to thrive. We also recognise the profound imperative to tackle the persistent injustices and inequalities in society today, and to help to deliver a more equitable future for all of humanity. ‚Ä¶ UCL is well-positioned to make major contributions to help humanity survive and prosper. This is due not least to our distinctive ability to sustain a breadth, depth and diversity of expertise and research across disciplines and methods. The purpose of this strategy is to enable UCL‚Äôs individual researchers and our research community as a whole to maximise their contribution to public good. I believe this also requires us to consider: how our research environment supports our researchers, both as individuals and collectively; the cultural and structural barriers we may need to overcome to achieve our ambitions; and how we can redefine traditional concepts of leadership, collaboration and research impact to reflect, enable and drive the vision, aims and objectives set out in this strategy.\\" The strategy sets out a number of objectives in support of an overall aspiration: \\"We want to stimulate disruptive thinking across and beyond our university to transform knowledge and understanding, and to tackle complex societal problems. We wish to help to enable society not only to survive to the next century ‚Äì an urgent challenge requiring unprecedented collective action and partnership ‚Äì but also to thrive, so that the lives of future generations are worth living: prosperous, secure, engaged, empowered, fair, healthy, stimulating and fulfilling. As a community of scholars and those who support them, we must each focus our efforts, based on our founding values and driven by our intellectual curiosity, to be a force for positive social change. ‚Ä¶ This strategy seeks to enable and empower all our researchers to thrive as research leaders, providing opportunities for engagement and impact, while ensuring that they retain the freedom to steer their own course, experiment and develop in unique ways. We see this as crucial in order to maintain the richness and diversity of research at UCL.\\" The strategy advocates three strategic aims: * Inspire and empower research leadership: \\"More than anything, our individual and collective research leadership underpins the contributions that we can make to humanity. We seek to identify, attract, inspire and empower those who demonstrate ‚Äì or show their potential to develop ‚Äì research leadership, regardless of their background. Leadership is exemplified in diverse ways, by researchers at all career levels. Research leaders advance their field, develop novel lines of enquiry, support and mentor their colleagues, and are engaged with the research community (within and beyond their discipline) and the wider world.\\" * Cross boundaries to increase engagement: \\"Rarely can the most interesting questions or the most significant societal challenges be adequately addressed by one discipline, one university or one sector alone. While disciplinary excellence is at the heart of everything that we do, to amplify and inform our research we need to cross conventional, but often artificial, boundaries ‚Äì between disciplines, between communities (disciplinary, academic and otherwise) and between different kinds of activity ‚Äì in order to increase mutual knowledge and engagement, and develop co-design and co-production approaches to research and complex societal problems.\\" * Deliver impact for public benefit: \\"We consider the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake to be a fundamental good and the basis of all our research impact. We also seek to maximise the public benefit resulting from our research, including by furthering academic disciplines and scholarship, enhancing our cultural contribution and engaging in public discourse, growing national and global prosperity, providing policy advice, informing professional practice, contributing to positive environmental change, and improving health and wellbeing. We will support activity of these kinds and the myriad other ways in which our research can deliver public value.\\" These three strategic aims are reinforced by three cross-cutting themes: * Pursue a responsible research agenda: \\"UCL 2034 states that we will ensure that our 'research and education are rooted in our ethical principles'. The key elements of this are: understanding the distinctive role (and limitations) of the university in advancing knowledge and enquiry; nurturing cultures of integrity in all our research activities, and supporting rising standards across all fields; leading in ethical consideration of research and its applications; engaging with those who will be affected by our research activity; minimising the negative environmental impact of research; and enhancing the public benefit derived from research.\\" * Exert our institutional influence for the greater good: \\"The growth in UCL‚Äôs size, breadth, impact and reputation in recent decades presents us with both opportunities and ‚Äì drawn from our founding values ‚Äì obligations. We have considerable potential to help shape the environment in which academic endeavour takes place, to influence others‚Äô thinking and to advocate rational, evidence-based and inclusive decision-making.\\" * Maintain a global perspective: \\"As London‚Äôs Global University, we will marshal our collective expertise to: extend our local and global knowledge in order to increase our cultural sensitivity, make us better partners and increase the ‚Äògrassroots‚Äô relevance of our research; support the growth of independent research capability globally, and facilitate partnership working at all levels; help our students to bring their research-based education to bear on their global careers and lives; and deliver impact to address global problems.\\"  Research policy  Price has advocated higher education policy reforms, including: * the concentration of research funding on the highest levels of excellence, in particular on those universities providing added value through the breadth and volume of their excellence * greater collaboration between institutions, and in particular between research-intensive ‚Äòhubs‚Äô and smaller ‚Äòislands of excellence‚Äô in other institutions * funding of research that is internationally competitive in institutions that are able to compete and leverage their UK funding by collaborating on the global stage * a rejection of defining the value of higher education in narrow cost-benefit terms * greater amounts of research funded by block grants on the basis of performance, rather than through the grant application ‚Äòtreadmill‚Äô.

The tiple is the smallest of the three string instruments of Puerto Rico that make up the orquesta jibara (i.e., the Cuatro, the Tiple and the Bordonua). According to investigations made by Jose Reyes Zamora, the tiple in Puerto Rico dates back to the 18th century. It is believed to have evolved from the Spanish guitarrillo. There was never a standard for the tiple and as a result there are many variations throughout the island of Puerto Rico. Most tiples have four or five strings and most tiple requintos have three strings. Some tiples have as many as 6 strings and as few as a single string, though these types are rare. The main types of tiple in Puerto Rico are: *Tiple doliente - this tiple has 5 single strings and is the most common used today. It is usually approximately 380mm total in length with a scale length of 350-365mm. It is tuned E3, A3, D4, G4, C5. *Tipl√≥n or tiple con macho - a larger version of the tiple with a fifth string peg like an American banjo, located on its neck. It usually has a scale length of approximately 530mm. It is tuned G5, D5, G4, B4, E5 or A5, D5, A4, B4, B5. *Tiple requinto de la monta√±a - a tiny version of the Tiple doliente with only three strings. It usually has a scale length of approximately 300mm. It is tuned D4, G4, B4. *Tiple requinto costanero - a smaller version of the tipl√≥n with only three strings. It usually has a scale length of approximately 380mm. It is tuned D4, G4, B4. *Tiple grande de Ponce - the largest version with 5 strings. It is considered to be the link between Tiples and Bordonuas. It is sometimes also called \\"Bordonua Chiquita\\" (or small Bordonua). It usually has a scale length of approximately 530mm. It is tuned D4, G4, C5, E5, A5. *Tiple Vihuela - A tiple with 5 doubled courses of strings, like a small Cuatro.

It has recently acquired a more or less fixed body shape narrowing at the top and having 5 strings (see the accompanying photo). It is usually made like the cuatro, so either constructed like a guitar, or from one piece of wood hollowed out. The bottom half of the body is rounded like a guitar, however the top half is square, or triangular. All other features (like neck and bridge) resemble the construction of a normal Spanish guitar. The peghead has tuning machines either from the side or from the back. The Tiple doliente is tuned with 5 metal strings: E3, A3, D4, G4, C5.

Narelle debuted on- screen during the episode airing on 25 March 1988, but left the show just over six months later. Character development Narelle is described as the \\"Home and Away dreamer, a dizzy 20-year-old blonde who plotted on leaving her home town of Yabbie Creek, to become a rich and famous popstar\\". Narelle's first on-screen kiss is with fellow character Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), at the age of seventeen, Steven is three years younger than Narelle. As the age difference was reflected off-screen too, it made everyone involved in the scenes nervous. Willits said, \\"I'd go for an older woman, if Steven can, I certainly can.\\"J Clayden 1989, p.21. While discussing the scenes he added \\"In the script, he had this plan to get Narelle to kiss me, because he has done a survey and he's a pretty hot kisser. It wasn't as though they were in love though.\\"Kesta 1990, p.12. Newman-Phillips describes the filming of the storyline stating: \\"Narelle seduces Steven and when it came to the kissing scene we were both very nervous. It was the first for both of us and we just couldn't get the scene right, so we did some extra rehearsing. The kiss only lasted a minute, but in the end, it took us a couple of hours to get it perfect for the cameras.\\" Whilst interviewed by TV Week, Willits stated: \\"When you consider rehearsals and retakes, we kissed a hell of a lot. It was great. She gave me all the pointers\\".Oram 1990, p.98. While Newman-Phillips said, \\"Adam's a sweetie after all the fuss had died down it was great fun.\\"Oram 1990, p.99. Newman-Phillips was contracted as a guest cast member. Of her Narelle's exit from the series, the actress told a reporter from TV Life that \\"Narelle left in search of a guy. It was left open-ended. Now I think they want me back so I could be returning to the show around March.\\" She added that it would have been great to reprise her role, something which has never happened. Storylines Narelle arrives at the Summer Bay House asking to audition for Frank Morgan's (Alex Papps) band. Narelle is the cousin of Lance Smart (Peter Vroom) and Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson) helps her to get ready and she starts her audition by dancing around Frank's living room and singing for him. Bobby thinks Narelle is better suited to stripping so Frank told her that she could not join the band, but should pursue a career in dancing. Narelle tells Bobby that she should dress more feminine in order to impress Frank, who Narelle thinks is attractive. Narelle attends the school dance and asks Bobby if she has made her move on Frank. Martin Dibble (Craig Thomson) and Lance convince Narelle to sneak into the local hospital to find out what had happened to Frank and Roo Stewart (Justine Clark), after they break up. She later visits Frank with the proposal that he moves in with her. Frank is tired of life at the caravan park and takes her up on the offer, moving into the flat above the general store. This annoys Celia Stewart (Fiona Spence) who does not approve of Narelle's short skirts. Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) employs Narelle at the general store which annoys Celia even more. Celia begins to order Narelle around at work and treats her badly. After helping Steven out with his science project on kissing, she falls for him and they begin dating, much to the town's shock as there is a four-year age gap. However, this is cut short when Narelle falls for his uncle, Philip (John Morris) and kisses him. In order to save Steven's reputation out of fear he may be bullied for being dumped, Philip and Narelle concoct a story in which Steven dumps Narelle. Celia threatens to evict Narelle from the flat but after she supports her in time of family drama, she relents. The next target of Narelle's affections is Gary Samuels (Darius Perkins) but she changes her mind when Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) accuses Gary of raping her. Narelle then decides to leave Summer Bay in order to find herself a man. She later settles in Queensland and Bobby visits her for several weeks. Reception The role of Narelle made Newman-Phillips one of the most famous soap stars in the United Kingdom and was tipped to replace Kylie Minogue (Neighbours) as the \\"number one\\".

History Aaltoes was founded in spring 2009 by a group of students from Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki School of Economics and University of Art and Design Helsinki, who saw that the entrepreneurial climate in Finnish universities did not support students or researchers who wanted to start companies and aim for international markets and high growth. Prior to the founding of Aaltoes, it was decided that in 2010 Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki School of Economics and University of Art and Design Helsinki would be merged into a single university, known as Aalto University. The underlying reason behind the merger was similar to that of the founding of Aaltoes. The former University of Technology was split into four schools in 2011 under the authority of Aalto University. At first, Aaltoes started bringing forth entrepreneurial role models to inspire and encourage students to become entrepreneurs, soon expanding to organizing pitching evenings, hackathons, workshops and other events, where students and researchers could experiment, look for co-founders and learn skills. In late 2009, as Aalto University was starting to gain its form, Aaltoes made a pitch for a space for young entrepreneurs to work on their companies, ultimately gaining premises and a budget from the university for a 1,500 square metre industry hall on the university's campus in Otaniemi, Espoo. The co-working space would later become known as Aalto Venture Garage. In 2010, Aaltoes formulated some of its activities into two seed accelerator programs for very early-stage startups, later known as Startup Sauna and Summer of Startups. Aaltoes was one of the main reasons for Aalto University to become the first official European partner of Stanford University's Technology Ventures Program (STVP) in 2011. In co-operation with Aalto University, Aaltoes tightened the relationship with Stanford University by bringing several high profile people to Finland (for example Steve Blank) and also taking a group of Aalto's faculty members to visit Stanford. Emergence in Finnish media Aaltoes became known to the wider audience in Finland through the organizing of Suomi Hyvinvoinnin J√§lkeen, which brought together Finnish industrial leaders such as Jorma Ollila, Bj√∂rn Wahlroos and Risto Siilasmaa to discuss the future prospects of the Finnish economy and the importance of growth in entrepreneurship, bringing together a live audience of over 1,700 people. The event itself gained wide national recognition, as Nokia's issues in the mobile industry had stirred a lot of discussion on these topics. After the event, Aaltoes was widely featured in the Finnish media, for instance Helsingin Sanomat and Image magazine both wrote lengthy feature stories of the society. Aaltoes today Today, Aaltoes maintains a 1,500 square meter co-working space on Aalto University's campus in Otaniemi, called the Startup Sauna and is organizing over 100 events with nearly 10,000 participants (hackathons, pitching, networking, talks, panels and other events related to entrepreneurship) per year. The biggest to name are TeamUp, Summer of Startups, FallUp, Junction, and Slush, one of the world‚Äôs largest tech conferences. Aaltoes also gave start to such projects as Startup Life, a year-round, non-profit internship program for the talented people in Finland and Sweden, and Startup Sauna. As of 2018, TeamUp and Summer of Startups have been merged to become Kiuas Accelerator, a combination of a startup accelerator and incubator program. The organization is funded by the university, public organizations, non-profits, government, and corporations, and operates an annual budget between 500,000 and 800,000 euros.

The reign of these two Ascanian Margraves was characterized by an expansion of the Margraviate, which annexed the remaining parts of Teltow and Barnim, the Uckermark, the Lordship of Stargard, the Lubusz Land and parts of the Neumark east of the Oder. They consolidated the position of Brandenburg within the Holy Roman Empire, which was reflected in the fact that in 1256, Otto III was a candidate to be elected King of the Germans. They founded several cities and developed the twin cities of C√∂lln and Berlin. They expanded the Ascanian castle in nearby Spandau and made it their preferred residence. Before their death, they divided the Margraviate in a Johannine and an Ottonian part. The Ascanians were traditionally buried in the Lehnin Abbey in the Ottonian part of the country. In 1258, they founded a Cistercian monastery named Mariensee, where members of the Johannine line could be buried. In 1266, they changed their mind and founded a second monastery, named Chorin, 8 km southwest of Mariensee. John was initially buried at Mariensee; his body was moved to Chorin in 1273. After the Ottonian line died out in 1317, John I's grandson Waldemar reunited the Margraviate. Life  Regency and guardianship  John was the elder son of Albert II of the Brandenburg line of the House of Ascania and Mechthild (Matilda), the daughter of Margrave Conrad II of Lusatia, a junior line of the House of Wettin. Since both John and his two years younger brother Otto III were minors when their father died in 1220, Emperor Frederick II transferred the regency to Archbishop Albert I of Magdeburg. The guardianship was taken up by the children's first cousin once removed, Count Henry I of Anhalt, the older brother of Duke Albert I of Saxony, a cousin of Albert II. As the sons of Duke Bernhard III of Saxony, they were the closest relatives, and Henry had the older rights. In 1221, their mother, Countess Matilda, purchased the regency from the Archbishop of Magdeburg for 1900 silver Marks and then ruled jointly with Henry I.Stefan Warnatsch: Geschichte des Klosters Lehnin ..., p. 62 The Archbishop of Magdeburg then travelled to Italy, to visit Emperor Frederick II and Duke Albert I of Saxony attempted to grab power in Brandenburg, causing a rift with his brother Henry I. The Saxon attack presented an opportunity for Count Palatine Henry V to get involved. Emperor Frederick II managed to prevent a feud, urging them to keep the peace. After Matilda died in 1225, the brothers ruled the Margraviate of Brandenburg jointly. John I was about twelve years old at the time, and Otto III was ten. They were knighted on 11 May 1231 in Brandenburg an der Havel and this is generally taken as the beginning of their reign.brandenburg1260.de Marca BrandenburgensisLyon 2013, pp. 203  Domestic policies  The Ascanian Margraviate of Brandenburg, around 1320 After the death of Count Henry of Brunswick-L√ºneburg in 1227, the brothers supported his nephew, their brother-in-law Otto the Child, who was only able to prevail against Hohenstaufen claims and its vassals by force of arms. In 1229, there was a feud with former regent Archbishop Albert, which ended peacefully. Like their former opponents and defenders, they appeared at the Diet of Mainz in 1235, where the Public Peace of Mainz was proclaimed. After the dispute over the kingship between Conrad IV and Henry Raspe the brothers recognized William II of Holland as king in 1251. They first exercised Brandenburg's electoral privilege in 1257, when they voted for king Alfonso X of Castile. Although Alfonso was not elected, the fact that they were able to vote illustrates the growing importance of Brandenburg, which had been founded only a century earlier, in 1157, by Albert the Bear. When John and Otto came to power, Brandenburg was considered an insignificant little principality on the eastern border. By the 1230s, the Margraves of Brandenburg had definitely gained the heritable post of Imperial Chamberlain and the indisputable right to vote in the election of the King of the Germans.Lutz Partenheimer: Albrecht der B√§r ..., p. 195  Developing the country  Towns on the Teltow and Barnim plateaus, around 1250 Deed of John I, raising Frankfurt an der Oder (Vrankenvorde) to city status in 1253 John I and his brother Otto III developed the territory of their margraviate and expanded market towns and castles, including Spandau, C√∂lln and Prenzlau into towns and centers of commerce. They also expanded Frankfurt an der Oder and John I awarded it city status in 1253. = The Teltow War and the Treaty of Landin = Between 1230 and 1245, Brandenburg acquired the remaining part of Barnim and the southern Uckermark up to the Welse river. On 20 June 1236, the Margraviate acquired the Lordships of Stargard, Beseritz and Wustrow by the Treaty of Kremmen from Duke Wartislaw III of Pomerania. Later that year, the brothers initiated the construction of Stargard Castle, to secure the northernmost part of their territory. From 1239 to 1245, the brothers fought the Teltow War against the Margraves of Meissen of the House of Wettin. At stake was a Slavic castle at K√∂penick, a former headquarters of the Sprewanen tribe, located at the confluence of the Spree and Dahme rivers, at the time, it was just east of Berlin; today it is part of the city. It dominated the Barnim and Teltow areas. In 1245, the brothers managed to take both castle a K√∂penick and a fortress at Mittenwalde. From this base, they could expand further to the east. In 1249, they acquired the Lubusz Land and reached the river Oder. In 1250, the brothers closed the Treaty of Landin with the Dukes of Pomerania. Under this treaty, they received the northern part of the Uckermark (), north of the Welse river and the districts of Randow and L√∂cknitz, in exchange for the half of the Lordship of Wolgast that John I had received as dowry from King Waldemar II of Denmark when he married his first wife, Sophia. This treaty is considered the birth of the Uckermark as a part of Brandenburg.Uwe Michas: Die Eroberung und Besiedlung ..., p. 41 = Policies to stabilize the Neumark = During the first third of the 13th century German settlers were recruited by Duke Leszek I the White to settle the Neumark. After he died in 1227, the Polish central government collapsed, allowing the Margraves of Brandenburg to expand eastwards. They acquired land east of the Oder and expanded their domain further east to the river Drawa and north to the river Persante. In 1257, John I founded the town of Landsberg (now called ) as an alternative river crossing across the Warta, competing with the crossing in the Polish town of Santok, detracting from the considerable revenues Santok made from foreign trade (custom duties, fees from the market operation and storage fees), similar to the way Berlin had been founded to compete with K√∂penick. In 1261, the Margraves purchased My≈õlib√≥rz () from the Knights Templar and began developing the town to their power center in the Neumark. To stabilize their new possessions, the Margraves used the tried and tested Ascanian policy of founding monasteries and settlements. As early as 1230, they supported the Polish Count Dionysius Bronisius when he founded the Cistercian Paradies Monastery near Miƒôdzyrzecz () as a filiation of the monastery at Lehnin. Their cooperation with the Polish count provided border security against Pomerania and prepared the economy of the area for integration into the Neumark. Among the settlers in the Neumark was the von Sydow family, who were later ennobled. the small town of Cedynia (; today in the Polish Voivodeship of West Pomerania) was enfoeffed to the noble von Jagow family. The historian Stefan Warnatsch has summarized this development and the attempts of the Ascanians to gain access to the Baltic Sea from the middle Oder and the Uckermark as follows: The great success of the territorial expansion in the 13th century was largely due to the great-grandsons of Albert the Bear [...]. The design of their reign reached much further spatially and conceptually then that of their predecessors.Stefan Warnatsch: Geschichte des Klosters Lehnin ..., p. 26 According to Lutz Partenheimer: [around 1250], the Ascanians had pushed back their competitors from Magdeburg, Wettin, Mecklenburg, Pomerania, Poland and the smaller competitors on all fronts. However, John I and Otto III failed to produce the strategically important connection to the Baltic Sea.  Development in the Berlin area  The development of the Berlin area is closely related to the other policies of the two Margraves. The two founding cities of Berlin (C√∂lln and Berlin) were founded relatively late. The settlements began around 1170 and achieved city status around 1240.Wolfgang Fritze: Gr√ºndungsstadt Berlin. Die Anfange von Berlin-C√∂lln als Forschungsproblem, Potsdam, 2000 Other settlement in the area, such as Spandau and K√∂penick, date back to the Slavic period (from about 720) and these naturally had a greater strateigc and political importance than the young merchant towns C√∂lln and Berlin. For a long time the border between the territories of the Slavic tribes Hevelli and Sprewanen crossed straight through the area of today's Berlin. Around 1130, Spandau was an eastern outpost of the Hevelli under Pribislav. When Pribilav died in 1150, Spandau fell to Brandenburg under the terms of an inheritance treaty between Pribislav and Albert the Bear. Brandenburg did not acquire K√∂penick until 1245. = Residence at Spandau = Plauer See, the scene of a battle against Magdeburg in 1229 In 1229, the Margraves of Brandenburg lost a battle against their former guardian, the archbishop of Magdeburg at the Plauer See, close to their residence in Brandenburg an der Havel. The escaped to the fortress at Spandau. In the following years, the brothers made Spandau their preferred residence, next to Tangerm√ºnde in the Altmark. Between 1232 and 1266, seventeen stays at Spandau have been documented, more than at any other town.Felix Escher: Der Wandel der Residenzfunktion. ..., p. 161 Albert the Bear probably expanded the fortress island at Spandau eastwards before or shortly after his victory against a certain Jaxa (this was probably Jaxa of K√∂penick) in 1157. Towards the end of the 12th century, the Ascanians moved the fortress about a kilometer to the North, to the location of today's Spandau Citadel, probably because of a rising ground water table. The presence of an Ascanian fortress on this site in 1197 has been established.Winfried Schich: Die Entstehung der mittelalterlichen Stadt Spandau. ..., p. 63f John I and Otto III expanded the fortress and promoted the civitas in the adjacent settlement. They gave it city rights in 1232 or earlier. They founded the Benedictine nunnery of St. Mary in 1239. The Nonnendammallee, one of the oldest streets in Berlin and as Nonnendamm part of a trade route as early as the 13th century, is still a reminder of the former nunneryNonnendammallee, in: Stra√üennamenlexikon des Luisenst√§dtischen Bildungsvereins = Expansion of C√∂lln and Berlin = John I (sitting) and Otto III studying the (alleged) city charter of Berlin and C√∂lln (now in the Spandau Citadel) Berlin and C√∂lln around 1230 St. Nicholas Church in Berlin, founded around 1220/1230, picture from 1740 According to the current state of research, no evidence has been found that a Slavic settlement existed in the area around the twin towns of Berlin and C√∂lln.Winfried Schich: Das mittelalterliche Berlin, ... S. 151 The ford across the largely swampy Berlin Glacial Valley gained importance during the Slavic- German transition period, when John I and Otto III settled the sparsely populated plateaus of Teltow and Barnim with local Slavs and German immigrants. According to Adriaan von M√ºller, the strategic importance of C√∂lln and Berlin, and the reason for the foundation was probably to form a couterweight to K√∂penick, a secure trading hub held by the Wettin (dynasty)s with its own trade roues to the north and east. The broad ford across two or even three river arms away could best be protected by fortified settlements on both river banks. The Margraves protected the route to Halle across the northwestern Teltow plateau by a chain of Templar villages: Marienfelde, Mariendorf, Rixdorf and Tempelhof. After the Ascanians defeated the Wettins in the Teltow War of 1245, the importance of K√∂penick decreased, took an increasingly central position in the developing trading network.Adriaan von M√ºller: Gesicherte Spuren ..., p. 114f According to Winfried Schich, we can assume the Berlin and C√∂lln owe their development as urban settlements to the structural changes in this area due to the expansion during the High Middle Ages, which led both to a denser population and a reorganization of long- distance trade routes. [...] The dilluvial plateaus of Teltow and Barnim with their heavy and relatively fertile soils, were systematically settled and put under the plow during the reign of Margraves John I and Otto III.Winfried Schich: Das mittelalterliche Berlin, ... p. 157. During the first phase of settlement, the lowland areas along the river with their lighter soils seem to have been the preferred places of settlement. According to the of 1280, Berlin and other places were built' () by John I and Otto III. Since their reign had started in 1225, the period around 1230 is considered the founding period of Berlin. Recent archeological research has uncovered evidence of late 12th century market towns in both C√∂lln and Berlin. Ninety graves were excavated in the St. Nicholas Church, the oldest building in Berlin, with foundations dated 1220-1230 and some of these graves could also be from the late 12th century. This implies that the two Margraves did not actually found the cities of C√∂lln and Berlin, although they did play a decisive r√¥le in the early expansion of the cities.Winfried Schich: Das mittelalterliche Berlin, ... p. 142 ff and 159 Among the privileges granted to the two cities by the Margraves were Brandenburg Law (including absence of tolls, free exercise of trade and commerce, hereditary property rights) and in particular the staple right,According to Stich, the deed from 1298 in which Margrave Otto V confirmed the staple right granted by his father and uncle, was at least partially forged on a later date. Nevertheless, the staple right may have been granted by John I and Otto III which gave C√∂lln and Berlin an economic advantage of Spandau and K√∂penick. The Margraves gave the Mirica, the C√∂lln Moor, with all usage rights to the citizens of C√∂lln. The connection of the Margraves with Berlin is also evidenced by their choice of Hermann von Langele as their confessor. This Hermann von Langele was the first known member of the Franciscan convent at Berlin. He is mentioned as a witness in a deed issued by the Margrave in Spandau in 1257.Winfried Schich: Die Entstehung der mittelalterlichen Stadt Spandau. ..., p. 83  Inheritance and descendants  The joint rule of the Margraves ended in 1258 with a division of their territory. A cleverly managed division and continued consensual policy prevented the Margraviate from falling apart. The preparations for the reorganization may have begun in 1250, when the Uckermark was acquired, but no later than 1255, when John I married Jutta (Brigitte), the daughter of Duke Albert I of Saxony-Wittenberg.Stefan Warnatsch: Geschichte des Klosters Lehnin ..., S. 64f  Johannine and Ottonian line  = Chorin Abbey - Grave laying and power politics = Chorin Abbey, burial place of John I Chorin Abbey church Chorin Abbey, founded by John I and Otto III, north side, 1854 The politics of marriage and 1258 consummated division of the state government led to the joint foundation of the monastery of Mariensee on a former island in the Parsteiner See lake on the northeastern edge of today's Barnim. Until then, deceased Margraves of Brandenburg had been buried at Lehnin Abbey, in the Ottonian part of the Margraviate. The monastery of Mariensee was meant to provide the Johannine line with a burial place of their own. Construction of the monastery began in 1258 with monks from Lehnin. Even before Marinesee was completed in 1273, a decision was made to move to a new location approximately five miles to the southwest with the new name Chorin Abbey. When John I died in 1266, he was initially buried at Mariensee. In 1273, his body was moved to Chorin Abbey.Harald Schwillus and Stefan Beier: Zisterzienser zwischen ..., p. 11, 16 It appears that in 1266, John I arranged for the monastery to move and that he donated rich gifts to the new Chorin Abbey, including the village of Parstein. His sons later confirmed these donations for the benefit of their father's soul and their own.Wolfgang Erdmann: Zisterzienser-Abtei Chorin. ..., p. 10 As with all monastery founded by the Ascanians, political and economic considerations played an important r√¥le, alongside the pastoral aspects. A Slavic circular rampart existed on the island, to the west of the monastery. John I and Otto III probably used this rampart as a castle against their Pomeranian competitors. The monastery was meant to provide central and administrative functions. \\"Both the foundation itself and the location in a regional centre 'across' the trade route [...] in a populated area are to be interpreted as the result of political calculations\\".Wolfgang Erdmann: Zisterzienser-Abtei Chorin. ..., S. 7 = Dividing the Margraviate = When the Margraviate was divided, John I received Stendal and the Altmark, which was considered the \\"cradle\\" of Brandenburg, and would remain a part until 1806. He also received the Havelland and the Uckermark. His brother Otto III received Spandau, Salzwedel, Barnim, the Lubusz Land and Stargard.Sources do not entirely agree on who received what. For example Marca Brandenburgensis says that The elder (Ottonian) line received the Stendal area in the Altmark, the Havelland, Teltow, Barnim, parts of the Neumark and the cities of Brandenburg an der Havel (Altstadt, i.e. the part North of the river), Berlin and Spandau The most important factors in this division were revenue and the number of vassals; geographical factors played only a subordinate r√¥le.Uwe Michas: Die Eroberung und Besiedlung ..., p. 58 Their successors as Margraves of Brandenburg, Otto IV \\"with the Arrow\\", Waldemar \\"the Great\\" and Henry II \\"the Child\\" all stem from the Johannine line. Otto's sons and grandsons and John's younger sons also styled themselves \\"Margrave of Brandenburg\\" and as such co-signed official document -- for example, John's sons John II and Conrad so-signed in 1273 the decision to move Mariensee monastery to Chorin -- however, they remained \\"co-regents\\". The Ottonian line died out in 1317 with the death of Margrave John V in Spandau, so that Brandenburg was reunited under Waldemar the Great. The Johannine line died out only three years later, with the death of Henry the Child in 1320, ending Ascanian rule in Brandenburg. In 1290, nineteen Margraves of the two lines had gathered on a hill near Rathenow; in 1318 only two Margraves were left alive: Waldemar and Henry the Child.Stefan Warnatsch: Geschichte des Klosters Lehnin ..., p. 66 The last Ascanian in Brandenburg, the eleven-year-old Henry the Child, only played a minor r√¥le and was already at the mercy of the various houses trying to grab power in the upcoming power vacuum.  Marriage and issue  In 1230, John I married Sophie of Denmark (1217‚Äì1247), daughter of King Valdemar II of Denmark and Berengaria of Portugal. With her, he had the following children: * John II of Brandenburg (1237(?)-1281), Margrave of Brandenburg as co-ruler. * Otto IV of Brandenburg (), Margrave of Brandenburg. * Conrad I of Brandenburg (-1304), Margrave of Brandenburg as co-regent, the father of Waldemar, the last Ascanian Margrave of Brandenburg. * Eric of Brandenburg (-1295), Archbishop of Magdeburg from 1283 to 1295. * Helene of Brandenburg (1241 or 1242 - 1304), married in 1258 to Margrave Dietrich of Landsberg (1242‚Äì1285). * Hermann of Brandenburg (died: probably 1291), Bishop of Havelberg from 1290 onward. In 1255, John I married Brigitte Jutta of Saxony, the daughter of Albert I, Duke of Saxony and Agnes of Austria (1206‚Äì1226). With her, he had the following children: * Agnes of Brandenburg (after 1255 - 1304), married firstly in 1273 to King Erik V of Denmark (1249‚Äì1286), and secondly in 1293 to Gerhard II, Count of Holstein-Pl√∂n (1254‚Äì1312). * Henry I of Brandenburg, \\"Lackland\\" (1256‚Äì1318), Margrave of Brandenburg and Landsberg. * Matilda of Brandenburg (died: before 1309), married to Bogislaw IV, Duke of Pomerania (1258‚Äì1309). * Albert of Brandenburg (-1290) John I held King Eric V prisoner from 1262 to 1264. In 1273, the King of Denmark married John's daughter, Agnes of Brandenburg. After John's death in 1266, his brother Otto III ruled Brandenburg alone. After Otto's death in 1267, John's son, Otto IV, took over as the senior Margrave.  Double statue of the brothers at the Siegesallee  Siegesallee in Berlin with double statue for the Margraves John I and Otto III. The left side figure is the priest Simeon from C√∂lln, the figure on the right is Marsilius de Berlin. Sculptor: Max Baumbach, unveiled in 1900 The double statue depicted on the left stood in the Siegesallee in the Gro√üer Tiergarten in Berlin. The Siegesallee was a grand boulevard commissioned by Emperor Wilhelm II in 1895 with statues illustrating the history of Brandenburg and Prussia. Between 1895 and 1901, 27 sculptors led by Reinhold Begas created 32 statues of Prussian and Brandenburg rulers, each 2.75 high. Each statue was flanked by two smaller busts representing people who had played an important r√¥le in the life of the historic ruler. The central statue in group 5 was the double statue of John and Otto. On the left was a bust of provost Simeon of C√∂lln, who was a witness, on 28 October 1237, together with bishop Gernand of Brandenburg, of the oldest deed in which C√∂lln is mentioned.28\\\\. Oktober (year 1237) in: Tagesfakten by the Luisenst√§dtischer Bildungsverein On the right was a bust of Marsilius de Berlin, the first recorded mayor () of Berlin. He was simultaneously mayor of C√∂lln.Winfried Schich: Das mittelalterliche Berlin, ... p. 141. The choice of the secular and ecclesiastical leaders of Berlin and C√∂lln as flanking characters for John and Otto underscores the pivotal r√¥le the city of Berlin played in the lives of the Margraves in the opinion of Reinhold Koser, the historian who did the research for the Siegesallee. Koser regarded the founding and development of the city as the Margrave's most important policy, more so than the expansion the principality and the founding of the monastery. he was also impressed by the consensus which characterised their joint rule, as presented in the Chronicle of 1280. According to Koser, the sculptor Max Baumbach was responsible for the decision to make the founding of Berlin the central theme of the double statue, rather than the expansion or the founding of the monastery. John I depicted sitting on a stone, with the city charter of Berlin and C√∂lln spread across his knees. The younger Otto III stand beside him, pointing to the deed with one hand, while his other arm rests on a spear. The outstretched arms and bowed head suggest the brothers' protection and promotion of the twin cities. The fact that the two young men are depicted as mature men was seen by Koser as legitimized by the right of artistic freedom. Two adolescents would not have been able to adequately express the founding of a future world city, from the perspective of the late 19th century interpretation of history.Uta Lehnert: Der Kaiser und ..., p. 115 The overall architecture of the statue group maintains a romanticistic style. According to Uta Lehnert, the two eagles show characteristics of the Jugendstil. Ancestry  References   Primary references  * Heinrici de Antwerpe: Can.

His father was later able to send him to Leeds Grammar School. Nichols was for some time a private tutor, and then entered into business as a printer and bookseller at Briggate, Leeds. Nichols died in Hoxton Square on 26 November 1861. He married Miss Bursey of Stockton-on-Tees in 1813, and had many children, of whom two survived. Works Nichols printed some small volumes, including John Byrom's Poems (1814), and pamphlets, and edited the Leeds Literary Observer vol. i., from January to September 1819. This periodical he wanted to replace by a more ambitious monthly miscellany; but in the event he moved to London and opened a printing office at 22 Warwick Square, Newgate Street. His best-known work Calvinism and Arminianism compared (1824), was written and printed there. In 1825 there was published the first volume of his translation of the Works of Jacobus Arminius, with a life and appendices, which met with the approval of Abraham des Amorie van der Hoeven. The third volume, issued in 1875, was translated by William Nichols. Nichols moved his printing office in 1832 to Hoxton Square, where he remained the rest of his life.

The regiment was raised in August 1914, as the divisional cavalry regiment for the 1st Division. The regiment fought against the forces of the German Empire and the Ottoman Empire, in Egypt, at Gallipoli, on the Western front, on the Sinai Peninsula, and in Palestine and Jordan. After the armistice the regiment eventually returned to Australia in March 1919. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded twenty-one battle honours. During the inter-war years, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the Corangamite region of southern Victoria. It was later converted to a motor regiment during the Second World War but was disbanded in late 1944 without having been deployed overseas. In the post war period, the regiment was re-raised as an amalgamated unit, designated the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse, which is currently part of the Australian Army Reserve. Formation On 11 August 1914, the 4th Light Horse Regiment was raised in Melbourne, as the divisional cavalry regiment of the 1st Division. Light horse regiments normally comprised twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, each of six troops.Gullett 1941, p. 54. Each troop was divided into eight sections, of four men each. In action one man of each section was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiment's rifle strength by a quarter.Horner and Williams, Chapter: \\"Setting up the Light Horse\\" The 4th Light Horse eventually raised five squadrons and later in the war, two of these squadrons were detached to accompany the Australian infantry divisions to France, while the other three remained to the Middle East, serving with the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division. All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted infantry,Gullett 1941, p. 29. and mounted exclusively on the Australian Waler horse.Gullett 1941, p. 38. Operational history Trooper A. G. Forsyth of the 4th Light Horse Regiment. Forsyth later transferred to the 2nd Anzac Mounted Regiment after Gallipoli and died of pneumonia on 2 April 1917 in England. Gallipoli The regiment sailed for war on 19 October 1914 and arrived in Egypt on 10 December. When the rest of the division departed to take part in the Gallipoli, the light horse were left behind the authorities under the belief that mounted troops would not be needed in the campaign due to the terrain. However, infantry casualties were so severe it was decided to send them, without their horses, as infantry reinforcements. The regiment landed at what became known as ANZAC Cove between the 22 and 24 May 1915. Initially, the regiment was broken up and provided squadrons as reinforcements for infantry battalions at various points around the beachhead, and it was not until 11 June that the regiment concentrated as a formed unit. After this, they were mostly used to defend the Allies' precarious position on the peninsula, especially in the area of \\"Ryrie's Post\\", although they did take part in several small assaults. The regiment left Gallipoli prior to the end of the campaign on 11 December 1915. Western Front On their return to Egypt the regiment was required to raise a fourth squadron, known as 'D' Squadron. Together with 'B' Squadron, 'D' Squadron was detached from the regiment and assigned as the divisional cavalry formations, for the 1st and 3rd Divisions, and in mid-1916 they were sent to France, for service on the Western Front. These two squadrons later took part in the Battle of Messines, the Third Battle of Ypres, the Battle of Broodseinde, the Battle of Passchendaele, the Battle of the Lys, the Battle of Kemmel, the Second Battle of the Marne and the Battle of Tardenois. The two squadrons together with a squadron from New Zealand were eventually amalgamated and renamed the I Anzac Corps Mounted Regiment. and together earned nine battle honours on the Western Front. Sinai and Palestine Campaign The 4th Light Horse in Egypt, after the war in 1919. With only two squadrons remaining in Egypt, a new squadron was raised, confusingly also called 'B' Squadron. The regiment was then deployed in defence the Suez Canal, for the remainder of the year. In 1916, plans were made to convert the 4th Light Horse, along with the 11th and 12th Light Horse Regiments into cameleers, but this plan was not followed through.Bou 2010, p. 152. In April 1917, the regiment moved into the Sinai but were only used for rear area security. The regiment was then assigned to the 4th Light Horse Brigade, and on 31 October took part in its first large battle: the Battle of Beersheba, which was part of the wider Third Battle of Gaza. During the battle, the 4th and 12th Light Horse carried out a cavalry charge on the town of Beersheba, which has since become known as the \\"charge of Beersheba\\". They were then involved in the advance into Palestine, before being rested in the early months of 1918. During the rest of the campaign the regiment took part in the Battle of Mughar Ridge, the Battle of Nebi Samwill, the capture of Jerusalem, the Battle of Es Sal and the Battle of Megiddo. A patrol from the regiment were among the first Allied troops to enter Damascus on 1 October 1918. The Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, and the war in the Middle East ended. However, the regiment had to return to Egypt, where rioting had started in March 1919, and they were subsequently involved in policing duties. Finally, in June 1919, the regiment sailed for Australia where it was eventually disbanded. The regiment's involvement in the war cost them 105 killed and 332 wounded. Perpetuation In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the honours and traditions of the AIF by reorganising the units of the Citizens Force to replicate the numerical designations of their related AIF units.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result, the 4th Light Horse was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the 3rd Military District, which encompassed the majority of the state of Victoria. Adopting the designation of the \\"Corangamite Light Horse\\", it assumed the lineage of several previously existing militia units, including the 20th Light Horse (Corangamite Light Horse) that had been formed in 1913. This unit traced its lineage back to the 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment (Victorian Mounted Rifles), which had been formed in 1903 as part of the amalgamation of Australia's colonial forces into the Australian Army after Federation.Festberg 1972, p. 41. In early 1936, the regiment was amalgamated with the 19th Light Horse to form the 4th/19th Light Horse. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the 4th/19th was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, which was part of the 2nd Cavalry Division.Finlayson 2012, p. 191. In March 1942, the 4th/19th was split again and the 4th was re-raised as a motor regiment and undertook garrison duties in Australia. In 1943, it was gazetted as an AIF unit after the majority of its personnel volunteered to serve outside of Australian territory; nevertheless, it did not serve overseas and in June 1944, as the Australian Army undertook a partial demobilisation, the regiment was deemed surplus to requirements and was disbanded without having seen operational service during the war. In the post war period, the regiment was re-raised as an amalgamated unit, designated the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse. Formed in July 1948 as part of the Citizen Military Force, this unit was established as an armoured regiment within the 2nd Armoured Brigade. Throughout the early 1960s, this unit maintained a squadron of Regular personnel, but these were later transferred to the 1st Cavalry Regiment, which was later re-designated as the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. The 4th/19th remains part of the Australian Army Reserve and is currently part of the 2nd Division.Finlayson 2012, p. 317.

Robert Andrews House is an historic house at 428 South Bridgton Road in Bridgton, Maine, United States. Built in 1805 by John Kilborn, Jr., a local master builder, it was the home for many years of Robert Andrews, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and an early settler of the Bridgton area. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Andrews House stands close to the east side of South Bridgton Road (Maine State Route 107) in a rural area of southern Bridgton. The house is a rambling connected series of wood frame structures, with the main house block at the southern end, and ells extending along the road to the north and behind the house to the east. The main block is a 2-1/2 story structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. Decorative elements are minimal, with the central entrance framed by pilasters and a fanlight, with a dentillated cornice above. A shed-roof porch extends across the southern facade, supported by fluted Doric columns. A 1-1/2 story four-bay addition, its front flush with that of the main block, extends north, with another section extending further north to join the house to a carriage barn. On the east side a series of two ells join the house to a livestock barn. Lieutenant Robert Andrews, a native of Boxford, Massachusetts, was one of several American Revolutionary War veterans from that town to receive grants of land from the state in 1780 in the area of what is now Bridgton. His first house location is not known, but he commissioned construction of this \\"mansion house\\" in 1805 from John Kilborn, Jr., another war veteran with a reputation for high-quality workmanship. Andrews was a major benefactor and civic actor in the town, serving as town selectman, and donating land and funds for churches and schools. A bachelor, he shared the house with younger relatives as he got older, building the four-bay ell on the north side as his living space. This arrangement ultimately led to the division of the house as a two- family after his death in 1845; the house was returned to single-family use in the 1990s. The extensive series of additions in two directions is a consequence of this division. One family Andrews shared the house with was with his niece and her husband, Sophia and Thomas Cleaves. Their son Henry, who later served as Governor of Maine, was born in this house in 1840.

The open marine radiolarite is very rich in silica.  Definitions  The Ruhpolding Formation derives its name from its type locality Ruhpolding, a commune in Upper Bavaria situated at the edge of the Northern Calcareous Alps. The type locality, situated southwest of Ruhpolding (at Gschwendlbach near R√∂thelmoos, Urschlau) is a bad choice as it doesn't show the characteristic red radiolarites found elsewhere in the Austroalpine domain but only grey to red cherty limestones.Steiger, E. & Steiger, T.(1994).

Wien. In a wider context all the radiolarites of Late Bajocian, Callovian, Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian and Early Tithonian age are reunited within the Ruhpolding Radiolarite Group (RRG).  Occurrence  The type locality of the Ruhpolding Formation belongs to the Lechtal Nappe of the Bajuvaric Unit, one of the major tectonic subdivisions of the Northern Calcareous Alps. The occurrence of the formation extends from the Allg√§u Alps in the west via the Lechtal Alps to the Chiemgau Alps in the east. The Ruhpolding Formation is also found in the Tirolic Unit to the south of the Bajuvaric Unit and therefore extends into the eastern part of the Northern Calcareous Alps. The Ruhpolding Radiolarite Group is encountered in the Southern Alps and even in the Penninic domain (Piemont Zone).  Stratigraphy  Within the Bajuvaric Unit the Ruhpolding Formation conformably overlies the Chiemgau Beds, further west in the Allg√§u Alps it overlies the upper Allg√§u Beds. It is conformably overlain by the so-called Aptychus Limestone of the Ammergau Formation. The changeover to the Aptychus Limestone is gradual. The lower contact of the Ruhpolding Formation is very distinct and outlined by a several centimeter thick bedding joint.Krystyn, L.(1971). Stratigraphie, Fauna und Fazies der Klaus-Schichten (Dogger/Oxford) in den √∂stlichen Nordalpen (√ñsterreich). Verh. Geol. Bundesanst., p. 486-509. Wien. ‚Äì as can be seen in the Tauglboden Basin of the northern Tirolic Unit where the Ruhpolding Formation overlies the red limestone of the Klaus Formation. In the Tauglboden Basin the Ruhpolding Formation is followed by the Tauglboden Formation of Kimmeridgian and lower Tithonian age. In the Sillenkopf Basin of the southern Tirolic Unit the Ruhpolding Formation is underlain by the Strubberg Formation and overlain by the Sillenkopf Formation which was deposited at the same time as the Tauglboden Formation.  Lithology  Various radiolarians under the microscope Lithologically the up to 50 meter thick Ruhpolding Formation consists of black-green to red radiolarites grading into cherty limestones, cherty marls and cherty shales. It has formed from radiolarian ooze. The ooze consolidated diagenetically to thinly layered and regularly banded cherts. The chert layers are usually separated by very thin claystone layers creating a cyclic appearance. This cyclicity might correlate with Milankovic cycles. A plausible diagenetic cause can be excluded due to slump structures that incorporate several individual cycles. The cherts are mainly earthy red, but show greenish-blackish hues in places. The red coloration due to hematite is caused by the complete oxidation of iron compounds in oxygen-rich bottom waters. The red layers show Fe3+/Fe2+ > 1, whereas in the greenish layers the ratio is < 1, the coloration in the latter being tied to sericite, chlorite and maybe pyrite. In thin section it can be observed that the siliceous groundmass is derived from the innumerable skeletons of radiolarians (maximal size 0.1 mm in diameter) altered during diagenesis. The cherts chemical composition nearly approaches 100% silica. On a macroscopic scale the rock is intensely criss-crossed by net-like fracture systems, which were later filled by calcite. These fractures were opened by tectonic stresses judging from structures like tension gashes. Tuff layers can be encountered right at the very base of the formation. They are probably a precursor of the later ehrwaldite magmatism.  Fossils  The Ruhpolding Formation consists mainly of microfossils, the bulk being made up by radiolarians. Macrofossils are extremely rare apart from some aptychi, crinoids like Saccocoma, spicules and filaments. Benthic foraminifera can occasionally be found but planktonic foraminifera are completely absent.Diersche, V.(1980).

The water depth of deposition is still disputed. Today radiolarian oozes form below the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) at water depth. In the Upper Jurassic the CCD was probably much higher and ranged somewhere between depth due to a greatly diminished calcareous nanoplankton at that time. The radiolarian blooms probably were triggered by volcanism and/or changing circulation patterns. The required silica was provided by volcanic exhalations and/or by upwelling.Diersche, V. Die Radiolarite des Oberjura in den N√∂rdlichen Kalkalpen zwischen Salzach und Tiroler Ache. Diss. Techn. Univ. Berlin.  Ruhpolding turning point  The sedimentation of the radiolarites represents a sudden and drastic change in the sedimentation history of the Northern Calcareous Alps. This event was termed the Ruhpolding turning point (Ruhpoldinger Wende in German). It was a decisive and not a transient, repetitive change, because the deep-water radiolarites and later Aptychen Beds clearly differ in character from the lower and mid-Jurassic sediments. During the Dogger the turning point was preceded by a rapid drop in sedimentation rates and ensuing thicknesses. This is exemplified by the increasing number of omission surfaces in the upper Klaus-Formation combined with a general slowed- down and more patchy sedimentation. This starved sediment supply is probably due to a continuous deepening of the basin. The turning point is also marked by tectonic movements enhancing the topographic differences of the seafloor. For instance already existing topographic highs were raised into shallow water. On these raised areas the Ruhpolding radiolarites did not accumulate; instead red limestones like the Agathakalk or the Hasselberg Limestone continued to be deposited here. This tectonically accentuated profile was slowly levelled later during the sedimentation of the Aptychen Beds. Another characteristic of the Ruhpolding turning point is the associated volcanic activity. The tuff layers right at the onset of the Ruhpolding formation are without doubt the precursors of the Upper Jurassic magmatic pulse in the Alps.Schlager, W. & Schlager, M.(1973). Clastic Sediments associated with radiolarites (Tauglboden-Schichten, Upper Jurassic, Eastern Alps). Sedimentology, 20, p. 65‚Äì89, Amsterdam Also noticeable is a pronounced increase in autokinetic sediments like turbidites, debris flows, slides etc. at or near the turning point. Good examples are the limestones of the Barmstein, the Sonnwendbreccia, the Tauglboden Formation and the Strubberg Formation. The gradual replacement of the radiolarian oozes of the Ruhpolding Formation by coccolith oozes of the overlying Aptychen Beds can be explained by further deepening of the basin and/or by blooming calcareous nanoplankton.  Age  The Ruhpolding-Formation was deposited during the Late Oxfordian, about 157 to 155 million years BP. This biostratigraphic age (maximum age) is based on ammonite finds in the upper Klaus Formation.Wendt, J.(1969). Stratigraphie und Pal√§ogeographie des Roten Jurakalkes im Sonnwendgebirge (Tirol, √ñsterreich). N. Jb. Geol. Pal., 132, p. 219‚Äì238.Stuttgart Meanwhile, the general diachronicity of the Rupolding Formation has been recognized. By using radiolarian stratigraphy a more recent study by Wegener, Suzuki & Gawlick (2003) found a Middle Oxfordian to Lower Kimmeridgian age for the upper red radiolarite, i. e. an absolute age of 159 ‚Äì 154 million years BP.Wegener, E., Suzuki, H. & Gawlick, H.-J.(2003).

It is native to western North America from Yukon and British Columbia south through the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, and the Great Plains.Esser, Lora L. 1993. Oxytropis sericea. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Retrieved 12-07-2011. This plant is a perennial herb growing up to about in maximum height. It grows from a long taproot. The leaves are up to long. One plant may produce several flowering stalks, each with up to 27 flowers. The fruit is a legume pod up to long containing many hairy, leathery, kidney-shaped seeds. The tough seeds can remain dormant in a soil seed bank for a long time. This helps the species survive stress conditions such as cold, exposure, and desiccation. This is often one of the first plants to grow up in the spring. The plant may occur in a wide variety of habitat types, including those in subalpine and alpine climates. It may occur at in elevation in Colorado. It easily takes hold on rangeland that has been disturbed, and in mature, climax plant communities. This plant, a species of locoweed, is a common cause of poisoning in livestock in North America. Locoweed poisoning is \\"the most widespread poisonous plant problem in the western United States.\\" Locoweeds cause locoism, a disease state resulting from chronic neurological damage. Symptoms of locoism include depression, blindness, loss of coordination, emaciation, tremors, paralysis, constipation, deterioration of the coat, decreased libido, abortion, seizures,Stegelmeier, B. L., et al. (1998). Tissue swainsonine clearance in sheep chronically poisoned with locoweed (Oxytropis sericea). Journal of Animal Science 76 1140-44. Retrieved 12-07-2011. and death.
