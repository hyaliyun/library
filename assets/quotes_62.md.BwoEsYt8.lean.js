Plot Triad leaders White Tiger (Chan Yuen) and Green Dragon (Michael Chan) become enemies while fighting for the objection of Yuk-fung (Yip San). Tiger abducts the child Prince and fabricates a story of how his mother was abducted by Dragon. Since then, Prince was determined to study martial arts in order to kill Dragon and rescue his mother. Prince was trained by Tiger to be a killer, and killing Dragon have become Prince's goal. One day, when Prince (Jacky Cheung) had the chance to kill Dragon, he sees his dream lover, Tweedy (Rosamund Kwan), and as a result, fails to kill Dragon, breaking his reputation of never making mistakes on missions. Prince's assistant, Ching-ching (Carina Lau), whom is deeply in love with him, arranges Tweedy to seemingly disappear for a while for the sake of him. However, Prince mistakenly believes that Ching-ching betrayed him and killed Tweedy and begins to drink heavily. Because he thinks Tweedy is dead, Prince feels hopeless. Later, Tiger calls Dragon out to meet with him, telling him that Prince is actually Dragon's son, a fact that Prince did not expect.

Because some aberrant individuals often can be found far outside their typical depth range, the MDO is sometimes defined as the depth below which 90% of individuals are observed or captured.Childress, James J. 1975. The respiratory rates of midwater crustaceans as a function of depth of occurrence and relation to the oxygen minimum layer off Southern California. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology. 50(4):787-799 In practice, observations of pelagic organisms are limited to trawling at a known depth, scuba diving observations, or use of underwater vehicles such as ROVs or AUVs. A species' MDO can change throughout ontogeny if the species is an ontogenetic vertical migrator; that is, it changes its habitat depth as it matures (typically descending deeper with increased maturity). Additionally, some species undergo diel vertical migration in which they migrate vertically each day. In these taxa, the MDO is defined based on their shallowest depth during their diel migration.  Relation to metabolic rate  For pelagic visually oriented organisms such as cephalopods, fishes, and crustaceans, metabolic rate decreases with increasing minimum depth of occurrence (MDO).Seibel, Brad A., Thuesen, Erik V., Childress, James J., Gorodezky, Laura A. 1997. Decline in Pelagic Cephalopod Metabolism with Habitat Depth Reflects Differences in Locomotory Efficiency. Biological Bulletin. 192:262-278 In other words, the shallower an organism ever has to go, the higher its metabolic rate must be. This is because inhabiting shallow waters requires locomotory ability to evade visually-hunting predators and function well as a visual predator on one's own prey. The visual-interactions hypothesis is the idea that many pelagic animals in the ocean have decreasing activity levels and metabolic rates with increasing minimum-depth of occurrence (MDO) due to decreasing light levels. According to this hypothesis,Childress, James J. 1995. Are there physiological and biochemical adaptations of metabolism in deep-sea animals? Trends in Ecology & Evolution 10:30-36 high metabolic rates are not an asset but a high cost to an organism, unless that high metabolic rate is necessary for survival. In well-lit euphotic waters, a high metabolic rate is advantageous because it helps an organism both avoid visually hunting predators and perform well as a visual predator itself. At depths below the euphotic zone, however, the efficiency of visual predation is substantially lessened, and thus high metabolic rates are no longer strongly selected. In addition to light levels, other factors (notably food limitation, oxygen, temperature, and pressure) are sometimes ascribed to be the driver of low metabolic rates in the deep sea. It has been well demonstrated, however, that the decrease in metabolic rate with depth is indeed due to visual predation rather than other factors. Firstly, the decline in metabolic rate is only observed in visually hunting predators such as most fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. Gelatinous zooplankton such as chaetognaths and jellies, for example, are semi-transparent and are not visual hunters themselves and thus their metabolic rate is light-independent. Seibel et al. (2007) assessed the merits of these factors on impacting the relationship between metabolic rate and MDO and found decreasing light to be the dominating factor.Seibel, Brad A., Drazen, Jeffrey C. 2007. The rate of metabolism in marine animals: environmental constraints, ecological demands and energetic opportunities. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences. 362(1487):2061-2078. Their evidence was as follows: * Metabolic rate is only related to habitat depth in visually orienting animals where light impacts their responses to prey and predators. * Food availability 1000 m below eutrophic surface waters can be similar to food availability in surface oligotrophic waters. Despite similar food supply, metabolic rate is still lower at depth. Also, decreasing metabolic rate with depth often tapers off near the bathypelagic zone (1000 m) but food availability continues to decrease an order of magnitude with each kilometer of depth. * Oxygen does not decline uniformly with depth. There are normoxic and deep habitats where taxa still have low metabolic rates. * Temperature does not decrease with depth in Antarctica, but metabolic rates of Antarctic organisms still decrease with depth. * Pressure gradients with depth do not affect the metabolic rates of gelatinous and benthic taxa. The relationship between MDO and metabolic rate is similar for both aerobic and anaerobic potential.Seibel, Brad A., Thuesen, Erik V., Childress, James J. 2000. Light- Limitation on Predator-Prey Interactions: Consequences for Metabolism and Locomotion of Deep-Sea Cephalopods. Biological Bulletin. 198:284-298 While hiding is a good primary defense, if this fails, the organisms still need to be able to quickly escape from a predator. Thus, anaerobic potential must stay high in the high predatory-risk epipelagic, but can drop off in the less risky darker depths.

Yanagihara stated that her novel was in part inspired by Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, who was revered in the scientific community before being accused of child molestation. The bulk of the novel is made up of the fictional memoirs of Dr. Abraham Norton Perina, a scientific researcher who discovers a turtle with life-prolonging qualities on the fictional island of Ivu'ivu. Yanagihara based the physical look and shape of Ivu'ivu on Angra dos Reis. Plot In the late 1990s Dr. Ronald Kubodera, a colleague of Nobel Laureate Dr. Abraham Norton Perina, mourns Norton's downfall after being convicted of sexually abusing his own children. Kubodera encourages Norton to write his memoirs from his prison isolation and marks them with footnotes. Norton writes of his childhood in the small town of Lindon, Indiana, where his interest in science was piqued by his paternal aunt Sybil, a doctor. While attending medical school Norton attracts the attention of Gregory Smythe, and is hired to work in his lab. Norton is eventually invited to Smythe's home for dinner where Smythe cries in front of him. Repulsed by Smythe, Norton quits the lab. Shortly before graduation however Norton is approached to be the medical doctor on an anthropological mission to U'ivu led by a man named Paul Tallent. Norton realizes that Smythe recommended him in order to send him as far away as possible from him. Despite the fact that the mission is considered career suicide, Norton accepts. Norton meets Tallent for the first time before they leave from Hawaii to U'ivu and finds him beautiful and enigmatic. When they arrive in U'ivu they meet the other member of the team, a woman named Esme Duff whom Norton immediately dislikes. Tallent leads Norton and Esme to a smaller island that is part of U'ivu called Ivu'ivu. There they meet three hunter guides who lead them deep into the jungle of the island where eventually Tallent reveals to Norton that there is a legend among the U'ivu people about a lost tribe that has been gifted with eternal life but also deep stupidity and that their guides have actually seen one of these people. Shortly after they discover a woman who is devoid of language, completely nude and seems unable to function as a regular human being. The explorers dub the woman Eve and quickly discover a tribe of other people like her whom they dub \\"Dreamers\\" all of whom have varyingly poor grasp of language. Through some of the more lucid dreamers Tallent discovers that though they all have a mark of a turtle on them, which indicates they are 60, they are actually all well over 100 years old. Shortly after discovering the Dreamers the explorers also discover a group of Ivu'ivu's who had lost contact with the U'ivuians. They are allowed to observe the village as long as they do not bring the Dreamers in contact with them. While there Norton observes the villagers engaging in the ritualistic rape of a young ten-year-old boy. While Esme finds the ritual disturbing Norton decides that it is not rape or abuse but simply a cultural difference. Later on he has a sexual encounter with the boy who was raped which he claims is consensual. He and the group also observe the chief of the village engaging in a ritual to celebrate his 60th year where he eats a turtle. Norton quickly realizes that there is a link between eating the turtle and the seeming immortality and brain damage exhibited by the dreamers. After interviewing one of the dreamers he is taken to a small pond where the turtles comes from and later, against Tallent's advice, returns and kills one of the turtles to bring back its flesh for experiments in America. He and Tallent also bring back four of the Dreamers for further observation. Back in America, working at Stanford, Norton feeds the turtle to mice and realizes that their life cycle can be extended 6 times that of regular mice. He publishes his paper at first to derision and eventually to acclaim. Tallent warns him that his paper has condemned the people of U'ivu and this eventually proves true; the turtles of Ivu'ivu are eventually hunted to extinction by pharmaceutical companies and the island itself destroyed, eventually U'ivu is colonized as well. Norton continues to visit the island and begins to adopt local abandoned children in great numbers. In 1980 he sees a decrepit man he believes was the boy he had the sexual encounter with when he first came to Ivu'ivu who foists his son on Norton. Norton takes the boy home and names him Victor. As Victor grows older he and Norton develop an increasingly contentious relationship. Norton claims that on Christmas Victor locked Norton out of his home leaving him to die after which Norton locked Victor in the basement for a few days. When Victor is a teenager he goes to Norton's brother, Owen, and tells him that Norton raped him, causing a rift between the brothers and leading to Norton's imprisonment. In December 2000, Dr. Kubodera writes that he and Norton have escaped from his parole officer. He confesses to feeling guilty for having omitted a portion of Norton's memoirs and includes it as a post- script. The omitted portion reveals that Norton raped not only Victor but many of his other adopted sons. Reception Yanagihara received rave reviews for her novel. The New York Times called her \\" a writer to marvel at\\" while The Guardian called the book an \\"ambitious debut\\".

Denmark's best result was in 2009, when they won their first ever junior title. Dupont's all-time World Junior Curling Championship personal record is 22‚Äì19. =Mixed doubles and men's= Dupont jumped into mixed curling, competing in the 2012 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship with Mette de Neergard. They finished in 9th. He later curled at the 2015 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship with his sister, Denise. They placed 5th. At the 2014 European Curling Championships, Dupont and his team finished in ninth. However, Denmark had already qualified for the 2014 World Men's Championships the year before, and the Hvidore CC traveled to Beijing to compete. Dupont was an alternate, but ended up playing. Denmark finished in 12th. Dupont has also competes at various World Curling Tour events, most recently the 2013 German Masters and 2014 Baden Masters. Personal life Oliver comes from a curling family. Dupont's father, Kim, competed at the 1980 and 1981 World Junior Curling Championships. His mother, Gitte Larsen, won a bronze medal with Denmark at the 1990 World Women's Curling Championships. They both curled for Hvidore CC. His sister, Denise, has competed at the 2006 and 2010 Olympics, as well as nine World Championships. His other sister, Madeleine, competed at the 2010 Olympics, and won the Frances Brodie Award in 2004.

It is primarily used in fluorescence spectroscopy, but is also very useful as an acceptor molecule in FRET, and as a fluorescent probe in fluorescence microscopy and X-ray crystallography. TNP BINDING  Constituent parts  TNP refers to the chemical compound 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, also known as Picric acid. It is a primary constituent of many unexploded landmines, and is a cousin to TNT, but less stable. It is recognized as an environmental contaminant and is toxic to many organisms. It is still commonly used in the manufacturing of fireworks, explosives, and rocket fuels, as well as in leather, pharmaceutical, and dye industries. ATP is an essential mediator of life. It is used to overcome unfavorable energy barriers to initiate and fuel chemical reactions. It is also used to drive biological machinery and regulate a number of processes via protein-phosphorylation. However, the proteins that bind ATP for both regulation and enzymatic reactions are very diverse‚Äîmany yet undiscovered‚Äîand for many proteins their relationship to ATP in terms of number of binding sites, binding constants, and dissociation constants remain unclear.  TNP- ATP  Conjugating TNP to ATP renders this nucleotide triphosphate fluorescent and colored whilst allowing it to retain its biological activity. TNP-ATP is thus a fluorescent analog of ATP. This conjugation is very useful in providing information about interactions between ATP and an ATP-binding protein because TNP-ATP interacts with proteins and enzymes as a substitute for its parent nucleotide, and has a strong binding affinity for most systems that require ATP. TNP is excited at a wavelength of 408 and 470 nm, and fluoresces in the 530‚Äì560 nm range. This is a very useful range of excitation because it is far from where proteins or nucleotides absorb. When TNP-ATP is in water or other aqueous solutions, this emission is very weak. However, once TNP-ATP binds to a protein, there is a dramatic increase in fluorescent intensity. This property enables researchers to study various proteins‚Äô binding interaction with ATP. Thus, with enhanced fluorescence, it can be seen whether a protein binds to ATP. When TNP-ATP in water is excited at 410 nm, TNP-ATP shows a single fluorescence maximum at 561 nm. This maximum shifts as the fluid's viscosity changes. For example, in N,N-dimethylformamide, instead of having its maxima at 561 nm as in water, the maxima is instead at 533 nm. Binding to a protein will also change the wavelength of maximal emission, as well as a change in fluorescent intensity. For example, binding to the chemotaxis protein CheA indicates a severalfold enhancement of fluorescence intensity and a blue-shift in wavelength of the maximal emission. Using this TNP nucleotide analog has been shown in many instances to be superior to traditional radionucleotide-labelling based techniques. The health concerns and the cost associated with the use of radioactive isotopes makes TNP-ATP an attractive alternative. The first fluorescent ribose-modified ATP is 2‚Äô,3‚Äô-O-(2,4,7-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene) adenosine 5‚Äôtriphosphate (TNP- ATP), and was introduced in 1973 by Hiratsuka and Uchida. TNP-ATP was originally synthesized to investigate the ATP binding site of myosin ATPase. Reports of TNP-ATP‚Äôs success in the investigation of this motor protein extended TNP-ATP‚Äôs use to other proteins and enzymes. TNP-ATP has now been used as a spectroscopic probe for numerous proteins suspected to have ATP interactions. These include several protein kinases, ATPases, myosin, and other nucleotide binding proteins. Over the past twenty years, there have been hundreds of papers describing TNP-ATP‚Äôs use and applications. Many applications involving this fluorescently labeled nucleotide have helped to clarify structure-function relationships of many ATP-requiring proteins and enzymes. There have also been a growing number of papers that display TNP-ATP use as a means of assessing the ATP-binding capacity of various mutant proteins.  Preparation  Preparing TNP-ATP is a one-step synthesis that is relatively safe and easy. Adenosine‚Äôs ribose moiety can be trinitrophenylated by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1-sulfonate (TNBS). The resulting compound assumes a bright orange color and has visible absorption characteristics, as is characteristic of a Meiseinheimer spiro complex compound linking. To see the exact method of preparion, please refer to T. Hiratsuka's and K. Uchida's paper \\"Preparation and Properties of 2'(r 3')-O(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) Adenosine 5'-triphosphate, an Analog of Adenosine Triphosphate,\\" found in the reference section. To revert TNP-ATP back to its constituent parts, or in other words to hydrolyze TNP-ATP to give equilmolar amounts of picric acid (TNP) and ATP, TNP-ATP should be treated with 1 M HCl at 100 degrees Celsius for 1.5 hours. This is because if TNP-ATP is acidified under mild conditions, it results in the opening of the dioxolane ring attached to the 2‚Äô-oxygen, leaving a 3‚ÄôO-TNP derivative as the only product.  Storage  TNP-ATP should be stored at ‚àí20 degrees Celsius, in the dark, and used under minimal lighting conditions. When in solution, TNP-ATP has a shelf-life of about 30 days.  pKa and Isosbestic Point  When absorption was measured against wavelength at various pH values, the changes at wavelength 408 nm and 470 nm yielded a sigmoidal line with a midpoint at 5.1. This indicated that the absorbance at these two wavelengths depends upon the ionization of the chromophoric portion of TNP-ATP and is unaffected by ionization of ATP. Although this ionization constant of 5.1 is not in physiological range, it has been shown that the absorbance of TNP-ATP is sensitive enough to detect changes due to slight shifts in neutral pH. Spectroscopic superposition indicated TNP-ATP‚Äôs isosbestic point to be 339 nm.  Constants and calculations  At low concentrations of TNP-ATP (‚â§1 ŒºM), fluorescent intensity is proportional to the concentration of TNP added. However, at concentrations exceeding 1 ŒºM, inner filter effects cause this relationship to no longer be linear. To correct this, researchers must determine the ratio of the predicted theoretical fluorescence intensity (assuming linearity) to the observed fluorescence intensity and then apply this correction factor. However, in most cases, researchers will try to keep the concentration of TNP to lower than 1 ŒºM. To determine binding affinities, TNP-ATP is added to a solution and then titrated with protein. This produces a saturation curve from which the binding affinity can be determined. The number of binding sites may also be determined through this saturation curve by looking to see if there are sudden changes in slope. One can also titrate a fixed amount of protein with increasing additions of TNP-ATP to obtain a saturation curve. To do so, however, may get complicated due to the inner filter effects that will need to be corrected for. To determine dissociation constants, TNP-ATP can be competed off of a protein with ATP. The value of the dissociation constant Kd for a single-site binding can then be obtained by applying the Langmuir equation for a curve fit: \\\\mathrm{RFU_{obs}} = \\\\mathrm{RFU_{free}} + \\\\frac{(\\\\mathrm{RFU_{bound}} - \\\\mathrm{RFU_{free}}) \\\\times \\\\left( (\\\\mathrm{[protein]_{total}} + \\\\mathrm{[TNP]_{total}} + \\\\mathrm{K_d}) - \\\\sqrt{(\\\\mathrm{[protein]_{total}} + \\\\mathrm{[TNP]_{total}} + \\\\mathrm{K_d})^2 - (4 \\\\times \\\\mathrm{[protein]_{total}} \\\\times \\\\mathrm{[TNP]})} \\\\right)}{2 \\\\mathrm{[TNP]_{total}}} where RFU is relative fluorescent units, RFUobs is the fluorescence observed, RFUfree is the fluorescence of free TNP-ATP, and RFUbound is the fluorescence of TNP-ATP when completely bound to a protein. To measure an ATP competitor, one can add competitor to pre-incubated samples of protein:TNP-ATP. The fraction of TNP-ATP bound to the protein can be calculated via: \\\\theta = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{RFU_{obs}} - \\\\mathrm{RFU_{free}}}{\\\\mathrm{RFU_{max}} - \\\\mathrm{RFU_{free}}} where Œ∏ is that fraction, and RFUmax is the value of fluorescence intensity at saturation, meaning when 100% of TNP-ATP is bound. The dissociation constants for TNP and competitor can then be calculated through the equation: \\\\theta = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mathrm{[TNP]} \\\\times \\\\left( \\\\mathrm{K_{TNP}} + \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{K_{TNP}}}{\\\\mathrm{K_{competitor}}} \\\\times \\\\mathrm{[competitor]} + \\\\mathrm{[TNP]} + \\\\mathrm{[protein]} - \\\\sqrt{\\\\left( \\\\mathrm{K_{TNP}} + \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{K_{TNP}}}{\\\\mathrm{K_{competitor}}} \\\\times \\\\mathrm{[competitor]} + \\\\mathrm{[TNP]} + \\\\mathrm{[protein]}\\\\right)^2 - 4 \\\\times \\\\mathrm{[TNP]} \\\\times \\\\mathrm{[protein]}} \\\\right) For reasons not yet fully understood, TNP- ATP typically binds the ATP binding sites of proteins and enzymes anywhere from one to three times tighter than regular ATP. The dissociation constants are usually around 0.3‚Äì50 ŒºM.  Other uses  In addition to using TNP-ATP to determine whether a protein binds ATP, its binding affinity and dissociation constants, and number of binding sites, TNP-ATP can also be used in ligand binding studies. To do this, titrations of the protein are added to TNP-ATP. Then, ligand is added to displace the bound analog. This is measured by decreases in fluorescence. One can also do this by titrating protein with TNP- ATP in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of the ligand of interest. Using either experiment will allow the binding affinity of the ligand to protein to be measured. TNP-ATP is also valuable fluorescence acceptor. This is because, as with any good acceptor, TNP-ATP absorbs over a wide wavelength range that corresponds to the range of emission of common FRET donors. Thus, TNP-ATP can be used to look at the conformational changes that proteins undergo. For example, Na+/K+ ATPase, the distance between the active site and Cys457 was shown to change from 25 Angstroms to 28 Angstroms in changing from the Na+ conformation to the K+ conformation. In addition to fluorescent spectroscopy, TNP-ATP is very useful in fluorescent microscopy. This is because it greatly increases the sensitivity of the observations when bound to proteins‚Äîthe enhanced fluorescence greatly reduces the problem of background fluorescence. This is especially true under epifluorescent illumation (illumination and light are both on the same side of the specimen). TNP-ATP has also been used in X-ray crystallography because it can be used to determine binding constants of crystallized substrates. This technique also demonstrates the structure of proteins in the presence or absence of TNP-ATP, which may or may not correspond to the structure of proteins when they bind ATP.

Early life Jacob F. Schoellkopf was born on November 15, 1819 in Kirchheim Unter Teck, a small town in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. He was the son of Gottlieb Schoellkopf and Christina Maier. He was educated in the town schools and at the age of 14 began learning about tanneries with his father, a large leather manufacturer, who had learned the trade from his father. Career After completing five years of apprenticeship, he became clerk at a mercantile house in Strassberg where he worked for two years. In 1841, he decided to try leave Germany and try his fortune in the United States. He landed in New York City at 22 years old in December 1841, and was \\"totally unacquainted with the English language.\\" =Tannery= He started working in New York City and after two years, headed West to earn more. In 1844, with $800 () of capital loaned to him by his father, he moved to Buffalo, New York to begin his own business in a small leather store which he established in Mohawk Street. In 1844, he purchased a small tannery at Whites Corners (Hamburg), Erie County. In 1846, he started a sheep skin tannery in Buffalo. In 1848, he built a tannery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in association with his cousin Frederick Vogel and the firm, \\"G. Pfister & Co.\\" In 1850, he became interested in the Chicago firm of \\"C. T. Gray & Company,\\" operating a tannery there which continued until 1856. In 1852, he became a partner in Philip Ludwig \\"Louis\\" Breithaupt's Buffalo tanning business, eventually buying out Breithaupt's share in 1861. From 1853‚Äì54, he established tanneries at Fort Wayne, Indiana, and North Evans, New York, operating the latter for 20 years, and in 1857, he made his first large investment outside the tanning business, erecting the \\"North Buffalo Flouring Mills,\\" which proved so profitable that he continued his investments with flour mills, ultimately becoming one of the largest operators of flouring mills in the Empire State. In 1870, he bought the \\"Frontier Mills of Buffalo,\\" and later erected extensive mills in Niagara Falls, New York. He did not retain many of these interests long after setting them up. His approach was to ensure they were successful and sell them at a profit to enable him to seek out new outlets for his increasing capital. However, he owed the later milling and tanning interests until his death, some being held in his own name and others as senior of the milling firm of \\"Schoellkopf & Matthews.\\" =Hydroelectric Power= Schoellkopf Power Station No. 3 Site in 2008 In 1877, when the Niagara Falls Canal Company went bankrupt, Schoellkopf purchased the hydraulic canal at Niagara Falls at auction for $71,000, () in order to develop a plan for utilizing the power of the Niagara river. The canal was later conveyed to a corporation known as The Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power & Manufacturing Company, which by 1882 was the first company to generate electricity from Niagara Falls. He improved the canal and put the powerhouse to commercial use. In 1881, the company completed Schoellkopf Power Station No. 1 (which would operate until 1904). By 1882, Schoellkopf had seven mills along the high bank (the top edge of the Niagara Gorge north of the American Falls) all producing power from the hydraulic canal which made Schoellkopf incredibly wealthy. In 1891, Schoellkopf Power Station No. 2 opened directly in front of the original, in the gorge below Niagara Falls, with a higher drop. In 1904, the company built Schoellkopf Stations No. 3A and 3B. Schoellkopf was president of the company at the time of his death, after which each son found a place in Schoellkopf's various business ventures. The Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power & Manufacturing Company was later shortened to \\"The Hydraulic Power Company,\\" and during World War I, the company was consolidated with the Niagara Falls Power Company, owned by Edward Dean Adams, under the latter name, but with the Schoellkopf interests predominating, an enterprise involving some $62,000,000 (). Schoellkopf, Hartford & Hanna Co. works in Buffalo, New York, formerly the Schoellkopf Aniline and Chemical Works, ca. 1908.Following the formation of the Niagara Falls Power Company in 1918, Schoellkopf Jr. was elected chairman of the board for the corporation, a position that he held for eighteen years. Jacob Frederick III, Paul Arthur (the son of Arthur Schoellkopf), and other third-generation members of the family also continued to be involved as directors and stockholders of the company. In 1929, they organized the Niagara Share Corporation as a trust for all the stock owned by family members. The company continued to hold stock in the power utility until 1956. =Other business ventures= In 1867, he was on the Board of Directors for \\"Buffalo German Insurance Company\\" along with Henry Persch and William Hellriegel. He served as the vice president of the \\"Third National Bank of Buffalo\\", and was on the boards of \\"Merchant Bank of Buffalo\\", \\"The German Bank of Buffalo\\" and \\"Farmer and Merchant's National Bank.\\" In 1879, Schoellkopf started the \\"Schoellkopf Chemical and Dye Company\\" for his two sons. In 1882, he was president of Buffalo's Board of Trade. In the 1880s and 1890s, he served as a trustee for the Bank of Niagara and the Power City Bank, both in Niagara Falls, New York. He also held the presidency and served as a director for the Citizens‚Äô Gas Company of Buffalo along with serving as vice president of the Buffalo, New York & Philadelphia Railroad. Lastly, he served as a trustee for the Buffalo General Hospital. Personal life The Schoellkopf FamilyIn 1848, Schoellkopf married Sofie Christiane Duerr (1827‚Äì1903), who was also born in Germany and came to the United States in 1842. Four of his children died in infancy and two suffered health problems and died within two years of their father. Their children who lived to adulthood were: * Henry Schoellkopf (1848‚Äì1880), who married Emily Vogel in 1875. * Louis Schoellkopf (1855‚Äì1901), who married Myra Lee Horton (1861‚Äì1910). * Arthur Schoellkopf (1856‚Äì1913), who served as the 5th mayor of Niagara Falls * Jacob F. Schoellkopf Jr. (1858‚Äì1942), who married Wilma Spring. * Alfred Schoellkopf (1860‚Äì1901), who married Emily R. Graebe (1869‚Äì1951). * Charles Philip Hugo Schoellkopf (1862‚Äì1928), who married Emily F. Annette of Fort Lee, New Jersey. * Helen Schoellkopf (1870‚Äì1962), who married Hans Schmidt (president of \\"J.F. Schoellkopf Co.\\") Schoellkopf died \\"one of Buffalo's wealthiest and best known citizens\\" in Buffalo, New York on September 15, 1899. Christiana died four years later on October 13, 1903. =Legacy= Forest Lawn Cemetery The Schoellkopf's lived in a large mansion at 553 Delaware Avenue at Allen Street on the southeast corner. Their daughter, Helena, who married Hans Schmidt, and their three children lived in the mansion until they moved to a new mansion in Derby, New York in 1914. The house was sold to Harlow C. Curtiss, who transformed the home into a boarding house. *In September 1906, the bridge last built over the hydraulic canal at Third street was named the \\"Schoellkopf Bridge\\" and at a public ceremonial on December 9, 1908, during the administration of Mayor Anthony C. Douglass, the \\"Schoellkopf Memorial Tablets\\" on that bridge were unveiled in his honor. *Schoellkopf Field, a 25,000-seat stadium in Ithaca, New York on the campus of Cornell University, bears Schoellkopf's name; his grandson Henry had played and coached at Cornell. *In 1930, Jacob F. Schoellkopf Jr. endowed the \\"Jacob F. Schoellkopf Medal\\", the oldest award given by any local section, that recognizes a person who has fostered the objectives or activities of the American Chemical Society. The medalist's contribution may be a discovery pertaining to chemistry, or an invention of a plan, process, or device, useful, valuable, or significant in the theory or practice of chemistry, or distinguished service to the Western New York Section.

For his career he had 152 tackles and 12 interceptions. As a receiver his senior year he set school records with 52 receptions for 953 yards and 13 touchdowns. Thompson was rated as a three-star recruit and committed to Boise State University to play college football. College career After redshirting his first year at Boise State in 2011, Thompson appeared in all 13 games, with six starts, as a redshirt freshman in 2012. For the season he had 43 tackles and three interceptions. As a sophomore in 2013, he started all 13 games and recorded 63 tackles and four interceptions. Thompson again started all 13 games as a junior in 2014. He recorded 71 tackles and seven interceptions and was named a second team All-American by CBSSports.com. During his senior year in 2015, Thompson tied Eric Weddle's Mountain West Conference record for career interceptions. Later in the same season, in a game against UNLV, Thompson recorded his 19th interception of his career breaking the mark set by Weddle. Professional career Thompson attended the NFL Scouting Combine and completed all of the combine and positional drills. On March 31, 2016, Thompson participated at Boise State's Pro day and attempted to improve his performance in the 40-yard dash (4.58s), 20-yard dash (2.67s), and 10-yard dash (1.59s). At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Thompson was projected to be a second to fourth round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the third best free safety in the draft by DraftScout.com and was ranked the fifth best defensive back by Sports Illustrated. =New York Giants= 2016 The New York Giants selected Thompson in the third round (71st overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. Thompson was the sixth safety drafted in 2016. On June 2, 2016, the New York Giants signed Thompson to a four-year, $3.45 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $837,136. He entered training camp competing with Nat Berhe and Mykkele Thompson for the vacant starting free safety position. Head coach Ben McAdoo named Thompson the backup free safety to begin the regular season, behind Nat Berhe. He made his professional regular season debut in the New York Giants' season-opener at the Dallas Cowboys and made three combined tackles in their 20‚Äì19 victory. On September 18, 2016, Thompson earned his first career start after he surpassed Nat Berhe on the depth chart and was named the starting free safety. He made a season-high four solo tackles before exiting in the fourth quarter of the Giants' 16‚Äì13 win against the New Orleans Saints due to a foot injury. Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo was impressed with Thompson's mastery of defensive schemes and his ability to get his teammates lined up correctly. On November 9, 2016, the New York Giants placed Thompson on injured reserve after he missed six games (Weeks 3‚Äì9) due to his foot injury that required surgery. Thompson finished his rookie season in 2016 with seven combined tackles (six solo) in two games and one start. 2017 Thompson entered training camp slated as the starting free safety. Head coach Ben McAdoo officially named Thompson the starting free safety to start the 2017 regular season, alongside strong safety Landon Collins. He started in the New York Giants' season-opener at the Dallas Cowboys and recorded three combined tackles during their 19‚Äì3 loss. On October 8, 2017, Thompson collected a season-high 11 combined tackles (eight solo), two pass deflections, and made his first career interception during a 27‚Äì22 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 5. Thompson made the interception off a pass by Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers, that was originally intended for wide receiver Keenan Allen, in the third quarter.

The premise is to introduce a polymer network into cellular or tissue samples, and then physically expand that polymer network using chemical reactions to increase the size of the biological structures. Among other benefits, ExM allows those small structures to be imaged with a wider range of microscopy techniques. It was first proposed in a 2015 article by Fei Chen, Paul W. Tillberg, and Edward Boyden. Current research allows for the expansion of samples up to 16x larger than their initial size. This technique has been found useful in various laboratory settings, such as analyzing biological molecules. ExM allows researchers to use standard equipment in identifying small structures, but requires following of procedures in order to ensure clear results.  Principles  = Purpose = 4-step process of ExM Traditional light microscopy has limits of resolution that prevent it from reliably distinguishing small structures that are important to biological function, and must instead be imaged by a higher-resolution technique, such as electron microscopy. For example, synaptic vesicles are 40-50 nanometers in diameter, which is below the commonly quoted resolution limit of 200 nanometers for light microscopy. Expansion microscopy solves this problem by expanding the underlying tissue sample. One key advantage of samples prepared using expansion microscopy and light microscopy over conventional electron microscopy is that it also allows investigators to stain for and visualize particular molecules in the sample, such as specific proteins or RNA to identify their density and distribution in relation to the biological structures of interest. The most beneficial principle of expansion microscopy is that it requires no specialized equipment; the materials for expansion are worth little to nothing compared to the price of a microscope that could get the same resolution. = Stages = Expansion microscopy is a multistep process that, depending on the protocol, has different requirements for gelation and expansion. The sequence of steps are stain, link, digest, and expand The staining process can take many different forms, and only requires that the fluorophores used can attach to the polymer in the next step. Linking is the process of adding a polymer gel to the cells, which permeabilize through the cell. The linking step also includes, as the name suggests, the process of linking the fluorophores to the gel. The digestion step involves adding a solution that digests the cell, removing the structure from the cell. If this step fails, the gel will not expand uniformly because the cell will try to stay together. Failure of this step can also cause cracking or fractures in the cell. Lastly, expansion causes the gel to be physically expanded in all directions, which causes the fluorophores that are attached to the gel to expand as well.  History  In 2015, Chen, Tillberg, and Boyden, all of MIT first described expansion microscopy as a method to enhance microscopy resolution by swelling a sample rather than using stronger microscopy equipment. Since then, the use of ExM has continued to grow. Due to the recency of development, there is limited information on applications. However, the most common modern use is in biological samples. In 2016, several papers were published detailing workarounds for ExM's traditional limitation of labeling probes. These changes proposed a way to use ExM with conventional microscopy probes, allowing it to be used more widely. In 2016, these new labeling methods were applied to allow fluorescence microscopy of RNA molecules. ExM is a rapidly growing field, and there is hope that many biological mysteries will be elucidated using ExM techniques within coming years.  Theory  Expansion microscopy is achieved by synthesizing a polymer system within a specimen. By then swelling this polymer network, the sample is expanded to be examined under conventional microscopic analysis tools without degrading the integrity of the sample. This allows a sample to be analyzed with a less powerful microscope than would be needed without expansion, and makes analysis of microscopic biological samples more accessible to labs that would otherwise have not been available to afford or obtain necessary powerful microscopy technology.  Applications  = Use = Expansion microscopy is a method which improves the final image resolution during regular microscopy by physically enlarging the organism or molecule itself. After the enlargement of the organism or molecule, more standard microscopes can achieve higher resolution imaging. The primary fields this method is used in are those involved in analyzing biological samples. However, this technique has since been adopted into many different fields of research and continues to grow and be applied in more and more laboratory settings. = Disease and diagnoses = Before the discovery of expansion microscopy, examination of cellular structures and biomolecules were done using diffraction-limited microscopy. They were mainly used to diagnose or investigate the pathogenesis of a wide variety of predisease and disease states. However, biomolecules are nanoscale in dimension and are located with nanoscale precision throughout cells and tissues. Several techniques such as super-resolution microscopy were used, but these required complex hardware and were difficult to apply to human tissues. Thus, expansion microscopy was developed. This method physically magnified the tissue samples rather than optically, and as a result was able to produce images with high resolution. These high quality images of tissues served as a turning point in diagnostic and medical expansion microscopy. Like many other techniques, expansion microscopy also possesses many potentials in the medical and diagnostic fields. Expansion microscopy improves the resolution of light microscopy by physically expanding the specimens. When this technique is applied to the clinical tissue samples nanoscale imaging of human tissue specimens. First, expansion pathology is used to convert clinical samples into a compatible state for the expansion microscopy. This process can be used for optical diagnosis of kidney minimal-change disease, early breast neoplastic lesions and to spot the difference of normal human tissue specimens to cancer tissue specimens, enabling a routine use of clinical research. The use of pathogenic expansion microscopy enabled clear images of tissue. Applying expansion microscopy on microarrays containing specimens from various organs, such as breast, prostate, lung, colon, pancreas, kidney, liver, and ovary, including normal and cancer-containing tissues, enabled the diagnostic and the examination of cellular network of diseased state tissues. This imaging reveals sub-diffraction limit sized features of the intermediate filaments keratin and vimentin, critical in the epithelial mesenchymal transition, cancer progression and initiation of metastasis. In the future, after further development of this technique, observation of nanoscale morphology of biomolecules and samples from wide range of human organs is anticipated to be provided. = Neuroscience = Many of the questions surrounding neuroscience attempt to answer and understand molecules and wiring in neural circuits. However, mapping these structures across the large scales of neural circuits is difficult. In these cases, ExM magnifies biological specimens such as brain circuits and allows them to be more easily mapped. Biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, are anchored to the polymer, which is then swelled in order to expand the biomolecules. Due to the increased distance between the biomolecules, ordinary microscopes can then perform nanoscale resolution imaging. Through the use of ExM technique, neuroscientists can more easily map images of synapses, cells, and neural circuits.  Subsets  With the development of expansion microscopy, scientists have begun to create subsets of the technique, including scanning Joule expansion microscopy, or SJEM. SJEM utilizes a thermal imaging technique which measures the thermal expansion of Joule-heated elements. One of the largest advantages of SJEM over older submicron thermal imaging techniques is that SJEM does not require the nanofabrication of specialized probes. Rather, SJEM only requires a standard atomic force microscope and simple electronics.  Advantages  One of the most significant advantages of expansion microscopy versus other forms of microscopy is that it prevents the requirement of purchasing stronger equipment. Because ExM is performed within a sample to enlarge the sample, it prevents researchers from needing to purchase expensive super-resolution microscopy equipment, such as electron microscopes. By making a sample larger, it becomes more easily examinable as the larger structures can then be examined using traditional microscopy techniques, such as light microscopy.  Limitations  Each of the four preparation steps of ExM must fully complete, or the cell will not yield a bright and clear stain. Failure to complete these steps can result in the breaking of the cell or uneven expansion, distorting the image beyond use. ExM struggles in those procedures that use fluorophore markers, as the polymerization process can bleach these fluorophores, rendering them unusable. There are some, such as Alexa 488 and Atto 565 that are still effective after polymerization, however their efficacy is greatly decreased to about 50%. The conjugation of DNA with another antibody is often very costly and difficult. These two issues are the primary limitations to using ExM in biological samples. It is important to note that while rebinding new antibodies can be costly and time consuming, it is sometimes made possible, post expansion, in cases where the antibody struggles to bind in dense tissue. After expansion, the tissue is far less dense and often allows for better reception of fluorescent antibodies.

The book was first released on October 20, 2015, through Harper Perennial in the United States and Orbit Books in the United Kingdom. Unlike the podcast, the novel is narrated from an omniscient viewpoint that follows Jackie Fierro, the owner of Night Vale's pawn shop, and Diane Crayton, the treasurer of the town's PTA. The audiobook version of the story is narrated by Cecil Baldwin, Dylan Marron, Retta, Th√©r√®se Plummer, and Dan Bittner. Synopsis The Man in the Tan Jacket is back in Night Vale and he has been leaving strange pieces of paper with people, all of which say \\"King City\\". While Night Vale is used to the strange and bizarre, the Man in the Tan Jacket's arrival puts the town at odds. Jackie Fierro, the owner of the town pawn shop, is determined to figure out the mystery behind both the man and the paper. Meanwhile, Diane Crayton has her own issues: her son has been changing and while this is average for most teenage boys, her son is literally a shape shifter and looks different each time she sees him. When she begins to see her son's father around town and Josh begins to show new interest in the man, Diane knows that this cannot end well. Reception Critical reception for Welcome to Night Vale has been positive and the novel was one of the Washington Post's top science-fiction and fantasy picks for October 2015. Cory Doctorow praised the novel in his review at Boing Boing, stating \\"Shot through it all is the love and integrity that made Night Vale a success from the beginning. After 400 pages, some of Night Vale's mysteries have been laid bare, we've been initiated into new ones, and most of all, we know that we're in the midst of some wonderful people.\\" In contrast, The A.V. Club gave Welcome to Night Vale a grade of C+, criticizing Fink and Cranor for including too many references from the podcast, which they felt \\"reduces the plot‚Äôs progression to a crawl\\". They also wrote that the book improved in the later chapters, writing that it became \\"a wonderfully creepy tale filled with revelations about the nature of the town and its residents.

Farrow, whom psychiatrists diagnosed with psychopathic personality disorder, had an obsessive hatred of Christianity, which he attributed to sexual abuse from a priest. He stabbed to death 77-year-old retired teacher Betty Yates in Bewdley, Worcestershire, and the Reverend John Suddards (aged 59) in Thornbury, Gloucestershire. Background Stephen Farrow was hyperactive from a young age, and was sent home from his first day at school. At the age of 10, he set a church altar on fire and watched it burn. He hated his strict father, but had love for his mother. As an adult, Farrow was a heavy smoker of cannabis. In 1994, Farrow was convicted of aggravated burglary at the home of an elderly woman in Stourbridge. He told the forensic psychiatrist that he had fantasies of committing rape in home invasions. When it was being decided whether he should serve his punishment in prison or in a mental hospital, he told a psychiatrist from Ashworth Hospital that he had wanted to kill from his teenage years, and had already murdered a backpacker in Devon six years prior. Although the doctor diagnosed him with psychopathic personality disorder, he theorised that Farrow was exaggerating his claims in order to have a safer place of detention than prison. During his trial, Farrow admitted to a burglary in Thornbury around New Year in 2012. He pinned a note to the house's kitchen table, reading, \\"Be thankful you did not come back or we would have killed you Christian scum. I... hate God\\". The threat was not personal, as the occupants were not religious. On New Year's Eve, he texted a friend that, \\"Church will be the first to suffer\\". Murders The Reverend John Suddards was the vicar at the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Thornbury. On 4 January 2012, Farrow broke into Yates' isolated cottage and killed her by stabbing her in the neck. Detectives suspected that she had been beaten with her walking stick before her death. Crimestoppers offered a reward of ¬£10,000 for information on the murder, and new leads were investigated after the crime was featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Yates and Farrow were acquainted. On 14 February, the Reverend John Suddards was killed at his vicarage; Avon and Somerset Police declared that the death was suspicious after his body was found by builders. Suddards, a former lawyer who joined the clergy after a car accident, had only moved to his new parish in June 2011, from Witham, Essex. He had previously spoken of the risks of his occupation, in which he would regularly welcome strangers into his home. After stabbing Suddards to death, Farrow drank the vicar's beer and watched a DVD, before stealing his mobile phone and watch. Legal proceedings On 18 February, police named Farrow as a suspect in Suddards' murder, warning the public not to approach him. He was arrested the following day in Folkestone, Kent, where he was also questioned on Yates' murder, and was charged with both murders and the burglary on 22 February. A week later, a 43-year-old man who had been previously arrested on suspicion of Suddards' death was eliminated from the investigation. On 29 June, Farrow pleaded not guilty to both murders, but admitted to the burglary. His trial at Bristol Crown Court began on 4 October; he later admitted Suddards' manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The jury were unanimous in finding him guilty of killing Suddards, and an 11‚Äì1 majority found him guilty of the murder of Yates. The judge, who called Farrow \\"sadistic\\", sentenced him to spend the rest of his life in prison. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Crisp of Avon and Somerset Police stated that tracking Farrow was difficult due to his nomadic lifestyle, but an anonymous phone call from a woman in Kent had led to his arrest. After the sentencing, Suddards' sister Hilary Bosworth questioned if the murders could have been avoided if people with Farrow's record of violence were properly dealt with, asking, \\"Do we, as a society, need to think again about how we might better monitor those in the community?\\" Legacy of victims Suddards' parishioners and family set up a Memorial Fund to raise money for causes with which he was involved, including the reintegration of the homeless and scholarships for students of Christian scripture.

It is the armed wing of the Wa National Organisation (WNO). History The WNA was founded along with the WNO on 29 July 1974, after the original group, a Ka Kwe Ye, joined forces with the Shan State Army (SSA) and Lo Hsing Han. The group was led by Mahasang, the son of the last sawbwa of Vingngun. In 1977, the WNA broke ties with the SSA and allied themselves with the 3rd Kuomintang battalion operating near the Myanmar-China border, led by General Li Wenhuan. In 1983, the WNA's political wing, the Wa National Organisation, officially joined the National Democratic Force (NDF).

The series is produced by DJ's a Creative Unit. The show shows a story set against superstitions. The music of the show is done by Dony Hazarika and Udbhav Ojha.  Plot  Kaala Teeka is the story of Vishwaveer \\"Vishwa\\" Jha (Bhupinder Singh) and his quest to keep his only daughter, Gauri, safe and protected. Vishwaveer discovers that an abandoned baby girl is able to protect Gauri from a familial curse, and he adopts her, naming her Kaali and making her Gauri's \\"kaala teeka\\". After 5 years Kaali (Sargam Khurana) continues protecting Gauri (Adaa Narang) in every way. Gauri, being Vishwaveer's only child, is brought up surrounded with comforts, while Vishwaveer doesn't treat Kaali very well. She is mistreated by Vishwaveer's sister-in-law Kalyani Jha (Mona Ambegaonkar). Vishwaveer's first wife, Manjiri Jha (Dalljiet Kaur), who doesn't have children, adores Kaali and brings her up as her own daughter. Kalyani plots to kill Gauri to get revenge from Vishwaveer for an old matter. She kills Kaali first, so that she is unable to protect Gauri. However, Kaali survives, and relates the incident to Manjiri, who decides to make Kalyani pay. Kaali and Manjiri confront Kalyani in a temple, where Kalyani ends up killing Manjiri by strangling her, and making it look like Kaali did it. When the family finds out, Vishwaveer decides to take the blame on himself and go to jail in Kaali's place, so that Kaali can stay with Gauri and continue to protect her. As a result, Vishwaveer goes to jail for 14 years. After 14 years Kaali (Simran Pareenja) and Gauri (Fenil Umrigar) are grown up. Kaali is very intelligent and a good singer, but all credits are taken by Gauri. Kaali writes exams for her and sings for her. A guy named Yug Choudhary (Rohan Gandotra) hears Kaali's voice and is taken aback by her voice. He tries to search for her but is unable to find her. Everyone thinks that it is Gauri who sings and Yug also thinks the same, but he is not able to find Gauri. Vishwaveer, while searching for a suitable groom for Gauri, comes across Yug and resolves to get her married to him. Gauri initially refuses but Kaali convinces her, and Gauri eventually falls in love with Yug and agrees for marriage after testing him a couple of times. When Yug's grandmother rejects the proposal considering Vishwa to be a criminal, he brainwashes Gauri's brother Neelkanth \\"Neel\\" Jha (Nivin Ramani) into trying to rape Yug's sister Sharmila Choudhary (Meenu Panchal). Neel attempts to do so, but is held back by his conscience at the last minute. In order to save Sharmila's reputation, Yug's grandmother agrees to get Yug married to Gauri in exchange for Neel marrying Sharmila. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Manjiri is still alive and that she lost her memory 14 years ago and saved Yug's life, after which his father took her in as his sister. She is now living with Yug. After a while Kaali finds out that Manjiri is still alive and with the help of Yug, Kaali brings her memory back. Yug-Gauri and Neel-Sharmila are now scheduled to get married. Instead destiny wants to bring Yug and Kaali together who have fallen in love. Yug is actually Kaali's childhood Ramji. The show goes on with Manjiri and Yug supporting Kali in each and every step to get back love of Vishwaveer and prove him superstitions are waste. Gauri's kundli's truth comes out and Kaali is forced to agree to be Gauri's Kaala Teeka again and goes to Yug's house. She gets anxious and encounters Vishwa and decides to leave. Manjiri and Kali get kidnapped by Kalyani, but Yug saves them. Kalyani is arrested and Manjiri goes back to Vishwa and demands Kali and Yug's alliance. Gauri drinks poison but she is saved and Vishwa realises that it was not Kali being kaala teeka that worked for Gauri but her prayers were the ones which truly worked. He fixes Yug and Kali's alliance to which Yug's mother Leelavita \\"Leela\\" Choudhary agrees only because of a hidden motto and she doesn't want Kali to be her daughter-in-law. Therefore, Leela and Gauri team up. Yug marries Kali but everyone get tricked as they assume it is Gauri who is marrying Yug. Yug doesn't trust Kali anymore and goes with Gauri. Yug starts to hate Kali. Time passes by and Yug finally finds out the truth behind Gauri and marries Kali once again. Gauri then plans to make Kali seem dead by injecting some type of medicine on her but that plan fails when her injection breaks. Instead, she puts the poison in the safety pin and hooks it on Kali's doli. Kali is pricked by the safety pin. While performing rituals and praying in the temple at Yug's house, Kali faints. They call the doctor but the doctor tells everyone that Kali is dead. Just then, Yug realizes that it could have been Gauri and goes to her hotel to drag her there. She fakes and does some drama of crying and says she will bring Kali back to life by burning kapur on her hand. She has already put chemical on her hand to make sure her palm doesn't burn. The poison wears off and Kali regains conscientious, leaving everyone believing Gauri. However Yug does not believe Gauri and sends her out of the house. Gauri vows for revenge. She comes back as a servant and starts to make Leela believe that an evil spirit is haunting her. She brings a fake astrologer and he tells that Yug should be 21 kilometers away from the house. Leela and Yug believe it and Yug leaves. Later with the help of the astrologer, Gauri makes it look like Kali has the evil spirit inside her and Leela decides to sacrifice Kali. Manjiri comes to Yug's house and discovers that there is a pooja going on and asks for Kali, who is locked in a room. Manjiri gets suspicious and follows the car leading to the ashram. She brings a real astrologer and the truth behind Gauri gets revealed to everyone. Kali, enraged, slaps Gauri for her deeds and Gauri later reveals to everyone that Leela did not want Kali to be her daughter in law and encouraged Gauri that Yug would be married to her. Yug gets distraught and leaves while Gauri and the fake astrologer get arrested. Gauri vows to destroy his whole family. After three months however, Gauri who is released from jail returns and reveals to everyone that she is pregnant with Yug's child. Because of this Yug allows her to stay until the child is born. Later, it is revealed that Kaali is also pregnant. This matter however, is only known by Gauri and Vishwa as they bribed the nurse to get her reports before she does. In order to make sure that Kaali and Yug stay apart Gauri plans to have Kali thrown out of the house which is eventually carried out by Yug himself, as he does so Vishwa then takes Kaali to the top of a cliff and reveals her pregnancy to her just as he is about to push her off. Vishwa pushes Kali off of the cliff but Kali hangs onto a branch. Vishwa throws rock at her and she falls. Afterwards, Kali's suicide note comes and everyone believes Kali to be dead. Leela asks Yug to marry Gauri and give the child a legitimate name. Yug agrees to marry Gauri. Meanwhile, Kali doesn't die and is saved by a mentally challenged man named Nandu Singh (Mayank Gandhi). Kali asks Nandu to take her to Choudhary House. Nandu takes her there but returns. There back in his village, some kids tease him as Kali's husband. Nandu becomes shy and later, Nandu marries Kali and then takes her to the hospital where he gets to know that Kali is in coma. 7 months later Yug is now turned as a puppet for Vishwaveer. Vishwaveer is the new landlord of Choudhary House. Nandu is seen taking care of Kali in the hospital. The nurses discuss that Kali has lost her child. Gauri and Yug travel to Veerpur. On there way Gauri gets labour pain and Yug takes her to the same hospital where Kali is admitted. Vishwaveer finds out that Kali is in the hospital. Meanwhile, Gauri delivers a baby girl and names it Naina. Naina gets kidnapped by Vishwa, after being told that baby is threat to his life and Kali finds out about Yug and Gauri and decides to commit suicide on the same river where Vishwa places Naina in a basket and floating away. Kali feels the basket and finds Naina in it and decides to live. She begins to raise Naina. Unknown to Kali is that Naina is Yug and Gauri's daughter, who are distraught after their baby went missing, and names it Naina. It is revealed that Vishwa attempted to kill Naina because of a superstition that says Naina is a threat to him. Manjiri later finds Kali at a temple and Kali reveals that she was once pregnant with Yug's child and Vishwa threw her off the cliff for the sake of Gauri. Manjiri vows revenge on Vishwa and brings Kali to Yug's house. Gauri does not like this and tries to kill her own daughter Naina. However it backfires. Meanwhile, Nandu finds out that Vishwa attempted to kill Kali and vows not to spare him. Fearing that the truth would come out, Vishwa gets rid of all the evidence he could find. He also find out that Kali's adopted daughter is actually Gauri and Yug's daughter Naina. Vishwa attempts to kill Kali and Naina but fails because of Nandu. Manjiri later finds out about this and scolds Vishwa and reveals her revenge against him. Kali and Naina disappeared once again and Manjiri threatens to kill Vishwa if he does not reveal where Kali and Naina are. It is later revealed that Kali had planned this to get the truth from Vishwa. Later, while Vishwa, along with his partner Raj Purohit (Rajesh Puri) conduct a Pooja, assuming that Kali is dead, Kali pretends to be a spirit to get Vishwa to say the truth. With the help of Nandu and Manjiri, Kali gets the truth out. Yug gets distraught by hearing this and a chandelier falls on Kali. While she is hospitalized Manjiri reveals the truth behind Vishwa and Gauri. Yug later gets Raj and Vishwa arrested but they escape. Naina gets kidnapped again but Kali and Manjiri finds her. Vishwa finds Kali and Manjiri and threatens to kill Kali and Naina. Before he could, Manjiri grabs a trishul and stabs Vishwa, killing him. After Vishwa's funeral, Yug asks Kali for forgiveness but Kali rejects saying that she is not a doll to play with. Nandu offers Kali to stay at his place but Yug threatens to kill Naina if Kali leaves. Kali stays but scolds Yug for being selfish and will only stay for Naina's sake. Leela declares Kali as Naina's official mother as Gauri is too dangerous for the number of sins she committed. At this time, a tantrik named Devri Singh (Vineet Raina) is introduced and reveals to be Nandu's brother. Kali and Manjiri get suspicious about Devri and ask a priest at an ashram and Raj Purohit, as he has no other option. Manjiri and Kali discover that Devri was Vishwa's Kaala Teeka. They also discovers Devri's true intentions to kill the baby Naina to gain evil powers. It is also revealed in Nandu's kundli that Nandu is Naina's Kaala Teeka. Discovering that Devri is a threat, Yug bans Devri from coming into the house while Devri plot to kill Naina is underway. Devri also decides to kill Kali because she is an obstacle that he has to overcome to kill Naina. But Manjiri and Nandu save them and Nandu and Kali get married for Naina's protection. This infuriates Yug and he decides to kill Nandu but is stopped by Gauri. Devri decides to kill his own brother Nandu in order to get Naina but Devri mistakenly stabs himself. Devri is rushed to the hospital. Yug later snatched Naina from Kali saying that she is no longer her mother. Yug meets with an accident and Naina and Yug are hospitalized. Devri donates blood to Naina but Kali would forgive him if he goes to jail. But Devri escaped and forms another plan to kill Naina. Jamuna soon finds out about this and warns Kali. Kali decides to kill Devri. Raj Purohit later finds out that only Kali and Nandu can kill Devri. Nandu does not want to kill his brother Devri. Kali decides to kill Devri with the help of Yug and she was successful. But Devri is still alive and attempted to drown Kali but is saved by Nandu who kills his own brother Devri. After 8 months Kali is now pregnant with Nandu's child and Naina is shown to be 8 months old and causing trouble for Kali, Yug and Gauri. Naina runs to a forest and Kali finds her there. while she was there, she gives birth to Nandu's child and names her Pavitra. A nearby tantrik reveals that Pavitra would not be able to live for no longer than seven years. 5 years later Nandu had died when he killed Devri. Yug decides to adopt Pavitra. Gauri gets jealous to Kaali because she think that Kaali was take her life. Gauri becomes angry after knowing that Kaali and Yug get closer again. She then burned the house. Everybody is dead but Kaali is trapped in her room. Naina and Pavitra was saved and they ran away from the house. Gauri chases them and wants to kill Pavitra. But fuel tank of her car was leaked and her car was exploded, Gauri dead. In the next day, Chulbuli comes home and is shocked to see the house was burned. Naina and Pavitra go back home and meet Chulbuli. They feel sad when everybody found dead. But Kaali still trapped in her room. They search Kaali and the found her, they take Kaali to hospital. Suddenly, Kaali wake up and hug Naina and Pavitra. Raj Purohit come to hospital and ask forgiveness to Kaali. Raj Purohit confess that myth about kaala teeka of Gauri is just a hoax. He made up the story about kaala teeka because he was treated by Vishwaveer. Kaali forgives him and make him promise to not tell about superstition anymore. Kaali want Chulbuli to take care of her daughter. Kaali closed her eyes and dies. A few days later, Jamuna come home and wants to take Pavitra to stay with her. Naina, Chulbuli and Pavitra herself didn't let her to take Pavitra. Chulbuli says to Raj Purohit to bring Naina and Pavitra to Neel and Sharmila in the city to avoid Jamuna. But before that happen, Jamuna comes and takes Pavitra away. Moving to Bhimpur, the bus in which they were traveling meets with an accident and Jamuna dies. Pavitra faints, falls into the river, and she floats away to another village. Maai finds her and says that she will take care of her. 14 years later Naina (Sukirti Kandpal), Gauri and Yug's daughter, lives in Mumbai while Pavitra (also Simran Pareenja), Kaali and Nandu's daughter, lives in Bhimpur village. Pavitra just looks like her mother Kaali. Naina goes to college and on every holiday she goes to several villages in search of Pavitra. This time she went to Bhimpur. In Bhimpur, she stays at a girl's house called Barki, which she helped during a bus accident. Naina doesn't know that the girl in whose house she is staying is Pavitra's house. In Bhimpur, there is a ride called \\"Ganga Darpan\\" in which innocent girls are decked up as brides and are send to the other village, in order to do prostitution. But the villagers are not aware of this. They think that the girls are being send to an Ashram for being Sanyasi's all their lives. This all is a big sex scandal. In all of this, Thakur Dev Sinha (Parag Tyagi), the Thakur of the village and the Mahant was involved. However, Naina tried to exposed Thakur Dev and the Mahant in front of the villagers, but nobody listened to her and she was sent back to Mumbai. But Naina didn't gave up and went back to Bhimpur, this time with Chulbuli and Dimpy. There Naina meet Krishna Sinha (Karan Sharma), the son of Thakur Dev Sinha. There was a glimpse of love at first sight. With the help of Krishna and Barki, Naina created a plan to expose the Thakur. The 45th time Barki was chosen for the \\"Ganga Darpan\\" and Naina wanted to stop this and she succeeds, but Thakur Dev Sinha accused Mahant and he was sent to jail instead of both of them. Then all the girls returned to their parents. However, Thakur Dev tried to kill Naina and Krishna, but couldn't succeed. One day Mai (also Barki's mother) wanted to remove all the proof of Pavitra's existence, but could't do it because Barki got to know that she is Pavitra. Naina saves Barki and they got back to the village. Thakur Dev didn't stop his cunning and slimy tricks. He harms Naina and marries her, cheating Krishna who was about to marry Naina, in order to rape Naina, because she exposed him. Naina losts her memory. Pavitra marries Krishna to enter Thakur Dev's mansion in order to save Naina. Thakur Dev kidnaps Dimpy, Chulbuli and Chutki. When the others got to know that the three were kidnapped, they started to haunt and taunt thakur so that he tells that where Chulbuli, Chutki and Dimpy are. When Thakur Dev was fed up and had enough, he tried to kill Krishna, Naina, Pavitra and Mai. But they didn't died. They returned in Thakur Dev's life to make him pay for his sins, but they didn't succeed in their plans. Thakur Dev now tried to create a rift between Naina and Pavitra, but Pavitra promised that she will make everything right, how it was before. Chulbuli, Dimpy and Chutki managed to escape from the goons den and went to the mansion. Meanwhile, Naina regains her memory. She accuses and abuses Pavitra for marrying Krishna. Now she wants to avenge Pavitra by taking her back to Mumbai, but Thakur didn't want to let go off Naina, because his revenge isn't complete yet. He want to have sex with Naina. He said that Naina and Pavitra only can leave this village if they unmarry back (Krishna with Pavitra and Naina with Thakur Dev). But the opposite happens. Pavitra goes in the room of Thakur Dev to save Naina, but then Krishna arrives in the room of Thakur Dev. After that Thakur Dev beats Krishna up, for stopping him. Meanwhile, the Mahant arrives with the villagers and The Thakurayan to expose Thakur Dev in front of the villagers. Thakurayan succeeds in her plans and the Thakur gets arrested. Now Naina is all set to go to Mumbai, but Pavitra is sad. Pavitra marries Krishna in full tradition. Krishna is now the Thakur of the village and Pavitra, the thakurayan. On their home way to Mumbai, Naina's car meets with an accident, because Purohitji told them that if Pavitra and Naina doesn't live together, they won't remain happy in life, because of their half-swastik tattoo on their arms. Naina regains consciousness, and they both go home.

The film, set during the Second Boer War in 1901, is a period drama that follows Willem Morkel, a Cape Rebel Boer/Afrikaans farmer who was captured and sent to a British prisoner of war camp on St. Helena Island in the Atlantic Ocean. Placed under terrible oppression and hardship, Morkel and his comrades slowly come together to assert their defiance, humanity and human spirit and, more specifically, through the game of rugby. Blood and Glory is a fictional account, using the backdrop of the Anglo-Boer War with some of the places in the plot resembling historical locations from the war. The film's protagonist, Willem Morkel, is loosely based on Sommie Morkel, who went on to play for the South Africa national rugby union team. The historical authenticity of backdrop events, conditions and attitudes in the plot of the film can be debated, as its depiction of the Boers and the British relies heavily on glorification of the former and vilification of the latter. However, the film's main villain (Australian Colonel Swanell) owes something to the real life Breaker Morant (convicted for murder and as a war criminal by the British during the Boer War and executed). It is documented that 28 000 Boer women and children, as well as 20 000 black people, died in British concentration camps (Professor Fransjohan, 2011 writing for BBC). The film also makes mention of the scorched earth policy implemented by Kitchener during the Boer War. Blood and Glory is a co-production by Dark Matter Studios and Collective Dream Films. The film is written and directed by Sean Else (Spud 2, Platteland, 'n Man soos My Pa), and produced by Llewelynn Greeff (Leading Lady and The Unfamiliar) and Henk Pretorius (Leading Lady, Fanie Fourie's Lobola, Wolwedans in die Skemer, Hoofmeisie, Bakgat Trilogy and The Unfamiliar)  Cast  Blood and Glory includes a strong South African male cast, along with five international actors ‚Äì a first for a South African film: * Stian Bam as Willem Morkel * Charlotte Salt as Katherine Sterndale * Grant Swanby as Colonel Swannel * Patrick Connolly as Finn Kelly * Albert Maritz as Isak Naude * Michael Richard as Governor Sterndale * Bok van Blerk as Kommandant Gideon Scheepers * Altus Theart as Daniel 'Yster' Malherbe * Jacques Bessenger as Phil Blignaut * Edwin van der Walt as Marius Prinsloo * Gustav Gerdener as Eddie Mijnhardt * Rudy Halgryn as Lt.

This also marked the final studio release by the band, disbanding in early 2016.  Production  After the success of the band's first EP, From Her Eyes continued to develop their sound. With the addition of guitarist Joe Shutt, the band wanted to introduce heavier elements to their sound indicative of deathcore and the technicality of progressive metal without abandoning their melodic roots Whilst still holding melodic elements and consistent lead lines, the tuning is dramatically lowered (from C# Standard seen on Demons to Drop A#), and is contrasted with Shutt's more visceral rhythm technique and riffs. Tomas Morgan's vocals lean far more towards deathcore, with lower vocal pitches for significant portions of the song. The band also adopted aggression wherever possible, i.e. being encouraged in studio to purposely hit rim shot drum strokes instead of clean drum strokes, and using only active pickups on all guitars. Despite this, this is the first venture to feature clean vocals since the band's early demo EP \\"No Place Like Home\\" (this is excluding the guest clean vocals on the title track of Demons), sung by drummer Gary Holley. This is something the band states was not planned, and was an impromptu idea that ended up being included in the final mix. Glass was originally seen by the band as a somewhat experimental bridge between Demons and their 2nd EP (which is currently being written,) rather than a confirmed introduction to the type of sound that might appear on their next EP in 2016. However, 6 months after this release From Her Eyes amicably disbanded, shelving plans for a follow up record. The band released a music video of Glass on 21 September 2015, produced by Storm + Shelter.

The central motif is the sadness and sorrow of Husayn ibn Ali‚Äôs family while crying around his horse coming back without its rider. The horse's messy hair, even the shape of its eyes, the lowering of its head, and the bloodstains on its body, indicate the calamity that has happened. Husayn ibn Ali was killed in battle of Karbala. It is one of the most inspiring and popular works of the Iranian artist, particularly for Shias.  Author  Mahmoud Farshchian (born January 24, 1930) is a Persian painter and miniaturist . He was born in the city of Isfahan and started to learn art, painting and sculpting. His works have been hosted by several museums and exhibitions worldwide. He is the most modernizer of the field of miniatures, an art form which was first established in Ancient Persia and later spread to China and Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries. In addition, the design of the Zarih, roof, door and cellar in the shrine of Ali al-Ridha, the 8th Shia Imam, in Mashhad and his membership in the committee supervising the construction of the shrine, is among work of him.  Title and subject  The Evening of Ashura is about the killing of Husayn ibn Ali in battle of Karbala who is unseen in the illustration and his horse is depicted returning to the tents alone, highlighting his martyrdom. There are women and young girls who are crying their hearts out at the feet of the charger which is back from the battle without bringing its rider back. There is an untidy saddle with pigeons hit by arrows falling on the saddle.

He spent three seasons with the Yomiuri Giants organization before signing with the Orix Buffaloes, where he spent two seasons. He made his only Nippon Professional Baseball first-team appearance for Orix in March 2014, before retiring due to injury during the 2015 season. Career =High school and university= Marumo was a member of the Osaka T≈çin High School baseball club. In his final year, he was a member of the team that qualified for the 2006 national championships. He appeared as a pinch-hitter in the 9th inning of the team's second-round loss to Waseda Jitsugyo High School and was struck out by Yuki Saito. After graduating high school he enrolled at the Osaka University of Economics and became a regular starting member of the university baseball team at the start of his second year. He played not only in the outfield but also as a third baseman. During his 4 years in the Kansai6 Baseball League, he played in a total of 88 matches and hit 4 home runs with a batting average of .227. =Professional career= In October 2010 Marumo was drafted by the Yomiuri Giants in the 8th round of the 2010 development player draft. He was the 29th player selected in the development draft that followed the regular draft (in which 68 players were selected), making him the 97th (and final) player picked overall that year. In a press release following the draft, the Giants described Marumo as \\"has top-class leg strength and will steal a lot of bases\\". Yomiuri Giants (2011‚Äì2013) In 2011 Marumo played 11 matches for the Giants' farm team; he only had one plate appearance and was mainly used as a pinch runner, finishing with three stolen bases and four runs. During the post-season camp, he was given the opportunity to practice as an infielder. In 2012, whilst registered as an outfielder, Marumo spent 57 games fielding at short stop, the most for the Giants' farm team. He played a total of 87 matches and had a batting average of .227 with 5 home runs and 15 stolen bases. In 2013 Marumo batted in the number 4 position in all of the pre-season \\"training league\\" games and, in a rare event for a development player, started the first game of the farm team's Eastern League season in the number 4 position. In 88 games he had a .197 batting average and 10 stolen bases. At the end of the 2013 season, Marumo became a free agent on 31 October, having reached the maximum of three years as a development player prescribed in the rules governing development players. He was invited to the Orix Buffaloes post-season camp in K≈çchi Prefecture and was acquired by the Buffaloes as a regular squad member on 16 November 2013, signing a contract with an estimated annual salary of 5.5 million yen the following month. Orix Buffaloes (2014‚Äì2015) Marumo impressed Orix manager Hiroshi Moriwaki with a steal in a pre-season match and started the 2014 season in the Buffaloes' first-team squad. On 28 March 2014 Marumo made his first-team debut in the Orix' opening game of the season against the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. He appeared as a pinch runner in the top of the ninth inning and scored a run; he was then replaced by catcher Katsuki Yamazaki in the middle of the ninth inning. On 2 April he was dropped to the second-team squad. Marumo played 64 games for the farm team, finishing the season with a .277 batting average and 12 stolen bases. On 5 February 2015 during the Orix pre-season camp, Marumo was struck in the left side of the head by a batted ball during fielding practice. He continued to practice, but complained of feeling unwell at the end of the session. He was taken to hospital and diagnosed with acute epidural hematoma and underwent an emergency craniotomy. He was discharged from hospital on 18 February to commence rehabilitation. Although Marumo returned to batting practice and regained his abilities to the level they were before the accident, on 2 July 2015 he announced his retirement from professional baseball on advice from his doctor, citing that a second blow in the same spot could be life-threatening. The club accepted his resignation the same day. The following day he made his final appearance in a farm league match, starting the game in the number 5 batting position and fielding in left field against the Hiroshima Carp. He fielded in the top of the first inning only and took one catch; at the end of the Hiroshima inning he was greeted by both teams standing in front of their benches and was presented with a bouquet of flowers by veteran teammate Yoshitomo Tani. As his retirement was voluntary, a member of the Orix organization said Marumo would not be eligible for compensation for forced retirement due to injury; however, club president Ry≈çz≈ç Setoyama announced Marumo would be joining the second-team staff. His career ended having made one first-team appearance as a pinch runner and scoring one run, without ever making an appearance at the plate. Playing style Marumo was noted for his leg speed, including being able to run 50 metres in 5.8 seconds. However, Orix manager Moriwaki also rated his hitting and fielding abilities, with the club expecting him to contribute as a utility infielder/outfielder.

Technology and functionality  They are described as being able to see into walls and other vehicles using Z backscatter technology.They are estimated to cost between $729,000 and $825,000. The NYPD has not disclosed how this technology is used as it would reveal investigation techniques, however Police Commissioner William Bratton states that they are not used to scan people for weapons . According to the New York University School of Law Policing Project, the manufacturer of the vans is American Science and Engineering. The product website for the van depicts a video where the van slowly drives past empty passenger cars, and in real time generates an x-ray image. The x-ray van manufacturer found that the vans expose bystanders to a 40% larger dose of ionizing radiation than the radiation delivered by airport scanners utilizing similar technology. In airports, The European Union and United States Transportation Security Administration banned the use of this type of radiation technology citing privacy and health concerns such as cancer.  Legislative controversy  On December 18, 2019, the NYCLU submitted testimony in support of Intro. 487, the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (‚ÄúPOST‚Äù) Act. In it, the NYCLU cited the example of X-ray vans as a violation of privacy, and stated in general that, \\"Left unchecked, police surveillance has the potential to chill the exercise of First Amendment-protected speech and religious worship, intrude on Fourth Amendment-protected privacy rights, and cast entire communities under a cloak of suspicion in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment‚Äôs guarantee of equal protection.\\"  Media coverage  In 2015 ProPublica issued an Article 78 proceeding in order to have the NYPD respond to FOIL requests to give further information about the usage and health risks of the x-ray technology. Although initially the lower court granted the request, the NYPD issued an appeal and the lower court ruling was overturned. The NYPD has refused to release details of the uses and operation of these vans. The New York Civil Liberties Union have filed an amici curiae brief in support of a legal action by the journalist Michael Grabell, who is attempting to obtain more information about these vehicles.

It was designed by the architect Hector Guimard, and built between 1895 and 1898. It was the first residence in Paris built in the style known as Art Nouveau. History Architect Hector Guimard (1867-1942) was born in Lyon and attended the School of Decorative Arts and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He was in charge of the construction of the Pavilion of Electricity at the 1889 Paris International Exposition, and between 1891 and 1893 he built several private houses and a school in Paris, all in the traditional styles. In 1894, at the age of twenty-seven, Guimard traveled to England and to Belgium, where he met the Belgian architect Victor Horta, and saw the Hotel Tassel which Horta had built in 1893-94 in what later became known as the Art Nouveau style. It was inspired not by classical models but by nature, particularly by the curving stems of plants and flowers. Horta also stressed to Guimard the importance of unity in a building; the structure, decoration, furniture, wallpaper, carpets and decoration should all go together. Guimard had undertaken the project of designing an apartment building in a traditional style for a widow named Madame Fournier before he went to Brussels and met Horta. When he returned, he persuaded his client to allow him to build the structure in the new style. He began designing the Castel B√©ranger in 1895, Guimard became involved in every detail of the project, designing the furniture, ornamental ironwork, carpets, glass, wall paper, door locks and doorknobs. Guimard did not forget his debt to Horta; when the building was done, Guimard sent him an album of the designs of the building with the inscription, \\"to an eminent master and friend, Victor Horta, affectionate homage from an admirer.\\" The design Describing the Castel B√©ranger, the architectural historian and critic Simon Texier wrote: \\"The Art Nouveau had as its characteristic trait a naturalist approach, which made a building or a simple object into a work which was at the same time complex, in motion, and unified by its lines.\\" There were many elements of the new building that were neo-Gothic, though Guimard's interpretation was very far from the pure 13th century style advocated by Viollet-le-Duc. It was suggested by the name Castel, rather than Hotel, and by its modern version of echauguettes, the overhanging turrets that were a feature on the corners of medieval castles. Guimard put into the building a multiplicity of different forms, materials and colors, some of them inspired by the colors of the villas of seaside towns. The ornament was abundant, but carefully designed and not overwhelming; it moved away from Gothic into a more personal and original style. The interior decoration was also diverse and personal.

In 1898 the City government encouraged variety by organizing a competition for the most beautiful and original new building facades; the winner for the 16th arrondissement was Guimard's Castel B√©ranger. In the same year, Guimard was selected to design the entrances of the new stations of the Paris Metro, making him the most prominent figure in the French Art Nouveau. Guimard also took the step, unusual at the time, of launching a public relations campaign based on the building, promoting the new style as a step forward. It was the first time that an architect treated a simple residential building as a major work; in the 20th century this became one of the characteristics of the modernist revolution in architecture. Afterwards Guimard built one other Art Nouveau house in Paris; his own residence, the Hotel Guimard, between 1909 and 1913, at 122 Avenue Mozart. For his own house, he moved away from ornament and expressed the Art Nouveau idea of modeling after nature in the form of the building itself. Beside the Metro station, Guimard's other Paris works included a Theater/Concert Hall, the Salle Humbert de Romans, which was opened in 1901 and demolished in 1905, and the Synagogue on Rue Pave in the Marais (1913). Between World War I and World War II Guimard turned his attention to experiments in building houses with prefabricated materials, including bricks of molded concrete, covered with a glaze (enduit) molded metal windowframes, and a roof covered with zinc. In 1922 he built a house on square Jasmin with these materials. In 1930 he designed a country house, la Guimardiere, where the pipes for the plumbing became a decorative element, featured on the outside, a precursor of the Centre Pompidou. It was demolished in 1969. As World War II approached, he left France and died in New York in 1942. Nearly all of his Metro stations were removed, and he was nearly forgotten as an architect until the 1970s, when there was renewed interest in the Art Nouveau. The Castel B√©ranger was classified as an historical monument on 3 July 1972.

Biography Esmahan Aykol was born in Edirne in 1970, in an emigrant family of mixed origins. Her father is from Macedonia while her grandmother was Bulgarian. Both her parents were lawyers. She attended a British boarding school in Istanbul, where German was taught as a second language. Aykol received a degree in law from Istanbul University and a postgraduate degree in law from Humboldt University of Berlin, where her dissertation was on discrimination and differences between Turkish and German divorce law. During her studies in Istanbul, she wrote articles on social issues for Turkish cultural journals, including coverage of the city's street children. Following her degree in 1996, she opened a pub with a friend, but it was unsuccessful. She then moved to Berlin with her husband, where she began writing crime fiction in the Turkish language. Aykol's first novel, Kitap√ßƒ± D√ºkkani was published in 2001. It featured Kati Hirschel, the owner of Istanbul's only crime fiction bookstore, a woman of German origin, whose inquisitiveness and passion for crime novels leads her to investigate a murder. The book was a bestseller and was followed by sequels, including Kelepir Ev (2003), ≈û√ºpheli Bir √ñl√ºm (2007), and Tango Istanbul (2012). As of 2015, three of these books have been translated into English. In 2006, Aykol published Savrulanlar, about a woman named Ece who escapes to London after a failed love affair. The book is an ode to the ancient art of storytelling, which remains a tradition of great honour among the Kurdish and Armenian communities in Turkey. Ece, stuck in a foreign land, recalls the stories told by her grandfather, an Armenian jeweller, and his experiences during the events of 1915.

It aired on MBC on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 22:00 beginning November 18, 2015. The series is loosely based on the Marrying the Mafia film franchise, which also starred Jung Joon-ho.  Plot  Yoon Tae-soo (Jung Joon-ho) struggles to balance his life as a kind loving father who heads his family while hiding his mob identity from them. Hoping to gain the respect of his grown-up children and hold his head high in front of others, Tae-soo tries to legalize his construction company to incorporate his gang into proper, clean businesses only to meet obstruction from his biggest rival, Baek Ki-beom (Jung Woong-in).  Cast  =Main characters= * Jung Joon-ho as Yoon Tae-soo (42, male / Choongshim Gang boss) :He manages night clubs, gentlemen's clubs, illicit gambling parlors, liquor distribution as the boss of the Choongshim gang. When he was only in his late teens, he already made a name for himself as a tough streetfighter in Daejeon. But he had to support his mom and siblings so once he finished high school, he started working at a paint factory where he had to deal with noxious fumes every day at work. But despite his hard work, the factory boss never paid him his salary. He needed money to support his siblings, so out of anger, he assaulted his boss. His boss pressed charges but offered to drop them if he were to agree to work at the factory for a year without pay. His friend Gi-bum and Byung-nam, who were members of the Choongshim Gang, heard about his plight and did extensive damage to the paint factory. Their gang handled the blowback from their rampage. After this incident, Tae-soo naturally joined the Choongshim gang. * Moon Jung-hee as Kim Eun-ok (42, female / Tae-soo's wife) :Her husband is a gang leader and her mother-in-law is a sociopath who torments her at every chance. Her daughter is constantly getting in trouble at school for bad behavior. Her life is terrible on so many levels. She is not happy with her husband‚Äôs occupation but she gets to live in a big, expensive apartment, and the money he makes is good so she is not complaining. But when Tae-soo does not answer his phone when she calls or comes home late, she gets very irritated and will nag him like nobody's business. * Jung Woong-in as Baek Gi-bum (42, male / President, Choongshim Construction) :Chairman Baek Man-bo's only son. Gi-bum is the future chairman of Choongshim Construction and currently works as the president. This is not what he wants but his father did not want his son to be involved in gang activities. His mother left the family when he was a young kid and this scarred him permanently. In the following years, he had different stepmothers, who he would treat with scorn and malice until they went away. This gave his dad a lot of headaches on top of his bad behavior at school. In high school, he picked fights with Tae-soo and Byung-nam but always got beaten. But the three of them forged a friendship and they were invincible around the streets of Daejeon. Due to his fiery temper, he got into a lot of trouble at school and was finally expelled by the principal. After that, he joined a gang. * Yoo Sun as Lee Do-kyung (female / Gi-bum's ex-wife) * Kim Eung-soo as Baek Man-bo (70, male / Chairman, Choongshim Construction) :He is the gang boss who held onto power the longest in Chungcheong Province and was a legendary boss in his prime. In the 1990s, he retired from his gang leader position but since he was able to amass a large fortune during his reign, he still wields power in the gang he founded. After retiring, he kept a low profile and appointed Tae-soo as the gang boss who oversees his many business interests in the underworld. His son Gi-bum oversees his real estate holdings and construction company while Hee-do, who has an MBA degree, is the brains who manages investments and bookkeeping. * Lee Minhyuk as Yoon Sung-min (18, male / Tae-soo's son) :He has an easy-going personality and is popular at school because he is approachable and friendly. He excels academically and constantly ranks near the top of his entire grade at high school while also performing his duties as the class president. He started taekwondo, judo, and kendo at an early age under his dad‚Äôs coaching so he is physically strong and athletic. Unlike his dad, he is academically inclined and is rather innocent about many things for a kid his age. His mother, Eun-ok wishes to see him go to one of the top universities in Seoul and has arranged for him to transfer to a high school in the big city soon. * Bang Minah as Baek Hyun-ji (18, female / Ki-beom's daughter) :She was a member of a girl band that never took off and you have to be pretty to get picked up by a talent agency so it goes without saying that she has great looks. After her parents divorced five years ago, she was forced to move to Seoul to live with her mom and this was against her wishes. She signed on with a talent agency and enrolled in their talent training program because of her mom.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Cilicia (now part of Turkey), within the Taurus Mountains. It has glaucous short leaves, tall stems with several branches, numerous flowers in various colours from blue-purple, lavender, pale blue, cream, white and yellow, with brown veining and white tipped orange beards. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Its status is still unclear, if it is a synonym of Iris germanica or a separate species. Description It has short rhizomes and a few long secondary roots. It has glaucous and sheathing leaves. The leaves can grow up to between long, and between wide.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) They are herbaceous, and die in autumn and it remains dormant over winter. It is a tall growing species,U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of Information with a stiff stem, or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. It has numerous, or 2‚Äì3 lateral branches (or pedicels). The stem has spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are green, long and scarious above. The stems (and the many branches) hold up to 7 flowers, between May to June. The chunky flowers, come in various colours. From blue-purple, lavender, pale blue,Kelly Norris white, cream, and yellow, or blended. The yellow forms are similar to Iris purpureobractea flowers. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The hafts (the section of petal closest to them stem), are white with brown-purple, or brown veins. In the centre of the falls are beards, row of small hairs, white tipped with orange. After the iris has flowered, it produces seed capsule, (that has not yet been described). Inside the capsule, are seeds (called pollen) that are 121 long x 123 wide (in microns). =Biochemistry= In 1989, a karyological study was carried out on 4 iris species in Turkey; including Iris junonia Schott et Kotschy ex Schott, Iris purpureobractea B. Matthew et T.Baytop, Iris taochia Woronow ex Grossh., and Iris schachtii. It found the chromosome counts of the iris species and Iris junonia was counted as 2n=4x=48. In 2013, a study was carried out on the cultural conditions of Iris species in Turkey. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. Iris junonia was found to be tetraploid, based on material from specimens collected, and had a count of 2n=48. Taxonomy thumb It is also known as 'Iris junoninana' or 'Iris pallida junonia', mainly in Europe. The Latin specific epithet junonia refers to the Roman goddess Juno, wife of Jupiter.D. Gledhill Although, it is not known for what exact reason the plant was so named, Iris cypriana and Iris trojana (now classed as a synonym of Iris germanica), also collected at the same time, may represent the ancient colonies, that the Greeks set up on Turkish shores. Specimens were found by Walter Siehe of Mersina, in the Turkish mountains, and he sent them to Haage and Schmidt of Erfurt, in Germany. Siehe caused a lot of problems for botanists, because he also sent other iris plant specimens under the same name. It was first published and described by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott & Karl Georg Theodor Kotschy in √ñsterreichisches Botanisches Wochenblatt (in Vienna) Vol.4 page 209 in 1854. It was also published in Van T. 1900; Dammann 1901; Farr 1912; Gardening Illustrated 37: 503. 14 Aug. 1914 illustrated; Bon. 1920; Sheets 1928; Mt. Upton 1939; \\"Bearded Irises Tried at Wisley\\"-Journal of The Royal Horticultural Society 128; Its origins have been much debated and discussed, it could be considered a form of Iris pallida, hence it is sometimes known as Iris pallida junonia. It could also be a small form of Iris mesopotamica. Of the many species, listed with Iris germanica in Europe, Brian Mathews (in 1981), considers Iris belouinii (now a synonym of Iris germanica), Iris biliottii (now a synonym of Iris germanica), Iris cypriana, Iris junonia, Iris mesopotamica and Iris trojana(now a synonym of Iris germanica) to be all 'doubtfully wild' and probably forms of Iris germanica, which Brian is thought to be a hybrid of Iris pallida and Iris variegata.George Gessert Dykes was unsure that if any true plants were now in cultivation. It is listed by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service as a synonym of Iris pallida Lam. on 4 April 2003, then updated on 1 December 2004. It is also listed in the Encyclopedia of Life and the Catalogue of Life. Iris junonia is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate areas of Asia minor. =Range= It was found in the Taurus Mountains in Cilicia, (now the modern region of √áukurova) in Turkey. Iris taochia, Iris purpuerobractea and Iris schachtii are also endemic to Turkey, with Iris junonia. it is endemic of Sicilian Taurus (a hill for which the city of Taormina was named) =Habitat= It grows in the dry, meadows, beside roadside and beside paths. Cultivation It is not fully hardy in the UK. It prefers sunny situations in soils containing limestone, and that are dry during the summer. It can be prone to rhizome rot. Dykes recommends a planting time of between August and September. It is found in herbarium collections. A specimen was collected by E.K. Balls, on 7 June 1934 from Turkey, for the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. =Hybrids and cultivars= Dykes had thought that Iris junonia, Iris trojana, Iris cypriana and Iris mesopotamica (other tall purple flower bearded irises), could be used in breeding programmes, to create plants with tall stems and large flowers. It can be crossed with other iris species (such as Iris pumila and Regelia section irises), to produce fertile offspring. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Sources * Davis, P. H., ed. 1965‚Äì1988.

The thirty-minute weekly series debuted on 10 May 1969 and was broadcast until 16 December 1972. History Hit Scene was developed by the ABC's Light Entertainment department, under the supervision of the Director of Television Programs, Ken Watts. The series was hosted by Melbourne radio announcer Dick Williams (Richard Arthur Williams (1931-2014). Williams had previously hosted ABC's Hit Parade, which was broadcast only in Victoria as part of their Saturday afternoon Sportsview program, and was chief reviewer on Radio Australia's 'International Record Review' short wave service. Williams had come to the television hosting job having successfully auditioned in early 1964 based on years of radio work. He had worked his way up from selling airtime and writing copy on 3KZ in Melbourne, 7AD and 7LA in Tasmania and 3HA Hamilton and 3TR Sale back in Victoria. He took over the Hit Parade and Radio Australia compering jobs from Pete Smith, who moved on to GTV-9. Broadcast The time slot for Hit Scene varied between broadcast regions. It was regularly broadcast at 2.10 p.m. (AEST) on Saturdays in Victoria, during the Sportsview programme, with the time-slot adjusted if it clashed with a scheduled sporting fixture. In NSW it was often seen around midday, screening outside of Sportsview. It also changed screening days at certain times of year, screening, for example, on Sundays at 6pm in Victoria late in 1969. The first episode was seen only in Melbourne due to the ABC's sporting commitments in other Australian states. The final episode was an hour-long special. Each episode would feature interviews with Australian musicians or a touring international artist, an in-house performance by an Australian musical artist, film footage of an overseas musical act, music charts from around Australia, and reviews of new releases. Hit Scene also broadcast special concerts during weekdays, including the farewell Australian concert of Max Merritt and the Meteors (Monday 8.00 pm, 13 July 1970) before their first North American tour. Theme Early episodes of Hit Scene featured a musically themed introduction track 'Mr. Eliminator' by Dick Dale and His Del-Tones, backing Brisbane band The Avengers (not be confused with the New Zealand band of the same name and time period) appearing and disappearing at various locations across Melbourne, along with compere Williams driving his Holden Monaro GT to the ABC studios. The Avengers appeared in-person on the first national episode on 17 May 1969, promoting their latest EMI single \\"Twiddle-E-Dee\\", composed by Terry Britten. Unlike GTK, in-house performances were mostly mimed to pre-recorded music. This may have played a part in Hit Scene's demise, because the Musicians' Union and Actors Equity decided on 1 November 1972 to ban all mimed performances on Australian television. Production Hit Scene was recorded in monochrome at the ABC's Ripponlea television studios in the Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick. Early episodes were produced by Bernard Terry, and directed by Roger Prior, with Alan Morris as executive producer. Brian Rodgers, Paul Brown, Ron Cromb, and Dick Robins provided technical production. Art work and set design was overseen by Peter Redman.

Schulz. It was released on October 23, 2015 through Epic Records. Following the announcement that Christophe Beck would score the film, it was revealed that Meghan Trainor would write an original song for the soundtrack. The song, titled \\"Better When I'm Dancin'\\", was released as a promotional single from the soundtrack on October 13, 2015. Along with Beck and Trainor, the soundtrack features songs by Vince Guaraldi and Flo Rida. Background In October 2014, 20th Century Fox revealed that Christophe Beck would score the film. Events occur at 8:03 (budget), 9:00 (Beck). Beck stated, \\"With the Peanuts movies, I grew up on those specials from the '60s and '70s, that, of course, rerun to this day. I'm very fond of all that Vince Guaraldi music, so what we did was try to find spots in the film where we could sort of touch down and remind people who were watching the film that it's still a Peanuts movie, and there's still a place for that music in the film. There's a bunch of spots where we quote the Guaraldi music, or we actually re-record his pieces quite faithfully.\\" He also added that the score would be more orchestral than Guaraldi's previous scores, which were mainly a small jazz combo. Jazz pianist David Benoit contributed to Beck's score. On July 28, 2015, Fox announced that American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor was writing and performing an original song for the film, titled \\"Better When I'm Dancin'\\". About the song, Trainor stated that \\"They wanted a song about confidence and knew I was good at writing those. I feel better when I‚Äôm onstage dancing and having fun, so I wrote about that!‚Äù Promotion \\"Better When I'm Dancin'\\" by Meghan Trainor was released as the album‚Äôs first and only promotional single from the soundtrack on October 13, 2015.

He is a prominent figure and pioneer in the world of Jewish- Christian relations, and is the executive director of the Center for Jewish- Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC), co-founder of the Day to Praise global interfaith initiative, and founder of the Blessing Bethlehem aid organization. In addition, Nekrutman is a columnist who has written for The Jerusalem Post, Charisma Magazine, and The Times of Israel.  Biography  = Early life = David Nekrutman was born on 28 November 1973 in Brooklyn, New York, to Natalie (n√©e Bell) and Allen Nekrutman. He is the younger brother of Joseph Nekrutman. Throughout his elementary and high-school years, Nekrutman attended a Yeshiva, where he adorned, in his words, \\"a black hat\\", which is significant of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish denomination. = Education = Nekrutman holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in forensic psychology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and a Master of Social Work from the University of Pennsylvania. In 2013, Nekrutman was accepted into Oral Roberts University's theology program, taking a Master of Arts in Biblical Literature, with a concentration in Judaic‚ÄìChristian Studies. In May 2018, Nekrutman became the first Orthodox Jew to graduate from Oral Roberts University with a master's degree in Christian Studies.  Jewish-Christian relations  In the early 2000s, prior to his work with CJCUC, Nekrutman served initially as Director of Political Affairs, and later on as Director of Christian Affairs, for the Consulate General of Israel in New York, a position he acquired after attending a Christian \\"Night to Celebrate Israel\\" event at a local community church in Brooklyn. Initially, it was Nekrutman's boss at the consulate, Alon Pinkas, who was intended to take part in the event, but an emergency situation in Israel at the time prevented him from going, and he asked Nekrutman to take his place. After placing a call to his rabbi, Gerald Meister, Nekrutman received the necessary dispensation to attend the event at the church. After attending the event, Nekrutman was later approached by Pinkas and his director of media affairs, Ido Aharoni, and informed that they are changing his portfolio from Director of Political Affairs to Director of Christian Affairs. After hesitation in regards to whether or not he wanted to accept the position, Nekrutman turned once again to Rabbi Meister, who told him that he had been entrusted with a sacred responsibility, and that he could go by way of two paths: \\"Covenant Theology\\", in which both Jewish and Christian communities believe they are covenanted; or by way of a \\"Kodak Moment\\", and get his picture taken in the paper. Meister told Nekrutman that he preferred he go by way of the first option. Nekrutman eventually accepted the position. While serving as Director of Christian Affairs, he was instrumental in the launching of The Day of Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem, The Israel Experience, The Christian Jerusalem Day Banquet, and The Watchman on the Wall program with Reverend Robert Stearns of Eagles' Wings, resulting in millions of Christians praying for and supporting Israel and the Jewish people. = CJCUC = David Nekrutman, speaking at the central Day to Praise event at \\"HaZvi Israel\\" synagogue in Jerusalem, 23 April 2015. Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, and CJCUC Executive Director, David Nekrutman, meet with Pope Francis in Rome, Italy, 26 October 2016 Since 2008, Nekrutman, under the auspice of Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, heads The Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation, or CJCUC, an educational institution at which Christians who tour Israel can study the Hebrew Bible with Orthodox rabbis and learn about the Hebraic roots of Christianity. The center was established in Efrat in 2008 by Riskin, who has developed a reputation as \\"the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists\\". CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as Christians United for Israel and the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem. Its mission is rooted in Isaiah 1:18: \\"Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord.\\" In 2011, Nekrutman spoke to Korean Christians at a pro-Israel rally held in Seoul. Nekrutman was the first Orthodox Jew to speak at the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) conference and discuss the importance of visiting Israel. In April 2012, he was the main speaker at CUFI's first international event in Nairobi, where over 1,500 Africans attended to support Israel. In 2013, Nekrutman, was accepted into the Oral Roberts University online Graduate Theology program. In October 2013, Nekrutman published a controversial appeal for funds from Jews to support the purchase of a permanent site for the Christian-Arab church of Pastor Steven Khoury. In a September 2015 piece for The Times of Israel, Nekrutman appealed to the Israeli Ministry of Education in regards to budget cuts and equal funding for Christian schools in Israel, citing these budget cuts as \\"collateral damage\\" of internal political issues and stating that these issues \\"should never oppress minority populations\\".

He served as president of the Swiss Federal Assembly (Tagsatzung) during 1820 and again during 1826. Life Georg Vinzenz R√ºttimann was born in Reiden, in the northern part of the Canton of Lucerne. He was born into one of the leading Catholic families of Lucerne. His father, Johann Jost R√ºttimann, was a member of the city's inner ruling council (Kleinrat), and through his mother, born Maria Elisabeth D√ºrler, he was related to other leading families. Vinzenz was sent away to Colmar for his education between 1780 and 1783, and there followed a further two years of private tuition back home in Lucerne after which for several years between 1785 and 1788 he traveled extensively in Germany, France and Italy. In 1791 Vinzenz R√ºttimann became a member of the city council, progressing in 1793 to membership of the inner ruling council, filling the vacancy caused by his father's death. He remained a member of the inner ruling council till 1798. During the 1790s he also served as a Habsburg bailiff and as secretary to the delegation sent on behalf of the thirteen cantons to meet with the agents of the French in Basel (1792/93). He also, in 1793 or 1794, joined the Helvetic (patriotic) Society. At the end of 1797 the Lucerne council sent him as delegate to the Swiss Federal Assembly (Tagsatzung) which that year met in Aarau. In 1798 he was a member of the Swiss federation's delegation in peace talks with the French. Between 1798 and 1803 the more heavily populated central belt of Switzerland, included Lucerne, was occupied by French troops, although aspects of the existing federal power structure persisted apparently with the French emperor's acquiescence. From 1798 till 1802 R√ºttimann occupied a senior governing role in the federal administration: politically during this time he was seen as an advocate for a greater coming together of the cantons. In this context he traveled to the important Helvetic Council meeting that took place between December 1802 and February 1803 as a delegate both for his home Canton of Lucerne and for the Italian speaking Canton of Ticino to the south. The French military presence in Switzerland was withdrawn in 1802, to be followed by a period of continuing political flux. Within Lucerne Vinzenz R√ºttimann was president of the provisional governing commission, and during what came to be known as the Period of Mediation, till 1814, he served as Lucerne's \\"Schulthei√ü\\" (a mayoral level office). On a federal level, during 1808 he was also designated as \\"Chief officer/magistrate\\" (Landammann) of the Swiss Confederation. Reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with general unruliness under the Lucerne Cantonal government since the setting aside of the traditional old regime, on 16 November 1814 Vinzenz R√ºttimann led a group of leading citizens in a coup d'etat to protect the traditional status quo through a reversion to a modified version of the \\"patriarchal\\" pre-revolutionary constitutional structure. In addition to the old patriarchal families, the new structure now also included members of the increasingly important middle class elements. A few years later, in 1818, R√ºttimann participated in negotiations in Rome over diocesan issues, which led to the transfer of Lucerne to the Swiss Diocese of Basel following the dissolution of the imperial Diocese of Constance. In terms of federal politics, between 1807 and 1829 R√ºttimann was regularly a delegate from Lucerne to the Swiss Swiss Federal Assembly (Tagsatzung) of which he was elected president in 1820 and 1826, which made him the senior political officer in the Swiss confederation, although the decentralised power structure in the country, meant that in the nineteenth century, as to a lesser extent still in the twenty-first, most important political decision were taken at the cantonal level.

He has been a regular member of the first-choice team since 2014, and was part of the victorious team that beat Gloucester in the final of the 2017-18 European Rugby Challenge Cup. =International career= He was a Wales under-20 international, captaining the side at the 2012 and 2013 Junior World Cup where Wales finished as runners up. Jenkins captained team consisting of a number of future Wales senior internationals: in the 2012 championship he captained the side which became the first side from any country to defeat New Zealand at that level. His team-mates that day included future senior Wales regulars Rob Evans and Samson Lee as well as several other players who would go on to earn senior Wales caps including Tom Prydie, Dan Baker, Eli Walker and Matthew Morgan, as well as future Scotland international Luke Hamilton. In 2013, Jenkins would captain the side which finished runners-up, Wales' best performance at U20 level to date. Jenkins would have to bide his time before making his senior Wales appearance, in part due to intense competition for places in the Wales back row from the likes of Sam Warburton, Dan Lydiate, Justin Tipuric, Josh Navidi and Aaron Shingler. He finally made his debut aged 23 on the 2016 tour of New Zealand, coming off the bench in all three tests. He would captain Wales for the first time against South Africa in Washington D.C. during the 2018 Wales rugby union tour to Argentina and the United States.

She is a partner at Henning Larsen Architects in Copenhagen where she heads the department for sustainability. Biography Kongebro studied architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, graduating in 1999. In 2001, she joined Henning Larsen Architects, where, since 2007, she has been an associate partner and headed the firm's sustainability department. Her research has revealed the critical importance of daylight in architectural design, in view of its contribution to sustainability and energy efficiency. More generally, her research has centred on the importance of adopting a sustainable design approach to reduce energy consumption of buildings in operation. The book Design with knowledge, edited by Kronebro, presents the results of research into design and energy consumption conducted by postgraduate engineers at the Technical University of Denmark. A key conclusion is that architects and engineers should collaborate closely in the building design process in order to apply recent developments in climate and energy studies. Kronebro provides the following explanation: > Right from the introductory design phases, we need to ensure that a building > does not use more energy than necessary. That is the cheapest way to > minimise energy consumption and in the future it will be essential. > Sustainability requirements are becoming stricter and these challenges > cannot be met by means of technology alone. Kongebro's work has revealed that 40 percent of a building's energy consumption depends on design. It can be halved if the necessary design criteria are applied from the start. As a result, sustainability has become a competitive factor for Henning Larsen Architects.

In 318 BC, at the suggestion of the Wei minister, Gongsun Yan, he entered into an alliance against Qin created by King Huai of Chu which also included the states of Zhao, Han and Yan. Chu then betrayed this alliance. In 317 BC, at the suggestion of chancellor Zhang Yi, King Xiang entered into an alliance with Qin. To punish Chu for its betrayal of the 5-state alliance, King Xiang sent an army in 312 BC to attack the city of Dengcheng in Chu (modern-day part of Shangshui County, Zhoukou, Henan Province). Wei itself was attacked by Qi in 310 BC, and King Xiang met King Wu of Qin at Linjin (modern day part of Linyi County, Yuncheng, Shanxi Province). In 308 BC, the two kings met again at Yingcheng (modern-day part of Xiaogan, Hubei) to plan an attack on Han. In 306 BC, after the death of King Wu of Qin, the alliance with Qin broke down, and Qin invaded, attacking and occupying the city of Puban. Qin chancellor Gan Mao defected to Wei and the invading forces were withdrawn. In 303 BC, Qin took advantage of Wei's alliance with Qi and Han against Chu to launch a second invasion. In 302 BC, relations between Wei and Qin normalized, and King Xiang met King Zhaoxiang of Qin and Han Ying (crown prince of Han) at Linjin, in which Qin agreed to return Puban. This allowed alliance of Wei, Han and Qi in inflict a major defeat on Chu in 301 BC.

The UK government has set a target for reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions and recognises that achieving its target will require emissions from road transport, which are significant, to be cut. Organization The LowCVP is a public-private membership organisation which operates by bringing significant stakeholders together to provide broad-based expert commentary on the issues, to stimulate promising initiatives, and to encourage lower carbon vehicle and fuel technologies and businesses. Membership is open to organisations with a stake in the UK's move to low carbon vehicles and fuels who agree with its principles and commitments; some 200 organisations were members in 2015 drawn from industry, academic institutions, consumer groups and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This diversity of stakeholders holding a common interest in low carbon vehicles and fuels, and willing to work together to tackle current issues, is a distinguishing feature of the LowCVP and one of the reasons that it receives UK government funding. LowCVP has a Board of Directors, a Members' Council and a Secretariat.

One of the top figures of the young generation of the contemporary Hungarian jazz scene, his performance style bridges styles, is improvisation-centred, ‚Äúsoaring‚Äù and filled with spirituality.  Career  Viktor T√≥th began his musical studies at the age of 14. A defining musical experience was meeting √Åkos Moln√°r, saxophonist, at the point when he chose music over the path of an architect. Around this time American big band jazz had a strong influence on him. Later he moved towards combo formations and the style and music of Charlie Parker and John Coltrane had an important impact on him. At the end of the 90s he was a member of several Hungarian formations. In 1998 he was accepted into the Jazz department of the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music from where he graduated with outstanding results in 2003. During this period he formed his first trio with Zolt√°n Ol√°h and Andr√°s Mohay, then his first quartet formation with G√°bor Cseke, M√°ty√°s Szandai and the afore-mentioned Andr√°s Mohay. In the period that followed he performed in concerts with Imre K≈ëszegi, Gyula Babos, Attila L√°szl√≥, B√©la Szakcsi Lakatos, Mih√°ly Dresch, Tam√°s Berki, K√°lm√°n Ol√°h, Ferenc Kov√°cs, and with artists from the international jazz scene William Parker, Henry Franklin, Leena Conquest, Peter Finch, Arnie Somogyi, Winston Clifford, Tim Giles, Gareth Williams, Piotr Wojtasik, John Betsch and Eric Allen. His first album, Tercett, was released in 2005. This was followed by Climbing With Mountains (2007) ‚Äì with Hamid Drake and M√°ty√°s Szandai ‚Äì through BMChttp://info.bmc.hu/index.php?node=artists&table;=ZENESZ&id;=1475&setlang;=en Budapest Music Center label and in the same year he was awarded the Jazz Musician of the Year in Hungary. Then he released Tartim (2009) with a similar line-up, followed by Popping Bopping (2011). In 2013 he founded his unusual formation trio T√≥th Viktor Arura Tri√≥, with Mikl√≥s Luk√°cs (cimbalom) and Gy√∂rgy Orb√°n (double bass). This unique trio released its first ballad album Szemed Kincse in 2014 and in 2015 was awarded Jazz Album of the Year by the jury of critics. He regularly plays as a member of various formations in Europe and the United States. He often performs in a trio with Hamid Drake, top jazz drummer who incorporates Afro-Cuban, Indian, and African percussion instruments and influence, and with double bassist M√°ty√°s Szandai. Throughout Europe he plays as a sideman for Piotr Wojtasik Polish trumpeter in his innovative contemporary quartet with John Betsch and Michal Baranski. He has performed at numerous festivals including in Italy, Germany and Great Britain with his new formation T√≥th Viktor & Masim Badavi Players in which permanent partners are the Belgian trumpeter Bart Maris. In his formation T√≥th Viktor Tercett, Gy√∂rgy Orb√°n plays the double bass and the outstanding young musician D√°vid Hodek plays the drums. He has participated in unusual projects too: he has composed music for theatre, and plays duets for contemporary dance. At the beginning of the 2000s his musical interest turned towards Bulgarian and other Balkan styles as well as oriental music. He also collects and processes folk music in eastern countries. These eastern folk influences are most strongly apparent in his saxophone quartet, Road Six Sax, established in the 1990s. Eastern musics and ornaments have a great influence on his jazz performance, too. His jazz hiphop project, Bird Food Market ‚ÄìD√°vid Szarvas beatbox, ‚Äì Gerg≈ë Kolta bass guitar, ‚Äì Viktor T√≥th alto saxophone, keyboard, loops ‚Äì, that with its fusion of bebop music and broken rhythms received great acclaim in the avant-garde hiphop clubs in Budapest.

The island, owned by the Penobscot Indian Nation, is archaeologically important, and has been designated Site 74.91 by the Maine Archaeological Survey. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 for its archaeological significance, which includes well- stratified evidence of human habitation dating back thousands of years. Description Gut Island is located in the Penobscot River, about from the Milford (east) bank of the river. It measures about , with a total surface area of . It is flat, not rising more than above the typical river level at any point. It has a rock outcrops at its northern end, and is sandy and graveled at the southern end. It is densely vegetated, with pine and maple trees, and thick underbrush. The island was probably formed by the accumulation of sediment and gravel downstream of the outcrops at its northern end. The archaeological importance of the island was identified in 1988, during a survey performed prior to relicensing of a downstream hydroelectric power facility, and it underwent excavation that same year by a team from the University of Maine. Finds were found as deep as , although the upper half of this depth is in many of the places surveyed to contain a mixture of prehistoric and historic artifacts, including ceramic pottery fragments, a stone tool, and evidence of a hearth. Deeper layers at the southern eod of the island yielded stone artifacts dating to the Middle and Late Archaic (c. 4000 BCE), including slate tools.

This is typically described as following the imposition of martial law in the United States after a major disaster or crisis. In some versions of the theory, only suspected dissidents will be imprisoned. In more extreme versions, large numbers of US citizens will be imprisoned for the purposes of extermination as a New World Order is established. The theory has existed since the late 1970s, but it has picked up greatly in popularity with the advent of the internet and social media platforms.  About FEMA  FEMA is a United States government agency tasked with the effective management of major emergencies within the country, including ensuring the continuity of government during a large-scale disaster such as a nuclear war. It provides federal relief to areas afflicted by natural disasters. The precursor agency to FEMA was the Federal Civil Defense Administration established by President Harry S Truman in 1950 pursuant to executive order #10186. FEMA was established in 1979 under executive order by President Jimmy Carter. It was established to coordinate the response to any major disaster that has occurs in the United States that overwhelms local and state authorities. In 2002, it was finally codified into law and made a component of the Department of Homeland Security. As well as providing large-scale emergency-management, FEMA is also the largest flood-insurer in the United States, mainly because most private insurance companies don't offer flood-insurance. Proponents of the conspiracy theory argue FEMA's mission is a cover up for real purpose ‚Äî to assume control of the United States following a major disaster or threat ‚Äî and that the organization is 'the executive arm of the coming police state'.  Variations  The theory in general states that once a disaster or threat of one comes into being, martial law will be declared and FEMA's emergency powers will come into operation, and it will effectively become the government. The Constitution will be suspended, and citizens will be moved into camps. In many versions, 'dissidents' (typically defined as constitutionalists/patriots etc...) will merely be imprisoned. Others have gone so far as to argue that they will be sent to these camps to be murdered. Extreme versions state that plans are in place to imprison and kill apolitical American citizens in camps as part of a 'population control' plot. In April 2014 Snopes posted a claim that FEMA was marking houses by political affiliation to round people up for these camps. In reality the bright, color coded stickers serve varying purposes for newspaper and mail delivery personnel. Although they do not mention FEMA specifically, the Oath Keepers list of 10 \\"Orders We Will Not Obey,\\" contains many of the fears shared by proponents of FEMA conspiracies. Proponents often play into racial fear, asserting that FEMA will use 'urban gangs' as auxiliaries to ensure order. FEMA conspiracies are often worked in larger conspiracy narratives about ushering in a 'New World Order', meaning a totalitarian global government. History One of the first known references to FEMA concentration camps comes from a newsletter issued by Posse Comitatus in 1982, with the warning that 'hardcore patriots' were to be detained in them. The prevalence of the conspiracy theory increased in line with the rise of the militia movement in the 1990s. The conspiracy was part of the rhetoric of the now largely disbanded Militia of Montana. The self-styled congressional analyst David Fletcher was their spokesman and brought it up in meetings, even pointing out \\"United Nations Reserves\\" that the government was building concentration camps for in the Northern Cascades. A supposed FEMA camp was featured in Linda Thompson's 1994 film America Under Siege (in reality, the 'FEMA camp' was an Amtrak repair facility). She accused the government of using \\"black helicopters\\" against patriots to prevent them from interfering with plans to establish a \\"New World Order\\". Following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the conspiracy theory was discussed by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Domestic Terrorism. The theory's inclusion in the plot of the 1998 X-Files movie showed its growing reach. Fears of FEMA declined in the early 2000s as foreign terrorists were perceived as the major threat but the late-2000s recession and the election of Barack Obama had renewed opposition among conservatives to the federal government. Obama's election also enabled the theory to reach more mainstream right-wing circles whereas it had previously been confined to the fringes. There was a resurgence in the militia movement and with it a resurgence of the FEMA camps conspiracy theory and a corresponding boom in the \\"prepper\\" economy. Emails from the magazine National Review have also promoted the theory. Congresswoman Michele Bachmann alluded to the theory while in office, as have other Republican Party politicians. In December 2011 Camille Marino of the hard-left animal liberation website Negotiation is Over posted an alert on her website titled \\"Military Now Recruiting Guards for FEMA Domestic Detainment/Internment Camps.\\" containing the usual warnings about the end of civil liberties and the announcement that the U.S. Army is looking for \\"a Few Good Totalitarians\\" to herd dissenters into camps. In 2015, fears of the FEMA roundup beginning surfaced with the announcement of a domestic military training operation called Jade Helm 15. County and state officials in Texas denounced the fears and the exercise was completed with no one being placed into an internment camp. Also in 2015 additional speculation about the theory was stoked by retired general Wesley Clark when he called for World War II-style internment camps to be revived to combat Muslim extremism. He stated, \\"If these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine, that's their right. It‚Äôs our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.\\" With the end of Obama's presidency and the 2016 election approaching conspiracy theories (including the FEMA death camp idea) were heavily promoted by many on the right, from Alex Jones to Donald Trump. According to the Las Vegas Police Department and witnesses in the weeks leading up to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting gunman Stephen Paddock reportedly espoused right-wing anti-government and conspiratorial views, including FEMA conspiracies. He reportedly told a friend that \\"sometimes, sacrifices have to be made\\" in order to encourage the American public to arm themselves.  Evidence  Popular Mechanics has published a debunking of some of the various claims proponents of the theory make and FOX News personality Glenn Beck did a 2009 interview with James Meigs, editor-in-chief there, where he walked through a debunking of one purported camp. \\"This video,\\" Meigs said, \\"actually dates from about 1995. But like so many of these conspiracy theories, it gets re-cut and re-edited and circulated around the Internet.\\" Bloggers at the Skeptic Project have posted detailed lists where they claim to debunk many of the FEMA camp locations in the U.S. elsewhere. Newsweek emailed FEMA to inquire about the FEMA camps rumors. Press Secretary Alexa Lopez replied, \\"We are currently focusing our efforts on providing assistance to disaster survivors, and the ongoing response and recovery efforts in Louisiana. As to your first question, over the years there have been many myths or rumors surrounding FEMA, and I am glad I have the chance to set the record straight with you. There is absolutely no truth to these rumors‚Äîthey are nothing more than conspiracy theories.\\" However, an internal FEMA memo shows the management understands the nature of trying to quell the conspiracies, \\"Most people know us as the agency that responds to natural disasters. Others believe we have a somewhat sinister role. For the latter, it is not realistic to think that we can convince them otherwise and it is advisable not to enter into debate on the subject.\\" Proponents have cited a contingency plan (Rex 84) drafted in part by U.S. Marine Colonel Oliver North calling for the suspension of the Constitution and the detainment of citizens in the event of a national crisis. This was aimed at left-wing activists, not the libertarians and right-wingers generally associated with FEMA theories. This has been linked to a 1970 document by Louis Giuffrida (years later, the director of FEMA) calling for the establishment of martial law in the event of an uprising by African American militants and the internment of millions of African Americans. Conspiracy theorists have used the actual internment of Japanese Americans during World War II in specifically constructed camps as evidence that such a scenario at least has historic precedent. Similarly, the forced removal of Native Americans from their lands is an earlier precedent.

He was one of the first realist engravers in Belgium.N. Hostyn, \\"LINNIG, Egide, marineschilder en scheepsportrettist\\", in Nationaal biografisch woordenboek, (1970), IX 481‚Äì486 Life Egide Linnig was born in Antwerp as the son of Pieter-Josef Linnig (born in Aschbach, Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany) and Catharina Josephina Leys. His father was a cabinetmaker. He had two older brothers (Jan Theodoor) Jozef Linnig and Willem Linnig the Elder who both became painters and engravers. River scene at dusk From 1834 Linnig studied at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts. Linnig was not happy with the emphasis placed on history painting by Mattheus Ignatius van Bree, the director of the Academy. Linnig was from the start more attracted to the marine genre and took advantage of van Bree‚Äôs death in 1839 to change his teacher to Jacques van Gingelen, a landscape painter and engraver. Linnig‚Äôs classmates and contemporaries during those years included Fran√ßois Lamorini√®re, Hendrik Frans Schaefels, Lucas Victor Schaefels, Louis van Kuyck, Karel Verlat and Henri Adolphe Schaep. During his studies at the Academy, Linnig made many works from life, particularly of the Scheldt river. While still enrolled at the Academy, Linnig participated in the Triennial Salon of Antwerp in 1840 exhibiting two marine paintings, Fishing for Herring on the Dogger Bank and Coast near Zierikzee.Linnig, Egide (1821‚Äì1860) Belgian marine painter, in: John J. Hattendorf (editor), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Maritime History, Oxford University Press, Print Publication Date: 2007, Published online: 2007 In 1842 Linnig decided to put an end to his academic studies. In the summer of the following year he joined the crew of fishing boats in order to study all ship maneuvers in detail. Linnig would in later years continue to take small sea trips for inspiration. One of the trips inspired him to the painting The brig 'Timor' shipwrecked off the English coast, which he exhibited at the Triennial Salon in Brussels in 1842. In 1844, the year of his marriage, Linnig and his brother Willem spent some time in The Hague. In the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, he studied the works of old and contemporary masters. Linnig later wrote that this trip to The Netherlands was decisive for the development of his conception of art and that this new conception was reflected in his composition Shipwreck on the English coast. He submitted this work to the 1845 Triennial Salon in Brussels. In 1847 Linnig sailed to Norway. In or shortly before 1848 he moved from Antwerp to St Willibrords. The three-master Constant off the coast of New Guinea'' Linnig presented four works at the Antwerp Salon of 1849. These were ordinary marines as well as ship portraits. From 1849 onwards Linnig regularly exhibited in Germany, where his marines met with success and were collected by several museum. In the late 1840s and early 1850s Linnig participated a total of three times in the \\"Exhibition of Living Masters\\" in the Netherlands with the following works: The wreckage of a Sardinian vessel (The Hague, 1847), Storm (Rotterdam, 1848) and The wintering of Barends and van Heemskerk on Nova Zembla. The last work was inspired by the poem of the Dutch poet Hendrik Tollens on the 16th century shipping disasters of Dutch ships near Novaya Zemlya (The Hague, 1851). From the 1850s onwards Linnig produced many marines. These were either general genre scenes or scenes depicting a named ship playing a principal role in the action. The latter were a form of combination between a ship portrait and general marine painting and were usually made on the commission of shipping companies and ship captains. An example of the latter category is The three-master Constant off the coast of New Guinea. It depicts the trading vessel the 'Constant' after it ran on a coral reef off the coast of a small island near New Guinea on 15 June 1858. It also shows how, after abandoning ship, the crew tries to go on land after the lifeboats sprang a leak.Egidius Linnig, The three-master 'Constant' off the coast of New Guinea at Christie‚Äôs Throughout the 1850s Linnig continued to make submissions to the Salons in Antwerp and Brussels. Linnig died in Sint Willibrords on 16 October 1860. The cause of death was pneumonia, which he had contracted after he missed his jump from a gig and had fallen into the water. Florent Crabeels was his pupil.Egidius Linnig at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work =General= Belgian merchant navy frigate Macassar The subject matter of Linnig's work is mainly marines, ship portraits and coastal landscapes. He also made some genre scenes. The Scheldt in Antwerp up to its estuary was one of his main sources of inspiration.Norbert Hostyn, Schilders van de zee at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen He also had an interest in depicting the Flemish coastal towns, as evidenced by his prints with coastal landscapes in Nieuwpoort and Wenduine.Norbert Hostyn, Vlaamse schilderkunst en de zee. Vlaamse schilderkunst in de achttiende en negentiende eeuw in: 'Vlaanderen'. Jaargang 49. Christelijk Vlaams Kunstenaarsverbond, Tielt 2000. P. 199-204 Linnig often signed and dated his work and occasionally drew the Masonic symbol of the square and compass alongside his signature as he was a Freemason. Linnig was an important representative of the Romantic-Realist movement in Belgian marine painting. This movement saw its heyday between 1830 and 1860. Linnig is a typical representative of this movement in the choice of his subject matter, which covers the usual romantic scenes such as storms, high seas and shipwrecks. He had a special preference for the 'extreme moments' of the day: sunrise and sunset, the start and end of the day, when the color contrasts are the most intense and the colors are striking. Other extreme moments which he treated regularly were skies at the time of a threatening storm with lightning and heavy cloud masses that create a contrast between the sunny foreground and the dark background scenery or vice versa. The Soho enters the Scheldt estuary near Flushing A good example of Linnig's Romantic pursuit of effects can be seen in The Soho enters the Scheldt estuary near Flushing (1843, Museum aan de Stroom), which is perhaps one of the most impressive paintings in his oeuvre. Linnig treats the subject in a particularly original manner by portraying the \\"Soho\\", a steamer of the London General Steam & Navigation Company, not as seen from its starboard or its port side as was customary, but rather in frontal view. As a result, the steamer is shown in extreme foreshortening and the bow of the ship gets the full attention. This special angle, combined with details such as the ship‚Äôs powerful radar unit, the rough sea, the stormy weather and the dilapidated guardhouse create an energetic and dynamic composition. Hunter on the ice Linnig's marine paintings are always well balanced and pay particular attention to topographical accuracy. His work provides an important testimony on the history of seafaring since he worked during the pivotal period that marked the transition from sailing ships to steamships. His works are also important documents on the shipping activities and wharves in and around Antwerp at the time.Jan Blomme, Momentum: Antwerp's port in the 19th and 20th century, Pandora, 2002, p. 132 =Graphic work= Linnig trained early on as an etcher and was one of the first to practise this art as an autonomous genre.James Ensor, Norbert Hostyn, Patrick Florizoone, Art graphique d'Ensor en confrontation: Mus√©e des beaux arts d'Ostende, 19 septembre 1999-13 f√©vrier 2000, √âditions Snoeck-Ducaju, 1999 He is regarded as one of the first realistic engravers in Belgium. His etchings, while technically finished, preserve a character of free and swift execution. The subject matter of his graphic work included marines and ship portraits as in his painterly oeuvre and extended beyond this to coastal landscapes, topographical views of harbours and city scenes as well as genre scenes with people such as fishermen and women busy on the beach, in ports or on markets. He also engraved a portrait of himself in the year before he died, which shows the bearded artist with hollowed out cheeks. Linnig's drawings were used by other engravers as the design of engravings and lithographs.Zicht op de twee dokken te Antwerpen at the University of Antwerp Vlaanderen References The paddle steamer Cygnus External links * Category:Belgian marine painters Category:Belgian printmakers Category:People from Antwerp Category:19th-century Belgian painters Category:19th-century printmakers Category:1821 births Category:1860 deaths ","title":"Egide Linnig"},{"id":"48312994","text":"In statistics, kernel-independent component analysis (kernel ICA) is an efficient algorithm for independent component analysis which estimates source components by optimizing a generalized variance contrast function, which is based on representations in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Those contrast functions use the notion of mutual information as a measure of statistical independence. Main idea Kernel ICA is based on the idea that correlations between two random variables can be represented in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), denoted by \\\\mathcal{F}, associated with a feature map L_x: \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbb{R} defined for a fixed x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. The \\\\mathcal{F}-correlation between two random variables X and Y is defined as : \\\\rho_{\\\\mathcal{F}}(X,Y) = \\\\max_{f, g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}} \\\\operatorname{corr}( \\\\langle L_X,f \\\\rangle, \\\\langle L_Y,g \\\\rangle) where the functions f,g: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} range over \\\\mathcal{F} and : \\\\operatorname{corr}( \\\\langle L_X,f \\\\rangle, \\\\langle L_Y,g \\\\rangle) := \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(f(X), g(Y)) }{\\\\operatorname{var}(f(X))^{1/2} \\\\operatorname{var}(g(Y))^{1/2} } for fixed f,g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}. Note that the reproducing property implies that f(x) = \\\\langle L_x, f \\\\rangle for fixed x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} and f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}. It follows then that the \\\\mathcal{F}-correlation between two independent random variables is zero. This notion of \\\\mathcal{F}-correlations is used for defining contrast functions that are optimized in the Kernel ICA algorithm. Specifically, if \\\\mathbf{X} := (x_{ij}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times m} is a prewhitened data matrix, that is, the sample mean of each column is zero and the sample covariance of the rows is the m \\\\times m dimensional identity matrix, Kernel ICA estimates a m \\\\times m dimensional orthogonal matrix \\\\mathbf{A} so as to minimize finite-sample \\\\mathcal{F}-correlations between the columns of \\\\mathbf{S} := \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\prime}.

Lewis et al.) was an American con artist and self-styled physician who operated in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago. He produced a patent medicine treatment known as \\"oxygenized air\\", which he promoted as a cure for catarrh, scrofula, consumption, and diseases of the respiratory tract.  Career  Charles Lewis Blood was born 1835 in Groton, Massachusetts; he claimed to be the son of Dr. Louis Blood, a physician, though this was correctly believed at the time to be a fabrication. His father was actually Lewis Blood (1805‚Äì1887), a successful farmer, timber dealer, contractor and prominent citizen in Ayer (formerly Groton Junction), Massachusetts. His medical credentials were likewise in question‚Äîthough he styled himself \\"Dr. C. L. Blood\\" or \\"C. L. Blood, M.D.\\" and authored a book on medicine, he was widely supposed to be a con artist with no legitimate claim to any medical degree. His notoriety was said to be national, albeit distributed among a variety of aliases. Around 1865, Blood moved from Philadelphia to Boston, where he established an office in the old Congregational Library building at 12 Chauncy Street. He began promoting his medical services via full-page newspaper advertisements, as well as advertising sheets which he distributed to the surrounding country. Around this time he also developed an interest in Gardner Quincy Colton's use of \\"laughing gas\\", or nitrous oxide. Blood learned the manner of its manufacture and thereafter claimed the invention as his own, rebranding it as \\"oxygenized air\\" and touting it as a cure for diseases of the throat and lungs. Office and residence of C. L. Blood at 27 Bond Street, New York City Blood's business flourished, which enabled him to move into better quarters at 119 Harrison Avenue. He extensively advertised his ability to cure all diseases of the blood and lungs by means of his \\"air\\", which he administered at his practice. A page would answer the calls of visitors at his door and usher them into elegantly furnished reception areas to await the appearance of Blood from his consultation room. Blood employed numerous shills to maintain the appearance of doing an immense business, which artifice he used to lure investors. To these he offered contracts securing the exclusive right to resell his \\"air\\" in various states and territories. Blood left Boston some time after 1867, shifting his activities to various cities in the Northeast and Midwest. He was known to maintain practices in New York City around 1875, in Chicago from 1875 to 1876, in Philadelphia in 1883, and again in Boston in the late 1880s. He died aged 73 in Manhattan on September 27, 1908, after an illness lasting eleven weeks. In a short obituary in his hometown Ayer, Massachusetts newspaper, it was reported that Blood \\"had lived in New York city twelve years, where he was in a manufacturing business.\\" His remains were transported to Ayer where he was buried in the family plot in Woodlawn Cemetery on October 1, a funeral having taken place the day before in the Lewis Blood house in Washington Street. Perhaps in view of the shame brought upon the Bloods by Charles' sordid past, his widow and four surviving sisters chose not to add his name to the family memorial.  Criminal activities and allegations  = Blackmail = While in Boston, Blood gained a rival in the person of a certain Dr. Jerome Harris, who also applied nitrous oxide but under the name of \\"super-oxygenized air\\". Unlike Blood, Harris was a trained physician, albeit one who traded on Blood's popularity by operating his practice from Blood's old quarters on Chauncy Lane. One day in the winter of 1866‚Äì67, Harris was visited by a Mr. Carvill of Lewiston, Maine who had a bronchial complaint and specifically requested Harris's \\"super-oxygenized air\\" treatment. The air was administered, and in a moment Carvill began frothing at the mouth and rolling on the floor, apparently in a fit, his contortions lasting about an hour. Finally Harris sent his patient home, whereupon the latter called for the services of his own physician, who turned out to be Blood. The next day the newspapers described Harris's supposed \\"poisoning\\" of Carvill by the administering of \\"super-oxygenized air\\", and the subsequent relief afforded the patient by Blood. Blood saw to it that the public were kept apprised of the supposedly continual improvement of the patient under his care, and reassured of the efficacy and harmlessness of his own \\"oxygenized air\\". Carvill subsequently brought suit against Harris, which served to maintain the media publicity against Harris's rival treatment. Though Harris was anxious to settle with Carvill, his legal counsel advised him not to pay, claiming it was a blackmail scheme. The case finally fell through, but Harris was frightened and left the city, after which Blood's business prospered. In May 1884, Blood was brought into the public eye again in Boston by reason of his arrest for blackmailing Ernest Weber, a local musician. The previous month, Blood had begun courting a woman by the name of Jennett Nickerson. He procured from her, allegedly by force, an affidavit to the effect that she had been ruined under promise of marriage by Weber, and that Weber had furthermore employed a physician to perform an abortion which had nearly cost her her life. A confederate of Blood exhibited the affidavit, together with correspondence between Weber and Nickerson, in a lawyer's office in the presence of Weber. Weber was threatened with criminal prosecution unless he paid $4000. Weber consulted with the police, who arrested Blood and his confederate; after a sensational trial both men were convicted of blackmailing and sentenced to several years in prison. = Tax evasion = Some time after his involvement with Dr. Harris, Blood got into trouble with the federal government for failure to properly stamp his patent medicines. Soon thereafter he disappeared from Boston, his last appearance being made in the custody of two deputy U.S. marshals. He reappeared some time later in Philadelphia, having somehow extricated himself from the situation. = Fraud and misdemeanors = During his first residence in Boston, Blood succeeded in conning Humphrey Cummings, an experienced businessman from Wellesley, Massachusetts, into providing him with $4500 in capital. The dividends Cummings received from the partnership were no more tangible or valuable than the atmospheric air Blood was peddling, and after a short time he demanded that Blood return the money he had advanced. Cummings was never repaid, and about a year later he died, broken down by the loss of his fortune. In 1880, Blood published A Century of Life, Health and Happiness, a compendium of medical information for the home. In January 1883, an investor by the name of Charles Baker alleged that Blood had defrauded him of $210 when the author failed to provide sundry copies of his book. A warrant was issued for Blood's arrest, who at the time was already wanted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for various misdemeanors. Blood was captured in Philadelphia and turned over to the Massachusetts State Police on a charge of defrauding by false pretences. = Murder of Hiram Sawtelle = In February 1890, Blood was implicated in the murder of Hiram Sawtelle, a Boston fruitseller. Isaac Sawtelle, Hiram's brother, had recently been released from prison after securing, at great expense, a pardon for his rape convictions. The destitute Isaac moved in with Hiram and their mother, and soon entered into a dispute with them concerning the estate left by his deceased father. Isaac was desperate to gain control of the property, which was held in his mother's name but managed by Hiram. According to Isaac, Blood, whom he had met in prison, offered to engineer Hiram's cooperation for a fee of $500. A third man, another former convict by the name of Jack, was then brought into the plan. Isaac abducted Hiram's daughter Marion and then used her to lure Hiram to a secluded camp near Springvale, Maine. There it was planned that Blood and Jack would force him to sign over the property. For whatever reason, the enterprise did not go according to plan. Hiram was shot four times, undressed, decapitated, and partly dismembered. The headless body was buried in a shallow grave just across the state line in New Hampshire. On discovering her husband's disappearance, Hiram's wife reported to the police her suspicion that he had been murdered by Isaac. A search was organized, and Hiram's body was discovered by investigators some ten days after the crime. Isaac had left Boston but was eventually captured in Rochester, New Hampshire. When he was arrested he had in his possession two train tickets to Montreal; it was speculated that the second ticket was for Blood. Blood's picture was circulated in the Boston newspapers, where it was recognized by two hoteliers from Dover, New Hampshire, whom Blood had approached for accommodation around the time of the murder. One of the hoteliers reported that Blood had been carrying two bundles, one done up in wrapping paper and apparently containing clothes, and the other wrapped in newspaper and \\"about the size of a man's head\\". By April 1890, Isaac Sawtelle had been charged with conspiracy and with the murder of Hiram, and was awaiting trial. On April 13, he released a confession through his attorney, admitting that he had plotted to intimidate Hiram into signing over the property but denying that he planned or had any part in the murder. Isaac instead held that he rendezvoused with Hiram at the appointed camp, where they were met by Jack as planned. Jack then led Hiram away on the pretence of taking him to Marion, while Isaac remained behind. Isaac claimed to have had no inkling that his brother had been murdered until the morning of his arrest, when he received a letter from Blood that read, \\"Your brother had to be put out of the way. Let each look out for himself.\\" Isaac later asserted that Blood had owed Hiram a considerable sum of money, implying that Blood had dispatched Hiram to escape the debt. Despite Isaac's jailhouse confessions and the hoteliers' statements, Blood was never questioned by police. Hiram's widow denied that Blood had any dealings with Hiram, though she did aver that he was a frequent guest of Isaac. At trial, Isaac changed his story, confessing that he had shot Hiram himself and demoting Blood's role in the conspiracy to preparation of the legal instruments for Hiram to sign. Isaac was convicted and sentenced to death, after which he recanted his previous confession and once again laid full responsibility for the murder on Blood: :Dr. Blood is the man who is responsible. Some time it will be known, a deathbed repentance, perhaps, and when all is known it will be found that I am innocent of anything to do with the murder. I have accused him; I accuse him now. If he had come forward I would have accused him to his face. But why didn't he appear? He didn't dare to; he didn't dare to face me. Now that I am practically dead he can do what he pleases. He has had a chance to establish and prove an alibi, while I have been in jail, tied hand and foot‚Ä¶ Blood was responsible in every way. I do not mean to say that he killed Hiram‚Äîthat he fired the shots which caused his death‚Äîbut I do mean that he knew of it and was responsible for it. Isaac Sawtelle died of natural causes on December 26, 1891, shortly before his scheduled execution.  Personality and appearance  Visiting card of C. L. Blood Contemporary reports describe Blood as being about tall, well built, and erect in carriage. He was said to be handsome, with a fresh, fair complexion and small, sparkling black eyes; he looked much younger than he claimed to be. He sported a full mane of brown or black hair, which he wore curled. His personality was described as vain but affable; he was known as a finely dressed masher who handed out visiting cards bearing his photograph. When not engaged in his office he would often be found loitering on the streetcorner below.  Cultural references  A fictionalized version of Blood appears as an important supporting character the 1991 role-playing video game Ultima: Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams. The game's manual describes him as \\"a concerned and able doctor\\" who was nonetheless \\"reviled by the medical establishment of the 1870s for espousing the curative powers of his creation\\". Blood accompanies the protagonist and his fellow adventurers on a rescue mission to Mars and, throughout the game, competently heals their injuries, radiation poisoning, and hypoxia, sometimes with the aid of his oxygenized air.

Taxonomy  Cyathophorum bulbosum was first described by Johann Hedwig, a German botanist in 1801 in the publication ‚ÄòSpecies Muscorum Frondosorum‚Äô. In 1851 it was then re described by Johann Karl M√ºller and given the current name. It belongs in the family Hypopterygiaceae along with other genus such as Hypopterygium (umbrella moss) and Lopidium. Members of this family are characterized by having flattened shoots and leaves in three rows, which is similar to many leafy liverworts.  Description  Cyathophorum bulbosum is often mistaken for a small fern due to its appearance. The stem can grow up to 20 cm, although is generally found around the 5‚Äì15 cm range, with the longer specimens found in Tasmania and Victoria. Stems are generally single shoots with distichous (evenly paired) and complanate (flattened) leaf arrangement, although it is not uncommon to find the occasional forked stem. They grow in an almost horizontal angle, forming beautiful overlapping clumps. They also have a smaller, rounder row of leaves on the underside, however this can also trick some people into thinking it is a leafy liverwort. Upon closer inspection of the leaves with a hand lens, there will be a short costa (mid vein), which immediately rules out liverworts. Sporophytes are born on the underside of the plant, running evenly down the stem. The capsules are subglobose to ellipsoidal in shape with a fleshy, pale to dark brown calyptra. They are borne on a very short setae (stalk). The operculum is long-rostrate, which means it has an apical beak narrowing to a slender tip. Cyathophorum bulbosum is dioicous, meaning that male and females are separate ‚Äòplants‚Äô.The life cycle is dominated by the gametophyte stage. There are no other species within Australia that look similar.  Distribution and habitat  Cyathophorum bulbosum is found growing on soil, rocks, the bases of trees, rotting logs and the trunks of tree ferns. It prefers a moist and shaded site, generally close to streams or continuous water sources. Common in temperate rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest. It is the only species of Cyathophorum present in Australia.

Plot Dan Fuller, a big game hunter, is forced to kill his pet gorilla when it attempts to rape his new bride Laura. The woman starts to experience strange urgings following the encounter, and submits to hypnosis under the care of a psychiatrist. She reveals to her shocked husband that she was actually a gorilla in a previous life. Slowly she reverts to her former bestial self, and winds up eloping into the jungle with a male ape, with her cuckolded husband staring helplessly after them.

Being African American and trying to become an architect in a White-dominated profession, especially in the 1800s-1900s was difficult. Racism towards African Americans was prevalent in the 1800s-1900s and this was amplified by the addition and enforcement of Jim Crow laws. Jim Crow Laws enforced segregation of White and Blacks, therefore promoting direct racism. Many African American architects working during and after this time period faced obstacles due to overt racism perpetuated by the society and culture of the United States. The Directory of African American Architects https://blackarch.uc.edu/ maintains an ongoing list of licensed African American architects. On October 24, 2019 there was 2,300 people listed including 467 women. African American architects represent about 2% of all licensed architects (113,000) and African American women represent approximately 0.3%. There are several organizations and initiatives focused on increasing representation including the National Organization of Minority Architects,https://noma.net Riding the Vortex,https://www.nowwhat- architexx.org/articles/2018/5/25/riding-the-vortex 400 FORWARD,https://www.tiffanybrowndetroit.com/ Hip Hop Architecture,http://hiphoparchitecture.com/ The First 500 Project,https://entrearchitect.com/2018/06/05/first-500-project-transcript/ Beyond the Built https://www.beyondthebuilt.com/pascale-sablan and many others.  African American Men Architects of the 19th and 20th Centuries  Some architects like Julian Francis Abele, and Paul Revere Williams were able to obtain an architectural degree from top universities, an architectural license, and positions at top architectural firms. However, clients were often opposed to having their projects overseen by an African American architect. This resulted in many African American architects working on a design for a project, but losing credit for their work. Both African American men and women dealt with similar issues regarding race. However, African American women in the mid-1800 to 1900s had to deal with discrimination based on sex as well. = Julian Francis Abele = Julian Francis Abele graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's graduate school of fine art, where he studied architecture. Abele was the main designer of Duke University's west campus. Abele also helped design the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Abele received credit for his contribution to Duke in documents, but it was not made public at the time that he played a significant role. = Paul Revere Williams = Paul Revere Williams was raised in the Los Angeles area where he attended school. After Graduating from high school, Williams attended the Los Angeles School of Art and eventually studied at USC. Williams then worked for established firms ran by Wilbert D. Cook Jr. and George D. Hall. Williams received his architecture license from the state of California, and was the first black person to join the AIA (American Institute of Architects) and the first black person to become a fellow of the AIA. Williams was also a member of the Los Angeles Planning Commission in 1920, the California Housing Commission in 1947, the National Monument Commission in 1929, and the National Housing Commission in 1953. Williams designed residential buildings as well as churches, schools, and other commercial buildings.  African American Women Architects of the 19th and 20th Centuries  The first African American women architects, such as Norma Merrick Sklarek and Beverly Loraine Greene, were faced with many challenges as they completed their journey of becoming architects. For years prior, the architecture industry was dominated by white men. In the 1900s, it was difficult for an African American man to receive a fair chance to become employed at a firm because of racism. On top of this, women were fighting for equal rights. Women architects not only had to overcome many setbacks due to their race but also due to their gender. Some common setbacks faced by Sklarek included being denied entry into the world of architecture, and not receiving recognition for their work. African American women had to work extremely hard just to have the chance to be educated in the field. As Sklarek demonstrated throughout her career, it was possible for African American women to excel in the architectural world, but the numbers of women within the field were low, and seem to have remained low from the time Sklarek was actively working to more recent years. = Norma Merrick Sklarek = Norma Merrick Sklarek was the first black woman architect in the state of California. She graduated from Columbia and worked for the architecture firms: SOM and Gruen and Associates. She also was the first black woman to join the AIA (American Institute of Architects). Sklarek collaborated with Cesar Pelli on projects that include the Pacific Design Center and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. = Beverly Loraine Greene = Beverly Loraine Greene was the first black woman to become a licensed architect in the US. She was based out of Illinois, and started her practice in Chicago. She struggled to be noticed because of her race. Greene went on to work on international projects such as UNESCO headquarters in Paris, and designed buildings for NYU.  African American Architects of the 21st Century  Although the culture and society in the United States have improved from the 19th and 20th centuries, African American architects and other people of color who desire to become an architect continue to deal with a lack of diversity in the field. The National Council of Architectural Registration Boards estimates that, at the end of 2013 there were 105,847 licensed architects in the United States.NCARB's 2013 Survey of Registered Architects , National Council of Architectural Registration Boards, 2013-12-30. Accessed 2015-11-08. Of these, 2,006, or about 2%, are self- identified as African American, and listed in the Directory of African American Architects; only 343 of these are African American women.The Directory of African American Architects states as of November 8, 2015, that their database lists 2,006 current licensed African American architects, and gives a breakdown of 1,633 men and 343 women.

The castle includes the 11th-century church of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (Chiesa dei Santi Maurizio e Lazzaro), associated with the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. The castle is occupied by the people of the frazione of Castello in the comune of Lierna. It is the northwesternmost of the eleven frazioni of Lierna comune.

Biography Catherine Blaikley was born around 1695 to William and Martha Kaidyee, in York County, Virginia. She was the couple's only daughter and had two brothers. Catherine married her husband William Blaikley, a merchant and watchmaker, on September 11, 1718. The Blaikleys' had at least five children together, two of which were boys who died at a young age. The family resided in what is now known as Catherine Blaikley House on Duke of Gloucester Street in Williamsburg, Virginia. Later, an inventory of the estate would reveal that the family enjoyed a comfortable living with luxuries such as silver spoons and slaves. William Blaikley died in May 1736, leaving Catherine a widow for 35 years. Upon her husband's death, Catherine Blaikley inherited all of his property which included 50 acres of land in Henrico County, a mill in Brunswick, and the family homestead. Economic opportunities for women were limited during this time period, but midwifery was considered to be an appropriate occupation, as was offering lodging, which Blaikley also did. Financial records indicate that Blaikley was able to maintain her standard of living. An advertisement she placed looking for her red Moracco pocketbook, suggested she had possession of paper money and access to drugs. Blaikley died in October 1771 and was buried in the cemetery at Bruton Parish Church. An obituary ran in one of the newspapers of the day and described her as an \\"eminent midwife.\\" In the 1950s Colonial Williamsburg restored Blaikley's home and is now a historical tourist site.  Career history  It is unknown exactly when Blaikley began working as a midwife but historian Linda Sturz has stated that it was likely around three years after the death of her husband. Midwifery, or the care of women before, during, and after birth, was a common and respectable occupation during this time and was often a full-time job. This was one of the few medically related careers that was not discriminatory against women worldwide. However, women were expected to call upon a physician should severe complications arise. In America, before the revolution and medical schools were in place, there were no restrictions on women to practice medicine, so it is likely Blaikley dealt with these issues on her own. Blaikley was reported to have delivered upwards of three thousand children, presumably both free and enslaved. Blaikley supplemented her income by lodging politicians, businessmen, and other important figures traveling through Virginia's capital.

Magazines published by Music Maker have included Music Technology (later MT and The Mix), Guitarist, Guitar Techniques, Bassist, Rhythm, Home & Studio Recording, Home Keyboard Review (later Keyboard Review), and Hip Hop Connection. Andrew Brel, who formed Bridge Recordings in 1989, promoted the distribution of Bridge albums through his association with Music Maker and its chairman, Terry Day. This enabled numerous successful promotions though the wide circulation of the magazine, Guitarist. In 1997 Terry Day and Dennis Hill sold Music Maker Publications, Ltd. in the UK to Future Publishing. With the acquisition of NewBay Media (which bought former Miller Freeman Music assets from United Business Media in 2006) by Future plc, the U.S. and the U.K. rights to Rhythm were reunited.  U.S. operations  In the late 1980s, it began publishing separate U.S. editions of three titles, \\"sharing about 25 percent of their content with their British counterparts\\". In the 1990s, the company faced some marketing difficulties brought on by \\"stiff competition from its rivals in the United States (and a general down turn in the synthesizer market)\\", and consequently \\"was forced to allow its U.S. edition of Music Technology to suspend independent operations and be absorbed by its more successful U.S. publication, Home & Studio Recording\\". In the fall of 1990, Music Maker entered into an agreement with Miller Freeman, Inc., under which the latter \\"would take over the publication of Rhythm (U.S.), while continuing to share some of its editorial content with the U.K. edition\\". Hip Hop Connection was later sold to Future plc, in Bath.\\"Hip-hop and it don't stop: What does the future hold for Hip-Hop Connection?\\", The Independent, (7 September 2008). In 1992, Tom Hawley was elected President of the corporation and soon moved the offices back to a facility in Canoga Park, just 2 blocks from the original offices. In December 1992, Lorenz Rychner joined the editorial staff of Home & Studio Recording, bringing with him a lifetime of experience as a recording musician, author and teacher (at the esteemed Grove School of Music). Responding to a growing need within the pro audio industry, Music Maker Publications launched a Spanish language edition of Home & Studio Recording in 1993. Broadening its editorial scope, the magazine was later re-titled as M√∫sico Pro in 1996. On 17 January 1994 the Northridge earthquake devastated the offices of Music Maker Publications. Overcoming the destruction and piecing the office back together from the wreckage, the employees of MMP persevered and didn‚Äôt miss a single issue‚Äîa true testimony to the dedication and determination of the company‚Äôs employees. Beginning with the July 1994 issue the ‚ÄúHome & Studio‚Äù was dropped from the magazine‚Äôs title. Recording soon garnered a new level of respect and prominence in the pro-audio industry. In February 1996 Brent Heintz was elected to the office of Vice President and promoted to the position of Associate Publisher. Dr. Mike Metlay joined the editorial team in April 1996 and continues to provide a wealth of talent as recording musician, writer, editor, administrator and glue. In May 1996 Music Maker Publications relocated its offices to Boulder, Colorado. The move was prompted by the 1994 earthquake and subsequent events in California that made the idea of greener pastures very appealing. Several locations were scouted and Boulder was selected for a number of reasons including the local music scene, the university and the lifestyle in general provided by the area. In May 1999 Brent Heintz was made a full partner in Music Maker Publications, Inc., and in September 2002 Tom Hawley and Brent Heintz became the sole owners of Music Maker Publications, Inc.

This was the first by-election of the 56th UK Parliament. The by- election was caused by the death of the sitting Member of Parliament (MP) Michael Meacher on 21 October 2015; Meacher had been the Labour Party MP for the seat since its creation in 1997 and had represented its predecessor seat of Oldham West since 1970. A writ for the by-election was moved in Parliament on 2 November 2015, setting polling day as 3 December 2015. Jim McMahon held the seat for Labour with a winning 62% of the vote, an increase of 7.3 percentage points. There was a 40.3% turnout. Candidates UKIP office for the Oldham By-election Six candidates contested the election; the statement of persons nominated was released by Oldham Council on 9 November 2015. The Labour Party, which last held the seat, selected its candidate on 5 November 2015 from a shortlist of four: Mohammed Azam, National Executive Committee member and former local councillor; Jane East, who contested the seat of Colne Valley unsuccessfully at the 2015 general election; Failsworth East councillor Jim McMahon, leader of Oldham Council; and Chris Williamson, former MP for Derby North. McMahon won the selection, reportedly with 232 votes against 141 for Azam in the final round, after the elimination of East and Williamson. UK Independence Party (UKIP) came second in the constituency at the 2015 general election and fielded a new candidate, John Bickley, who was runner-up at the by-election held in 2014 in the neighbouring constituency of Heywood and Middleton. Others talked about as potential candidates were Paul Nuttall, the UKIP deputy leader, and Steven Woolfe, both MEPs for North West England. The Conservative Party came a close third to UKIP at the 2015 general election and selected James Daly, a solicitor and Bury councillor, who contested the Bolton North East constituency in 2015. The Liberal Democrat candidate was Jane Brophy, who works for the NHS in Greater Manchester and has served as a Trafford councillor for over 15 years; she was LibDem candidate for Altrincham and Sale West at the 2010 and 2015 general elections. Simeon Hart stood for the Green Party, having contested the constituency for the Greens at the 2015 general election. Sir Oink A-Lot stood for the Official Monster Raving Loony Party. Results Aftermath The result was considered by commentators as surprisingly good for Labour, who had been expected to be more closely challenged by UKIP, and was reported as a boost for Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the party. On the morning after the by-election, UKIP leader Nigel Farage and some other party sources claimed that there had been voting fraud particularly around ethnic minority voters and around postal votes, with Farage claiming the vote was \\"bent\\" and that in constituencies with large numbers of ethnic minority voters who do not speak English \\"effectively the electoral process is now dead\\". Paul Nuttall, UKIP's deputy leader, said to journalists: \\"You've got to ask yourself, is this Britain or is this Harare?\\" However, others in UKIP downplayed the allegations, with deputy chairman Suzanne Evans saying the party risks sounding like \\"bad losers\\". Tom Watson, Labour's deputy leader, dismissed the complaints as \\"sour grapes\\". Farage stated that he was planning to make a formal complaint about the allegations. Deputy leader Paul Nuttall wrote an open letter to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government, raising concerns about postal voting processes.

Eustathios is only mentioned by the De Administrando Imperio, a work compiled in the middle of the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos. According to it, in approximately 909/910, he was protospatharios, asekretis, and ek prosopou of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme. Use of the title ek prosopou (\\"representative\\") is ambiguous in the sources, and modern scholars suggest that he was actually the military governor (strategos) of the Cibyrrhaeots, rather than the governor's deputy. He came into conflict with the katepano of the Mardaites, a certain Staurakios Platys. Although both were proteges of the powerful logothetes tou dromou, Himerios, Eustathios clashed with Staurakios over their jurisdiction, as the latter held his appointment directly from the emperor and was wont to disregard the instructions of the theoretically superior strategos. After remonstrances to Emperor Leo VI the Wise, Staurakios was recalled, and his authority transferred to Eustathios. As Eustathios remained in office until late 912, when he was replaced by Emperor Alexander with the protospatharios Niketas, he is most likely to be identified with the anonymous strategos of the Cibyrrhaeots who was responsible for the equipment of a fleet and crews in preparation for Himerios' great naval expedition in 911, directed against the Emirate of Crete or the coasts of Syria.

A native of Hillsborough, California, Krook pitched for the Oregon Ducks and was drafted by the Miami Marlins in the first round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft and the San Francisco Giants in the fourth round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft. Krook stands tall and weighs . High school career Krook was a highly decorated pitcher for St. Ignatius College Preparatory High School, where he played for coach Matt Stecher. In his senior year he went 2‚Äì1 with a 1.65 ERA. He was named a First Team All-American and All-Region by Perfect Game and was named to the All-State team by MaxPreps, and was considered one of the top ten prep pitchers for the 2013 draft. Krook was selected by the Marlins in the Competitive Balance Round of the 2013 draft with the 35th pick. Although he had originally intended to sign with the team, and the two sides had agreed upon a contract, a failed physical forced the Marlins to withdraw their offer. Krook then chose to honor his college commitment to the University of Oregon, where he would pitch for George Horton's Ducks. College career Even though Krook's freshman year was cut short due to injury, he was named a Louisville Slugger First-Team Freshman All-American. He pitched to a 2‚Äì1 record and a 1.79 ERA, with 60 strikeouts. Among his highlights that year were an 11-strikeout performance against Loyola Marymount and a quality start where he allowed only five hits in seven innings against Hawaii. Krook's season ended unexpectedly after he felt arm stiffness in a game against Washington State. He elected to undergo Tommy John surgery on April 22, with the procedure done by noted orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. Krook did not pitch his sophomore season, although he had expressed interest in playing in the 2015 NCAA Tournament and would have agreed to burn his redshirt had the Ducks made it past the Springfield (IL) Regional. He made his debut that summer for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod League. He pitched to an 0‚Äì1 record with a 6.35 ERA and 15 strikeouts in six starts. Professional career Krook was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the fourth round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft. Krook signed with the Giants, was assigned to the AZL Giants, and was later promoted to the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes. He posted a combined 1-4 record with a 5.53 ERA in 13 games (11 starts) between both teams. He spent 2017 with the San Jose Giants where he went 4-9 with a 5.12 ERA in 25 games (17 starts). On December 20, 2017, the Giants traded Krook, Christian Arroyo, Denard Span, and Stephen Woods to the Tampa Bay Rays for Evan Longoria and cash considerations. Krook spent the 2018 season with the Montgomery Biscuits, pitching to a 4-2 record with a 4.26 ERA in 37 games (six starts). He returned to Montgomery to begin 2019.https://www.draysbay.com/2019/4/14/18309282/rays-prospects-minor-leagues- april-14-2019-fox-josh-lowe References External links Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:People from Hillsborough, California Category:People from San Mateo, California Category:Baseball players from California Category:Baseball pitchers Category:Oregon Ducks baseball players Category:Wareham Gatemen players Category:Arizona League Giants players Category:Salem-Keizer Volcanoes players Category:San Jose Giants players Category:Montgomery Biscuits players Category:Peoria Javelinas players ","title":"Matt Krook"},{"id":"48313354","text":"Alfred Cleave Hammond ButtonNational Library of New Zealand was the Dean of Dunedin from 1945Crockford's Clerical Directory 1948 p190 London: OUP, 1948 until 1956.

Curran (born June 10, 1953) is an American organic chemist and a professor of chemistry at University of Pittsburgh known for his research in the fields of organic chemistry, radical chemistry, and fluorous chemistry. Career and personal life Curran received his BS degree from Boston College in 1975 and his PhD degree from the University of Rochester in 1979 working under the direction of Andrew S. Kende. After postdoctoral studies with Barry Trost at the University of Wisconsin, he joined the University of Pittsburgh Department of Chemistry as an Assistant Professor in 1981. He became Associate Professor in 1986, Full Professor in 1988, and Distinguished Service Professor in 1995. He became the first Bayer Professor of Chemistry in 1996 and since 2019 is the Covestro Professor of Chemistry. Chemistry runs in Curran's family. His father, Dr. William V. Curran (1929-2019), was a 60-year member of the American Chemical Society and the inventor of the third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic cefuzonam. His younger brother Kevin J. Curran has won the Technical Achievement Award of the American Chemical Society Division of Organic Chemistry (2007).ACS Division of Organic Chemistry Research areas = Radical chemistry = Curran is known for his pioneering work on organic radicals and radical cyclizations, especially directed towards organic synthesis. Prior to the 1980s, radicals were neglected because they were thought to be too reactive and too unselective for use in organic synthesis. Curran parlayed cascade reactions of radicals (also called tandem reactions or domino reactions) into powerful tools to make natural products. His 1985 total synthesis of hirsutene,Curran, D. P.; Rakiewicz, D. M., ‚ÄúTandem radical approach to linear condensed cyclopentanoids. Total synthesis of hirsutene‚Äù J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 1448-1449. doi 10.1021/ja00291a077Curran, D. P.; Rakiewicz, D. M., ‚ÄúRadical-initiated polyolefinic cyclizations in linear triquinane synthesis. Model studies and total synthesis of hirsutene‚Äù Tetrahedron 1985, 41, 3943-3958. doi 10.1016/S0040-4020(01)97175-3 the first of many such syntheses with cascade radical reactions, is today regarded as a classic.Nicolaou, K. C.; Sorenson, E. J., Classics in Total Synthesis, VCH: Weinheim, 1995; Ch 23, pp 381-420, ‚ÄúHirstutene and Capnellene‚Äù. Curran also revitalized atom transfer radical reactions. These reactions are also called Kharasch addition reactions (or sometimes Curran-Kharasch reactions). Morris S. Kharasch discovered and pioneered halogen atom transfer addition reactions in an initial flowering period in the late 1940s and 1950s. About 40 years later, Curran described fast new reactions involving iodine transfer, bromine transfer and functional group transfer, and encompassing radical addition (ATRA), cyclization (ATRC) and annulation. He introduced sunlamps as convenient tools for photo-initiation of ATRA and ATRC reactions.Curran, D. P., ‚ÄúIodine atom transfer reactions in organic synthesis‚Äù In Free Radicals in Synthesis and Biology, 1989; Vol. NATO ASI Series, vol. 260, pp 37-51. Curran is also a pioneer in stereoselective radical reactions and radical translocation reactions. Radical reactions are today regarded as powerful tools for synthesis of natural products and other organic molecules. Curran's work helped to expose many of the features that are now considered hallmarks of organic radical reactions. Synthetic economy is a primary attraction. Protecting groups and activating functional groups are often superfluous (atom economy). In addition, several bonds can be formed simultaneously (step/pot economy). Other features include reliability, predictability, selectivity, functional group tolerance and inertness to water and other protic solvents. A 1991 synthesis of the important anti-cancer agent camptothecin illustrates many of these features. The synthesis takes place over six steps centered on a cascade radical reaction that makes three bonds and two rings. There are no protecting groups, no functional group transformations, no reductions and only one oxidation.Curran, D. P.; Liu, H., New 4+1 radical annulations - a formal total synthesis of (+/-)-camptothecin. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 5863-5864. doi 10.1021/ja00040a060 = Fluorous Chemistry = Curran has also pioneered many aspects of the relatively young field of fluorous chemistry. Expanding on the initial 1995 concept of fluorous biphasic catalysis,Horv√°th, I. T.; R√°bai, J., ‚ÄúFacile catalyst separation without water: Fluorous biphase hydroformylation of olefins‚Äù Science 1994, 266, 72-75. doi 10.1126/science.266.5182.72 he introduced the concepts of fluorous tagging and fluorous synthesis in 1997 Studer, A.; Hadida, S.; Ferritto, R.; Kim, S.-Y.; Jeger, P.; Wipf, P.; Curran, D.

FMS is the first example of solution phase synthesis with separation tagging,Luo, Z. Y.; Zhang, Q. S.; Oderaotoshi, Y.; Curran, D. P., ‚ÄúFluorous mixture synthesis: A fluorous-tagging strategy for the synthesis and separation of mixtures of organic compounds‚Äù Science 2001, 291, 1766-1769. doi 10.1126/science.1057567 and it has been used to make many analogs and stereoisomers of complex natural products. The techniques of FMS allow 4‚Äì16 analogs or isomers to be made in a single synthesis. Curran also introduced fluorous solid phase extraction, a simple separation technique that enabled much subsequent work. The high resolution version of the technique, fluorous chromatography, is the basis of FMS. Service Curran has held various positions in the American Chemical Society (ACS) Division of Organic Chemistry hierarchy, culminating as Chair of the Division in 2000. He was an Associate Editor of Organic Reactions from 1991‚Äì2001 and Editor of Tetrahedron Letters from 1995‚Äì2001. He is a member of Organic Syntheses, Inc and edited Volume 83 in 2006.

But his step-mother and step sister, Ramla did not want him to marry Shiza. Ramla is jealous from her. Maira and Bilal married each other but from his family issues they did not accept Maira, and Maira did not produce child. She was also abused and left their house. Aapa and Amma found a girl, Zartashia and married her with Bilal. Soon they found that she was so badtameez and she also could not produce a child. They thought that now Bilal should divorce her. Shiza and Haris also married, Ramla stole the diamond ring and put it in her fingers. She also told her Aani about it. One day, the whole family was on dinner table, Haris caught the ring from Ramla's hands. She and Aani said that it is not Shiza's. Aani bought it for Ramla. Haris said that the design was the same. But they refused. So he and Shiza went on a vacation out of the country. At home Ramla and Aani were responsible for their children. Ramla did a trick and killed Shiza's daughter. Heartbroken Haris told the death of their daughter to Shiza and both returned to Pakistan. Zartashia found the report of Bilal and came to know that problem was in Bilal that she and Maira could not produce. Bilal found that Zartashia was in affair with someone else. He yelled at Zartashia and told that he knows the truth, Zartashia also said that Bilal was problemized and cannot have children. Aapa and Ammi found it and stare each other. Ammi and Bilal married Aapa to a person. But she was again divorced because he knew that Aapa's smallest sister was flirting with someone. Amma cried that she is so unlucky that her daughter cannot marry, son cannot have children, daughter's beti died and smallest was in flirt.

All Saints Whitstable There has been a church on the site for at least 800 years, initially consisting of a chancel and nave. In the early 13th century a new church was built in the same simple form, the early English style of Gothic Architecture, and a tower was added.The north aisle was added in the 15th century. In the 1870s when the fabric became unsafe the church was almost rebuilt with the chancel enlarged and a vestry added. In 1962 the design was competed by the adddition of a south aisle and west porch. The south wall of the nave was taken down and rebuilt to form the wall of the new aisle, still retaining the original stained glass windows. Arches and pillars were constructed to reflect those of the early 15th century on the north side of the nave.At the east end of the Nave Aisle there is a stone slab, from which the brass has been removed, in which the outline of a chalice is clearly visible, showing that it was the tomb of a priest. Only two other similar examples exist, both of them in north Kent. The tomb in unique in that it depicts the chalice only and no communion wafer. On the south wall is the oldest brass in the church, a memorial tablet to Thomas Brede, who died in 1444.

It is directed by Danny Roew and produced by The Asylum. The movie aired on SyFy on April 1, 2016 in the United States. Carter managed to get two of his bandmates, A. J. McLean and Howie Dorough to star in the movie. In addition, Carter also cast several members from other boy bands like 98 Degrees, O-Town, 'N Sync and All-4-One. A free copy of the theme song \\"In the End\\" was released on March 28, performed by band members Nick Carter, AJ McLean and Howie D.; Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick from NSYNC; Jeff Timmons from 98 Degrees; and Erik-Michael Estrada from O-Town. Plot After the zombie apocalypse occurs, mankind reverts to a simpler way of life reminiscent of the Old West. However, a woman named Apocalypta has decided to try and train zombies to use as her army to take over what is left of the world. After creating her army, which she calls Copperheads, she has her subordinates, Johnny Vermillion and Stamper, begin leading them to the town of Harper‚Äôs Junction. Some of the residents run or hide while others, such as Billy, begin to fight back. When Billy is almost killed by a Copperhead, he is saved by his girlfriend Daisy Jane. Daisy and Billy encounter Johnny and capture him but with the sheriff dead and the town overrun, they decide to take him with them as they head to Desert Springs. In Desert Springs, Mayor Shelby, who lost an eye to Apocalypta, and Sheriff Cooper question Johnny about why Apocalypta attacked Harper‚Äôs Junction, and when Johnny mocks them, Shelby tells Cooper to hang Johnny at sunrise. Meanwhile, Stamper tells Apocalypta about Johnny being captured and she orders him to go rescue Johnny. He does and they plan their escape but before he leaves, Johnny pays a visit to Georgie, a young boy that Cooper is raising. Hearing about Johnny‚Äôs escape, Shelby orders Cooper to assemble a group to head up and kill Johnny, Apocalypta, and all of the Copperheads they see. At a nearby saloon, a man named Whiskey Joe is playing cards and when the men accuse him of cheating and try to kill him, he knocks them all out and leaves, where Cooper approaches him to join his team. Whiskey Joe goes to recruit his friend Vaquero, who recommends they bring a ninja named Komodo with them. Meanwhile, Daisy goes to the post office to hire a ranger to find Billy‚Äôs brother Jack, hoping to get his help with Apocalypta but Billy is not happy about it. Whisky Joe, Vaquero, and Komodo meet up with Daisy, Billy, and Cooper, who explains the plan but the only person that can guide them through the valley near Apocalypta‚Äôs base is Jack and there has been no word from him. Cooper leaves to go check on Georgie and Komodo mentions a warrior priestess named Sirene that might help them, but says they won‚Äôt be able to find her, she will find them. Cooper reaches his house and finds the door open and when he hears a sound, he turns to find Georgie has been turned into a Copperhead. Billy and Daisy are arguing about Jack when they see a transformed Cooper approaching, leading an army of townspeople that have been transformed into Copperheads. Billy and Daisy warn the others as the bar they are at comes under attack and the group is forced to defend themselves. During the fight, Daisy is almost bitten by a Copperhead but is saved by Jack. After the fight, the mayor says he will give the group anything they want if they finish the mission and they all head off. They arrive at the mines at the base of the mountain and Billy wants to go around them but Jack says they need to search the place as a friend had a stash of ammo hidden there and they need to rearm themselves. The group split up to search the mine but soon come under attack by a horde of Copperheads pouring out of the mine. Jack is almost killed by a Copperhead but is saved by Sirene, who joins up with Jack, Billy, and Daisy as they leave, with Jack saying they will tell the others where to meet up but they are unaware that they are being watched by Stamper. At the mountain base, Johnny tells Apocalypta that Stamper mapped out a way through the mines and they can attack Desert Springs while the heroes make their way up the mountain. Joe, Vaquero, and Komodo try contacting the others but are unable to reach anyone and argue about what to do at first but after some Copperheads attack them, Joe decides to continue heading up the mountain. Jack and the others come across a truck containing some dead bodies and when Stamper shows up to attack them, he is killed by Sirene. Sirene leads them up the mountain and when they stop for the night, she tells them about where the Copperhead name came from, and how her grandmother taught her how to track and hunt. Komodo, Joe, and Vaquero reach a brothel that Trixie, a girl that Komodo likes, was heading for and decide to rest there. Jack and the others reach a corral that Apocalypta has her army of Copperheads held in and Sirene leads them up the mountain past it, saying to be careful of traps and Copperheads. Billy and Daisy argue over Billy‚Äôs not trusting Sirene but they are unaware that Johnny is watching them and he captures Billy when he falls behind the others. Back at the brothel, Joe manages to convince the owner Madame Jezebel to let them in and while Joe hooks up with one of the girls, Komodo finds Trixie and Jezebel leads Vaquero to the basement to get supplies but really tosses him to a Copperhead that is kept there. Vaquero is bit but manages to get away and warn the others but as Komodo, Trixie, and Joe escape, they turn to find Vaquero has changed and Joe is forced to shoot him. Back on the mountain, the others notice that Billy is missing but choose to keep going. When they reach the top, they find the place seemingly deserted and split up to find a way in. Daisy finds Billy trapped in a cage but before she can free him, Johnny shows up and stabs her before dragging her towards some Copperheads, and they proceed to turn her as a devastated Billy watches helplessly. Johnny tells Apocalypta that he has the heroes trapped and she unleashes her army to attack Desert Springs. Jack and Sirene show up and free Billy, then Jack is forced to kill Daisy, they then make their way through the mines after Johnny only to find themselves trapped by a horde of Copperheads. They manage to escape and trap the Copperheads in the mine and head back to try and save Desert Springs. In Desert Springs, Apocalypta and Johnny lead the Copperheads through the town, killing anyone that tries to stop them or escape. Jack, Billy, Sirene, Komodo, Trixie, and Joe try leading the Copperheads out of town but when Johnny attempts to shoot Sirene, Billy jumps in the way and is shot instead. He dies in Jack's arms. Komodo kills Johnny by decapitation, which enrages Apocalypta and she attacks Jack. Meanwhile, Joe, Komodo, and Trixie keep trying to lure the Copperheads out of town but Joe ends up getting bit and after he turns, he is blown up by a booby trap that he had prepared in case he was ever turned. Trixie is bit and when Komodo kisses her goodbye, she ends up biting him so Komodo kills her and then himself. Jack manages to kill Apocalypta and as he watches the Copperheads feed on her body, he is bit by a small child. Sirene kills the child then hands Jack his gun so he can kill himself. With Apocalypta dead, humanity has a chance to come back from the apocalypse while Sirene is shown to have given Jack a sky burial so his spirit can be reborn.

In the past he's made several independent short films and in 2014 he started an Indiegogo campaign to fund his first feature-length film titled Evil Blessings. Later that year however the director, Sxv'leithan Essex, died. This led Carter into scrapping the film and replaced it with Dead 7, initially titled Dead West. In 2015, he landed the support of The Asylum, the production company behind Sharknado and other SyFy productions. Filming began on August 20, 2015, in Anaconda, Montana at the 1880s ranch in the Valley just outside of town. They spent a week and a half filming at the ranch before going to Butte, Montana.https://dreadcentral.com/news/120711/first- images-from-dead-7-feature-the-backstreet-boys-in-the-wild-west/ Butte locations in the film include The Dumas Brothel and The World Mining Museum. While scouting location in Montana to include in the film, one of Fox's production assistants showed him a photo of Our Lady of The Rockies, a statue overlooking the city of Butte. Fox liked the image so much that the final scene was rewritten to include Our Lady of The Rockies. About 250 locals from in and around the Anaconda and Butte areas were used as zombie extras, and an additional 250 Montanans showing up to audition from other cities across the state. Production wrapped on September 8, 2015.

Writing center assessment builds on the larger theories of writing assessment methods and applications by focusing on how those processes can be applied to writing center contexts. In many cases, writing center assessment and any assessment of academic support structures in university settings builds on programmatic assessment principles as well. As a result, writing center assessment can be considered a branch of programmatic assessment, and the methods and approaches used here can be applied to a range of academic support structures, such as digital studio spaces.  History  While writing centers have been prominent features in university settings dating back to the 1970s in American higher education, questions remain about the role of the writing center in improving student writing ability. In discussing the lack of discussion about writing center assessment, Casey Jones compares writing centers to the group Alcoholics Anonymous, claiming that \\"both AA and writing labs have similar features\\" yet \\"the structure of AA complicates empirical research, the desired outcome, sobriety, can be clearly defined and measured. The clear-cut assessment of writing performance is a far more elusive task\\". Between 1985 and 1989 the Writing Lab Newsletter, a popular publication among writing center directors, lacked discussion of hard evaluation of writing centers, illustrating the early lack of discussion about assessment in the context of writing centers, instead focusing primarily on advice and how-to guides. In many cases, writing center directors or writing program administrators (WPAs) are responsible for assessing writing centers, and must communicate these results to academic administration and various stakeholders. Assessment is seen as beneficial for writing centers because it leads us to assume the professional and ethical behaviors important not just for writing centers but for all higher education.  Methods  One of the major sources of methods and approaches to writing center assessment comes from writing assessment at large, and programmatic assessment. James Bell argues that directors of writing centers should \\"turn to educational program evaluation and select general types of evaluations most appropriate for writing centers\\". Writing center assessment methods can largely be divided into two major forms of methods: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative methods are predicated on the desire to understand teaching and learning from the actions and perspectives of teachers and learners, and has largely dominated knowledge making in composition studies, particularly in the last twenty years. Quantitative methods, meanwhile, stem from the belief that the world works in predictable patterns, ones that might be isolated in terms of their causes and effects or the strengths of their relationships (i.e., correlation). The use of quantitative methods in writing center contexts leaves room for issues to arise, however, such as data being interpreted incorrectly to support the work of the writing center, or not choosing appropriate data to measure student success like ACT writing test scores or course grades in first-year composition courses. Some writing scholars endorse quantitative methods more thoroughly than others, and see them as most helpful when reframed in a postmodern epistemology since most writing center directors subscribe to a theory of epistemology that sees knowledge as constructed, tenuous, and relative. Writing center scholars such as Stephen North group these methodologies into three larger approaches: Reflections on Experience, or looking back of writing center events to help others out in similar situations; Speculation, or a theory of how writing centers should work; and Surveys, or what he champions as enumeration. Fitting into and blending these methods, several writing studies scholars have published articles on methods used in assessing different elements of writing centers which can be seen in the sections below. = Focus Groups = One method of assessment used in writing center contexts is focus groups. In writing centers, using this method allows writing center directors to collect responses to specific questions and to use the social dynamics of the group to allow for the participants to play off one another's answers, resulting in changes that can be implemented rapidly to make their organization or product more productive. For writing center assessment, focus groups should be about 7-12 people. = Surveys = Another common method of assessing writing centers is use of surveys, one of the most common quantitative methods used to gather data in writing centers. This fits into the notion of enumeration mentioned by North above. Surveys are commonly used to determine information such as student satisfaction with tutoring sessions in the form of a post-session survey, or the confidence of students as writers following their sessions in the writing center. Due to the nature of tutoring sessions, collecting this type of data in the middle of sessions may prove difficult, and as such, while writing in 1984, North claimed that \\"there is not a single published study of what happens in writing center tutorials\\". Typically, surveys determine the number of students seen, number of hours tutored, reaction of students to center, reaction of teachers to center, and so on. = Recording Sessions = Recording sessions are seen by some writing center scholars as a viable method of data gathering that answers critiques from the likes of Stephen North about the lack of research regarding what happens during tutoring sessions. To accomplish this, writing center directors using this method explicitly study what happens during a tutoring session using audio or video tapes and analyzing the transcripts.  Assessment Plans  Assessment plans are encouraged by some writing center scholars as a means of planning and enacting improvement of centers. Discussed in many forms, several writing center scholars advise directors to develop assessment plans, and provide a series of approaches for doing so. These typically begin with figuring out what to measure, validating these plans, and presenting these findings to the relevant stakeholders. = Developing Assessment Plans = One prominent example of an assessment plan can be seen in the Virginia Commonwealth Assessment Plan. In discussing the VCAP, Isabelle Thompson lists six general heuristics of program assessment that fit into this context. According to her, program assessment and improvement should be: * Pragmatic, intending to be informative and, hence, improve conditions for student learning as well as summative and, hence, justify a program or service. * Systematic, orderly, and replicable. * Faculty-designed and led. * Multiply measured and sourced. * Mission-driven. * Ongoing and cumulative. According to Thompson, in order to develop an assessment plan, writing center directors should: # Prepare a mission statement for the writing center based on the services the center provides and aspires to provide. # Develop goals, objectives, or intended educational outcomes for the center # Determine appropriate assessment methods for the writing center. # Conduct the assessment of the writing center's services. # Analyze the results of the assessment and draw conclusions about the results in terms of outcomes and the current strengths and weaknesses of the writing center. # Use the results to bring about improvements in the center's services. Others like Neal Lerner endorse frameworks for assessment plans for writing centers that consist of heuristics such as determining: who participates in the writing center, what students need from the writing center, how satisfied students are with the writing center, identifying campus environments, outcomes, finding comparable institution assessments, analyzing nationally accepted standards, and measuring cost-effectiveness. = Validating Assessment Plans = Assessment of writing relies on the concept of validity, or insuring that you measure what you intend to measure. Chris Gallagher supports developing writing assessments locally, something that many scholars in writing assessment firmly support, but adds that we should validate our assessment methods and choices on a larger scale and suggests the following heuristics for doing so in his Assessment Quality Review Heuristic: # Briefly describe the writing program, including curricular and instructional goals, institutional constraints and opportunities (e.g. resources issues, labor conditions, professional development offerings), and student and teacher demographics. Append relevant documentation. # Briefly describe the assessment and its relationship, if any, to other assessments conducted in the program. If this assessment is part of an overall assessment plan, append the plan. # Answer the following questions about the assessment under review: #* Meaningful: #** What are the purposes of this assessment? What are its intended uses? How were these purposes arrived at? Who formulated them? Why and to whom are those purposes significant? How were these purposes made known to students and teachers? How does the content of the assessment match its purpose? #* Appropriate #** How is the assessment suitable for this context, these participants, and its intended purposes and uses? How does the assessment reflect the values, beliefs, and aspirations of the participants and their immediate communities? #* Useful #** How does the assessment help students learn and help teachers teach? How does the assessment provide information that may be used to improve teaching and learning, curriculum, professional development, program policies, accountability, etc.? Who will use the information generated from this assessment and for what purposes? #* Fair #** How does the assessment ensure that all students are able to do and demonstrate their best work? How does the assessment contribute to the creation or maintenance of appropriate working conditions for teachers and students? How does it ensure adequate compensation and/or recognition for the labor required to produce it? #* Trustworthy #** How are the assessment results arrived at and by whom? How does the assessment ensure that these results represent the best professional judgment of educators? How does the assessment ensure that the results derive from a process that honors articulated differences even as it seeks common ground for decisions? #* Just #** What are the intended and unintended consequences of this assessment‚Äîfor students, teachers, administrators, the program, the institution, etc.? How does the assessment ensure that these consequences are in the best interest of participants, especially students and teachers? # In light of this review, what changes, if any, do you plan to make to this assessment? = Presenting Findings to Stakeholders = After designing and implementing an assessment plan in writing center contexts, assessment experts advise considering how this information is provided to the rest of the administrators in the university setting. Writing center practitioners recommend that directors of these spaces balance the usefulness of findings in writing center assessments to the improvement of the space itself, and rhetorically appealing to the intended audience. Some administrators advise using quantifiable data, and connecting that data to important concepts in a given university, like retention, persistence, and time-to-degree, though the important factors to assess and present may vary depending on what a given university administration values. In their book Building Writing Center Assessments that Matter, Ellen Schendel and William J. Macauley Jr. provide a set of heuristics for presenting information to stakeholders in the university setting: * Carefully presenting \\"good news\\" and \\"bad news\\" in the report, and discussing them ethically. * Articulating what we do in ways that non-experts will understand. * Creating a story about the writing center that is supported by the data and that is told clearly in the report. * Planning and articulating trajectories for our work and using the assessment reports to collaborate with others. * Using the report to inform our public communications about the writing center. Some of this advice, such as the desire to tell a story about the writing center space, clashes directly with advice from administrators like Josephine Koster, who claims that \\"administrators don't want to read essays. Directors should use bulleted lists, headings, graphs, and charts, and executive summaries in documents sent to administrators\\". These clashes appear to support the larger importance placed on local writing assessment practices in determining what local administrators may expect.

In 2015, the museum launched a project to recreate the Autopia attraction that had operated in the Walt Disney Municipal Park south of town. The miniature car ride was donated by Disney when the attraction was dismantled at Disneyland. The town operated the ride from 1966 until rising insurance costs and a lack of replacement parts forced its closure in 1977. A single restored car is on display at the museum and was the centerpiece of a Kickstarter project to finance a $500,000 reconstruction of the ride, launched in July 2015.

In addition to designing and building over 35 schools in Mexico, she designed the largest indigenous market in South America, in Otavalo, Ecuador. Her approach to architecture is to build what is useful for the local community. Besides schools, she has built a hotel, tourist villages and a swimming pool to boost employment of residents in Oaxaca, Mexico. Biography Tonny Zwollo was born on 1 February 1942 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. She was the daughter of the goldsmith, Marinus Zwollo. She graduated in 1964 with a degree in architecture from the Delft University of Technology, but found it difficult to find work as a female architect in the Netherlands. That same year, Zwollo accepted an offer to work for the Mexican government building schools. Initially employed in Mexico City, she found bias against working with a woman there too and requested that she be transferred to more remote areas. She was sent to Oaxaca, where she had to convince the local villagers to work for her, without pay, to build the schools for their communities. Often, to get supplies to the sites, they had to build airstrips as well. Within two years, she had built nearly 30 airstrips and 35 schools. Her work was featured in Life magazine in 1967. She completed her work with the Mexican government in 1968, graduated in 1970 with a degree in engineering and received the Prix d'Excellence Award for her work. As her final student project in 1970, Zwollo went to Ecuador to design the Otavalo Market. The market is the largest outdoor market in South America and was not completed until 1973. She built 90 concrete market stalls to create the Plaza de los Ponchos and house the handicrafts of indigenous merchants. She completed her dissertation entitled, Fantasy and architecture, and it was published in English, Spanish and Dutch in 1975. In 1976, Zwollo returned to Oaxaca and worked on a collaborative project to restore the Santa Catalina Convent with architect Mart√≠n Ru√≠z Camino. The conserved sixteenth-century, ex-convent was converted into a five-star hotel called El Presidente, winning Zwollo an additional Prix d'Excellence Award, from France. In 1990, Zwollo designed another open air market. This one was located in Tlacolula de Matamoros and featured a two-story design with a food court on the second floor and shops on the ground floor. In 1992, she approached Mart√≠n Ru√≠z Camino, with whom she had worked on the convent and proposed a design to boost tourism in Tlacolula. Her idea was to create small tourist houses, similar to the indigenous dwellings dotting the stretch of the Pan-American highway. The houses would allow tourists to live in an authentic dwelling and provide jobs for the indigenous population. Ru√≠z, who at the time was Secretary for Tourist Development, implemented the idea and Tourist Y√∫'√π Program was launched in nine villages in the Oaxaca's Central Valley. In 1993, Zwollo and Ru√≠z published a book about their projects first in Spanish and then under the English title, The Lost Paradise: Architecture and Ecology in the Oaxaca Valley (). Zwollo was appointed as a consultant in 1996 by Di√≥doro Carrasco Altamirano, Governor of Oaxaca, for special projects. One of those projects, at Hierve el Agua, created the pools at the ancient canals. Previously, swimming had been forbidden to protect the archaeological heritage of the site, but with the building of the pools, the local community was able to improve employment of local inhabitants through the funds earned by tourism. She created a documentary film, Blue is my colour: designing as an answer to nature about the project.

Despite the difficulty of the task due to the topography and ground cover, as well as the relatively primitive tools available to surveyors at the time, Goerck finished the job in about 6 months, by December 1785. He had created 140 lots - the size he was instructed to create - of varying uniformity, and had laid out a road through the middle of them that would, eventually, become Fifth Avenue in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811. Goerck's lots were oriented with the long axis going east-west, just as the blocks in the Commissioners Plan would be.Koeppel (2015), pp.18-22 In 1788, Goerck was hired by the long- established Bayard family, relatives of Peter Stuyvesant, to survey and lay out streets in the portion of their estate west of Broadway, so the land could be sold in lots. About accommodated 7 east-west and 8 north-south streets, all wide, making up 35 whole or partial rectilinear blocks of width from east to west, and between long north to south - although near the edges of the estate the grid broke down in order to connect up with existing streets. The Bayard street grid was one of the first attempts to apply a gridiron plan to Manhattan island, and the streets still exist as the core of SoHo and part of Greenwich Village: Mercer, Greene, and Wooster Streets, LaGuardia Place/West Broadway (originally Laurens Street), and Thompson, Sullivan, MacDougal, and Hancock Streets, although the last has been subsumed by the extension of Sixth Avenue.Koeppel (2015), pp.14-16 By 1794, with the economy of the city improving and hoping for increased sales of Common Lands lots, the Council again hired Goerck to survey the area. Goerck was asked to make the lots more regular and rectangular, and to add roads to the east and west of his original middle road - these would become Fourth and Sixth Avenues when the Commissioners' Plan came out. He was also to lay out east-west streets connecting the three north-south roads, which would later become the numbered streets of the 1811 plan. Goerck took 2 years to complete this task, finishing in March 1796. The Common Lands were now divided into 212 numbered lots of a size close to , although, again, the surveying was less than perfect. In 1808, John Hunn, the city's street commissioner at the time, would comment that \\"The Surveys made by Mr. Goerck upon the Commons were effected through thickets and swamps, and over rocks and hills where it was almost impossible to produce accuracy of mensuration.\\" Often the streets intended to intersect at right angles would not quite do so.Koeppel (2015), pp.25-26 Nevertheless, Goerck's two surveys of the Common Lands provided a template for the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, although the Commission did not acknowledge this in their report. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has written that \\"The Commissioner's Plan borrowed heavily from Goerck's earlier surveys and essentially expanded his scheme beyond the common lands to encompass the entire island.\\"Brazee, Christopher D. and Most, Jennifer L. (March 23, 2010) Upper East Side Historic District Extension Designation Report New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, p.6 n.12 Historian Gerard Koeppel comments \\"In fact, the great grid is not much more than the Goerck plan writ large. The Goerck plan is modern Manhattan's Rosetta Stone...\\"Koeppel (2015), p.27 With the French architect Joseph-Fran√ßois Mangin, another of the five city surveyors, Goerck was commissioned by the Common Council in 1797 to prepare a new map of the city as it existed. Goerck and Mangin had each submitted individual proposals to the Council, but then decided to team up. Their new joint proposal offered to provide a detailed map as far north as today's Astor Place, with elevations throughout - correcting miscalculations of elevation which had previously been accepted - and indications of the positions of every lot, house, street, wharf, square and ward. They asked for 18 months to do the job, and wanted $3,000 in compensation (). They would provide a square master map, as well as square copies, and a field book containing all the pertinent information, including that of the names of property owners, and a method for correcting past miscalculations. The Council awarded them the job.Koeppel (2015), pp.34-36 Goerck died of yellow fever before the map could be completedKoeppel (2015), p.34 and Mangin finished it on his own, adding Mangin Street and Goerck Street as well as other improvements and additions that went far beyond the project commissioned by the Council.1801 Mangin-Goerck Plan or Map of New York City. Geographicus Rare Antique Maps. Retrieved 21 October 2015. This proved to be the downfall of the project: after four years in which the Council had accepted the plan as \\"the new Map of the City,\\" political machinations perhaps organized by Aaron Burr brought the plan's speculative nature into disrepute - although there was no question that the map showed the settled area of the city accurately, it was Mangin's expansion of the Council's commission to show \\"not the plan of the City such as it is, but such as it is to be.\\" There is no indication of whether Goerck approved of this or not.Koeppel (2015), p.37 and passim Death According to Stokes, Goerck died on November 19, 1798, which roughly accords with Koeppel, who writes > Before a freeze in late November 1798 killed them, mosquitoes delivered > death bites to two thousand of the sixty thousand New Yorkers. Casimir > Goerck, who spent long hours tramping the filthy streets, foul docksides, > and swampy outskirts, was among them, early in the month.

Built as a hotel in 1927 and designed by the architectural firm Murgatroyd & Ogden, it was a women's temporary residence owned by The Salvation Army from 1963 to 2008. It was then known as the Parkside Evangeline. In 2010, The Salvation Army sold the building to Eastgate Realty for US$60 million. The investors were the Zeckendorf family and Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer.Craig Karmin, Developers Team Up With a Man Behind the Scenes, The Wall Street Journal, May 12, 2013 In 2012, the building was redesigned by Robert A.M. Stern Architects as a luxury 16-unit condominium building. Residents have a key to Gramercy Park, a private park.  Neighborhood History  The area which is now Gramercy Park was once in the middle of a swamp. In 1831, Samuel B. Ruggles, a developer and advocate of open space, proposed the idea for the park due to the northward growth of Manhattan. He bought the property, 22 acres of what was then a farm called \\"Gramercy Farm\\", from the heirs of James Duane, son of the former mayor, father of James Chatham Duane, and a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant. Ruggles then deeded the land on December 17, 1832, to five trustees, who pledge to hold 42 lots in trust to be used as parkland. To develop the property, Ruggles spent $180,000 to landscape it, draining the swamp and causing about a million horsecart loads of earth to be moved. He then laid out \\"Gramercy Square\\", deeding possession of the square to the owners of the 66 parcels of land he had plotted to surround it, and sought tax-exempt status for the park, which the city's Board of Aldermen granted in 1832. It was the second private square created in the city, after Hudson Square, also known as St. John's Park, which was laid out by the parish of Trinity Church. Numbering of the lots began at #1 on the northwest corner, on Gramercy Park West, and continued counter- clockwise: south down Gramercy Park West, then west to east along Gramercy Park South (East 20th Street), north up Gramercy Park East, and finally east to west along Gramercy Park North (East 21st Street). As part of his overall plan for the square, Ruggles received permission on January 28, 1833, from the Board of Alderman to open up Fourth Avenue, which had been limited to use by trains, to vehicular traffic. He also brought about the creation by the state legislature of Lexington Avenue and Irving Place, two new north-south roads laid out between Third and Fourth Avenues and feeding into his development at the top and bottom of the park. The new streets reduced the number of lots around the park from 66 to 60. Gramercy Park was enclosed by a fence in 1833, but construction on the surrounding lots did not begin until the 1840s, due to the Panic of 1837. In one regard, this was fortunate, as the opening of the Croton Aqueduct in 1842 allowed new townhouses to be constructed with indoor plumbing. The first formal meeting of the park's trustees took place in 1844 at 17 Union Square (West), the mansion of James W. Gerard, which is no longer extant, having been demolished in 1938. By that time, the landscaping had already begun with the hiring of James Virtue in 1838, who planted privet inside the fence as a border; by 1839 pathways had been laid out and trees and shrubs planted. Major planting also took place in 1844 ‚Äì the same year the park's gates were first locked ‚Äì followed by additional landscaping by Brinley & Holbrook in 1916. These plantings had the effect of softening the parks' prim formal design. Gramercy Park is now a quiet residential corner within New York‚Äôs most unambiguously enduring neighborhood. It is the only park in Manhattan with a keyed entry, as it is a private park. Access to the park is exclusive to people who live directly on the park's perimeter, which features a number of the city‚Äôs most architecturally enchanting buildings, complete with wrought-iron gates, bluestone sidewalks, shaded lawns, and wooden benches. Owners at 18 Gramercy Park may purchase an annual key to the park. As of 2008, the cost for a key was $350, with a $1,000 fee for lost keys, which rises to $2,000 for a second instance. The Medeco locks are changed annually, and any property that does not pay the annual assessment of $7,500 per lot has its key privileges revoked. Additionally, the keys are very hard to duplicate. As of 2012, there were 383 keys in circulation, each individually numbered and coded. Some of the area's notable previous residents include Henry James, Diminish Stuyvesant, Herman Melville, Edith Wharton, Stanford White, Oscar Wilde, and Winslow Homer. Building Features Since its completion in September 2012, the building has sold all of its units(many of which are full- floor residences), with many costing more than $4,000USD per square foot, including the three-level Maisonette with a private passage. The units feature marble showers, Miele dishwashers and thick white-oak floors. The building features two rooftop porches, a club room, spa and wellness center, 24-hour porter, full-time staff(including concierge) and four exposures with park and horizon views.

Illustration of a Highwayman = Criminal Life = For about seven to twelve years, William Spiggot was a highwayman and the leader of a gang of at least eight men. He performed his robberies on the roads from London to Hounslow Heath, Kingston and Ware. The exact number of his crimes is unknown, yet according to the Ordinary of Newgate, Spiggot had declared to him that \\"it was in vain to mention his numerous Robberies on the High-Way, being perhaps about a Hundred\\". His criminal life came to an end when he was arrested along with other members of his gang in January 1721, in a tavern at Westminster by the men of the famous thief-taker Jonathan Wild. John Merrit, who apprehended Spiggot and his gang, claimed that the actual arrest was of a violent sort. Spiggot was described as very reluctant on being taken and fought back, eventually shooting his landlord, Mr Rowlet, in the shoulder. According to another witness, Spiggot swore on his arrest that \\"he would kill a thousand before he would be taken\\". =First Trial and Refusal to Plead= The punishment peine forte et dure for a refusal to plead in London. Engraving published in the 1780 edition of the Malefactor's Register or Newgate Calendar During the 13 January 1721 session at the Old Bailey Court, William Spiggot and Thomas Phillips (alias Cross) were judged for highway robberies and violent thefts. But as they were brought to the bar, they refused to plead. They declared that until their belongings, money and horses were given back to them, they would remain silent. The court reminded them of William and Mary's 1692 act titled \\"An Act for encourageing the apprehending of Highway Men\\". Part IV of this act stipulates clearly that when highwaymen are arrested, the apprehender can take the horses, money and other belongings from the felon. Still they both refused to speak. At the time, a refusal to plead would lead to a heavy judgement also called Peine forte et dure, which is to be pressed with heavy weights either until death or until one would speak. The judge threatened them, describing how the sentence should be carried out. The atrocity of the sentence was thought to dissuade felons from non pleading and that they would submit themselves to a trial by a jury. But still, the convicts stayed mute. They were brought back to Newgate Prison to receive their sentence. On their arrival in the Press (the room where the heavy judgment should be carried out), Thomas Phillips asked to be brought back to court in order to plead. On the other hand, Spiggot endured the Press. His legs and arms were kept outstreched by cords, while he laid almost naked on the floor. Some 350 pounds (about 160 kg) of iron were put on his breast. Apart for groans and \\"pray for me!\\", Spiggot kept silent. He had just a cloth covering his face but he also complained about a heavy weight on his head; according to the Ordinary of Newgate Thomas Purney, this was due to the blood pressure as the blood was \\"flush'd and forc'd up into his face\\". After half an hour, 50 pounds (about 23 kg) were added on his chest. The excruciating pain made the weak prisoner accept to be brought back to court in order to plead not guilty. =Second Trial= Brought back to court, Spiggot and Phillips pleaded not guilty on their new trial. They were accused of assaulting John Watkins on the Highway on 12 November 1720 and robbing him \\"a Silver Watch, a Holland Gown, a pair of Stays, a Scarlet Riding-Hood lined with Silk, with divers other Goods, and 5 l. in Money, in all to the value of 200l\\". They were also convicted with one of their associates, William Heater, for another highway robbery, attacking John Turner on 1 November 1720 and stealing \\" [his]5 Guineas [...] and 1 Box, a Gold Watch, 12 Holland Shirts, 2 pair of Lace Ruffles, 2 Cambrick Bosoms. 2 Lawn, Turnovers, 2 Muslin Turnovers, 2 pair of Stockings, a Hat, a Perriwig, &c.; and 12 Guineas, the Goods and Money of Neal Sheldon, Esq\\". When he testified, John Watkins declared that he recognized Spiggot, knowing him for some years. On the contrary, the gang that attacked John Turner were on horseback and wore masks. The testimonies suggested that some of Turner's stolen goods were found at Spiggot's lodgings. Among the witnesses, six people described Spiggot's gang's violent arrest. They made him appear as a very impetuous man, not eager to surrender and who was difficult to catch. Even one of his former accomplices, Joseph Lindsey, testified against him. Heater was described as the man in charge of renting horses and receiving the stolen goods. Even Spiggot and Phillips declared that he was innocent. This declarations and the lack of proofs found against him made the jury acquit Heater. The proceedings do not recollect any defence from the prisoners. The jury found Spiggot and Phillips guilty and they were sentenced to death. =Third Trial= On the same session of 13 January 1721, Spiggot was cited in the next trial along with another prisoner William Bourroughs of Finchley. They were indicted for highway robbery. Charles Sybbald prosecuted them for assaulting him on the Highway near Finchley Common on 25 August 1720. According to the victim, they stole \\"15 Guineas and 10 Shillings in Money\\". Again the accomplice of Spiggot, Joseph Lindsey testified against him. Lindsey clearly declared that he participated in the attack of Sybbald and his man. The three armed robbers were on horseback. However, Sybbald recognized only Lindsey having seen his face and heard his voice during the assault. The two other attackers had indeed covered up their faces. Burroughs' brother also testified during the trial. He claimed that Lindsey's wife told him that his brother and her husband left together for the country. Burroughs' brother explained that he took William home to their mother, where he was guarded by other men. The jury found them guilty and they were sentenced to death. = Execution = Executions at Tyburn (late seventeenth century) Found guilty by the jury at his trials on 13 January 1721, Spiggot was sentenced to death along with his partner in crime Thomas Cross alias Phillips. The Ordinary of Newgate recorded that William Spiggot attended to the prayers before his execution thus being \\"truly penitent\\", contrary to his associate Cross who would disturb them. He also recalled that Spiggot did not easily weep, and when he wished his son farewell for the last time might have been the only moment that Purney saw Spiggot crying. The condemned man was furious at his former accomplice Joseph Lindsey, who betrayed him by testifying at his trial. The convicted robber declared that he once helped his former accomplice escape and that he protected him and saved his life. Spiggot and Phillips were both executed on 11 February 1721 at Tyburn, with five other convicts. The crowd carried off Spiggot's body in order to prevent surgeons dissecting it. As suggested by Hitchcock and Shoemaker, it is probable that people were impressed by his bravery as he suffered the press ordeal and therefore protected his corpse.  Interpretations of his Refusal to Plead  A refusal to plead led to such a harsh punishment, \\"a torture\\" according to Newgate's Ordinary, that people always wondered why Spiggot kept obstinate. The Chaplain already considered in his accounts of February 1721 the reasons of Spiggot stubbornness. Thomas Purney affirmed that Spiggot's main motive was to secure his family so that they would not suffer from his trial, on a social and financial level. Then, Purney mainted that since Spiggot was enragged at Lindsey, his ex-accomplice who testified against him during several trials, he would not want his treator to be delighted by his downfall. However, for the historians Shoemaker and Hitchcock, these two reasons don't justify his actions completely. For them, the proof resides in the account opening sermon, where the Ordinate condemned misused virility and pride qualifying them of being \\"false courage\\". The two felons, Spiggot and Phillips bragged about their numerousless extravagant crimes. The historian Andrea McKenzie suggests that obtaining a fame as highwayman could have been one of Spiggot's reason. The \\"criminal celebrities\\" were populars among the people, who would visit the famous criminals in prison or gather in huge crowds to watch an execution. Published works related the depravity of prisoners of the time, for instance Spiggot and his stubbornness were cited the Newgate Calendar or The Lives of the Most Remarkable Criminals. The question of challenging justice in England is also raised. Even if Spiggot's intentions were not to challenge the legal system, it was interpreted by modern historians as confronting its authority. For instance, in her article about the Peine forte et dure, Andrea McKenzie argues that such refusals showed a \\"persistent popular resistance to that most sacred of English institutions, trial by jury\\". In an 18th-century trial, the balance was on the side of the prosecutor. Being judged by neighbours, with friends and relations testifying for and against them, prisoners had a few chances to be found innocent. Maybe knowing that his trial would certainly be his downfall considering the violence of his crimes, Spiggot refused to plead and to have a trial by a jury. Furthermore, his reason could also be financial. As explained by McKenzie, the unsanitary London prisons were very expensive. To secure a private cell or better conditions, a prisoner had to pay for it. Requesting to be given back the money that was taken on his arrest, Spiggot probably wanted to secure better living conditions in Newgate.

The period is characterised by the succession of capitals that followed the fall of the Polonnaruwa Kingdom and the creation of the Jaffna kingdom. Overview Periodization of Sri Lanka history: Jaffna kingdom The Jaffna kingdom, also known as Kingdom of Aryacakravarti came into existence after the invasion of Magha, who is said to have been from Kalinga, in South India. It was a tribute-paying feudatory region of the Pandyan Empire in modern South India in 1250, but it later became independent with the fragmentation of the Pandyan control. For a brief period, in the early and middle 14th century, it was an ascendant power in the island of Sri Lanka when all regional kingdoms accepted subordination. However, the kingdom was eventually overpowered by the rival Kotte Kingdom in around 1450. It was freed of Kotte control in 1467. Its subsequent rulers directed their energies towards consolidating its economic potential by maximising revenue from pearls and elephant exports and land revenue. It was less feudal than most of other regional kingdoms in the island of Sri Lanka of the same period. During this period, important local Tamil literature was produced and Hindu temples were built, including an academy for language advancement. The arrival of the Portuguese colonial power to the island of Sri Lanka in 1505, along with its strategic location in the Palk Strait of connecting all interior Sinhalese kingdoms to South India, created political problems. Many of its kings confronted and ultimately made peace with the Portuguese colonials. In 1617, Cankili II, a usurper to the throne, confronted the Portuguese but was defeated, bringing the kingdom‚Äôs independent existence to an end in 1619. Kingdom of Dambadeniya Dambadeniya is an ancient capital of Sri Lanka. Four kings ruled from there, Vijayab√¢hu III (1220‚Äì1236), Par√¢kkamab√¢hu II (1236‚Äì1270), Vijayab√¢hu IV (1270‚Äì1272), and Bhuvanaikab√¢hu I (1272‚Äì1283). The first king to choose Dambadeniya as his capital was Vijayab√¢hu III. He was able to bring about unity among the sangha who had scattered due to the hostile invasion of the Kalinga magha. He also succeeded in holding a Buddhist convention in 1226 to bring about peace among the Buddhist clergy. King Par√¢kkamab√¢hu II inherited the throne from Vijayab√¢hu III. He was considered a genius who was a great poet and prolific writer. Among the books he wrote are Kausilumina, which is considered a great piece of literature. Unifying the three kingdoms that existed within Sri Lanka at that point in time is regarded as his greatest achievement. King Bosath Vijayab√¢hu, as the eldest son of king Par√¢kkamab√¢hu II, was crowned in 1270. He was well known for his modest behaviour and for his religious activities. He was killed in the second year of his reign by a minister called Miththa.

Niketas is only mentioned by the De Administrando Imperio, a work compiled in the middle of the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos. According to it, he was the son of Ioube (·º∏ŒøœçŒ≤Œ∑, a Hellenized form of Ayyub). Along with his older brother Chase (Hasan) he was a slave of the patrikios Damian, the parakoimomenos of Emperor Michael III, implying that they had been captured as prisoners of war during a conflict with the Arabs around the middle of the 9th century or shortly after. It is unclear whether they came alone or with their father; it is possible that they came to Byzantium as children, and that Niketas was even born there. Chase remained a Muslim in Byzantium, but Niketas, whose original Arab name is not recorded, was apparently baptized a Christian. In 912 he was appointed by Emperor Alexander as the military governor (strategos) of the naval Cibyrrhaeot Theme, in succession to Eustathios. He requested from the emperor that his son, Aberkios, be appointed to the post of katepano of the Mardaites within the Cibyrrhaeot Theme. Emperor Alexander assented to this request. The illoustrios John Ioubes later in the century was possibly a descendant or otherwise a relative.

Career  Domatas began his football career in the youth teams of his local side Ergotelis and signed his first professional contract with the club, on 24 May 2012. He scored his first goal on 24 October 2012, during a Cup match against Aiginiakos. He would proceed to add another two goals during Ergotelis' 2012‚Äì13 Football League season, thus helping his club gain promotion to the Superleague. In the winter transfer period of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Domatas was loaned out to Football League side Asteras Magoula. He went on to make 7 appearances and score 1 goal before returning to Ergotelis. In the next season, Domatas was loaned out again, this time to local Gamma Ethniki side Giouchtas. His feats with the club did not go unnoticed and after six months, on 13 January 2015 he signed with Football League side Ermionida, after mutually terminating his contract with Ergotelis. In 16 appearances with the club, Domatas scored 2 goals, yet Ermionida was relegated after finishing 4th in the 2014‚Äì15 Football League relegation play offs. On 13 August 2015, Domatas returned to Ergotelis, signing a one-year contract with his former club. Domatas was one of just 17 players to remain part of the club's roster despite unbearable financial issues during the season, which ultimately forced the club to withdraw from professional competitions in January 2016. As a free agent after Ergotelis' meltdown, Domatas signed with fellow Football League side Panserraikos, where he stayed until the end of the season. He eventually went on to play for Olympiacos Volos in the Gamma Ethniki, for the 2016‚àí17 season, making a total of 24 appearances and scoring two goals, before signing with Aiginiakos and returning to the Football League.

She was recognized then as \\"the foremost authority on this branch of education.\\" She was inducted into the Cosmetology Hall of Fame at the New York World's Fair in 1965.  Education Wall graduated from St. Elizabeth's College in Convent Station, N.J., in 1913. She received bachelor's degrees in both Arts and Education, with honors in English and Chemistry. Initially a teacher, she was able to enter the chemical profession as men went to fight in World War I and women entered business and industry.  Early career  Her first position, in 1917, was with the Radium Luminous Material Corporation of Orange, New Jersey. Luckily she was not one of the Radium Girls, workers who became ill from exposure to radioactive paints. Wall's job was to chemically analyse ores and measure the concentration of radium extracted from them. Her reports made clear that chemists at the plant routinely used protective laboratory equipment and procedures which were not utilized by dial painters. She later testified and wrote about her work at the plant. Within a year, she had joined the Seydel Manufacturing Company, where she worked on the distillation of benzyl acetate and other benzoic acid derivatives. After examining a sample of her work, the U. S. Chemical Warfare Service asked her to supervise large-scale production of benzyl acetate and benzyl benzoate at the Fellows Medical Manufacturing Company, for coating military aircraft. After the plant closed at the end of the war, she worked briefly in 1919 for Ricketts Laboratory and then for the U. S. Motor Fuel Corporation on catalysts for gasoline. She was fired after reporting falsification of results at the plant and recommending that the pilot program there be terminated.  Cosmetic chemistry  In 1923, she became one of the first women admitted as a Fellow of the American Institute of Chemists. After a brief period teaching in Cuba, Wall was hired by Inecto, Inc., a leading manufacturer of hair dyes, in 1924. Her original position was as a liaison between the development lab and the product testing salon. With strong technical and writing skills, and fluency in multiple languages,According to Hamlin, these included French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Swedish. she was soon made the head of library research and technical advice. Eventually her title became \\"Director of trade education and technical publicity\\". Florence E. Wall helped to found Inetco's Notox Institute for postgraduate education in hair dyeing in the 1920s, and developed curricula for beauty and cosmetology schools such as the Notox Institute and the Marinello Schools of Beauty, which were purchased by Inetco. She coined the term canitics when asked to write a text about the art and science of hair dyeing. Eventually Florence published 5 books and more than 300 articles, including Canitics: The art and science of hair dyeing, The principles and practice of beauty culture, a biography of chemist Charles Herty,Florence E. Wall, \\"Charles Holmes Herty-Apostle to the South.,\\" The Chemist, 9 (February 1932): 123-131. and articles on the history of the cosmetics industry and the status of women chemists.Florence E. Wall. \\"The Status of Women Chemists.\\" Chemist, 15(1938): 191 She wrote articles for the Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology and the World Book Encyclopedia, and edited The Chemist for two years during 1929-1931. She left Inetco as of December 1928 to work as a freelance lecturer, teacher and writer. She traveled for months in Europe, reaching out to chemists, physicians, lawyers, advertisers and merchandising people. Unable to find anyone to supervise her as a Ph.D. student, she took further classes at the School of Education at New York University, creating her own program of self-study in issues relating to cosmetology. Marston L. Hamlin, an early employer, later said of her: Beginning in 1936, Florence Wall taught the first college-accredited course on cosmetics, \\"Cosmetic Hygiene\\", at the School of Education at New York University. In 1938 she received her M.Sc. from New York University. She continued to teach until 1943, adding the specialized topics \\"Advanced Cosmetology\\" and \\"Teaching of Cosmetology,\\" as well as a general class on \\"Teaching of Personal Grooming\\". Wall promoted the idea that \\"Beauty is an Ensemble,\\" involving makeup, hairstyling, weight control, posture, and general health. Florence E. Wall was involved in the drafting of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, testifying, attending all the hearings, and working with Senator Royal S. Copeland, who proposed the legislation. In 1943 Wall became technical editor for General Aniline and Film Corporation, and moved to Easton, Pa. In 1945, she returned to New York as technical editor for the Ralph L. Evans Associate laboratories. By 1947, she had returned to freelance consulting.  Recognition  She was a Fellow of the American Institute of Chemists, a member of the American Chemical Society (in the Paint and Varnish Division), the Society of Medical Jurisprudence, the Society of Cosmetic Chemists, and the History of Science Society. She was the first person to present a paper on cosmetics to the American Chemical Society. She was also active in the Women's Advertising Club of New York. On December 13, 1956, she received the 9th Medal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists, given as \\"our highest award for outstanding contributions to the science and art of cosmetics.\\" She was the first woman to receive the medal. She was inducted into the Cosmetology Hall of Fame at the New York World's Fair in 1965.

Meredith was unable to enter the profession as an architect because of \\"both her race and her sex\\" as an African-American woman, and worked primarily as an art teacher at Virginia State University (then Virginia State College), where she founded the art department. She is best known for her residence, Azurest South, where she and her partner, Edna Meade Colson, resided together.  Biography  Azurest South Meredith was born in Lynchburg, Virginia. Her father, Samuel Peter Meredith, was white, and was also a master stair builder. Her mother, Emma Kennedy was black, so her parents were prohibited by anti-miscegenation laws from marrying in Virginia. Eventually, her parents traveled to Washington, D.C. to get married. Not long after their marriage, her father began to lose business, \\"apparently as a result of the marriage\\" and died by suicide in 1915. Meredith started teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in Indian Rock after she completed high school. Later, she went back to Lynchburg and taught elementary school, before returning to college. In 1922, she attended Virginia State University (then Virginia State College for Negroes), and afterwards, taught at Dunbar High School for six years. In 1926, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, where she attended the Teacher's College of Columbia University. She studied fine arts, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1930 and then her master's degree in 1934. she then returned to Virginia where she founded the Arts Department for Virginia State University in 1935. Despite having no formal training in architecture, Meredith designed many homes for family and friends in Virginia, New York and Texas. Her first building was Azurest South, which was completed in 1939 and was designed \\"both inside and out\\" completely by Meredith. She and her partner, Colson, moved in together and it would be their primary residence for the rest of their lives. Azurest South is considered a rare example of Virginia's International Style and displays her interest in avant-garde design. Meredith also used Azurest South as her own art studio. Meredith was active in documenting her lifestyle and accomplishments at Azurest though photographs. In 1947, Meredith started developing a 120 lot subdivision in Sag Harbor called Azurest North. Azurest North was created for her family and friends to use. In order to develop Azurest North, she and her friends created a group, called Azurest Syndicate, which worked to create an African American leisure community. Lots were sold to investors who built cottages in Sag Harbor. Terry Cottage and Edendot were both designed by Meredith. Meredith was also an inventor. In 1955, she received a patent for an accessory to be attached to a golf bag. In 1958, she retired from teaching. She continued to design buildings and paint throughout the 1960s. In the 1970s, Meredith designed logos to be used for a proposed name change for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Meredith died in 1984 and is buried alongside Edna Meade Colson at Eastview Cemetery, Petersburg, Virginia.

He was married to the actress Ada Svedin. Biography Czerny grew up in Vienna, where he attended elementary school, middle school and secondary school. Shortly after the turn of the century, he took acting lessons from actor Hermann Romany at the Vienna Theater School. Czerny began his artistic career at Theater an der Wien, his first engagement was in 1906 at the Innsbruck city theater. The following year he switched to the Carl Schultze Theater as a choir singer. In 1910 Czerny went on an opera and operetta tour to South America with an ensemble, where he also directed. The following year he was appointed director (under the direction of Felix Basch) to the Vienna Operetta Ensemble. Czerny already felt connected to music theater - an interest that was to lead to his cinematic work years later. In 1919 he co- developed the NotoFilm system for adding sound to a film (also called Czerny- Springefeld method ). In the system sheet music was copied into part of a film image, which was to serve as a score for the conductor and orchestra present in a cinema theater. During the music passages, the conductor was able to direct the melody from the images of the notes running at the bottom of the picture; Singers in the hall tried to perform their arias on the screen in sync with the actors' lip movements. Despite the considerable effort, these films turned out to be technically poor and, moreover, quite unsuccessful. After the public and critic flop Das M√§del von Pontecuculi , film critic Robert Volz called the work premiered in November 1924 a \\"freak of this film operetta\\", the pioneer of this film genre completely withdrew from the directing business. After the singing film Gretchen Schubert , which was shot in 1925, failed in every respect, NotoFilm ceased production entirely.Michael Wedel, Pictorial Affects, Senses of Rupture: On the Poetics and Culture of Popular German Cinema, 1910-1930, Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2019, pages 153 to 157 With the beginning of the sound film era, Czerny returned to the film and tried again, without any real success, to run his own production company Czerny-Prod. GmbH as a film producer. He concentrated on documentaries about (north German) country and people. As early as 1934, after the completion of his only sound feature film (the boy's story Die Gange vom Hoheneck), the Nazis, who had come to power the year before, forced all production activities to cease. Ludwig Czerny died in an air raid on 1941 when he tried to help a woman carry her stroller down to the air-raid shelter.

It is located at 99 Avenue des Champs-√âlys√©es and is part of Hotel Barri√®re Le Fouquet's Paris. The menu, designed in collaboration with Chef Pierre Gagnaire, continues the tradition of classic French cuisine, including Fouquet's beef tartare, sole meuni√®re, Simmental beef fillet with Champs-Elys√©es sauce. The brasserie is famous for its red awnings on the Champs-Elys√©es, which spread over the two terrasses on the Champs-Elys√©es and George V avenues. For decades, Fouquet's Paris has been a place where people from the Culture industry would meet. It has strong ties with the Cinema, and hosts every year the traditional Gala dinner after the C√©sar ceremony. The restaurant is listed as a historical French monument since 1990 (Inventaire des Monuments Historiques). The historical decor includes mahogany woodpanelling by Jean Royere, Harcourt portraits of notable actors and actresses, and discrete brass plaques which indicate the favourite tables of famous people. Most frequent guests own their silver napkin rings with their name engraved on it. Although the name of the restaurant's founder, [Louis] Fouquet, is pronounced in the standard French way, rhyming with \\"bouquet\\", the restaurant name is pronounced with a hard \\"t\\" and \\"s\\", rhyming with the English word \\"nets\\".  History  Fouquet's brasserie was founded in 1899 by Louis Fouquet. He called it after his French last name, \\"Fouquet\\", and added the \\"'s\\" to give it a trendy style, although he was born and raised in France. Since 1990, the main room is listed as a historical French monument (Inventaire des Monuments Historiques). In 1998, Fouquet's was purchased by Groupe Barri√®re. Then, the family owned French group created Hotel Barri√®re Le Fouquet's Paris by acquiring 6 buildings around the brasserie. Groupe Barri√®re inaugurated seven other Fouquet's restaurants, in Cannes, Toulouse, Courchevel, La Baule, Marrakech, Enghien-les-Bains and Montreux. In March 2019, the restaurant was severely damaged during yellow vest protests. The restaurant Fouquet's Paris reopened a few month later for Bastille day, on July 14, 2019, identical as it was before.

The site opened to the public for the first time in 200 years on 1 May 2016. Covering and situated close to the Lee Valley, Woodberry Wetlands was acquired as a nature reserve in 2014. The site is owned by Thames Water and run by London Wildlife Trust. After a major redevelopment the East Reservoir now offers free public access. The reserve was developed by London Wildlife Trust in collaboration with Thames Water, Berkeley Homes and London Borough of Hackney, with funding from Heritage Lottery Fund. The site contains a boardwalk, a visitors' centre with caf√©, toilet facilities and a classroom. The New River Path runs alongside the northern edge of the reservoir. This forms part of a cycle route connecting to Walthamstow Wetlands, badged as the 'Wetlands to Wetlands Greenway'.  History  The New River by the Woodberry Down Estate Before the 1600s London's water supply was mostly reliant on the River Thames, local streams, wells and springs. King James I authorised the construction of the New River in 1604 to bring clean water from springs in Hertfordshire and Middlesex to London. Created in 1833, the Stoke Newington reservoirs stored water from The New River. The banks of the reservoirs were lined at higher levels with stones taken from London Bridge, then in the course of demolition. Presently, water is temporarily held at the East Reservoir before processing at Walthamstow Reservoirs. The west reservoir has been converted into a water sports centre.  Ecology  191x191px Woodberry Wetlands is located close to the Lee Valley and is a resting place for migratory birds that move to and from the Lee Valley Special Protection Area, with waterfowl such as pochard, shoveler and gadwall visiting the site. Grey heron, tufted duck, reed bunting and other wetland birds are also present, along with kingfisher and other species such as damselflies, dragonflies, amphibians and bats. A significant expansion of the reed beds, organised by London Wildlife Trust, provides increased wildlife habitat with the aim of encouraging more reed bunting and reed warbler to breed at the site, as well as provide additional habitat for overwintering bittern.

Gul-e-Rana is known as one of the popular dramas of Hum TV. It has been criticized for its misogynistic, sexist and regressive approach. There was also a controversy when in a scene the leading actress Sajal Aly blamed a victim of sexual abuse because of her sense of dressing. Synopsis The series revolves around a girl who is struggling for the rights of women after being abused by poor mentality people of the society. After marriage, men don‚Äôt give respect to women and treat them badly. Gul-e-Rana (Sajjal Ali) tries her best to transform Adeel's mentality about women and faces many problems. In the end, Adeel has an accident and transforms into a good person. It is shown in the drama that Gul-E-Rana leaves Adeel for some time and becomes an ordinary teacher. But it is hinted in the end that both of them reconcile after some time. Plot summary The series is a story of emotions, trust, relations and sympathy. It gives a note on forgiveness. Gul-e-Rana's father dies in a car accident, and consequently her rich uncle, takes Rana, her sister and her mother under his wings. Rana's both Aunts hate her and warn her that all her uncle's money is for them. Meanwhile, Maria and Laila, daughters of Gul-e-Rana's aunts, are willing to do anything to marry Adeel who is the only son of Raana's uncle. Gul-e-Rana is very different from her cousins, as Rana exhibits the traits of a well-groomed and modest girl. Unlike Gul-e-Rana, her cousin Adeel is egotistic and narcissistic. To him, girls are merely a means of passing time and pleasure. He considers Gul-e-Rana perfect to marry as she wouldn‚Äôt have a say in his personal life and tries every way to trick her but she pays no heed. Meanwhile, Zafri, Rana's cousin is interested in her and wants to marry her to ensure that Maria and Adeel can marry without any hurdles. One night, Adeel misbehaves with Rana. She slaps him hard on his face. Adeel knits a sinister plan i.e. the very next morning he apologises to Raana and ask for her forgiveness for his last night's misbehaviour. That afternoon he picks Raana from college and lies that her mother is very ill and is admitted in the hospital. He takes Raana to a faraway deserted house, arranges for a Maulvi and his friends help to organize a Nikaah, leaving her with a choice to choose between him and her honour. She decides to marry Adeel but vows to get revenge. Rana's mother finds out about their 'supposed love' and is shell-shocked. Eventually, Adeel and Rana get married while everybody assumes that they love each other; Adeel and Rana torture each other. Rana disobeys and ignores everything Adeel tells her in order to show him where he stands in her life. Adeel suspects that something is going on between Gul-e-Rana and Ashar (Rana's cousin) while Rana just sees Ashar as a friend. Adeel goes to Islamabad. Then Adeel brings Rana to Islamabad with him by lying to his father that he wants Rana to take care of him while he is sick. Adeel and Rana continue to play Tom and Jerry with each other.

Now Rana is thinking about how the life has brought such a turn in his life. Taya Abbu returns, advising Rana to compromise.he says Adeel is immature but Rana is a wise girl and sacrifices are a part of married life.

On their way back they enjoy the scenery and take pictures. When they return it is quite late. Gul-e-Rana tells Gul Bibi to set up the dinner for her. Maria and Adeel come. Maria behaves rudely.

Adeel visits Ashar's house to take back Rana forcefully. Ashar shows courage and supports Rana. Rana goes into the house with Ashar and Adeel is flabbergasted.

It provided support for the Contadora group from South America, in the conflict between Nicaragua and the United States. History The conflict between the United States and the Sandinista Junta in Nicaragua attracted the attention of fellow Latin American countries Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, who started the Contadora group to request a peaceful solution. The Argentine president Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n met the Peruvian president Alan Garc√≠a in Peru, during his presidential inauguration in 1985. Both of them agreed to make coordinated diplomatic actions in relation to the conflict. According to the Argentine chancellor Dante Caputo, the Contadora group was growing inactive, and required a second group to support it.Mui√±o Chancellors Dante Caputo, Olavo Set√∫bal from Brazil and Enrique Iglesias from Uruguay met in Punta del Este and had a similar agreement. The creation of a group with the four countries was announced in Lima, on July 29, 1985. The Contadora group and the Contadora support group met in Cartagena, Colombia, on August 24 and 25, 1985. Both groups were collectively known as \\"the group of eight\\". The group of eight had a second meeting in Caraballeda, Venezuela, in 1986, and issued the \\"Caraballeda message\\". Other Central American countries accepted it. However, the proposals ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. Later meetings attempted to increase the scope of the group. They discussed about fostering the bilateral relations, creating a Latin American parliament, and a technological club. They also created a \\"debitors club\\", to make coordinated actions towards creditors of their foreign debt. According to a proposal by Caputo, they rejected the United Kingdom policy towards the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Both groups were eventually replaced by the Rio Group.Aravena, p. 174 References Bibliography * * Category:International organizations based in the Americas Category:Foreign relations of Argentina Category:Foreign relations of Brazil Category:Foreign relations of Peru Category:Foreign relations of Uruguay Category:Organizations established in 1985 ","title":"Contadora support group"},{"id":"48314803","text":"Henry Vits (January 21, 1842 - December 7, 1921) was an American businessman and politician.

His paintings were characterized by symmetrical patterns of geometry and the presence of tantric symbols such as mandala, phallus and vagina, reportedly representing masculine and feminine energies of the universe. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1992.  Biography  Biren De was born in Faridpur, in the Bengal Presidency (now Bangladesh) on 8 October 1926. He relocated to Kolkata along with his family and joined the Government College of Art & Craft, Kolkata in 1944 for his graduate studies but did not accept the graduate diploma, citing a rift with the then college principal. He moved to New Delhi in 1949 when he was commissioned for a mural at the University of Delhi. His first overseas exhibition was held at Salon de Mai, Paris, in 1951. Returning to India, he joined the College of Art, Delhi, in 1952, as a member of their faculty and stayed at the job till 1963. During his tenure at the College of Art, he spent one year in New York, on a Fulbright Scholarship. It was after this period, his paintings started to depict tantric symbols. In 1966, his works were exhibited at the Kumar's Gallery, New Delhi and Hayward Gallery, London. His works have since been displayed at several places including National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, Berlin State Museum and the National Gallery, Prague, Royal Academy of Arts, London, Tokyo festival of India of 1988, and at the biennales in Venice, Tokyo, S√£o Paulo, Mainichi and Sydney. De received the Lalit Kala Akademi National Award in 1958 which he received a second time in 1964. The Government of India included him in the Republic Day honours list for the civilian award of the Padma Shri in 1992. He died 12 March 2011, at the age of 84.

The work applied ideas from combinatorics and probability to analyse various games of chances popular during the time. This book was mainly influenced by Huygens' treatise De ratiociniis in ludo aleae and the knowledge of the fact that Jakob Bernoulli had written an unfinished work in probability. The work was intended to re-create the yet unpublished work of Jakob Bernoulli called Ars Conjectandi. The work greatly influenced the thinking of Montmort's contemporary, Abraham De Moivre. Montmort collaborated with Nicolaus(I) Bernoulli in a fascinating correspondence which began in 1710. They discussed many topics, particularly the probability questions that arose from Montmort's book. A second edition of the book was published in 1714, a year after the publication of Ars Conjectandi, published eight years after the Jakob's death. The second edition contained many new material and contained correspondences between the author and the Bernoullis, Niklaus and John, and is more than twice as long as the first edition. There are five sections: (1) A Treatise on Combinations; (2) Problems on Games of Chance; (3) This is called \\"Problem on Quinquenove:\\" (4) Various Problems; and (5) Correspondence. The second section studies the card games: Pharaon, Lansquenet, Treize, Bassette, Piquet, Triomphe, L'Ombre, Brelan, Imperial and Quinze. The third section examines games played with dice: Quinquenove, Hazard, Esperance, TricTrac, Trois Dez, Rafle, Trois Rafles, and Noyaux. The fourth section solves various problems including Huygens problems from De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae. The section ends giving four unsolved problems. The fifth section contains Montmort's correspondence with Nicolaus(I) Bernoulli where Petersberg and Waldegrave problems are introduced.

It is planned as part of an ¬£260m extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking Line on the London Overground network. The extension will run partly over the existing London, Tilbury and Southend Railway line from , operated by c2c, and over of new track to be laid to the new station. It is expected that Barking Riverside station will open in December 2021.https://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/news/tfl-budget-reveals- continued-support-for-overground-extension-1-6762509 There have also been calls to extend the line further south across the river to Thamesmead and Abbey Wood (see diagram). In August 2017, the Government granted permission for the extension and a future provision for a stop at and states that a further extension across the Thames should be provisioned.  History  The Barking Riverside development is a brownfield site of some 440 acres, on the site of the former Barking Power Station. The site has planning permission for around 10,800 homes, however planning restrictions prevent more than 1,200 homes without adequate transport links. An extension of the Docklands Light Railway to Dagenham Dock was proposed in the mid 2000s at a cost of around ¬£750m, however this extension was cancelled in 2008 by then Mayor of London Boris Johnson. Following this, Transport for London assessed various options to bring transport links to Barking Riverside, including the previously proposed DLR extension, extension of the Hammersmith & City line to Grays, new segregated, high frequency bus services and a new station at Renwick Road. Following a decision to extend the Gospel Oak to Barking line to the area in 2014, the proposed route were consulted on in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Following this, a Transport and Works Act Order for the extension and new station was submitted in March 2016. As part of this process, a public inquiry was held in October 2016. The Transport and Works Order was approved in August 2017.  Route  Leaving Barking station towards the south east, the extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking line will follow the London, Tilbury and Southend line for around 2.4km. Passing underneath Renwick Road, a future station at Renwick Road has been passively safeguarded. The extension then turns south, crossing the main line and the Ripple Lane freight yard on a viaduct, as well as crossing over the High Speed 1 tunnels. The viaduct then continues south for 1.5km to the elevated station at Barking Riverside. While the station will be owned by Transport for London, the railway infrastructure will be handed over to Network Rail when completed.  Construction  Following approval of the Transport and Works Order in August 2017, construction on the extension by a joint venture of Morgan Sindall and VolkerFitzpatrick began in late 2018. Construction is expected to take 3 years at a cost of ¬£260m, with the new station opening in December 2021. The station building will be designed by architects Weston Williamson.

The restaurant has a reputation for modern and often unusual food, with modern and artistic presentation. It was awarded a Michelin star in October 2015 and three AA Rosettes in 2016. As of December 2019 it is the only restaurant in Leeds which holds a Michelin star and the second restaurant in the city to have been awarded one.  Overview  O'Hare had previously worked as the head chef at The Blind Swine in York, but considered Leeds a more suitable location for high-end dining and opened The Man Behind The Curtain in 2014. The restaurant is located on Vicar Lane above Flannels clothes shop and takes its name from a line in The Wizard of Oz - 'pay no attention to that man behind the curtain'. After opening the restaurant without a name, O'Hare said: \\"I get a lot of people asking me if I'm the man behind the curtain. You can't stop it, but you can mock it.\\" It is currently the only restaurant in Leeds which holds a Michelin star and the second restaurant in the city to have been awarded one, the first being Jeff Baker's Bistro Moderne which closed in 2013. The restaurant seats up to forty people and is decorated in artwork by O'Hare's friend Schoph and features sculptures by Gareth Griffiths. O'Hare describes the food and ambience of the restaurant as not \\"particularly based on what I wanted, but on what I hated and didn‚Äôt want.\\" = Menu = After opening, The Man Behind The Curtain soon gained a reputation for very modern and often unusual dishes including olives wrapped in edible cellophane, salt and vinegar ox cheek and chocolate pudding and pork rinds. The dishes also have imaginative names, such as 'The Insecurity of Postmen in Oakley Sunglasses' and 'Inception of a Spacecat in Black'. O'Hare doesn't consider himself to have been inspired by anyone, saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you have to say ‚ÄòI am inspired by ‚ÄòX‚Äô... I want things first and foremost to look great. Anyone [at this level] can make something taste nice.\\" He is also keen not to draw comparisons to Noma having worked there under acclaimed chef Ren√© Redzepi, saying \\"it‚Äôs not what we are doing here.‚Äù The Man Behind The Curtain serves a twelve-course d√©gustation menu, with O'Hare describing a lot of food as \\"quite Spanish\\" because it is the style of food he enjoys eating.  Reception  Writing in The Guardian in 2015, Marina O'Loughlin said \\"there are items that jar\\" but \\"if a chef can put a silky foam of potato laced with puffed wild rice on top of an elaborate chocolate dessert and have you laughing out loud as you fight over it (turns out it‚Äôs scented like a salt and vinegar crisp), he‚Äôs doing something very right.\\" In a review for Great British Chefs, Gemma Harrison wrote \\"it blew my mind ‚Äì and I can‚Äôt wait to go back and have it blown all over again.\\" Time Out rated the restaurant 4 stars out of 5 in 2016 and said, although not cheap, \\"a destination restaurant that‚Äôs truly worth a visit.\\" The restaurant was awarded a Michelin Star after just over one year of opening, and awarded three AA Rosettes in September 2016.

External discoloration is accumulation of stains on the tooth surface. Internal discoloration is due to absorption of pigment particles into tooth structure. Sometimes there are several different co-existent factors responsible for discoloration. Normal tooth shade Cross-sectional diagram of a molar tooth. 1: crown, 2: root, 3: enamel, 4: dentin and dentin tubules, 5: pulp chamber, 6: blood vessels and nerve within root canal, 7: periodontal ligament, 8: apex and periapical region, 9: alveolar bone value chroma; A: red-brown, B: red-yellow, C: grey, D: red-grey The appearance and perception of a tooth is the result of a complex interaction of factors such as lighting conditions, translucency, opacity, light scattering, gloss and the human eye and brain. Of these, the intrinsic pigmentation of a tooth is the most influential, which in turn is determined by genetic and natural factors. Light hitting a tooth undergoes reflection, absorption and transmission by varying degrees in each tissue layer of the tooth substance. Reflected light detected by the human eye determines the perceived appearance of a tooth. Teeth have a thin enamel layer on the outer surface. The enamel layer is whiter and semitransparent, and contributes blue, pink green tints to the tooth color. The underlying dentin layer is darker than enamel, yellow-brown in color, and less transparent. Dentin forms the bulk of the tooth substance, and contributes most to the overall tooth color. At the core of the tooth is soft connective tissue termed the dental pulp. The pulp is pink/red due to its vascularity, but is rarely visible through the overlying enamel and dentin unless the thickness of these layers is reduced by tooth wear (or rarely internal resorption). Public opinion of what is normal tooth shade tends to be distorted. Portrayals of cosmetically enhanced teeth are common in the media. In one report, the most common tooth shade in the general population ranged from A1 to A3 on the VITA classical A1-D4 shade guide. Tooth color varies according to race, gender and geographic region. Females generally have slightly whiter teeth than males, partly because females' teeth are smaller, and therefore there is less bulk of dentin, partially visible through the enamel layer. For the same reason, larger teeth such as the molars and the canine (cuspid) teeth tend to be darker. Baby teeth (deciduous teeth) are generally whiter than the adult teeth that follow, again due to differences in the ratio of enamel to dentin. Causes =Extrinsic discoloration= The stained teeth of a regular betel chewer in Burma Extrinsic discolorations are common and have many different causes. The same range of factors are capable of staining the surface of restorations (e.g., composite fillings, porcelain crowns). Some extrinsic discolorations that are allowed to remain for a long time may become intrinsic. * Dental plaque: Although usually virtually invisible on the tooth surface, plaque may become stained by chromogenic bacteria such as Actinomyces species. * Calculus: Neglected plaque eventually calcifies, and leads to formation of a hard deposit on the teeth, especially around the gumline. The color of calculus varies, and may be grey, yellow, black or brown. * Tobacco: Tar in smoke from tobacco products (and also smokeless tobacco products) tends to form a yellow-brown-black stain around the necks of the teeth above the gumline. * Betel chewing. * Certain foods and drinks. Foods, such as vegetables, that are rich with carotenoids or xanthonoids can stain teeth. Ingesting colored liquids like sports drinks, cola, coffee, tea and red wine can discolor teeth. * Certain topical medications. **Chlorhexidine (antiseptic mouthwash) binds to tannins, meaning that prolonged use in persons who consume coffee, tea or red wine is associated with extrinsic staining (i.e., removable staining) of teeth. **Cetylpyridinium chloride, which is found in many antimicrobial mouthwashes, can result in staining due to dead bacterial residue. * Metallic compounds. Exposure to such metallic compounds may be in the form of medication or other environmental exposure. Examples include iron (black stain), iodine (black), copper (green), nickel (green) and cadmium (yellow-brown). * Antibiotics. Tetracycline and its derivatives are capable of intrinsic discoloration (discussed below). However other antibiotics may form insoluble complexes with calcium, iron and other elements that cause extrinsic staining. =Intrinsic discoloration= Causes of intrinsic discoloration generally fall into those that occur during tooth development and those acquired later in life. The known causes of intrinsic staining are listed below, however some causes are unknown. Dental caries Dental caries (tooth decay) begins as an opaque white spot on the surface of the enamel. As demineralization progresses, the various lesion eventually cavitates and the underlying brown color becomes visible. Fluorosis Mild fluorosis: mostly on the upper right central incisor Severe fluorosis: mottled enamel of an individual from a region with high levels of naturally occurring fluoride Fluorosis may occur when there is chronic and excessive exposure to fluoride during the years of tooth development. Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral in water, although some regions have higher levels than others, and in some areas fluoride is added to water supplies in low levels to help prevent tooth decay. Exposure can also occur via bottled water and fluoride toothpaste. In its mildest form, fluorosis appears as small opaque white flecks on the enamel surface. More severe cases show severely hypoplastic patches of enamel, which are also prone to accumulation of surface stains. Chronological, fine white bands of fluorosis may be seen that correspond to the times of high exposure to fluoride. Trauma Dental trauma may result in discolorations. Following luxation injuries red discoloration may develop almost instantly. This is due to severance of the venous microcirculation to a tooth, while the arteries continue to supply blood to the pulp. The blood is then decomposed gradually and a blue-brown discoloration develops. Teeth may turn grey following trauma- induced pulp necrosis (death of the pulp). This discoloration typically develops weeks or months after the injury and is caused by incorporation of pigments released during the breakdown of the pulpal tissue and blood into the dentin. Yellow discoloration may occur following pulp canal obliteration, i.e., the sealing up of the pulp. Trauma to a developing adult tooth (e.g., intrusion of a baby tooth into the bone) may affect the enamel layer of the adult tooth. This becomes apparent when the adult tooth erupts into the mouth. Pulp necrosis Teeth die mainly as a result of extensive tooth decay, however this may also occur following dental trauma or heavy drilling down of the tooth during tooth preparation prior to restoration. Internal resorption Internal resorption of the left maxillary lateral incisor (right in photograph), giving rise to the appearance termed \\"Pink tooth of Mummery\\" Internal resorption may sometimes follow dental trauma (although in other cases it appears unrelated). This is where the dentin is resorbed and replaced instead by hyperplastic, vascular pulp tissue. As this process starts to approach the external surface of the tooth, a pink hue of this replacement pulp tissue may become visible through the remaining overlying tooth substance. This appearance is sometimes termed \\"pink tooth of Mummery\\". Root canal treatment Internal staining is common following root canal treatment, however the exact causes for this are not completely understood. Failure to completely clean out the necrotic soft tissue of the pulp system may cause staining, and certain root canal materials (e.g., gutta percha and root canal sealer cements) can also. Another possible factor is the lack of pulp pressure in dentinal tubules once the pulp is removed, leading to incorporation of dietary stains in dentin. Amalgam fillings Amalgam filling: giving overall darker appearance to the tooth Amalgam fillings often stain the tooth they are placed in. This is most noticeable in very old fillings, as pigment slowly leaches out of the amalgam filling material and its associated corroded surfaces. In addition, metallic fillings cast a shadow that can be visible through the tooth and make it appear darker. Tetracycline and tetracycline-derivatives Tetracycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic, and its derivative minocycline is common in the treatment of acne. The drug is able to chelate calcium ions and is incorporated into teeth, cartilage and bone. Ingestion during the years of tooth development causes a yellow-green discoloration of dentin, which is visible through the enamel and fluorescent under ultraviolet light. Later, the tetracycline oxidizes and the staining becomes more brown and no longer fluoresces under UV light. Other drugs derived from tetracycline such as glycylcycline share this side effect. Because tetracyclines cross the placenta, a child may have tooth staining if the drugs are administered during the mother's pregnancy. Genetic disorders Several genetic disorders affect tooth development (odontogenesis), and lead to abnormal tooth appearance and structure. Enamel hypoplasia and enamel hypocalcification are examples of defective enamel that potentially gives a discolored appearance to the tooth. Teeth affected in this way are also usually more susceptible to further staining acquired throughout life. Amelogenesis imperfecta is a rare condition that affects the formation of enamel (amelogenesis). The enamel is fragile, the teeth appear yellow or brown, and surface stains build up more readily. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a defect of dentin formation, and the teeth may be discolored yellow-brown, deep amber or blue-grey with increased translucency. Dentinal dysplasia is another disorder of dentin. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (Gunther disease) is a rare congenital form of porphyria, and may be associated with red or brown discolored teeth. Hyperbilirubinemia during the years of tooth formation may make bilirubin incorporate into the dental hard tissues, causing yellow-green or blue-green discoloration. One such condition is hemolytic disease of the newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis). Thalassemia and sickle cell anemia may be associated with blue, green or brown tooth discoloration. A high proportion of children with cystic fibrosis have discolored teeth. This is possibly the result of exposure to tetracycline during odontogenesis, however cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator has also been demonstrated to be involved in enamel formation, suggesting that the disease has some influence on tooth discoloration regardless of exposure to tetracyclines. =Aging = Intrinsic discoloration tends to accompany aging. Throughout life deposition of secondary dentin occurs along the internal walls of the pulp chamber. Secondary dentin is darker and more opaque than primary dentin. This gives the dentin an overall darker appearance. At the same time, the enamel layer is gradually thinned by tooth wear processes such as attrition and acid erosion, a degree of which is considered normal. Enamel also becomes less porous and phosphate deficient. Management Discoloration of the front teeth is one of the most common reasons people seek dental care. However, many people with teeth of normal shade ask for them to be whitened. Management of tooth discoloration depends on the cause. Most discoloration is harmless and may or may not be of cosmetic concern to the individual. In other cases it may indicate underlying pathology such as pulp necrosis or rarely a systemic disorder. Most extrinsic discoloration is readily removed by cleaning the teeth, whether with \\"whitening\\" (i.e., abrasive) toothpaste at home, or as treatment carried out by a professional (e.g., scaling and/or polishing).

Negretti has also worked as communications and press aide to Puerto Rico's House Speaker and for a Senator from San Juan and is often invited by educational institutions to give lectures regarding her literary work. Early years Negretti was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico Her paternal family is of Italian origin due to the 1904 arrival in San Juan of her grandfather Giovanni Negretti-Odescalchi, an architect and engineer born and raised in Como (Lombardy,) who had recently graduated from Sorbonne University in Paris and had been hired by the Porto Rico Railroad Company to oversee the expansion of the railway and design the railroad system's stations. He took up residence in Old San Juan after becoming the vice president of the company and marrying Puerto Rican Emilia Santisteban. Negretti's maternal family is of French extraction due to the 1900 arrival in Puerto Rico of her great grandfather, businessman Gustave Emile Lavergne, who emigrated from the city of Nantes (France) and who after marrying Naguabo native Emilia G√≥mez-Vargas, established residence in Vieques (an island- municipality of Puerto Rico.) After Negretti's father, Gino P. Negretti, graduated from Law School, he established his practice in Miami (USA) in 1951, wherefore Negretti became bilingual at an early age. Upon her return to San Juan after her parent's divorce in 1954, the family ‚Äì her mother Fe Josefina Lavergne, who worked for decades in the insurance business in San Juan and her brother Gino ‚Äì established their residence in San Juan's suburban area of Hato Rey, where Negretti attended Colegio Esp√≠ritu Santo (a Catholic educational center) until the eighth grade. She was then enrolled at University High School in nearby R√≠o Piedras, where during three consecutive years she was the editor of the school's newspaper, Campus UHS. During those years she was introduced to the world of arts and literature by her paternal uncle, Boris Negretti, who often took her to his friends‚Äô literary circle meetings, to the theatre and to museum and art gallery exhibitions in San Juan as well as providing her with many contemporary works of literature. Also contributing to her love of literature was her high school Spanish teacher, Dr. Carmen Turull- Garc√≠a, who constantly persuaded her to write. Negretti spent summers with her father in Miami, where he hired her as a legal assistant, an opportunity that allowed her to acquire basic legal knowledge that she put to use when she became a news reporter. At the time she attended the University of Puerto Rico the institution did not have a School of Journalism and she enrolled as a student in the Humanities Department, which provided students with the opportunity of taking a series of classes offered by veteran journalists, among them professor Jos√© Pirulo Hern√°ndez, who due to the fact that many of his students became renowned news reporters, editorialists, columnists and writers, was known as the Educator of Journalists. Journalism In 1978 professor Hern√°ndez recommended Negretti, who was living with her husband and children in Florida, for an internship at the newspapers Hialeah Home News y Miami Springs News, both owned by Elmer Rounds, a veteran Associated Press journalist who had gained fame after working as news correspondent for the news agency during the Cuban Revolution and the crisis in Nicaragua. After completing her internship, Rounds offered Negretti a job as editor-in-chief of the new 10-page Spanish section of the Hialeah Home News, which allowed her to gain knowledge of all the phases of news publishing. Upon her return to Puerto Rico, Negretti was hired by Luis Villares, editor-in-chief of the San Juan- based newspaper El Mundo as copy editor and later as news reporter, which allowed her to learn ‚Äòthe tricks of news reporting that can only be acquired by working a beat‚Äô under the wings of renown Puerto Rican journalists such as Mal√©n Rojas Daporta, Luis Romero Cuevas, Juan Tato Ramos and Luis Cab√°n. Her most memorable report while working for El Mundo was a two-part front-page article in which the residents and the mayor of Vieques, as well as the staff of the island-municipality's only medical facility decried the poor state of affairs at the center. The article prompted the government to eventually revamp the existing medical facilities while the construction of a new one took place. Negretti's incursion in radio news programs was due to her recruitment as producer of news programs by Victelio Mart√≠nez, news director at WQII, Noticias 1140, (Guaynabo, Puerto Rico,) Three months after accepting the job she became a news reporter for the station and among the stories she covered was the situation endured by 800 Haitians detained at Fort Allen, a military base in Juana D√≠az (Puerto Rico) after the U.S. Immigration Office signed a contract with the Puerto Rican government that allowed the agency's use of the military facility for the detention of refugees. Negretti was the first news reporter to gain entrance to the base and interview several detainees, after which she reported a series of human rights violations at the center that impacted the Puerto Rican public as well as the international community, which in turn generated the visit of Noble Peace Prize winner, Argentinian Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel to the detention center. In 1984 Negretti was recruited by news director Ram√≥n Cotta as a reporter for Eyewitness News, a newscast transmitted in English by WPRV-TV Channel 13, the ABC (American Broadcasting System) affiliate in San Juan. In a short span of time she was assigned to cover the political beat, which meant her daily work entailed the coverage of the governor, the State Department and the Capitol. After working six months at the station, she became co-anchor of the evening newscast along with Christopher Crommett, a renowned journalist who later became the director of CNN Espa√±ol (CNN in Spanish) in Atlanta, Georgia. Within the year Negretti was awarded an Agueyban√° award by the Higher Council of Arts of Puerto Rico) for Paradise Lost, an investigative report on criminality in the form of a documentary for which she became a jack-of-all-trades by undertaking the investigative work, writing the script and also producing it. This documentary was used by Francisco Aponte-P√©rez, a former senator and a University of Puerto Rico's Law School professor as a learning tool in his classes. Later on Negretti was handed two INTRE (acronym in Spanish for Radio and Television Ethics Institute) awards for excellence in the coverage of political news and for her television coverage of the murder trial against Puerto Rican actress Lydia Echevarr√≠a. Her reports on the so-called Mameyes Disaster (1985,) the landslide of a hill near the city of Ponce that caused the death of more than 100 people and the New Year's Eve DuPont Plaza Hotel fire in San Juan (1986,) in which 97 people lost their lives and 140 others were injured, gained her two awards issued by the Senate of Puerto Rico. Negretti's exclusive interview of the wife of H√©ctor Escudero-Aponte, a DuPont Plaza Hotel employee and Teamsters union member who was found guilty of starting the fire at the hotel, was published in the front page of The New York Times and her daily televised reports of the aftermath of the fire and the government investigation of the catastrophe were transmitted by all ABC affiliates throughout the United States. Her exclusive report on the alleged illegal appropriation of Puerto Rican patrimony by a prominent American treasure hunter, released shortly before the latter was supposedly about to depart Puerto Rico with several gold ingots found in a Spanish galleon that had sunk in waters of Vieques during the 17th Century, generated a joint investigation by the Puerto Rico legislature and the filing of a law to protect the island's national patrimony. Another of her exclusive reports was able to generate enough public pressure to force the government to maintain free access, as dictated by law, to Las Pic√∫as Beach in R√≠o Grande in order to allow local fishermen to regain direct access to their boats and be able to work. The vice president of Puerto Rico's Journalists Association, Carmen Rita P√©rez, recruited Negretti in 1987 to conduct Frente al pueblo (In front of the people,) a televised program produced by the association and in which the moderator steered the discussion of important issues by high-profile personalities. Transmitted on a weekly basis by WIPR-TV, Canal 6 (San Juan,) the program increased its ratings during the year Negretti served as moderator. After the closure of WPRV-TV, Negretti was recruited by House Speaker Jos√© Ronaldo ‚ÄúRony‚Äù Jarabo as press, communications and public relations aide. She later worked for the San Juan- based daily The San Juan Star, where she was a member of the editing staff and then as a reporter for the newspaper's magazine Weekend. During that time, Negretti held an exclusive interview with famed Puerto Rican musician and band leader Tito Puente that was published as a two-page spread that is still used as reference by many institutions and individuals. While working for The San Juan Star she was recruited by El Oriental newspaper in Humacao (Puerto Rico,) owned by Pierantoni Enterprises, to be editor-in-chief of a special 200-page edition of the newspaper commemorating the 200th anniversary of the founding of the city of Humacao (1993.) A copy of that edition was placed inside a vacuum-sealed container and buried under the monument dedicated to Ta√≠no chief Jumacao, located in the outskirts of the city. The container will be opened in 2093. Negretti also worked as senior copywriter with Better Communications Group, an advertising agency located in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, as press, communications and public relations officer for Technical and Scientific Services, located in R√≠o Piedras and directed by chemist and renowned environmentalist Neftal√≠ Garc√≠a, and as press, communications and public relations aide to San Juan senator Jos√© Ortiz Daliot. While she worked for Ortiz Daliot, Negretti organized the First Symposium on Autism, the first activity of this type held anywhere, which was held in Ponce (Puerto Rico.) As a result, she represented the Senate of Puerto Rico at a three-day symposium on autism held by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., where she was one of the main speakers. Literary works ;La buenaventura The publication of La buenaventura in 2005 caused a great uproar within the Catholic Church in Puerto Rico due to its contents. An investigative report written as a narrative, the first part of the book is based on the memoirs of a Puerto Rican peasant describing an alleged 10-year- long Marian apparition at La Santa Monta√±a de Puerto Rico (The Sacred Mountain of Puerto Rico) located in the municipality of San Lorenzo. The second part of the book deals with an alleged conspiracy between several of the island's priests and high-ranking church authorities to oust the bishop of the Diocese of Caguas, Monsignor Enrique Hern√°ndez, by using the results of the investigation of the events at La Santa Monta√±a ordered by the prelate as spearhead in what turned out to be an alleged full-fledged war against him. La buenaventura (The good venture) soon became a bestseller at the three Borders bookstores in Puerto Rico and remained on its top-10 bestseller list for eight months between 2005 and 2006. ;Tiempos revueltos Tiempos revueltos, published in 2008, is a historical novel which narrates in detail El Grito de Jayuya, (The Outcry at Jayuya) the Nationalist revolution that took place in Puerto Rico in 1950 against the United States, during which the Republic of Puerto Rico was able to survive four days after its proclamation. The book was translated into English under the title \\"Times of Upheaval\\". This historical milestone is narrated from the perspective of the commander of the revolutionary forces in Jayuya, Elio Torresola and his close relatives: his first cousin Blanca Canales, leader of the Nationalist movement in Jayuya; his sister Angelina, who was married to one of the revolutionaries and was later designated acting president of the Nationalist Party; his sister Doris, who was an aide to freedom champion and Nationalist Party president Pedro Albizu- Campos; his brother Griselio, who extended the revolution to the United States by assaulting Blair House, the temporary residence of president Harry Truman in W√°shington; his son Elio Ariel and one of his closest friends, Jayuya resident and Puerto Rican Independence Party follower Sigfredo Rodr√≠guez. Tiempos revueltos contains a detailed description of the crimes perpetrated by the United States against the people of Puerto Rico during the 20th Century as well as the history of the Nationalist Party and the challenges the organization confronted. The sources of information used to write the novel include interviews with members of the Nationalist army, Torresola family members and their relatives and friends, residents of Jayuya in 1950, the so- called FBI Secret Files on Puerto Rico, released in their entirety to the public by a congressional order and related to the surveillance and compilation of data on nationalists and independence advocates and, more than 600 other sources of information located in the University of Puerto Rico's Puerto Rican Collection, newspaper and periodical libraries and film archives in Puerto Rico, Cuba and the United States. Several universities and high schools in Puerto Rico have included Tiempos revueltos in their compulsory reading lists and in 2015, during a tribute rendered to him in Havana for being part of the 1950 revolutionary feat and for his unyielding patriotism throughout the years, Jayuya revolutionary Heriberto Mar√≠n handed a copy of Tiempos revueltos to Ricardo Alarc√≥n, the president of Cuba's National Assembly (1993-2013) considered for many years the third most powerful political figure in Cuba. ;¬øLobos o Ungidos? ¬øLobos o ungidos? (Wolves or anointed?) was published in 2013; this narrative details the investigation and the efforts undertaken to unravel the events that took place at La Santa Monta√±a de Puerto Rico between 1899 and 2013, including those that took place after the reappearance of the blood allegedly shed at the mountain by Nuestra Madre, the name given by the peasants to the figure they claim was present on the peak between 1899 and 1909. 'Nuestra madre Nuestra madre (Our mother) is a second narrative which completes the trilogy (along with La buenaventura and ¬øLobos o ungidos?) and delves into the mystery of La Santa Monta√±a de Puerto Rico. Published in 2014, it contains a synopsis of La buenaventura, the latest events regarding the alleged Marian apparition at the mountain, an interview with the bishop emeritus of the Diocese of Caguas, Monsignor Enrique Hern√°ndez and testimonies of people who claim they have been healed at the mountain through the intercession of the Virgin Mary or have supposedly witnessed miraculous events there. ;;Sabras que te quiero Sabr√°s que te quiero (Know that I love you) was published in 2017, this is Negretti's second historical novel. The book narrates the indomitable patriotic spirit, the immense love for her family and for the city in which she was born, as well as the social, political and personal events that affected the life of Old San Juan native Emilia Santisteban (n√©e Maldonado) since her 1863 birth until her death in 1952, especially those that took place once she promised to never again step on American soil after having witnessed the October 18, 1898 ceremony at Plaza de Armas (Arms Square) in which invading U.S. troops took over the capital. The political and social history of the island and the customs, as well as the idiosyncrasy of the Puerto Rican people during the 19th Century and the first half of the 20th century are recreated in detail in this novel, for which the author consulted over 400 sources of information. ;;Cascabel de la Luna Cascabel de la Luna (2019) El bohique de Bieke dio por sentado que hab√≠a logrado cerrar el portal aleda√±o a la tumba del gran ancestro araguac√∫, evitando as√≠ la desapareci√≥n de mujeres duranre las noches de luna llena.

The ICTD also received funding from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), which ran until March 2016. Founded in 2010, its mission is to generate knowledge that will help developing countries to mobilise domestic resources efficiently, effectively, and equitably, and develop tax systems that promote good governance and pro-poor economic growth. The ICTD fosters a network of social science researchers from developing countries to engage with taxation issues by funding research, building research capacity through courses and workshops, and collaborating with a range of partners including various African tax administrations, UNU-WIDER, the Munk School of Global Affairs, and the Chr. Michelsen Institute. It also aims to disseminate its research evidence to policymakers through its publications and annual centre meetings in Africa. By sharing its research findings, the ICTD aims to widen the public debate on taxation and governance in developing countries. Research The ICTD's research aims to generate knowledge to help develop better tax systems in the developing world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. To this end, the ICTD conducts and provides grants for research along the following themes: * Tax administration and compliance * Tax and governance * Subnational and property tax * Informal tax *International tax * Tax, welfare, and inequality * Gender and tax In order to facilitate better research on tax issues, the ICTD created the Government Revenue Dataset, the most complete and accurate cross-country dataset on government revenue, which importantly separates natural resource revenue from other revenue streams. In early 2019, UNU-WIDER launched the GRD Explorer, a tool that allows users to quickly and easily access and visualise the data contained in the Government Revenue Dataset. Publications ICTD has published and supported the publication of many working papers, policy briefings, journal articles, and books. They also publish 2-page brief summaries of their research, available in both English and French. In July 2018, Taxing Africa was published by Zed Books as a part of their African Arguments series. The book offers a cutting-edge analysis on all aspects of the continent‚Äôs tax regime, displaying the crucial role such arrangements have on attempts to create social justice and push economic advancement. From tax evasion by multinational corporations and African elites to how ordinary people navigate complex webs of ‚Äòinformal‚Äô local taxation, the book examines the potential for reform, and how space might be created for enabling locally- led strategies.  Networks  The ICTD have three research networks. = African Property Tax Initiative = The African Property Tax Initiative (APTI) stimulates and encourages wider use of more effective property tax systems in Africa. The ICTD is working to build the critical mass needed to successfully support African governments that are considering or currently undertaking property tax reforms. To this end, APTI is currently engaged in establishing a well-resourced network of property tax practitioners, policymakers, and researchers who can support and learn from each other. APTI also produces and disseminates robust research on key themes to inform policy and practice. APTI‚Äôs activities focus on four priority themes: # Strengthening the use of information technology for property tax, # Exploring locally appropriate approaches to valuation, # Examining the roles of local and central governments in property tax collection, and # Investigating the link between property taxation and public services in enhancing the relationship between governments and citizens. = Ethiopian Tax Research Network = The Ethiopian Tax Research Network (ETRN) is a new initiative of the ICTD funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and hosted at the Ethiopian Development Research Institute. The ETRN is dedicated to enhancing the generation and exchange of tax knowledge in Ethiopia. It is concerned with all topics related to taxation, ranging from tax policy to tax administration, and from academic papers to practical case studies. The ETRN was officially launched on the 20th of September 2017 at the Capital Hotel in Addis Ababa, with over 100 attendees. The main objectives of the ETRN are to: * Provide a platform for knowledge exchange and evidence-based debate on tax issues through workshops, conferences, and publications. * Support the production of high-quality, policy-relevant research, especially that led and undertaken by Ethiopian researchers, by providing funding and capacity development. * Facilitate coordination and complementarity between existing projects and actors active in the area of taxation in Ethiopia. = Nigerian Tax Research Network = With funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the ICTD launched the Nigerian Tax Research Network (NTRN) to support the generation and exchange of tax knowledge in Nigeria, with stakeholders including tax practitioners and researchers from Nigerian and international organisations.

Some writers deny consciously organizing articles according to specific structures, but may use them to describe the writing post hoc. Others recognize a style within a developing story and use it to develop the narrative. Still others may be required to pursue a specific style from the beginning by publisher guidelines. The relevant portion also appears as \\"Crafting a strong feature article\\" in Writer's Digest, November/December 2015.  Structures  Some of the structure types include: = Inverted pyramid = The inverted pyramid structure begins with the latest or most important developments, then provides greater description and detail, tapering off with less significant events of relevance. Proponents of this structure, which is common in news reporting, may criticize other styles as \\"burying the lead\\", though others criticize it as a dull style that \\"tells the joke by starting at the punch line\\". Because this structure is designed to permit truncation by an editor, authors do not need to plan a specific ending as they might with other styles. However not all articles contain all elements of the pyramid = Narrative = A narrative structure is a straightforward, chronological description of events. For example, an article about a set of murders may begin with the discovery of the first victim and end with the imprisonment or execution of a suspect. = Hourglass = The hourglass structure is a combination of inverted pyramid and narrative structures. The author begins with key details (who, what, when, where, and why), and adds details of increasingly lower importance as in the inverted pyramid structure. The story then abruptly \\"turns\\", requiring a clear transition, to focus on a narrative, such as the story of a specific eyewitness or party, which addresses finer details and implications, before making its final conclusion. Like the inverted pyramid, it attempts to satisfy readers who don't complete the article, while continuing to engage readers with greater interest. In broadcast news reporting, the narrative portion may be provided by a reporter on the scene, while the beginning and end are told by an anchor at the studio. The simple narrative portion may be convenient for reporters writing under a deadline. = Nut-graph = An article may begin with an anecdotal \\"hook\\" to catch the reader's attention. This is followed by a \\"nut graph\\" paragraph that summarizes the story as a whole. Body paragraphs then explore these ideas in greater detail, provide useful background, or explain conflicting opinions. = Diamond = The diamond structure is similar to a nut graph, with anecdotal hook, nut graph, and a wealth of general detail, but then progressively narrows these issues and applies them to the anecdote introduced in the hook. The story may be considered as a \\"quest\\" to understand the situation of a single individual. A journalism class may require this structure for an opinion story. = Christmas tree = The \\"Christmas tree\\" shape of this story broadens out from the introduction and a series of internal turning points or surprises within the narrative, before coming to a final conclusion. For example, the subject may be revealed to (a) HIV, (b) be unresponsive to existing drugs, (c) learn of an experimental study, but (d) doesn't know if it will work. Each of these turning points provides the basis for further development of the story. = Organic = The organic structure, as expounded by Jon Franklin, is composed at its most basic level of visual imagery that provides a cinematic feel. These are linked into \\"foci\\" that detail an action, which are in turn linked by \\"transitions in time, mood, subject and character\\". A typical sequence of foci may be complication, development, and resolution. = Five-boxes = Credited to Rick Bragg, the \\"five boxes\\" of this structure are a standard progression: A hook that attracts the reader's attention with a specific image or detail; a nut graph summary; a second lead that introduces remaining facts; details of secondary importance; and a \\"kicker\\": a strong image, comment, or quotation that provides a strong conclusion.

He was committed to the Catholic Church and to Christian democracy. He ran the Bloud et Gay publishing house for many years, and edited the influential journals La Vie Catholique (Catholic Life) and l'Aube (The Dawn). He helped publish clandestine journals during the German occupation of France in World War II (1939‚Äì45). After the war he was a deputy from 1945 to 1951, and participated in three cabinets in 1945‚Äì46. Early years Francisque Gay was born on 2 May 1885 in Roanne, Loire, son of a plumbing contractor. He was educated by the Marists of Charlieu, then by the Lazarists of Lyon. In 1903, when he was aged 18, Gay helped at the national congress of the Cercles d'√©tudes (Study Circles) in Lyon. There he was impressed by the views of Marc Sangnier, founder of Le Sillon (The Furrow). He went to Paris to visit Sangnier at his home on the boulevard Raspail and to offer his help with Le Sillon. He was deeply influenced by Sangnier's views on Social Catholicism, and founded a branch of Le Sillon in Roanne. He contributed to Le Sillon's journal, D√©mocratie. Gay became more deeply involved in Catholicism, and in 1905 entered the Major Seminary of Francheville. He left when the seminary closed in December 1906 and moved to Paris, where he studied at the Sorbonne faculty of letters. He then moved to Montpellier where he was accepted as an English teacher by a religious college. Publisher In 1909 Gay abandoned teaching and obtained a job with Bloud & Cie, a publisher. He had met one of the owners, Edmond Bloud, through Le Sillon. Henri Bloud, Edmond's brother and co-owner of the publishing house, retired on 29 April 1911. He sold part of his share to Edmond Bloud, who now owned 60% of the enterprise, and part to Francisque Gay, who now owned 40%. The company name was changed to \\"Bloud et Gay\\". On 20 May 1911 Gay married Blanche Marie Fromillon. They would have six children. On 30 December 1922 Bloud & Gay became a soci√©t√© anonyme, a publicly held company. Edmond Bloud was active in politics, and from 1924 reduced his involvement in the company to one day per week. In the 1920s and 1930s Gay was one of the leading polemicists for the Christian democratic movement. In 1924 he joined the Popular Democratic Party (Parti d√©mocrate populaire, PDP). That year he launched the weekly La Vie Catholique (Catholic Life). In 1926 La Vie Catholique defended Pope Pius XI's condemnation of the far-right Action Fran√ßaise. On 1 January 1927 the Pope sent a telegram to Gay thanking him for the courage of La Vie catholique. In 1927 Gay founded the Volontaires du Pape (Volunteers of the Pope) to disseminate Social Catholicism throughout Europe, and arranged a large pilgrimage to Rome with this organization in 1929. Gay also founded L'Almanach catholique, then in 1932 L'Aube (The Dawn). L'Aube presented Christian democratic views, and was notable for the editorials of Georges Bidault. In 1938 Gay and Bidault, who also belonged to the PDP, founded the New French Team (Nouvelles Equipes Fran√ßaises, NEF). The purpose was to pull together Christian Democrats against the rising dangers of Fascism. Gay's journalistic activity was reduced with the approach of World War II (1939‚Äì45). La Vie catholique was closed in 1938 and L'Aube closed in June 1940. World War II Francisque Gay became active in the French Resistance, using the Lyon and Paris premises of his publishing house as a base. He helped publish the clandestine reviews La France continue and Les cahiers politiques. In March 1944 he escaped arrest by the Gestapo and went into hiding until the Liberation of Paris in August 1944. L'Aube reappeared on 23 August 1944 during the height of the Paris uprising. In November 1944 Gay, Georges Bidault and others founded the Popular Republican Movement (Mouvement R√©publicain Populaire, MRP). Also in November 1944 Gay was appointed to the Provisional Consultative Assembly and was made a member of the committees on National Education and on Information and Propaganda. Gay was appointed head of the Press department of the Ministry of Information. Later career Plaque at 3 Rue Garanci√®re, Paris 6e, Seat of Bloud & Cie, which became Bloud & Gay in 1911 Gay was elected to the first National Constituent Assembly on the MRP platform for the first district of the Seine. He voted against the draft constitution of 19 April 1946. He was reelected to the second National Constituent Assembly and voted for the draft constitution of 28 September 1946, which was ratified by a popular referendum. Gay was deputy for the Seine from 1946 to 1951. He was Minister of State from 21 November 1945 to 26 January 1946 in the cabinet of Charles de Gaulle. He was Vice-President of the Council (deputy to the President) from 26 January 1946 to 24 June 1946. He was again Minister of State from 24 June 1946 to 16 December 1946 in the cabinet of Georges Bidault. Gay was ambassador to Canada from April 1948 to October 1949. Gay became disillusioned with politics. He felt that the MRP was too conservative, particularly on colonial issues. He did not stand for reelection in July 1951, but returned to his publishing business, He sold this business in 1954 to Descl√©e et Cie. He died in Paris on 23 October 1963 after suffering a heart attack.

It was theoretically abolished by President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, but this had little effect in Florida. Slavery continued until the end of the Civil War and collapse of the Confederacy in the spring of 1865, followed by the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865. Some of the characteristics of slavery ‚Äî inability to leave a disagreeable situation ‚Äî continued under sharecropping, convict leasing, vagrancy laws. In the 20th and 21st centuries, conditions approximating slavery are found among marginal immigrant populations, especially migrant farm workers and involuntary sex workers.  Spanish Florida  The first African slave in the region, Estevanico, was brought to the area as a leader in a Spanish expedition in 1528. The peninsula of modern- day Florida was under the control of Spain until the mid-1700s, when it was briefly owned by the British, only to be returned to Spain a few years later. The Spaniards did not bring many slaves to Florida as there was no work for them to do‚Äîno mines, no plantations. Very few Spaniards came to Florida; there were only three military/naval support outposts: St. Augustine, St. Marks, and what is today called Pensacola. Prior to the colony being turned over to the British, there was a period in the early 1700s during which Spanish Florida was a hotbed for the raiding natives from the northern Carolina and Georgia areas. Though they were left alone for the most part by one of the original raiding groups, the Westos, Spanish Florida was heavily targeted by the later raiding groups the Yamasee and Creek. These raids, in which villages were destroyed and natives were either captured or killed, drove the natives to the hands of the Spanish, who attempted to protect them as best they could from the invaders. However, the strength of the Spanish dwindled and as the raids continued the Spanish and natives were forced to retreat farther and farther back into the peninsula. The raids were so frequent that there were few natives left to capture, and so the Yamasee and the Creek began bringing fewer and fewer slaves to the Carolina colonies and were unable to effectively continue the trade. The retreat of the Spanish was only ended when the Yamasee and Creek entered what would later be known as the Yamasee War with the Carolina colony.Ethridge, Robbie Franklyn, and Sheri Marie Shuck-Hall. 2009. Mapping the Mississippian Shatter Zone: The Colonial Indian Slave Trade and Regional Instability in the American South. U of Nebraska Press. Since the beginning of the 18th century, Spanish Florida attracted numerous African slaves who had escaped from British slavery in the thirteen colonies. Once the slaves reached Florida, the Spanish freed them if they converted to Roman Catholicism. Most settled in Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, the first settlement of free slaves in North America. Another, smaller group settled along the Apalachicola River in remote northwest Florida, centered on Prospect Bluff, future site of the famous Negro Fort. A store or trading post was set up there about 1800. The former slaves also found refuge among the Creek and Seminole, Native Americans who had established settlements in Florida at the invitation of the Spanish government. In 1771, Governor John Moultrie wrote to the English Board of Trade, \\"It has been a practice for a good while past, for negroes to run away from their Masters, and get into the Indian towns, from whence it proved very difficult to get them back.\\" When British government officials pressured the Native Americans to return the fugitive slaves, they replied that they had \\"merely given hungry people food, and invited the slaveholders to catch the runaways themselves.\\"Miller, E: \\"St. Augustine's British Years,\\" The Journal of the St. Augustine Historical Society, 2001, p. 38. After the American Revolution, slaves from the State of Georgia and the South Carolina Low Country escaped to Florida. The U.S. Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817‚Äì1818 campaign by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War. The United States afterwards effectively controlled East Florida. According to Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, the US had to take action there because Florida had become \\"a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.\\"Alexander Deconde, A History of American Foreign Policy (1963) p. 127 Spain requested British intervention, but London declined to assist Spain in the negotiations. Some of President James Monroe's cabinet demanded Jackson's immediate dismissal, but Adams realized that it put the U.S. in a favorable diplomatic position, allowing him to negotiate very favorable terms.Weeks (2002) As Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons, the Crown decided to cede the territory to the United States. It accomplished this through the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty, which took effect in 1821. Florida under American rule Florida became an organized territory of the United States on February 22, 1821, and allowed slavery. =Free negros were unwanted= The free blacks and Indian slaves, Black Seminoles, living near St. Augustine fled to Havana, Cuba, to avoid coming under US control. Some Seminole also abandoned their settlements and moved further south. Hundreds of Black Seminoles and fugitive slaves escaped in the early nineteenth century from Cape Florida to The Bahamas, where they settled on Andros Island.Mulroy, Kevin. The Seminole Freedmen: A History (Race and Culture in the American West), Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2007, p. 26 In 1827 free negros were prohibited from entering Florida, and in 1828 those already there were prohibited from assembling in public. In antebellum Florida, \\"Southerners came to believe that the only successful means of removing the threat of free Negroes was to expel them from the southern states or to change their status from free persons to... slaves.\\" Free Negroes were perceived as \\"an evil of no ordinary magnitude,\\" undermining the system of slavery. Slaves had to be shown that there was no advantage in being free; thus, free negroes became victims of the slaveholders' fears. Legislation became more forceful; the free negro had to accept his new role or leave the state, as in fact half the black population of Pensacola and St. Augustine immediately did (they left the country). Some citizens of Leon County, Florida, Florida's most populous and wealthiest county, which wealth was because Leon County had more slaves than any other county in Florida, petitioned the General Assembly to have all free negroes removed from the state. Legislation passed in 1847 required all free Negroes to have a white person as legal guardian; in 1855, an act was passed which prevented free Negroes from entering the state. \\"In 1861, an act was passed requiring all free Negroes in Florida to register with the judge of probate in whose county they resided. The Negro, when registering, had to give his name, age, color, sex, and occupation, and had to pay one dollar to register.... All Negroes over twelve years of age had to have a guardian approved by the probate judge.... The guardian could be sued for any crime committed by the Negro; the Negro could not be sued. Under the new law, any free Negro or mulatto who did not register with the nearest probate judge was classified as a slave and became the lawful property of any white person who claimed possession.\\" =The growth of plantations= American settlers began to establish cotton plantations in northern Florida, which required numerous laborers, which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market and on March 3, 1845, Florida became a slave state of the United States. Almost half the state's population were enslaved African-Americans working on large cotton and sugar plantations, between the Apalachicola and Suwannee rivers in the north-central part of the state. Like the people who owned them, many slaves had come from the coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas. They were part of the Gullah-Geechee culture of the South Carolina Lowcountry. Others were enslaved African- Americans from the Upper South who had been sold to traders taking slaves to the Deep South. By 1860, Florida had 140,424 people, of whom 44% were enslaved and fewer than 1,000 free people of color. Their labor accounted for 85% of the state's cotton production. The 1860 Census also indicated that in central Leon County, which was the center both of the Florida slave trade and of their plantation industry (see Plantations of Leon County), slaves constituted 73% of the population. As elsewhere, their value was greater than all the land of the county. (References in History of Tallahassee, Florida#History of black Tallahassee.) =Secession= In January 1861, nearly all delegates in the Florida Legislature approved an ordinance of secession, declaring Florida to be \\"a sovereign and independent nation\\"‚Äîan apparent reassertion to the preamble in Florida's Constitution of 1838, in which Florida agreed with Congress to be a \\"Free and Independent State.\\" According to William C. Davis, \\"protection of slavery\\" was \\"the explicit reason\\" for Florida's declaring of secession, as well as the creation of the Confederacy itself. Confederate authorities used slaves as teamsters to transport supplies and as laborers in salt works and fisheries. Many Florida slaves working in these coastal industries escaped to the relative safety of Union-controlled enclaves during the American Civil War. Beginning in 1862, Union military activity in East and West Florida encouraged slaves in plantation areas to flee their owners in search of freedom. Some worked on Union ships and, beginning in 1863, with the Emancipation Proclamation, more than a thousand enlisted as soldiers and sailors in the United States Colored Troops of the military.Murphree, R. Boyd. \\"Florida and the Civil War: A Short History\\" , State Archives of Florida. Retrieved on June 5, 2008. Escaped and freed slaves provided Union commanders with valuable intelligence about Confederate troop movements. They also passed back news of Union advances to the men and women who remained enslaved in Confederate-controlled Florida. Planter fears of slave uprisings increased as the war went on.Murphree (2008) In May 1865, Federal control was re- established, and slavery abolished. Human trafficking After California and New York, Florida has the most human trafficking cases in the United States. Florida has had cases of sex trafficking, domestic servitude, and forced labor. Florida has a large agricultural economy and a large immigrant population, which has made it a prime environment for forced labor, particularly in the tomato industry. Concerted efforts have led to the freeing of thousands of slaves in recent years.The Unsavory Story of Industrially Grown Tomatoes The National Human Trafficking Resource Center reported receiving 1,518 calls and emails in 2015 about human trafficking in Florida.

Motion and shift  There is a distinction drawn between a shift and motion in football. Motion occurs when a player is moving at the time of the snap. A shift occurs when one or more players changes their position on the offensive side of the ball before the snap, causing a change in formation. For example, players may line up initially in an I-formation and then shift the two running backs into wide receiver positions to put the offense in a spread formation. A team may shift any number of players into new positions, so long as they all come to a complete stop for a full second before the ball is snapped to start the play. The National Football League defines all motion and shift penalties as \\"illegal motion\\",NFL official rule book while both the NCAA and NFHSAA make a distinction between an \\"illegal shift\\" and \\"illegal motion\\"; an illegal shift refers to players shifting and not coming to a complete stop before the snap, while illegal motion refers to a player who is in motion towards the line of scrimmage, or a player who is not a \\"back\\" in motion.NCAA official football rules In both leagues, however, the penalty for illegal motion/illegal shift is five yards from the previous spot and replay the down. Additionally, the offensive team may be charged with the penalty of a \\"false start\\" if a player on the offense jumps or moves abruptly, simulating the start of the play. This movement is not normally considered a subset of the \\"motion\\" or \\"shift\\" rules, as the player is not judged to be moving into a new pre-snap position; they are merely starting the play too soon. This is also a five yard penalty. History Diagram of the Heisman shift. Both motions and shift were introduced by Amos Alonzo Stagg. The history of college football involves three notable, distinct shifts: *The Minnesota shift, used by the likes of Henry L. Williams. *The Jump shift or Heisman shift, used by the likes of John Heisman. *The Notre Dame Box, used by the likes of Knute Rockne.

Biography  Chase, a Hellenized form of the Arabic name \\"Hasan\\", is mentioned by the De Administrando Imperio, a work compiled in the middle of the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, and the chronicles of Theophanes Continuatus and Georgius Monachus. Along with his younger brother, who received the Christian name Niketas on his baptism, he was reportedly a slave of the patrikios Damian, the parakoimomenos of Emperor Michael III (), implying that they had been captured as prisoners of war during a conflict with the Arabs around the middle of the 9th century or shortly after. It is unclear whether they came alone or with their father Ioube (·º∏ŒøœçŒ≤Œ∑, Hellenized form of Ayyub); it is possible that they came to Byzantium as children, and that Niketas was even born there. Unlike his brother, who converted to Christianity, Chase remained a Muslim throughout his life. Constantine VII asserts that during the reign of his uncle Alexander (), Chase was one of his closest confidantes. Constantine VII further accuses him of having a negative influence on the emperor. According to the chroniclers, he held a fiscal position in the theme of Hellas thereafter. He became quickly hated by the local inhabitants due to his incessant demands, until he was stoned to death before the altar of a church (most likely the converted Parthenon) in Athens. As he was a Muslim, he may have tried to seek sanctuary there, or otherwise his entering of the church may have outraged the congregation leading to his murder. His death took place probably in 915.

The company provides app-based transportation services, including taxi hailing, private car hailing, social ride-sharing and bike sharing; on-demand delivery services; and automobile services, including sales, leasing, financing, maintenance, fleet operation, electric vehicle charging and co-development of vehicles with automakers. History =2012‚Äì2015: Founding of Didi Dache= In June 2012, following eight years, working in Alibaba's sales and Alipay divisions, Cheng Wei founded Didi Dache (), a taxi-hailing app, [through BeiJing XiaoJu Keji Co. (; Xiaoju Â∞èÊ°î means ‚Äúlittle orange.‚Äù )]. ÂòÄÂòÄÊâìËΩ¶ then changed to . ‚ÄúÊª¥Êª¥‚Äù means ‚Äúbeep beep‚Äù in Mandarin (like a car's horn). So Êª¥Êª¥ÊâìËΩ¶ literally means \\"Beep-beep! Mobility\\" The application was the initial incarnation of Didi Chuxing's ride-hailing service, and consisted of an app for consumers to request taxis and other rideshare services for immediate pick up. BeiJing XiaoJu Keji Co. developed the app. In November 2012, Tencent invested $15 million in the company. = 2015: Merger of Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache = A study in December 2013 by Analysis International, estimated that at the time Didi Dache (backed by Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Limited) held approximately 55% of the smartphone-based taxi-hailing market in China (about 150 million Chinese were estimated to use their smartphones to hail taxis). According to the same study, Kuaidi Dache (Âø´ÁöÑÊâìËΩ¶; meaning \\"Fast Taxi\\"), backed by Alibaba Group, held most of the remaining market share. Aggressive fundraising by the two companies resulted in Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache raising US$700 million and US$600 million from private investors, respectively, to sustain their growth in the world's largest transport market. In February 2015 the companies merged to form Didi Kuaidi. In May 2015, Didi Kuaidi spent aggressively to compete with other startups including Yidao Yongche () and Uber (of which Baidu was an investor). The company also added other features to complement its basic taxi- calling function such as new premium vehicle services, functions for carpool and designated driver transportation modes and enhanced accessibility functions for passengers with disabilities. In July 2015, Didi Kuaidi completed a US$2 billion fundraising round, bringing the company's cash reserves to over US$3.5 billion; the same month, Didi Kuaidi was reported to get 80.2% market share in car hire services. Didi Kuaidi's existing stakeholders, including Alibaba, Tencent, Temasek Holdings (Private) Ltd and Coatue Management, participated in the round, alongside new investors including, Capital International Private Equity Fund and Ping An Ventures, part of Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd. The July 2015 fundraise is ranked as the world's largest single fundraising round by any private company, as well as the largest fundraising round for a Chinese mobile internet company at that time. By September 2015, Didi Kuaidi had obtained 80% market share in private car hailing services and 99% of the taxis market share. The same month, Didi Kuaidi announced the launch of a rebrand process, including a plan to rename itself \\"Didi Chuxing\\". Following the rebrand, in December 2015, taxi drivers concerned with the potential risk of ride-hailing applications cutting into their business protested against Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, forcing both companies to close their offices in the city of Luoyang. =2016: Acquisition of Uber China= By the beginning of 2016, Uber China, which started its Chinese operations in 2015, had become a major competitor to Didi Kuaidi. Uber's then-CEO, Travis Kalanick, claimed the company was losing over US$1 billion annually in China. In June 2016, DiDi closed a US$4.5 billion fundraising round, with investors including Apple Inc., China Life Insurance Co., and a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. As part of the round, DiDi secured a $2.5 billion syndicated loan arranged by China Merchants Bank Co. This equity share fundraising round is one of the world's largest by any private company, surpassing the previous record set by DiDi. On 1 August 2016, DiDi announced that it would acquire Uber China in an acquisition valuing Uber China at US$35 billion. [47][48][49] As part of the deal, Uber acquired 5.89% of the combined Chinese company with preferred equity interest which at the time equated to a 17.7% economic interest in DiDi. The transaction also provided DiDi with a minority equity interest in Uber. In April 2019, Uber released a public version of its S-1 filing ahead of its planned initial public offering. As part of the filing, Uber revealed that at the time of filing, the company owned a 15.4% stake in DiDi. Uber's stake in the company was diluted (from 17.7% in 2016 to the 2019 stake) as a result of new investments from additional investors since 2016. = 2017‚Äìpresent: business expansion, crisis and safety system enhancement = In March 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank Group Corporation approached DiDi with an offer to invest $6 billion in the company to fund the ride- hailing firm's expansion in self-driving car technologies, with a significant portion of the money to come from SoftBank's then-planned $100 billion Vision Fund. On 28 April 2017, DiDi announced it closed a new financing round of over US$5.5 billion to support its global expansion strategy and continued investments in AI-based technologies. The round valued the company at US$50 billion. In December 2017, Reuters reported that DiDi had raised $4 billion for a global push into foreign markets and investments into technologies such as Artificial Intelligence. In May 2018 the company received a wave of negative media coverage when a female passenger on the company's Hitch social carpooling service was murdered by her driver. In August of the same year, a second female passenger was raped and killed by her driver using the same Hitch service on the DiDi platform. Following these incidents, DiDi suspended its Hitch services in August 2018, and began to reform its platform with improved safety standards. In September 2018, Didi announced an investment of $20 million in customer service, The app's safety updates included an evolving set of safety precautions and in-app functions, including the formation of an in-app safety center, en-route audio recording, police assistance button and blocking function to restrict service from certain drivers and passengers. The company also invested $20 million in its customer service offerings and increased its in-house customer service team to 8,000 staff.[63] As part of the update, DiDi created an online discussion platform to facilitate online and offline national public opinion surveys in China. Media reported that in 2018, DiDi recorded losses of up to $1.61 billion owing to heavy spend on training and recruitment of qualified and skilled drivers. In 2018, the company launched its \\"Red Flag Steering Wheel\\" program in which verified Communist Party of China members would be visible as drivers. The company also pledged to hire 1,000 Communist Party members as part of its safety drive. In 2018, the company launched a bike and e-bike sharing platform and expanded vertically into auto service sector with the spinoff of Xiaoju Automobile Solutions, a platform providing auto sales, leasing, financing, car maintenance, refueling and recharging services to driver partners on the platform and independent vehicle owners. Since 2015, DiDi has invested in Grab, Lyft, Ola, Uber, 99, Bolt (Taxify) and Careem, and expanded into Latin America, Australia and Japan.

There are several identified types of control -Perceived Control (a person's perception regarding their ability to achieve outcomes), cognitive control (the ability to select one's thoughts and actions), emotional control (the ability to regulate one's feelings or attitudes toward something), motivational control (one's ability to act on prescribed behaviors), control desire (the amount of control one seeks within a relationship), inhibitory control (the ability to inhibit thoughts or actions in favor of others), social control (selecting one's environment for personal benefit), ego control (the attempt to regulate impulses or attention processes), and effortful control (the ability to regulate how much effort one invests into a goal). Perceived control Perceived control in psychology is a ‚Äúperson‚Äôs belief that [they] are capable of obtaining desired outcomes, avoiding undesired outcomes, and achieving goals.‚Äù High perceived control is often associated with better health, relationships, and adjustment. Strategies for restoring perceived control are called Compensatory control strategies.Landau, Kay and Whitson. (2015). ‚ÄúCompensatory Control and the Appeal of a Structured World‚Äù. Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 141, No. 3, p. 695 One's perception of perceived control is influenced by the past and future as well as what the desired outcome of an event may be. Perceived control is often associated with the term locus of control. Perceived control can be broken down into two different categories including primary and secondary perceived control which deal with one's perception of control over the environment or their wishes within that environment. Control desire Control desire applies to any subject, circumstance, or relationship that an individual may want to have some degree of control over. In the context of a sales relationship, control desire refers to the amount of control a customer wants within the relationship.Mullins, Bachrach, Rapp, Grewal, and Beitelspacher. (2015).Journal of Applied Psychology.Vol. 100, No. 4, 1073-1088 Control desire is often associated with perceived control, and studies focused on individuals with lower control desire show a correlation with greater psychological problems. Cognitive control Cognitive control in psychology describes ‚Äúthe ability to control one‚Äôs thoughts and actions.‚Äù It is also known as controlled processing, executive attention, and supervisory attention. Controlled behaviors, behaviors over which one has cognitive control, are guided by maintenance, updating, and representing task goals, and inhibiting information irrelevant to the task goal.Reimer, Radvansky, Lorsbach and Armendarez. (2015). ‚ÄúEvent Structure and Cognitive Control‚Äù. Journal of Experimental Psychology.Vol. 41, No. 5, 1374-1387 Cognitive control is often developed through reinforcement as well as learning from previous experiences. Increased cognitive control allows individuals to have increased flexibility in their ability to choose between conflicting stimuli. Cognitive control is commonly tested using the Stroop color-word task as well as the Eriksen flanker task. There are also certain quirks of cognitive control such as ironic rebound, in which attempts to keep a particular thought out of consciousness result in that thought becoming increasingly prevalent. In social psychology experiments conducted by Daniel M. Wegner, Ralph Erber and R.E. Bowman, male and female subjects were instructed to complete some sentences related to sexism. Some participants were given guidance to avoid being sexist, whereas some were not given such instructions. Additionally, for some sentence completions, time pressure was either applied by asking for immediate responses or reduced by giving subjects ten seconds to respond. Under low pressure conditions with guidance to avoid being sexist, the number of sexist sentence completions were lower when contrasted with the much higher amount of sexist sentence completions that resulted when subjects were under time pressure along with guidance to avoid being sexist. Furthermore, these results were consistent among both male and female subjects. This highlights the effect of ironic rebound, as when the individuals attempted to not be sexist under a significant time constraint, their resulting actions were counter to their attempts at cognitive control. Emotional control Emotional control is a term from literature on self- regulatory psychology and refers to ‚Äúthe ability to self-manage or regulate attitudes and feelings that directly affect participant receptiveness to, and implementation of, training activities.‚ÄùRobbins, Oh, Le and Button. (2009). ‚ÄúIntervention Effects on College Performance and Retention as Mediated by Motivational, Emotional, and Social Control Factors: Integrated Meta-Analytic Path Analysis.‚Äù Journal of Applied Psychology Vol. 94, No. 5, 1163-1184 Emotional control is often referred to as emotional regulation and is the process the brain undergoes to regulate and control emotional responses throughout the day. Emotional control manages and balances the physiological as well as psychological response to an emotion. The opposite of emotion regulation is emotional dysregulation which occurs when problems arise in the emotional control process that result in the inability to process emotions in a healthy manner. Emotional control contains several emotional regulation strategies including distraction, cognitive reappraisal, and emotional action control. Motivational control Motivational control in psychology ‚Äúrefers to the self-regulatory mechanism by which individuals are able to act on prescribed behaviors to implement training activities.‚Äù It can be explained by the analogy of a student who studies for an hour each morning for two months before a test, whether or not the student likes studying. Inhibitory control Inhibitory control or ‚ÄúIC‚Äù in psychology refers to another type of self-regulation defined as ‚Äúthe ability to inhibit prepotent thoughts or actions flexibly, often in favor of a subdominant action, typically in goal- directed behavior‚Äù.Allan, Hume, Allan, Farrington and Lonigan. (2014). ‚ÄúRelations Between inhibitory Control and the Development of Academic Skills in Preschool and Kindergarten: A Meta-Analysis‚Äù. Developmental Psychology. Vol. 50, No. 10, 2368. There are two types of IC: hot and cold. Hot IC involves activities or tasks related to emotion regulation, and cold IC involves abstract activities or tasks. A lack of inhibitory control can lead to difficulties in three main areas of life including motor, attentional, and behavioral control. Inhibitory control is also involved in the process of helping humans correct, react, and improve social behavior. A lack of inhibitory control can be connected with several mental disorders including Behavioral Inhibition, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Alcohol and drugs also influence one's inhibitory control. Social control Social control is learning psychology and ‚Äúrefers to an individual‚Äôs skills in engaging the social environment in ways that help to support and reinforce his or her learning activities.‚Äù Social control can be influenced by several factors including the control that society places on individual actions and behaviors as well as the control an individual can exert over their own behaviors in public. The definition of social control has changed over time to include the social control groups of people have in addition to individuals. Ego control Ego control in psychology refers to the efforts of the individual to control \\"thoughts, emotions, impulses or appetites‚Ä¶ task performances [and] attentional processes.‚ÄùGottdiener, Murawski and Kucharski. (2008). ‚ÄúUsing the Delay Discounting Task to test for failures in ego control in substance abusers.‚ÄùPsychoanalytic PsychologyVol. 25, 3, 533-549 Failure of ego control is seen as a central problem in individuals who suffer from substance abuse disorders. Situational control Situational control in psychology is part of leadership psychology that refers to ‚Äúthe degree to which the situation provides the leader with potential influence over the group‚Äôs behavior‚Äù.Fiedler, F.E. (1971). ‚ÄúValidation and extension of the contingency model of leadership effectiveness: A review of empirical findings. Psychological Bulletin, 76, 129 Effortful control Effortful control in psychology refers to a type of self regulation. It is a broader construct than inhibitory control, and encompasses working memory and attention shifting.Allan, Hume, Allan, Farrington and Lonigan. (2014). ‚ÄúRelations Between inhibitory Control and the Development of Academic Skills in Preschool and Kindergarten: A Meta-Analysis‚Äù. Developmental Psychology. Vol. 50, No. 10, 2368-2379. Effortful control works by allowing individuals the ability to start or stop behaviors they may or may not want to do through attention management. Effortful control is theorized to be involved in the process of problem solving as well as behavior regulation due to the top down processing involved. Effortful control often interacts and is central in other forms of control such as emotional control and inhibitory control.

In 1918, he was selected for OTC at Inns of court but was not able to complete it as the war ended. Having been declined a commission, he requested to be discharged from the Army. The war office instead sent him to India. After World War I concluded in 1918, the Indian politicians raised a demand to grant Indians the King's Commission. After strict screening, Rudra was selected for the first batch that underwent rigorous pre-commission training. In 1919, he joined the first batch of the King's Commissioned Indian Officers (KCIOs) at the Daly College in Indore. His batchmates included Kodandera M. Cariappa, who later went on to become a Field Marshal of the Indian Army. On 1 December 1919, Rudra was commissioned into the 28th Punjabis as a temporary second lieutenant in the British Indian Army, and was posted in Palestine; seven months later, on 17 July 1920, he was appointed to a permanent commission as a second lieutenant, with seniority from the date of his temporary commission. Promoted to temporary lieutenant on 1 December 1920, he took part in the Third Afghan War and served in the North- West Frontier, Baluchistan, Waziristan and Peshawar, receiving promotion to the substantive rank of lieutenant on 17 July 1921. Rudra was promoted to captain on 17 October 1927; he was promoted to major on 27 March 1939. During World War II, he took part in the Arakan Campaign 1942‚Äì43.

The factory was located at B√ºlowstrasse 106, Berlin W57, under the direction of factory owner Hans Windhoff. Windhoff initially produced radiators for cars, trucks, and aircraft, setting up a factory with his brother Fritz in Rheine in 1902, then on his own in Berlin from 1907-24.Ing. S Milani, 'Motociclette Pluricilindriche a Turismo:1895-1968', Motone, Pavia, Italy, 2002 In 1924 he entered the burgeoning German motorcycle market with a water-cooled two-stroke of 125cc. The engine was built under license from a design by Hugo Ruppe, whose ladepumpe (an extra piston used as a supercharger to compress the fuel/air mix) design was used most successfully by DKW in their Grand Prix racers. Windhoff had much racing success with these small two-strokes, although an experiment with enlarged two-stroke racers of 493cc and 517cc were less reliable.K Reese, 'Motorr√§der aus Berlin', Johann Kleine Vennekate Verlag, Lemgo Germany, 2002. The carburetor side of the Windhoff 750cc-4 In 1926, a totally new machine was designed; a dramatic and technically fascinating 746cc overhead camshaft, oil-cooled 4-cylinder. Only Granville Bradshaw (creator of the ABC motorcycle) had successfully used an oil-cooled engine in a motorcycle. The engine, designed by Ing. Dauben (who later joined Mercedes on the W144 - W146 racers) had no external oilways, making a very clean design. The engine finning acted as a giant radiator, with recirculating oil the cooling agent. The single overhead camshaft was driven by a train of gears at the front of the engine. Very few 4-cylinder production motorcycles of the pre-War period had an overhead camshaft (a notable rival was the first iteration of the Ariel Square Four of 1931). The 63x60mm short-stroke engine produced 22 hp at 4,000rpm, which gave an 80 mph+ top speed. The Windhoff chassis had no ‚Äòframe‚Äô to speak of, and the engine/gearbox unit was used as a stressed member, with the forks and rear subframe (4 parallel tubes) bolt directly onto it. The trailing-link forks use double leaf springs for damping, with no rear suspension; the rear frame tubes emerge straight out of the gearbox casting, and hold the final drive housing for the shaft drive, and rear hub and brake. Despite its massive appearance, the total weight of the machine was only 440 lbs. The price when new was 1,750DM, a bit more than the contemporary 750cc BMW R63 (1,600DM). Hans Windhoff designed a new machine for 1929, with a side valve flat-twin motor of 996cc, but the economic Crash of 1929 meant very few were produced. Windhoff struggled on with small two-stroke motorcycles of 298cc, with engines produced under license from Villiers. The company ceased operations by 1933.

He was abducted on 2 May 2015 and found dead two days later 350 kilometers southeast of Mexico City near the town of Acatlan de Perez Figueroa, Oaxaca. He had been reporting about organized crime involvement in petroleum from Pemex, the Mexican oil company.  Personal  Armando Salda√±a Morales grew up in the community of Laguna Chica, Veracruz, selling coffee. He married Maria Isabel Jasso, a nurse, from Tamaulipas. They lived together in his hometown of Laguna Chica where they raised their three daughters.  Career  As a radio journalist, Salda√±a hosted a political program, called \\"La Grilla Punto y Debate,\\" on La Ke Buena 100.9 FM. and also was a writer for the local newspaper \\"Cronica de Tierra Blanca.\\" In addition, Salda√±a contributed to the media outlets El Mundo de C√≥rdoba, El Sol de Cordoba, and Radio Max. He practiced journalism for 25 years.  Death  On 2 May 2015, Armando Morales Salda√±a was kidnapped by a number of suspects after leaving work. He was last seen by his colleague Octavio Bravo Bravo in Veracruz. Although the motive for murder is unclear, he had reported about organized crimes by criminal parties over the course of the few months leading up to his murder. He most recently reported about the activities of a party known as \\"Chupaductos\\" that was tapping state-owned Pemex oil pipelines. An anonymous tip led authorities to Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca, where he was found dead on 4 May 2015 He was found beside an F-150 pickup truck, and he had been shot 4 times and his body also showed signs of torture. His left cheekbone had been broken by stabs; his jugular was cut; his ear was cut off; his feet were burned and broken; and his mandible was shattered. Police had to be requested to the area because it was remote. The area was also in another state where he was kidnapped. After the initial investigation and funeral, the family protested a number of irregularities in the collection of evidence. On 22 May 2015, Juan Carlos de la Cruz was placed under arrest by the Agencia Estatal de Investigaciones. The suspect was formally charged on 27 May of participating in the murder. The Procuradur√≠a General de Justicia del Estado de Oaxaca (PGJEO) is working to find the other participants of this murder.  Context  According to Reporters Without Borders, Mexico has been ranked 148th out of 180 countries in regards to press freedom. There have been 82 journalists murdered in Mexico in the last 20 years, and the state of Veracruz in which Morales lived and work is considered to be the most dangerous state for journalists ton live in. Morales was the third journalist in 2015 to be murdered. Since Governor Javier Duarte took office in 2010, 12 journalists have been murdered; also, in 2014 about 326 journalists were harmed due to their profession. Crimes related to oil thefts such as those Morales was reporting about are also not uncommon in Mexico with as much revenue as $1.14 billion having been lost to oil theft in 2014. This increase in petroleum theft led to a growth in security of 122% from 2006 to 2013 at an expense of 299 million pesos.  Impact  Morales was one of twelve reporters to have been murdered in Veracruz since the appointment of Governor Javier Duarte has taken office. despite the many deaths that have occurred, the federal prosecutors office that is meant to protect journalists has not been able to convict a single suspect for the murder of any journalists. The death of Morales and the many other Mexican journalists, especially those working in Veracruz, raise concern for the safety of journalists and for the freedom of speech of the people as well.  Reactions  In a response to Morales' death, the National Human Rights Commission (Comisi√≥n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos) contacted Morales' family and formally condemned the attack and murder of Morales on 7 May 2015. Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said \\"I condemn the murder of Armando Salda√±a Morales and call on the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into this murder. Crimes against journalists affect the whole of society and limit our ability as citizens to make informed choices. For this reason, it is essential that such crimes do not go unpunished.\\" Gustavo Mohme, the president of Inter American Press Association (SIP-IAPA), said, \\"We are facing another murder that could run the risk of being without justice, unpunished like so many other cases in Mexico....\\" See also * List of journalists and media workers killed in Mexico  References  Category:2015 crimes in Mexico Category:Assassinated Mexican journalists Category:Deaths by firearm in Mexico Category:Journalists killed in the Mexican Drug War Category:Mexican journalists Category:Male journalists Category:2015 murders in North America Category:2010s murders in Mexico Category:People from Veracruz ","title":"Armando Salda√±a Morales"},{"id":"48315987","text":"50 United Nations Plaza is a high-rise residential building in Manhattan, New York City, United States.

Poojary, a 29 year old flower seller, a member of Bajrang Dal, was stabbed with blades by six assailants on 9 October 2015 at about 7.00 am IST. , ten people have been arrested in connection with the attack, allegedly motivated by Poojary's activism against the illegal slaughter of cows. One suspect Mohammad Imtiaz Gantalkatte was arrested from Mumbai airport as he was attempting to flee India for Dubai. An eyewitness to the incident 60 year old Vaman Poojary, a tender coconut seller whose shop was opposite Poojary's shop, went missing on 15 October 2015. He was found dead on the next day. It has been alleged by Nalin Kumar Kateel MP from Dakshina Kannada constituency to which the town of Moodabidri belongs that witnesses were being threatened over international phone calls including those made from Pakistan and asked not to testify against the suspects. The Karnataka government also revealed that its minister Abhay Chandra Jain received threats Karnataka police consider this murder as a part of a conspiracy to incite communal hatred in the region. A Zee News talk show titled \\"Cow slaughter: Protests against Dadri lynching, why silence over Prashanth Poojary's murder?\\" commented on the absence of media attention as regards to the murder. Vishwesha Teertha head of the Sri Pejavara Adokshaja Matha has similarly asserted bias on the part of a section of writers for their selective outrage to criminal incidents exemplified by their silence on Poojary's killing.

Along with Aegypius jinniushanensis, L. l√ºi is one of several new species of extinct birds discovered at Jinniushan, Liaoning, China. The extinct stork is named after Professor Zun-e L√º. Extant members of the genus Leptoptilos are today found only found in the African and Asian tropics. L. l√ºi is the only member of Leptoptilos from the Pleistocene so far to have been discovered outside of its modern range. Description L. l√ºi is one of the largest Leptoptilos on record and might be larger than Leptoptilos titan and Leptoptilos robustus. The humerus and proximal phalanx are longer and more robust than those of any other Leptoptilos on record. With very long wings, L. l√ºi was probably a good flyer that mainly relied on gliding and soaring on the thermal air currents available then, as the climate conditions in the region during the Middle Pleistocene was a lot warmer and more humid. L. l√ºi most likely relied on scavenging from Pleistocene megafauna for the bulk of its food source. The disappearance of Pleistocene megafauna and climate change are likely the primary causes of its extinction.

Kostas Perrikos (; 23 April 1905 ‚Äì 4 February 1943) was a Greek Air Force officer and leader of the PEAN resistance movement in World War II. He is the father of the UN arms control Commissioner Dimitris Perrikos (ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒ∑œÇ Œ†ŒµœÅœÅŒØŒ∫ŒøœÇ). Early years Perrikos was born in Kallimasia on the island of Chios where he received his elementary education. His family later moved to Alexandria, where he completed high school. He returned to Greece in 1925 and in 1926 he entered the Air Force Academy, which he left with a commission as a Lieutenant. Perrikos was a fervent Republican who had been dismissed from the Air Force after the failed Venizelist coup attempt in March 1935. He was married to Maria Deligiorgi, with whom he had three children. During World War II After the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War in October 1940, Perrikos requested to return to duty. His request was granted on 23 November 1940 and he was forwarded to the front. In June 1941, Perrikos was a founding member of the \\"Army of Enslaved Victors\\" (Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ¨ Œ£Œ∫ŒªŒ±Œ≤œâŒºŒ≠ŒΩœâŒΩ ŒùŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÑœéŒΩ, SSN), one of the first resistance groups to spring up after Greece was overrun by the Germans in April 1941. Dissatisfied by the SSN's neutrality on the crucial issue of the post-war regime in Greece (monarchy or republic), Perrikos and a number of others split off to form the \\"Panhellenic Union of Fighting Youths\\" (Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒµŒªŒªŒÆŒΩŒπŒøœÇ ŒàŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ ŒëŒ≥œâŒΩŒπŒ∂œåŒºŒµŒΩœâŒΩ ŒùŒ≠œâŒΩ, PEAN). PEAN had a leftist political orientation, strongly opposed any return of the monarchy and insisted on active struggle against the occupying forces. =ESPO bombing= PEAN's most spectacular act of sabotage was the bombing of the collaborationist ESPO headquarters on 20 September 1942. ESPO (ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ£ŒøœÉŒπŒ±ŒªŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ†Œ±œÑœÅŒπœâœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒüœÅŒ≥Œ¨ŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ, Hellenic Socialist Patriotic Organization) was the largest Greek National-Socialist organization. ESPO was trying to recruit volunteers for a \\"Greek Legion\\" to fight in the Eastern Front alongside the Germans.Bernard O'Connor: Sabotage in Greece, lulu.com, 2014, ESPO was housed in a four-storey building located on the corner of Gladstonos and Patission streets in central Athens. Sabotaging it was a challenging feat as the building also accommodated the headquarters of the German Secret Field Police in Athens and the surrounding area was frequented by locals. The bombing operation was planned and executed by Perrikos and three others, namely Antonis Mytilinaios, Spyros Galatis and Ioulia Bimba. They prepared a 12 kgr dynamite bomb, which they smuggled and planted underneath ESPO's offices.Rigas Rigopoulos: Secret War: Greece-Middle East, 1940‚Äì1945: The Events Surrounding The Story of Service 5‚Äì16‚Äì5. Turner Publishing Company, 2003, . Approximately 40 ESPO members and 6 Germans were wounded, many of which lethally. The attack was widely publicized and praised by Allied radio stations, and marked the end of the ESPO and of German attempts to recruit Greeks into the Wehrmacht. Other Greek resistance organizations like EAM reacted with skepticism, attributing the bombing to a provocation by the Gestapo. Execution and aftermath On 11 November 1942 Perrikos and 12 of his partners were arrested after being betrayed. One month later, he was court marshaled and sentenced three times to death and to 15 years of imprisonment. He was executed by firing squad on 4 February 1943 at Kaisariani. Perrikos was posthumously promoted to the rank of Wing Commander. On 2 September 1987, a bronze bust of Perrikos was unveiled near the ESPO building in Gladstonos street.
