Its major advantage over the previously practised \\"classic\\" technique is that it allows the skater to do useful work during the part of the stride that was \\"wasted\\", and therefore to go faster. Opinions differ on its usefulness for non-elite skaters as it requires much practice before a skater is faster using doublepush than without. History It is uncertain who first invented the doublepush. Chad Hedrick is generally acknowledged as having brought it to the public eye. Prior to Chad's arrival on the scene circa 1992, inline speed skaters used the classic speed skating technique derived from ice speed skating. Hedrick's alternative approach rapidly proved itself to be faster and was soon adopted by many elite skaters. Technique Wheels used in speed skating are usually round or elliptical in profile, and do not literally have edges. The terminology is carried over from ice skate blades, which have edges. In inline skating, being \\"on an inside edge\\" refers to skating with the wheel of the skate leaning inwards (i.e. medially: right skate leaning left, and vice versa). An outside edge is the opposite, and a center edge implies that the wheel is vertical. The classic speedskating technique is an alternating cycle of inside-edge pushes and outer-edge glides. The cycle starts as the skater is gliding on one (let us suppose the right) leg with a bent knee. Then the right knee straightens (extends) while leaning to the left. The direction of the push is therefore outwards (rightwards) from the center of mass. When the pushing leg reaches full extension, the left (now support) leg is set down and used to glide, while the right leg lifts and is brought back behind and underneath the skater (recovery) ready to be placed on the ground (set down) and become the new support leg. Once the pushing leg has been recovered, the support leg pushes out in the other direction and the cycle repeats. Note that the pushes are always in a lateral direction: the left leg pushes exclusively leftwards, and the right leg exclusively rightwards. This will naturally result in a push that starts on the center edge or on a slight outside edge and \\"rolls over\\" onto the inside edge as the foot moves away from the skater's center of mass. The double-push eliminates the \\"glide\\" phase from the above cycle, replacing it with a medially-directed \\"underpush\\" on the outside-edge. The recovery skate is placed on an outside edge and pushed underneath the body (right leg pushes leftward, and vice versa) while maintaining that outside edge, before being steered or pulled back across the centerline for the regular inside-edge push that follows. By its nature the double-push is less stable than classic technique, making it difficult to learn. If the skater should lose traction during an underpush there is no support leg to fall back on. The double-push also allows for the very brief application of force through both legs simultaneously. The skater does this by transferring weight from the inside-edge foot to the outside-edge foot gradually, rather than transferring all weight to the outside-edge foot instantly. Some hold that this is essential to the double push, but this opinion is not universal. Advantages The principal advantage of the double push is that it allows skaters to generate propulsive force during a part of the stroke cycle which was previously wasted. In the glide phase of the classic stroke, friction from road, atmosphere and bearings tends to slow skaters down, yet the deep knee flexion during this part of the cycle fatigues the muscles. Using DP, skaters can do useful work in this time instead. This is beneficial to their muscles and also helps keep speed more nearly constant instead of surging ahead and then slowing down repeatedly. The DP extends the effective stroke length. One of the best ways to go faster is to push further in each stroke, but whereas traditionally this requires sitting lower (restricting blood flow and increasing lactic acid production in the muscles), in DP the same leg at a higher bend angle can achieve a longer effective stroke by pushing both inward and outwards. Double-Push On Ice Although it is possible to use the double-push in ice skating, it is by no means certain that it can provide the same advantage that it can in inline skating. This has been attributedPublow, Barry (1999). Speed on Skates. Human Kinetics. . to the different characteristics of edging on ice. Whereas an inline skate on a center edge continues to grip the road, an ice blade on a center edge will slip if pushed sideways: it must be on an inside or outside edge if it is to \\"dig into\\" the ice. Although some skaters can be seen to be underpushing slightly on ice, the effect is much more subtle. Chad Hedrick, due to his success in connection with the DP, has had his form widely commented on since he moved to ice. The DP has not been widely adopted on ice. Whether this is because it makes little practical difference or for other reasons is at present difficult to say. The main reason why DP does not work on ice, it is proposed, is that ice skates can move only on a straight line or on a big radius, while DP requires carving movements. Perhaps some technical developments could enable creating an ice speed skate that can carve, but it may have more drag. This problem is similar to cross country skis that do not enable carving techniques.

The Roman army in Gaul threw off its allegiance to Gallienus around the year 260,The year of Postumus' accession was either 259 or 260. In the past, the year 259 was favoured; today, however, most scholars consider that the summer or fall of 260 is the more likely date that he was hailed emperor, according to Polfer (Postumus) and J.F. Drinkwater (1987), p. 97. The terminus ante quem is an inscription from September 260 naming Postumus as emperor: Bakker (1993), pp. 369‚Äì386. Other dates cited in this article must be pushed back one year for those who take 259 as the year of Postumus' accession. See Drinkwater (1987), pp. 95-106. and Postumus assumed the title and powers of Emperor in the provinces of Gaul, Germania, Britannia and Hispania, thereby founding what scholars have dubbed the Gallic Empire. He ruled for the better part of ten yearsBased on numismatic evidence, Postumus' rule extended over ten periods of tribunician power, each conventionally lasting for one year beginning on December 10. Regardless of which year Postumus assumed the purple (259 or 260), his rule must have stretched across ten such years. See Drinkwater (1987), pp. 93, 95. before he was murdered by his own troops. Life =Rise to power= Little is known about the early life of Postumus. He has been claimed as being of BatavianState, Paul F., A Brief History of the Netherlands, Infobase Publishing, 2008, p. 8 origin; certainly his coinage honors deities ‚Äî Hercules Magusanus and Hercules Deusoniensis ‚Äî who would have been popular among the Batavians.Drinkwater (1987), pp. 162-3. Hercules Magusanus was probably an interpretatio romana translation of the Germanic deity √ûunraz.Fields, Nic (2006): Roman Auxiliary Cavalryman: AD 14-193, , p. 45-46 Deusoniensis may refer to the town of Deuso, located in or near Batavian territory and likely to be identified with modern-day Diessen; it has been hypothesized that Postumus himself was born in Deuso. From these relatively obscure provincial origins, Postumus would have risen through the ranks of the army until he held command of the Roman forces \\"among the Celts\\".The phrase is Zosimus', quoted in Drinkwater (1987), p. 59. What his precise title was is not definitely known,Drinkwater (1987), p. 25. though he may plausibly have been promoted by the emperor Valerian to the position of imperial legate of Germania Inferior.Potter (2004), p. 257 Postumus was evidently in favor at court, and, according to K√∂nig, was granted an honorary consulship.Drinkwater (1987), p. 67. By 259, Valerian was campaigning in the east against the Persians, while his son and co-emperor Gallienus was preoccupied with the situation on the Danubian frontier.Southern (2001), p. 79 Consequently, Gallienus left his son, Saloninus, and military commanders, including Postumus, to protect the Rhine.Polfer, Postumus Amid the chaos of an invasion by the Alamanni and Franks, and spurred on by news of the defeat and capture of Valerian, the army in Gaul revolted and proclaimed Postumus emperor. The trigger was their defeat in 260 of a Juthungian army which was returning from Italy laden with prisoners, even though they had been repulsed by Gallienus at Mediolanum (Milan).Potter (2004), p. 256 Under the command of Postumus and Marcus Simplicinius Genialis, the Roman army crushed the Juthungi, and Postumus proceeded to distribute the captured spoils to the legions he commanded. Saloninus, on the advice of his praetorian prefect Silvanus (who had coordinated Roman policy in Gaul alongside Postumus), demanded the transfer of the recovered booty to his residence at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (Cologne). Postumus assembled his army and made a show of reluctantly enforcing this command, thus inviting his troops to instead throw off their allegiance to Gallienus.Drinkwater (1987), p. 89. The troops accordingly proclaimed Postumus emperor and proceeded to besiege and attack Colonia, trapping Saloninus and Silvanus. After breaching the walls of the city, Postumus had Silvanus and Saloninus killed, although his supporters later claimed that it was the native Gauls who were responsible for the murders.Southern (2001), p. 98 Later he erected a triumphal arch to celebrate his victory. =Establishment of a Gallic empire= Postumus aureus, 268, Treves, gold . Legend: POSTVMVS AVG. Postumus was immediately recognized as emperor in Gaul (except perhaps for Narbonensis), Germania Superior and Inferior, and Raetia. By 261, Britannia, Gallia Narbonensis and Hispania also acknowledged him as emperor, possibly after an expedition to Britain in the winter of 260‚Äì261.Drinkwater (1987), p. 168. He established his capital in northern Gaul, probably at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (Cologne) or Augusta Treverorum (Trier),Drinkwater (1987), pp. 146, 167. and then proceeded to set up many of the traditional Roman legislative and executive structures.Southern (2001), p. 97 Apart from the position of emperor, he immediately assumed the office of consul alongside a colleague, Honoratianus.Potter (2004), p. 260 Like his imperial predecessors, he became the pontifex maximus of the state and assumed tribunician power each year. He is thought to have established a senate, perhaps on the basis of the Council of the Three Gauls or provincial councils,Drinkwater (1987), p. 29. and a praetorian guard, one of whose officers was to become the future Gallic emperor Victorinus.Drinkwater (1987), p. 130. Reflecting his power base, the chief members of Postumus‚Äô administration appeared to have been of northern Gallic origin, and indeed, the entire administration soon became rapidly Gallicized.Potter (2004), p. 261. Both Victorinus and Tetricus, important members of the government, hailed from this region. Postumus represented himself as the restorer of Gaul (Restitutor Galliarum) and the bringer of security to the provinces (Salus Provinciarum) on some of his coins; prior to 10 December 261, he also took the title of Germanicus maximus, a title he earned after successfully defending Gaul against the Germans. His principal objective in assuming the purple appeared to be the restoration and defence of the Rhine frontier and the surrounding area, a task that he approached with vigour, earning the admiration of the ancient authors, who declared that he restored the security that the provinces had enjoyed in the past. So successful was he in the task of restoring peace and security to the provinces under his direct control that the coins issued by Postumus were of better workmanship and higher precious metal content than coins issued by Gallienus;Southern (2001), p. 118 his control of the Spanish and British mining regions was presumably crucial in this regard,Drinkwater (1987), p. 27. as was his employment of master minters who would have come into Gaul with Gallienus.Drinkwater (1987), p. 136. Postumus fought successful campaigns against the Franks and Alamanni in 262 and 263; following his victory over them in 263, he assumed the title Germanicus Maximus, after which his coin- types celebrated peaceful themes such as Felicitas Augusti for some time.Drinkwater (1987), pp. 30, 170. After having spent much of the last four years pushing the Franks out of Gaul, Postumus then recruited Frankish troops to fight against other Franks, probably dispersed within existing Roman army units.Southern (2001), p. 217 Scholars continue to debate whether Postumus originally intended to dislodge Gallienus from Rome or was content to rule only the western provinces. From the beginning of his usurpation, Postumus had made it clear that he had no immediate intentions to make a bid for Rome, that his priority was for Gaul. Postumus‚Äô power base was Gaul and his main responsibility was the defense of the Rhine provinces. If he marched against Gallienus, then he would be exposing his heartland not only to the Germanic tribes but also potentially to any number of usurpers. Perhaps he hoped to achieve some official recognition from Gallienus; what is clear, however, is that Postumus was not overtly separatist and did not revive the 1st-century dream of an independent Galliarum imperium. (See Julius Sabinus and revolt of the Batavi.) The forms, titles, and administrative structures of Postumus‚Äô principate remained conventionally Roman.Drinkwater (1987), p. 28. Milestone of Postumus c.261-269 found in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. It bears the inscription: [I]MP(ERATORI) CAE[S(ARI)] [M]ARCO CA[SSIJANO] LAT[IN]IO POSTUMO AUG(USTO). =Confrontation with Gallienus= For four years Gallienus was too distracted by Germanic invasions and other usurpers in the east to turn his attention to the situation to his north and west.Potter (2004), p. 263 This changed in 265 when Gallienus launched a campaign to defeat Postumus. After some initial success against Postumus, his first attempt failed when Postumus managed to escape from a precarious situation due to the carelessness of Gallienus‚Äô cavalry commander Aureolus,Polfer, Postumus leading to Aureolus‚Äô demotion and eventual abandonment of Gallienus in 267. A second campaign, led by Gallienus himself, also seemed to have the advantage over Postumus, but while Gallienus was besieging a city in Gaul (perhaps Augusta TreverorumSouthern (2001), p. 100), he was wounded and forced to withdraw.Drinkwater (1987), p. 89, who cites Zonaras (12.24.13-18) as the ancient authority for these events. After his failed attempt at defeating Postumus, Gallienus was occupied with crises in the rest of his empire and did not confront Postumus again. Gallienus nevertheless did manage to wrest control of Raetia from Postumus during these years. =Final years= radiate of Postumus. Legend: IMP. C. POSTVMVS P. F. AVG. By the end of 265, Postumus‚Äô coin issues were triumphantly commemorating the victory over Gallienus, and the festivities celebrating his quinquennalia continued into the following year.Polfer, Postumus Very little troubled the reign of Postumus from 265 to 268; archaeological evidence, such as it is, points to a general return to peace and normalcy.Drinkwater (1987), p. 231. In 266, Postumus became consul for the fourth time, taking as his colleague Marcus Piavonius Victorinus, a Gallic noble who was also a senior military officer; his selection to such a high-profile position may be seen as an attempt to broaden Postumus‚Äô base of support.Drinkwater (1987), p. 174. The year 268 saw the issuing of the ‚ÄòLabours of Hercules‚Äô series of gold coins in honour of Postumus‚Äô favourite god.Drinkwater (1987), pp. 32, 174. A sudden debasement of the coinage later that year shows that Postumus was facing increasing financial difficulties, due perhaps to a disruption of silver production in the Spanish minesDrinkwater (1987), p. 210. or the need to buy off an increasingly discontented army.Polfer, Postumus Such discontent must probably have been due to the army‚Äôs frustration with Postumus‚Äô failure to take advantage of a golden opportunity to move against Gallienus in 268.Drinkwater (1987), p. 32. Aureolus, the general who was in command of Mediolanum (Milan) in Gallienus‚Äô interest, rebelled and ultimately declared for Postumus. The city of Mediolanum and its north Italian and Raetian hinterland would have been critical to Postumus if he planned to march on Rome. For whatever reason, Postumus failed to support Aureolus, who was besieged by Gallienus.Southern (2001), p. 106 Before the end of the northern summer in 268, the events at Mediolanum were to see the assassination of Gallienus, the defeat of Aureolus, and the accession of Claudius II.Potter (2004), p. 264 It also triggered a sequence of events that would see the end of Postumus‚Äô rule in Gaul. =Fall= Aureus of Postumus, within a pendant. Legend: POSTVMVS PIVS AVG. Postumus assumed his fifth consulship on 1 January 269, but the army in Germania Superior raised a usurper in early 269. Laelianus, one of Postumus‚Äô top military leaders and the governor of Germania Superior, was declared emperor in Mogontiacum (Mainz) by the local garrison and surrounding troops (Legio XXII Primigenia).Potter (2004), p. 265 Although Postumus was able to capture Mogontiacum and kill Laelianus within a few months, he was unable to control his own troops, who wished to put Mogontiacum to the sack. When Postumus tried to restrain them, his men turned on him and killed him.Aurelius Victor 33.8; Eutropius 9.9.1 The mutineers set up Marius, a common soldier, as emperor. Marius held sway for a short while before being overthrown by Victorinus, Postumus‚Äô erstwhile colleague in the consulship and tribune of the praetorian guard.Drinkwater (1987), p. 35. In the meantime, the Gallic Empire lost Hispania.Potter (2004), p. 266 Historical sources Most of the ancient literary references to Postumus come from the works thought to be based on the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte (Aurelius Victor, Epitome de Caesaribus, Eutropius, and the Historia Augusta, in the last of which Postumus is listed among the Thirty Tyrants). He also figures in the works of Zosimus and Zonaras.Drinkwater (1987), p. 45.  Coinage  Postumus has been of particular interest to numismatists, in light of the high quality and relative abundance of his coin issues. His ‚ÄòLabours of Hercules‚Äô series is particularly renowned.

The game was expanded upon in 1977 with help from Don Woods, and other programmers created variations on the game and ports to other systems in the following years. In the game, the player controls a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be filled with wealth. Players earn predetermined points for acquiring treasure and escaping the cave alive, with the goal to earn the maximum number of points offered. The concept bore out from Crowther's background as a caving enthusiast, with the game's cave structured loosely around the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky. Colossal Cave Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction and, as the first text adventure game, is considered the precursor for the adventure game genre. Colossal Cave Adventure also contributed towards the role-playing and roguelike genres.  Gameplay  Adventure has the player's character explore a mysterious cave that is rumored to be filled with treasure and gold. To explore the cave, the player types in one- or two-word commands to move their character through the cave, interact with objects in the cave, pick up items to put into their inventory, and other actions. The program acts as a narrator, describing to the player what each location in the cave has and the results of certain actions, or if it did not understand the player's commands, asking for the player to retype their actions. (The player's commands are shown here in lower case, and the program's replies are in all-capitals.) YOU ARE STANDING AT THE END OF A ROAD BEFORE A SMALL BRICK BUILDING. AROUND YOU IS A FOREST. A SMALL STREAM FLOWS OUT OF THE BUILDING AND DOWN A GULLY. go south YOU ARE IN A VALLEY IN THE FOREST BESIDE A STREAM TUMBLING ALONG A ROCKY BED. The program's replies are typically in a humorous, conversational tone, much as a dungeon master would use in leading players in a tabletop role-playing game. A notable example is when the player dies after falling into a pit. go west YOU FELL INTO A PIT AND BROKE EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY! NOW YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT! I'M OUT OF ORANGE SMOKE! YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO DO A DECENT REINCARNATION WITHOUT ANY ORANGE SMOKE, DO YOU? yes OKAY, IF YOU'RE SO SMART, DO IT YOURSELF! I'M LEAVING! Certain actions may cause the death of the character (the player has three lives), requiring the player to start again. The game has a point system, whereby completing certain goals earns a number of predetermined points. The ultimate goal is to earn the maximum number of points (350 points), which partially correlates to finding all the treasures in the game and safely leaving the cave.  Development  Will Crowther was a programmer at Bolt, Beranek & Newman (BBN), and helped to develop the ARPANET (a forerunner of the Internet). Crowther and his wife Patricia were experienced cavers, having previously helped to create vector map surveys of the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky in the early 1970s for the Cave Research Foundation. In addition, Crowther enjoyed playing the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons with a regular group which included Eric S. Roberts and Dave Lebling, one of the future founders of Infocom. Following his divorce from Pat in 1975, Crowther wanted to connect better with his daughters and decided a computerized simulation of his cave explorations with elements of his role-playing games would help. He created a means by which the game could be controlled through natural language input so that it would be \\"a thing that gave you the illusion anyway that you'd typed in English commands and it did what you said\\". Crowther later commented that this approach allowed the game to appeal to both non-programmers and programmers alike, as in the latter case, it gave programmers a challenge of how to make \\"an obstinate system\\" perform in a manner they wanted it to. Will Crowther's original Adventure (1976) running on a PDP-10 Developed over 1975 and 1976, Crowther's original game consisted of about 700 lines of FORTRAN code,Crowther W., Crowther's original FORTRAN source code for Adventure , 1976 with about another 700 lines of data, written for BBN's PDP-10 timesharing computer. The data included text for 78 map locations (66 actual rooms and 12 navigation messages) as well as 193 vocabulary words, travel tables, and miscellaneous messages. On the PDP-10, the program loads and executes with all its game data in memory. It required about 60k words (nearly 300kB) of core memory, which was a significant amount for PDP-10/KA systems running with only 128k words. Crowther's original version did not include any scorekeeping. Once the game was complete, Crowther showed it off to his co-workers at BBN for feedback, and then considered his work on the game complete, leaving the compiled game in a directory before taking a month off for vacation. During that time, others had found the game and it was distributed widely across the network, which had surprised Crowther on his return. Though titled in-game as Colossal Cave Adventure, its executable file was simply named ADVENT, which led to this becoming an alternate name for the game. One of those that had discovered the game was Don Woods, a graduate student at Stanford University in 1976. Woods wanted to expand upon the game and contacted Crowther to gain access to the source code. Woods built upon Crowther's code in FORTRAN, including more high fantasy- related elements based on his love of the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. He also introduced a scoring system within the game and added ten more treasures to collect in addition to the five in Crowther's original version. His work expanded Crowther's game to approximately 3000 lines of code and 1800 lines of data. The data consisted of 140 map locations, 293 vocabulary words, 53 objects (15 treasure objects), travel tables, and miscellaneous messages. Like Crowther's original game, Woods' game also executed with all its data in memory but required somewhat less core memory (42k words) than Crowther's game.Crowther W., Woods D., PDP-10 FORTRAN source code advent-original.tar.gz, 1977Crowther W., Woods D., PDP-10 FORTRAN source code adv350-pdp10.tar.gz, 1977 Don Woods continued releasing updated editions through to at least the mid-1990s. Crowther did not distribute the source code to his version, while Woods, once finished with his improvements, widely distributed the code alongside the compiled executable. Woods' 1977 version became the more recognizable and \\"canon\\" version of Colossal Cave Adventure in part due to wider code availability, on which nearly all revisions described in the following section were based. Crowther's original code was thought to have been lost until 2007 when an unmodified version of it was found on Woods' student account archive. = Later versions = PDP-11/34 displayed on the minicomputer's VT100 serial console. ADVENT running on an Osborne 1 Computer circa 1982 this MS-DOS version by Level 9 Computing. Both Crowther's and Woods' version were designed to run on the PDP-10, enabling certain features unique to the platform. The PDP-10 architecture was 36-bit, with each word able to store five 7-bit ASCII characters. The game's FORTRAN code compared player's commands with its vocabulary but using only the first five letters of each English word. Unfortunately, this limitation was silently evident to the game player too, and adversely affected gameplay (\\"north\\" would be equivalent to \\"northeast\\"). Hence, Woods added the five-letter limit notes to Crowther's original game instructions. The PDP-10 also implemented application checkpointing which allows saving and restoring of the state of the entire program, instead of a more traditional save file. Both these features made it difficult to directly port the code to other architectures. One of the first efforts to port the code was by Jim Gillogly of the RAND Corporation in 1977. Gillogly, with agreement from Crowther and Woods, spent several weeks porting the code to C to run on the more generic Unix architecture. It can be found as part of the BSD Operating Systems distributions, or as part of the \\"bsdgames\\" package under most Linux distributions, under the command name \\"adventure\\". The game was also ported to Prime Computer's super-mini running PRIMOS in the late 1970s, utilizing FORTRAN IV, and to IBM mainframes running VM/CMS in late 1978, utilizing PL/I. In 1978, Chris Eisnaugle and Dan Blumenfeld, both high school students at the time, replicated the entire 350-point version of the game by coding a functional equivalent in HP Time-Shared BASIC for a Hewlett- Packard 2000C minicomputer. The gameplay and text content were identical to the original by Crowther and Woods. In the late 1970s, a freeware Commodore PET version was produced by Jim Butterfield; some years later this version was ported to the Commodore 64. Microsoft also released versions of Adventure in 1979 for the Apple II Plus and TRS-80 computers. The Software Toolworks in 1981 released The Original Adventure. Endorsed by Crowther and Woods, it was the only version for which they received royalties. Microsoft released Adventure in 1981 with its initial version of MS-DOS 1.0 as a launch title for the IBM PC, making it the first game available for the new computer. It was released on a single-sided 5 inch disk, required 32K RAM, and booted directly from the disk; it could not be opened from DOS. Microsoft's Adventure contained 130 rooms, 15 treasures, 40 useful objects and 12 problems to be solved. The progress of two games could be saved on a diskette. Later versions of the game moved away from general purpose programming languages such as C or Fortran and were instead written for special interactive fiction engines, such as Infocom's Z-machine. In addition to strict ports of the game, variations began to appear, typically denoted by the maximum number of points one could score in the game; the original version by Crowther and Woods had a maximum of 350 points. Russel Dalenberg's Adventure Family Tree page provides the best (though still incomplete) summary of different versions and their relationships.] A generic version of the game was developed in 1981 by Graham Thomson for the ZX-81 as the Adventure-writing kit. This stripped-down version had space for 50 rooms and 15 objects and was designed to allow the aspiring coder to modify the game and thus personalize it. The game's code was published in April 1982.Thompson, Graham. Scot, Duncan, ed. Adventure. Your Computer. Vol.2, No.4. Pp.24-27. April 1982. https://archive.org/details/your- computer-magazine-1982-04 Dave Platt's influential 550-point version (released in 1984) was innovative in a number of ways. It broke away from coding the game directly in a programming language such as FORTRAN or C. Instead, Platt developed A-code ‚Äì a language for adventure programming ‚Äì and wrote his extended version in that language. The A-code source was pre-processed by a FORTRAN 77 (F77) \\"munger\\" program, which translated A-code into a text database and a tokenized pseudo-binary. These were then distributed together with a generic A-code F77 \\"executive\\", also written in F77, which effectively \\"ran\\" the tokenized pseudo-binary. Platt's version was also notable for providing a randomized variety of responses when informing the player that, for example, there was no exit in the nominated direction, introducing a number of rare \\"cameo\\" events, and committing some outrageous puns. Dave Platt's 550-point version of Colossal Cave ‚Äì perhaps the most famous variant of this game other than the original, itself a jumping-off point for many other versions including Michael Goetz's 581 point CP/M version ‚Äì included a long extension on the other side of the Volcano View. Eventually, the player descends into a maze of catacombs and a \\"fake Y2\\". If the player says \\"plugh\\" here the player is transported to a \\"Precarious Chair\\" suspended in midair above the molten lava. (The 581-point version was on SIGM011 from the CP/M Users Group, 1984.) In 2017, Eric S. Raymond received permission from Crowther and Woods to release the source code for a forward port of their last version of the game dating from 1995. Raymond refers to this port as Open Adventure, but it uses the original six-character name for the executable in order to avoid colliding with the BSD port.  Critical analysis  Graham Nelson's Inform Designer's Manual presents \\"Advent\\" as the pioneer of the three-part structure typical of 1980s adventure games; he identifies the \\"prologue\\" with the aboveground region of the game \\"whose presence lends a much greater sense of claustrophobia and depth to the underground bulk of the game\\", the transition to the middle game as the \\"passage from the mundane to the fantastical\\", and the endgame or \\"Master Game\\". Dennis Jerz, among other cavers, has explored the Mammoth Cave system against Crowther's original layout for the game, and they believe that much of Crowther's map and descriptions in the game matched well with the natural Colossal Cave as it had been in the 1970s at the time that Crowther would have surveyed it. Many of the rooms are named based on caving jargon used for marking survey points which Crowther would have used in his surveys. In-game elements such as the small house at the start of the game and grates separating some rooms represented features that had been in place by the Park Service but since removed. Other natural elements such as a narrow cobble-strewn crawlway leading from the Bedquilt Cave to the Colossal Cave also matched consistency with the in-game locations. Woods' expansion would add new features that were not part of the natural caves, as he had never visited the park.  Influence  Colossal Cave Adventure is considered one of video gaming's most influential titles. Dave Lebling said that when it arrived at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, \\"For a couple of weeks, dozens of people were playing the game and feeding each other clues ... Everyone was asking you in the hallway if you had gotten past the snake yet.\\" The game is generally the first known example of interactive fiction and established conventions that are standard in interactive fiction titles today, such as the use of shortened cardinal directions for commands like \\"e\\" for \\"east\\". Colossal Cave Adventure directly inspired the creation of the adventure game genre. Games such as Adventureland by Scott Adams of Adventure International, Zork by the team of Lebling, Marc Blank, Tim Anderson, Bruce Daniels, and Albert Vezza of Infocom, and Mystery House by Roberta and Ken Williams of Sierra Entertainment were all directly influenced by Colossal Cave Adventure, and these companies would go on to become key innovators for the early adventure game genre. As described by Matt Barton in Dungeons and Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games, Colossal Cave Adventure demonstrated the \\"creation of a virtual world and the means to explore it\\", and the inclusion of monsters and simplified combat. For this, it is considered the precursor of computer role-playing games. Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy state Adventure as an influence for their game Rogue in 1980, which would go on to become the namesake of the roguelike genre. Adventure also inspired the development of online multiplayer games like MUDs, the precursors of the modern-day MMORPG. The Atari 2600 video game Adventure was an attempt to create a graphical version of Adventure, and itself became the first known example of an action-adventure game and introduced the fantasy genre to video game consoles. The Carmen Sandiego series, one of the first educational games, was inspired by transforming the caverns of Colossal Cave Adventure into a globe-spanning clue-and-treasure hunt. = Memorable words and phrases = Due to its influence, a number of words and phrases used in Adventure have become recurring concepts in later games.  Xyzzy  \\"Xyzzy\\" is a magic word that teleports the player between two locations (\\"inside building\\" and the \\"debris room\\"). Entering the command from other locations produces the disappointing response \\"Nothing happens.\\" As an in-joke tribute to Adventure, many later computer programs (not only games but also applications) include a hidden \\"xyzzy\\" command ‚Äì the results of which range from the humorous to the straightforward. Crowther stated that for its purpose in the game, \\"magic words should look queer, and yet somehow be pronounceable\\", leading him to select \\"xyzzy\\". The meaning and origin of the term are unclear, but Crowther has said \\"I made it up out of whole cloth just for the game\\", and offered that as he had been considering working at Xerox at the time, he focused on a word starting with X.  Maze of twisty little passages  In Crowther's original version of Adventure, he created a maze where each of ten room descriptions was exactly the same; \`YOU ARE IN A MAZE OF TWISTY LITTLE PASSAGES, ALL ALIKE.\` The layout of this \\"all alike\\" maze was fixed, so the player would have to figure out how to map the maze. One method would be to drop objects in the rooms to act as landmarks, enabling one to map the section on paper. Woods' version added a second maze, where the description of each of eleven rooms was similar but subtly different. For example, \`YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTING PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.\` and \`YOU ARE IN A MAZE OF TWISTING LITTLE PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.\` The layout was still fixed but the player did not have to drop inventory objects to map the maze. Instead, this \\"all different\\" maze required the player to recognize the wording changes to find maze exits and its solution. Don Woods was doing doctoral research in graph algorithms, and he designed this maze as (almost) a complete graph, with two exceptions important to gameplay. The phrase \\"you are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike\\" has become memorialized and popularized in the hacker culture, where \\"passages\\" may be replaced with a different word, as the situation warrants. This phrase came to signify a situation when whatever action is taken does not change the result. The line was used by Nick Montfort in the title for his book about the history of interactive fiction, Twisty Little Passages: An Approach To Interactive Fiction.  Plugh  When the player arrives at a location known as \\"Y2\\", the player may (with 25% probability) receive the message \\"A hollow voice says 'PLUGH'.\\" This magic word takes the player between the rooms \\"inside building\\" and \\"Y2\\". Some other games recognize \\"PLUGH\\" and will respond to it, usually by making a joke. A web page giving responses to \\"plugh\\" in many games of interactive fiction The adventure game Prisoner 2 contained a cavern with the word \\"PLUGH\\" written on the wall; if the player typed this word into the command parser, he was sent back to his starting point. The TRS-80 adventure game Haunted House ‚Äì one of the few commercial adventure games playable with only 4K of RAM ‚Äì requires the player to type PLUGH to enter the haunted house. If the player types PLUGH inside the haunted house, the game replies, \\"Sorry, only one PLUGH per customer.\\" Another TRS-80 game, Bedlam, replies to PLUGH with \\"You got better.\\" Plugh.com gives further historical background to the name, allegedly by Don Woods. = In popular culture = The game Kentucky Route Zero's third act draws direct inspiration from this game, as well as Crowther's career in caving. The act shows a computer simulation set up inside of a cave, which is itself depicting a massive cave system. Though not mentioned by name, Colossal Cave Adventure is described in Tracy Kidder's 1981 non-fiction book The Soul of a New Machine, alluding to several of the location names from the game. The documentary Get Lamp on the history of text adventure games is named in part for one of the first objects the player encounters (the first is the lamp, the second is water) and must carry to solve Colossal Cave Adventure. Colossal Cave Adventure is a key plot point in season 1 episode 5 of the AMC TV series, Halt and Catch Fire, a period drama taking place in the early days of the personal computing revolution. The chief software designer uses the game as a competency test to determine which programmers will remain on the team. Those who hack the code and find the backdoors are retained. As a tie-in, a fully playable version of the game (augmented with player hints and \\"hidden\\" artwork revealed when certain locations are visited) was made available on the show's official website. The point-and-click adventure Thimbleweed Park references a successor called Colossal Cave Adventure 2 in the plot. As of 1 May 2019, Colossal Cave Adventure was officially inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame along with Microsoft Solitaire, Mortal Kombat, and Super Mario Kart.

Modern ventilators are computerized microprocessor-controlled machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated bag valve mask. Ventilators are chiefly used in intensive-care medicine, home care, and emergency medicine (as standalone units) and in anesthesiology (as a component of an anesthesia machine). Ventilators are sometimes called \\"respirators\\", a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the \\"Bird respirator\\"). However, contemporary hospital and medical terminology uses the word \\"respirator\\" to refer to a protective face-mask. Function A standard setup for a ventilator in a hospital room. The ventilator pushes warm, moist air (or air with increased oxygen) to the patient. Exhaled air flows away from the patient. In its simplest form, a modern positive pressure ventilator consists of a compressible air reservoir or turbine, air and oxygen supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable \\"patient circuit\\". The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room- air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the lungs' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a one-way valve within the patient circuit called the patient manifold. Ventilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g. pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g. air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled turbopump. Modern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small embedded system to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient's needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, respiratory therapists are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance. In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient's interaction with the ventilator is done by critical care nurses. The patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive. Noninvasive methods, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive ventilation, which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require intubation, which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a tracheotomy cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation. =Life-critical system= Because failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as life- critical systems, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their power supply. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no single point of failure can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an anaesthetic machine). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.  History  The history of mechanical ventilation begins with various versions of what was eventually called the iron lung, a form of noninvasive negative-pressure ventilator widely used during the polio epidemics of the twentieth century after the introduction of the \\"Drinker respirator\\" in 1928, improvements introduced by John Haven Emerson in 1931, and the Both respirator in 1937. Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation, the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines. In 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at Harvard University. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles. An East-Radcliffe respirator model from the mid-twentieth century In the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a Sturmey-Archer bicycle hub gear to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive windscreen wiper motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs. Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as ether and cyclopropane. In 1952, Roger Manley of the Westminster Hospital, London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice. The 1955 release of Forrest Bird's \\"Bird Universal Medical Respirator\\" in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment. The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the \\"Bird\\". It was a pneumatic device and therefore required no electrical power source to operate. In 1965, the Army Emergency Respirator was developed in collaboration with the Harry Diamond Laboratories (now part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory) and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Its design incorporated the principle of fluid amplification in order to govern pneumatic functions. Fluid amplification allowed the respirator to be manufactured entirely without moving parts, yet capable of complex resuscitative functions. Elimination of moving parts increased performance reliability and minimized maintenance. The mask is composed of a poly(methyl methacrylate) (commercially known as Lucite) block, about the size of a pack of cards, with machined channels and a cemented or screwed-in cover plate. The reduction of moving parts cut manufacturing costs and increased durability. The bistable fluid amplifier design allowed the respirator to function as both a respiratory assistor and controller. It could functionally transition between assistor and controller automatically, based on the patient's needs. The dynamic pressure and turbulent jet flow of gas from inhalation to exhalation allowed the respirator to synchronize with the breathing of the patient. Intensive care environments around the world revolutionized in 1971 by the introduction of the first SERVO 900 ventilator (Elema-Sch√∂nander), constructed by Bj√∂rn Jonson. It was a small, silent and effective electronic ventilator, with the famous SERVO feedback system controlling what had been set and regulating delivery. For the first time, the machine could deliver the set volume in volume control ventilation. Ventilators used under increased pressure (hyperbaric) require special precautions, and few ventilators can operate under these conditions. In 1979, Sechrist Industries introduced their Model 500A ventilator, which was specifically designed for use with hyperbaric chambers. =Microprocessor ventilators= Microprocessor control led to the third generation of intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators, starting with the Dr√§ger EV-A in 1982 in Germany which allowed monitoring the patient's breathing curve on an LCD monitor. One year later followed Puritan Bennett 7200 and Bear 1000, SERVO 300 and Hamilton Veolar over the next decade. Microprocessors enable customized gas delivery and monitoring, and mechanisms for gas delivery that are much more responsive to patient needs than previous generations of mechanical ventilators.  Open- source ventilators  An open-source ventilator is a disaster-situation ventilator made using a freely-licensed design, and ideally, freely-available components and parts. Designs, components, and parts may be anywhere from completely reverse-engineered to completely new creations, components may be adaptations of various inexpensive existing products, and special hard-to-find and/or expensive parts may be 3D printed instead of sourced. During the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic, various kinds of ventilators have been considered. Deaths caused by COVID-19 have occurred when the most severely infected experience acute respiratory distress syndrome, a widespread inflammation in the lungs that impairs the lungs' ability to absorb oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. These patients require a capable ventilator to continue breathing. Among ventilators that might be brought into the COVID-19 fight, there have been many concerns. These include current availability, the challenge of making more and lower cost ventilators, effectiveness, functional design, safety, portability, suitability for infants, assignment to treat other illnesses, and operator training. Deploying the best possible mix of ventilators can save the most lives. Although not formally open-sourced, the Ventec V+ Pro ventilator was developed in April 2020 as a shared effort between Ventec Life Systems and General Motors, to provide a rapid supply of 30,000 ventilators capable of treating COVID-19 patients. A major worldwide design effort began during the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic after a Hackaday project was started, in order to respond to expected ventilator shortages causing higher mortality rate among severe patients. On March 20, 2020, the Irish Health Service began reviewing designs. A prototype is being designed and tested in Colombia. The Polish company Urbicum reports successful testing of a 3D-printed open-source prototype device called VentilAid. The makers describe it as a last resort device when professional equipment is missing. The design is publicly available. The first Ventilaid prototype requires compressed air to run. On March 21, 2020 the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) began maintaining a strategic list of open source designs being worked on. The NECSI project considers manufacturing capability, medical safety and need for treating patients in various conditions, speed dealing with legal and political issues, logistics and supply. NECSI is staffed with scientists from Harvard and MIT and others who have an understanding of pandemics, medicine, systems, risk, and data collection. The University of Minnesota Bakken Medical Device Center initiated a collaboration with various companies to bring a ventilator alternative to the market that works as a one- armed robot and replaces the need for manual ventilation in emergency situations. The Coventor device was developed in a very short time and approved on April 15, 2020 by the FDA, only 30 days after conception. The mechanical ventilator is designed for use by trained medical professionals in intensive care units and easy to operate. It has a compact design and is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and distribute. The cost is only about 4% of a normal ventilator. In addition, this device does not require pressurized oxygen or air supply, as is normally the case. A first series is manufactured by Boston Scientific. The plans are to be freely available online to the general public without royalties. COVID-19 pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortages of essential goods and services - from hand sanitizers to masks to beds to ventilators. Several countries have already experienced a shortage of ventilators. Fifty-four governments, including many in Europe and Asia, imposed restrictions on medical supply exports in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The number of ventilators varies by country. When data is often not available for ventilators specifically, estimates are sometimes made based on the number of intensive care unit beds available, which often contain ventilators. =United States= In 2006, president George W. Bush signed the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which created the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In preparation for a possible epidemic of respiratory disease, the newly created office awarded a $6 million contract to Newport Medical Instruments, a small company in California, to make 40,000 ventilators for under $3,000 apiece. In 2011, Newport sent three prototypes to the Centers for Disease Control. In 2012, Covidien, a $12 billion/year medical device manufacturer, which manufactured more expensive competing ventilators, bought Newport for $100 million. Covidien delayed and in 2014 cancelled the contract. BARDA started over again with a new company, Philips, and in July 2019, the FDA approved the Philips ventilator, and the government ordered 10,000 ventilators for delivery in mid-2020. On April 23, 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a successful COVID-19 ventilator, named VITAL (\\"Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally\\"). On April 30, NASA reported receiving fast-track approval for emergency use by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the new ventilator. On May 29, NASA reported that eight manufacturers were selected to manufacture the new ventilator.

Addison-Wesley. History Interest in polymorphic type systems developed significantly in the 1960s, with practical implementations beginning to appear by the end of the decade. Ad hoc polymorphism and parametric polymorphism were originally described in Christopher Strachey's Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages, where they are listed as \\"the two main classes\\" of polymorphism. Ad hoc polymorphism was a feature of Algol 68, while parametric polymorphism was the core feature of ML's type system. In a 1985 paper, Peter Wegner and Luca Cardelli introduced the term inclusion polymorphism to model subtypes and inheritance, citing Simula as the first programming language to implement it. Types =Ad hoc polymorphism= Christopher Strachey chose the term ad hoc polymorphism to refer to polymorphic functions that can be applied to arguments of different types, but that behave differently depending on the type of the argument to which they are applied (also known as function overloading or operator overloading). The term \\"ad hoc\\" in this context is not intended to be pejorative; it refers simply to the fact that this type of polymorphism is not a fundamental feature of the type system. In the Pascal / Delphi example below, the \`Add\` functions seem to work generically over various types when looking at the invocations, but are considered to be two entirely distinct functions by the compiler for all intents and purposes: program Adhoc; function Add(x, y : Integer) : Integer; begin Add := x + y end; function Add(s, t : String) : String; begin Add := Concat(s, t) end; begin Writeln(Add(1, 2)); (* Prints \\"3\\" *) Writeln(Add('Hello, ', 'Mammals!')); (* Prints \\"Hello, Mammals!\\" *) end. In dynamically typed languages the situation can be more complex as the correct function that needs to be invoked might only be determinable at run time. Implicit type conversion has also been defined as a form of polymorphism, referred to as \\"coercion polymorphism\\". =Parametric polymorphism= Parametric polymorphism allows a function or a data type to be written generically, so that it can handle values uniformly without depending on their type.Pierce, B. C. 2002 Types and Programming Languages. MIT Press. Parametric polymorphism is a way to make a language more expressive while still maintaining full static type-safety. The concept of parametric polymorphism applies to both data types and functions. A function that can evaluate to or be applied to values of different types is known as a polymorphic function. A data type that can appear to be of a generalized type (e.g. a list with elements of arbitrary type) is designated polymorphic data type like the generalized type from which such specializations are made. Parametric polymorphism is ubiquitous in functional programming, where it is often simply referred to as \\"polymorphism\\". The following example in Haskell shows a parameterized list data type and two parametrically polymorphic functions on them: data List a = Nil  Cons a (List a) length :: List a -> Integer length Nil = 0 length (Cons x xs) = 1 + length xs map :: (a -> b) -> List a -> List b map f Nil = Nil map f (Cons x xs) = Cons (f x) (map f xs) Parametric polymorphism is also available in several object-oriented languages. For instance, templates in C++ and D, or under the name generics in C#, Delphi and Java: class List { class Node { T elem; Node next; } Node head; int length() { ... } } List **map(Func f, List xs) { ... } John C. Reynolds (and later Jean-Yves Girard) formally developed this notion of polymorphism as an extension to lambda calculus (called the polymorphic lambda calculus or System F). Any parametrically polymorphic function is necessarily restricted in what it can do, working on the shape of the data instead of its value, leading to the concept of parametricity. =Subtyping= Some languages employ the idea of subtyping (also called subtype polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism) to restrict the range of types that can be used in a particular case of polymorphism. In these languages, subtyping allows a function to be written to take an object of a certain type T, but also work correctly, if passed an object that belongs to a type S that is a subtype of T (according to the Liskov substitution principle). This type relation is sometimes written S <: T. Conversely, T is said to be a supertype of S‚Äîwritten T :> S. Subtype polymorphism is usually resolved dynamically (see below). In the following example we make cats and dogs subtypes of animals. The procedure \`letsHear()\` accepts an animal, but will also work correctly if a subtype is passed to it: abstract class Animal { abstract String talk(); } class Cat extends Animal { String talk() { return \\"Meow!\\"; } } class Dog extends Animal { String talk() { return \\"Woof!\\"; } } static void letsHear(final Animal a) { println(a.talk()); } static void main(String[] args) { letsHear(new Cat()); letsHear(new Dog()); } In another example, if Number, Rational, and Integer are types such that Number :> Rational and Number :> Integer, a function written to take a Number will work equally well when passed an Integer or Rational as when passed a Number. The actual type of the object can be hidden from clients into a black box, and accessed via object identity. In fact, if the Number type is abstract, it may not even be possible to get your hands on an object whose most-derived type is Number (see abstract data type, abstract class). This particular kind of type hierarchy is known‚Äîespecially in the context of the Scheme programming language‚Äîas a numerical tower, and usually contains many more types. Object-oriented programming languages offer subtype polymorphism using subclassing (also known as inheritance). In typical implementations, each class contains what is called a virtual table‚Äîa table of functions that implement the polymorphic part of the class interface‚Äîand each object contains a pointer to the \\"vtable\\" of its class, which is then consulted whenever a polymorphic method is called. This mechanism is an example of: * late binding, because virtual function calls are not bound until the time of invocation; * single dispatch (i.e. single-argument polymorphism), because virtual function calls are bound simply by looking through the vtable provided by the first argument (the \`this\` object), so the runtime types of the other arguments are completely irrelevant. The same goes for most other popular object systems. Some, however, such as Common Lisp Object System, provide multiple dispatch, under which method calls are polymorphic in all arguments. The interaction between parametric polymorphism and subtyping leads to the concepts of variance and bounded quantification. =Row polymorphism= Row polymorphism is a similar, but distinct concept from subtyping. It deals with structural types. It allows the usage of all values whose types have certain properties, without losing the remaining type information. =Polytypism= A related concept is polytypism (or data type genericity). A polytypic function is more general than polymorphic, and in such a function, \\"though one can provide fixed ad hoc cases for specific data types, an ad hoc combinator is absent\\".Ralf Lammel and Joost Visser, \\"Typed Combinators for Generic Traversal\\", in Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages: 4th International Symposium (2002), p. 153. Implementation aspects =Static and dynamic polymorphism= Polymorphism can be distinguished by when the implementation is selected: statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at run time, typically via a virtual function). This is known respectively as static dispatch and dynamic dispatch, and the corresponding forms of polymorphism are accordingly called static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism. Static polymorphism executes faster, because there is no dynamic dispatch overhead, but requires additional compiler support. Further, static polymorphism allows greater static analysis by compilers (notably for optimization), source code analysis tools, and human readers (programmers). Dynamic polymorphism is more flexible but slower‚Äîfor example, dynamic polymorphism allows duck typing, and a dynamically linked library may operate on objects without knowing their full type. Static polymorphism typically occurs in ad hoc polymorphism and parametric polymorphism, whereas dynamic polymorphism is usual for subtype polymorphism. However, it is possible to achieve static polymorphism with subtyping through more sophisticated use of template metaprogramming, namely the curiously recurring template pattern. When polymorphism is exposed via a library, static polymorphism becomes impossible for dynamic libraries as there is no way of knowing what types the parameters are when the shared object is built.

He is best known for his soulful, bluesy approach to playing the alto saxophone, although in his formative years he was, as many were of the bebop era, heavily influenced by Charlie Parker.[ Allmusic Biography] Life and career Donaldson was born in Badin, North Carolina. He attended North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro in the early 1940s. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was trained at the Great Lakes bases in Chicago where he was introduced to bop music in the lively club scene. At the war's conclusion, he returned to Greensboro, where he worked club dates with the Rhythm Vets, a combo composed of A and T students who had served in the U.S. Navy. The band recorded the soundtrack to a musical comedy featurette, Pitch a Boogie Woogie, in Greenville, North Carolina, in the summer of 1947. The movie had a limited run at black audience theatres in 1948 but its production company, Lord-Warner Pictures, folded and never made another film. Pitch a Boogie Woogie was restored by the American Film Institute in 1985 and re-premiered on the campus of East Carolina University in Greenville the following year. Donaldson and the surviving members of the Vets performed a reunion concert after the film's showing.

Donaldson's first jazz recordings were with the Charlie Singleton Orchestra in 1950 and then with bop emissaries Milt Jackson and Thelonious Monk in 1952, and he participated in several small groups with other jazz luminaries such as trumpeter Blue Mitchell, pianist Horace Silver, and drummer Art Blakey. In 1953, he also recorded sessions with the trumpet virtuoso Clifford Brown, and Philly Joe Jones. He was a member of Art Blakey's Quintet and appeared on some of their best regarded albums, including the two albums recorded at Birdland in February 1954 Night at Birdland. He was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame on October 11, 2012. Also in 2012, he was named a NEA Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2016, he retired at age 90.

Catheterization allows urine to drain from the bladder for collection. It may also be used to inject liquids used for treatment or diagnosis of bladder conditions. A clinician, often a nurse, usually performs the procedure, but self-catheterization is also possible. A catheter may be in place for long periods of time (indwelling catheter) or removed after each use (intermittent catheterisation). Catheter types Catheters come in several basic designs: *A Foley catheter (indwelling urinary catheter) is retained by means of a balloon at the tip that is inflated with sterile water. The balloons typically come in two different sizes: 5 cm3 and 30 cm3. They are commonly made in silicone rubber or natural rubber. *An intermittent catheter/Robinson catheter is a flexible catheter that is removed after each use. Unlike the Foley catheter, it has no balloon on its tip and therefore cannot stay in place unaided. These can be non-coated or coated (e.g., hydrophilic coated and ready to use). *A coud√© catheter, including Tiemann's catheter, is designed with a curved tip that makes it easier to pass through the curvature of the prostatic urethra. *A hematuria (or haematuria) catheter is a type of Foley catheter used for Post-TURP hemostasis. This is useful following endoscopic surgical procedures, or in the case of gross hematuria. There are both two-way and three-way hematuria catheters (double and triple lumen). *A condom catheter can be used by males and carries a lower risk of infection than an indwelling catheter. Catheter diameters are sized by the French catheter scale (F). The most common sizes are 10 F (3.3mm) to 28 F (9.3mm). The clinician selects a size large enough to allow free flow of urine, and large enough to control leakage of urine around the catheter. A larger size is necessary when the urine is thick, bloody, or contains large amounts of sediment. Larger catheters, however, are more likely to damage the urethra. Some people develop allergies or sensitivities to latex after long-term latex catheter use making it necessary to use silicone or Teflon types. Evidence does not support an important decrease in the risk of urinary tract infections when silver-alloy catheters are used.  Indications  Common indications for urinary catheterization include acute or chronic urinary retention (which can damage the kidneys), orthopaedic procedures that may limit a patient's movement, the need for accurate monitoring of input and output (such as in an ICU), benign prostatic hyperplasia, incontinence, and the effects of various surgical interventions involving the bladder, prostate or bowel. Intermittent self- catheterization may be indicated in cases of neurogenic bladder due to damage to the spinal cord or brain. This can be performed by the patient four to six times a day, using a clean technique. Nurses use a sterile technique to perform intermittent catheterization in hospital settings. For patients with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury, intermittent catheterisation (IC) is a standard method for bladder emptying. The technique is safe and effective and results in improved kidney and upper urinary tract status, lessening of vesicoureteral reflux and amelioration of continence. In addition to the clinical benefits, patient quality of life is enhanced by the increased independence and security offered by self-catheterization. Catheter maintenance A catheter that is left in place for more than a short period of time is generally attached to a drainage bag to collect the urine. This also allows for measurement of urine volume. There are three types of drainage bags: The first is a leg bag, a smaller drainage device that attaches by elastic bands to the leg. A leg bag is usually worn during the day, as it fits discreetly under pants or skirts, and is easily emptied into a toilet. The second type of drainage bag is a larger device called a down drain that may be used overnight. This device is hung on a hook under the patient's bed‚Äînever placed on the floor, due to the risk of bacterial infection. The third is called a belly bag and is secured around the waist. This bag can be worn at all times. It can be worn under the patient's underwear to provide a totally undetectable look. During long-term use, the catheter may be left in place all the time, or a patient may be instructed on a procedure for placing a catheter just long enough to empty the bladder and then removing it (known as intermittent self-catheterization). Patients undergoing major surgery are often catheterized and may remain so for some time. The patient may require irrigation of the bladder with sterile saline injected through the catheter to flush out clots or other matter that does not drain. Complications Catheterization can have short and long term complications. Generally long- term catheterization carries higher risk of complications. Long-term catheterization carries a significant risk of urinary tract infection. Because of this risk catheterization is a last resort for the management of incontinence where other measures have proved unsuccessful. Other long term complications may include blood infections (sepsis), urethral injury, skin breakdown, bladder stones, and blood in the urine (hematuria). After many years of catheter use, bladder cancer may also develop. Some people experience bladder spasms with catheterization and may be more common in males. If bladder spasms occur, or there is no urine in the drainage bag, the catheter may be blocked by blood, thick sediment, or a kink in the catheter or drainage tubing. Sometimes spasms are caused by the catheter irritating the bladder, prostate, or penis. Such spasms can be controlled with medication such as butylscopolamine, although most patients eventually adjust to the irritation and the spasms go away. Preventing infection Everyday care of catheter and drainage bag is important to reduce the risk of infection. Such precautions include: * Cleansing the urethral area (the area where the catheter exits body) and the catheter itself. * Disconnecting drainage bag from catheter only with clean hands * Disconnecting drainage bag as seldom as possible. * Keeping drainage bag connector as clean as possible and cleaning the drainage bag periodically. * Use of a thin catheter where possible to reduce the risk of harming the urethra during insertion. * Drinking sufficient liquid to produce at least two litres of urine daily * Sexual activity is very high risk for urinary infections, especially for catheterized women. There is no clear evidence that any one catheter type or insertion technique is superior than another in preventing infection. In the UK it is generally accepted that cleaning the area surrounding the urethral meatus with 0.9% sodium chloride solution is sufficient for both male and female patients as there is no reliable evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptic agents reduces the risk of urinary tract infection. Recent developments in the field of the temporary prostatic stent have been viewed as a possible alternative to indwelling catheterization and the infections associated with their use. History Ancient Egyptian and Roman physicians have been described using reeds as urinary catheters to overcome blockages, and catheterisation to relieve urinary retention has also been described in ancient Indian and Chinese texts.

He represented Michigan in the United States Senate and served in the Cabinets of two U.S. Presidents, Andrew Jackson and James Buchanan. He was also the 1848 Democratic presidential nominee and a leading spokesman for the Doctrine of Popular Sovereignty, which held that the people in each territory should decide whether to permit slavery. Born in Exeter, New Hampshire, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy before establishing a legal practice in Zanesville, Ohio. After serving in the Ohio House of Representatives, he was appointed as a U.S. Marshal. Cass also joined the Freemasons and would eventually co-found the Grand Lodge of Michigan. He fought at the Battle of the Thames in the War of 1812 and was appointed to govern Michigan Territory in 1813. He negotiated treaties with Native Americans to open land for American settlement and led a survey expedition into the northwest part of the territory. Cass resigned as governor in 1831 to accept appointment as Secretary of War under Andrew Jackson. As Secretary of War, he helped implement Jackson's policy of Indian removal. After serving as ambassador to France from 1836 to 1842, he unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination at the 1844 Democratic National Convention; a deadlock between supporters of Cass and former President Martin Van Buren ended with the nomination of James K. Polk. In 1845, the Michigan Legislature elected Cass to the Senate, where he served until 1848. Cass's nomination at the 1848 Democratic National Convention precipitated a split in the party, as Cass's advocacy for popular sovereignty alienated the anti-slavery wing of the party. Van Buren led the Free Soil Party's presidential ticket and appealed to many anti-slavery Democrats, possibly contributing to the victory of Whig nominee Zachary Taylor. Cass returned to the Senate in 1849 and continued to serve until 1857 when he accepted appointment as the Secretary of State. He unsuccessfully sought to buy land from Mexico and sympathized with American filibusters in Latin America. Cass resigned from the Cabinet in December 1860 in protest of Buchanan's handling of the threatened secession of several Southern states. Since his death in 1866, he has been commemorated in various ways, including with a statue in the National Statuary Hall. Early life Cass was born on October 9, 1782, in Exeter, New Hampshire, just after the end of the American Revolution. His parents were Molly (n√©e Gilman) Cass and Major Jonathan Cass, a Revolutionary War veteran who fought under General George Washington at Bunker Hill. Cass attended the private Phillips Exeter Academy. In 1800, the family moved to Marietta, Ohio, part of a wave of westward migration after the end of the war and defeat of Native Americans in the Northwest Indian War. Cass studied law with Return J. Meigs Jr., was admitted to the bar, and began a practice in Zanesville. Career In 1806, Cass was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. The following year, President Thomas Jefferson appointed Cass as the U.S. Marshal for Ohio. He joined the Freemasons, an increasingly popular fraternal organization in that period, being initiated as an Entered Apprentice in what was later American Union Lodge No.1 at Marietta on December 5, 1803. He achieved his Fellow Craft degree on April 2, 1804, and his Master Mason degree on May 7, 1804. On June 24, 1805, he was admitted as Charter member of the Lodge of Amity 105 (later No.5), Zanesville. He served as the first Worshipful Master of the Lodge of Amity in 1806. Cass was one of the founders of the Grand Lodge of Ohio, representing the Lodge of Amity at the first meeting on January 4, 1808. He was elected Deputy Grand Master on January 5, 1809, and Grand Master on January 3, 1810, January 8, 1811, and January 8, 1812. =War of 1812= When the War of 1812 began against the United Kingdom, he took command of the 3rd Ohio Volunteer Regiment. He became colonel of the 27th United States Infantry Regiment on February 20, 1813. Soon after, he was promoted to brigadier general in the Regular Army on March 12, 1813. Cass took part in the Battle of the Thames, a defeat of British and Native Indian forces. Cass resigned from the Army on May 1, 1814. =Territorial Governor of Michigan= As a reward for his military service, Cass was appointed Governor of the Michigan Territory by President James Madison on October 29, 1813, serving until 1831. As he was frequently traveling on business, several territorial secretaries often acted as governor in his place. During this period, he helped negotiate and implement treaties with Native American tribes in Michigan, by which they ceded substantial amounts of land. Some were given small reservations in the territory. In 1817, Cass was one of the two commissioners (along with Duncan McArthur), who negotiated the Treaty of Fort Meigs, which was signed on September 29 with several Native American tribes of the region, under which they ceded large amounts of territory to the United States. This helped open up areas of Michigan to settlement by Euro-Americans. That same year, Cass was named to serve as Secretary of War under President James Monroe, but he declined the appointment. In 1820, Cass led an expedition to the northwestern part of Michigan Territory, in the Great Lakes region in today's northern Minnesota. Its purpose was to map the region and locate the source of the Mississippi River. The headwater of the great river was then unknown, resulting in an undefined border between the United States and British North America, which had been linked to the river. The Cass expedition erroneously identified what became known as Cass Lake as the Mississippi's source. It was not until 1832 that Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, the Cass expedition's geologist, identified nearby Lake Itasca as the headwater of the Mississippi. =Secretary of War= On August 1, 1831, Cass resigned as governor of the Michigan Territory to take the post of Secretary of War under President Andrew Jackson, a position he would hold until 1836. Cass was a central figure in implementing the Indian removal policy of the Jackson administration; Congress had passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830. While it was directed chiefly against the Southeastern tribes, especially the Five Civilized Tribes, it also affected tribes in Ohio, Illinois and other areas east of the Mississippi River. Most were forced to Indian Territory in present-day Kansas and Oklahoma, but a number of bands negotiated being allowed to remain in Michigan. =U.S. Minister to France= Lewis Cass At the end of his term, President Jackson appointed Cass to succeed Edward Livingston as the U.S. Minister to France on October 4, 1836. He presented his credentials on December 1, 1836, and served until he left his post on November 12, 1842, when he was succeeded by William R. King, who later became the 13th Vice President of the United States under President Franklin Pierce. =Presidential ambitions and U.S. Senate= In the 1844 Democratic convention Cass stood as a candidate for the presidential nomination, losing on the 9th ballot to dark horse candidate James K. Polk. Cass was elected by the state legislature to represent Michigan in the United States Senate, serving in 1845-48. He served as chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs in the 30th Congress. In 1848, he resigned from the Senate to run for president in the 1848 election. William Orlando Butler was selected as his running mate.Kleber, John E. (ed.) (1992). The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 146. University Press of Kentucky. , . Cass was a leading supporter of the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which held that the American citizens who lived in a territory should decide whether to permit slavery there.Klunder (1996), pp. 266‚Äì67 His nomination caused a split in the Democratic Party, leading many antislavery Northern Democrats to join the Free Soil Party, which nominated former President Martin Van Buren. After losing the election to Zachary Taylor, Cass was returned by the state legislature to the Senate, serving from 1849-57. He was the first non- incumbent Democratic presidential candidate to lose an election and the first Democrat who was unsuccessful in his bid to succeed another Democrat as President. Apart from James Buchanan's election to succeed Franklin Pierce in 1856, subsequent Democrats who attempted election to succeed another Democrat as President all failed in their bid to do so. Cass made another bid for president in 1852 but neither he nor rival Democratic contenders, Buchanan and Stephen Douglas secured a majority of delegates' votes at the Democratic Convention in Baltimore, and the party went with Franklin Pierce instead. =U.S. Secretary of State= On March 6, 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Cass to serve as Secretary of State as a consolation prize for his previous presidential runs. Although retaining incumbent Secretary of State William L. Marcy was considered the best option by many, Buchanan made it clear that he did not want to keep anyone from the Pierce Administration. Moreover, Marcy had opposed his earlier presidential bids, and was in poor health in any event, ultimately dying in July 1857. Cass, aged 75, was seen by most as too old for such a demanding position and was thought to be likely be little more than a figurehead. Buchanan, weighing many of the other options for Secretary of State, considered that Cass was the best choice to avoid political infighting and sectional tensions. Buchanan, who did not particularly like Cass, nonetheless wrote a flattering letter offering him the post of Secretary of State, commenting that he was remarkably active and energetic for his advanced age. Cass, who was retiring from the Senate, but not eager to leave Washington and return home to Michigan, immediately accepted. Aware of his age and physical limitations, Cass agreed to delegate most of his powers as Secretary of State to an Assistant Secretary of State or the president himself. He also promised to refrain from making anti-British remarks in public (having served in the War of 1812, Cass had a low opinion of London). Most assumed Cass was a temporary Secretary of State until a younger, more fit man could be found, however, he ultimately served for all but the final four months of Buchanan's administration. As expected, the aged Cass largely delegated major decision-making to subordinates, but eagerly signed his name on papers and dispatches penned by them. While sympathetic to American filibusters in Central America, he was instrumental in having Commodore Hiram Paulding removed from command for his landing of Marines in Nicaragua and compelling the extradition of William Walker to the United States.Collier, Ellen C. (1993) \\"Instances of Use of United States Forces Abroad, 1798 - 1993\\" CRS Issue Brief Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, Washington DC Cass attempted to buy more land from Mexico, but faced opposition from both Mexico and congressional leaders. He also negotiated a final settlement to the Clayton‚ÄìBulwer Treaty, limiting U.S. and British control of Latin American countries. The chiefs of Raiatea and Tahaa in the South Pacific, refusing to accept the rule of King Tamatoa V, unsuccessfully petitioned the United States to accept the islands under a protectorate in June 1858. Cass resigned on December 14, 1860, because of what he considered Buchanan's failure to protect federal interests in the South and failure to mobilize the federal military, actions that might have averted the threatened secession of Southern states.Cass's resignation statement, quoted in McLaughlin, Andrew Cunningham (1899) Lewis Cass Houghton, Mifflin, Boston, pp. 345‚Äì346, OCLC 4377268, (standard library edition, first edition was published in 1891) Personal life On May 26, 1806, Cass married Elizabeth Spencer (1786‚Äì1853), the daughter of Dr. Joseph Spencer Jr. and Deborah (n√©e Seldon) Spencer.Heidler, David S., and Heidler, Jeanne T.

It operated domestic and international scheduled services from its main base at Vilnius International Airport.Flight International 3 April 2007 Due to financial difficulties the airline suspended operations on 17 January 2009.  History  =Establishment and privatization= The airline was established as government-owned Lietuvos Avialinijos (Lithuanian Airlines) on 20 September 1991, shortly after Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union. Initially, it operated using aircraft of the Aeroflot fleet located in Vilnius (twelve Yakovlev Yak-42, seven Tupolev Tu-134, four Antonov An-24, and three Antonov An-26 airliners). During the period from 1991 to 1993, the airline re-oriented its route network from the countries of the former Soviet Union to Western Europe. From the beginning, the airline faced stiff competition with Lufthansa and Scandinavian Airlines. In December 1991 Lithuanian Airlines sub-leased its first Boeing 737-200 from Mal√©v Hungarian Airlines. Six months later, the aircraft was leased directly from Guinness Peat Aviation and bore the registration LY-GPA. After a decade of loss-making operations, abortive plans to launch a trans-Atlantic service, and the widely criticized sale of landing slots at London Heathrow to cover some US$20 million in debt, Lithuanian Airlines was privatized in 2005.

She has worked in the classical and pop genres, as a film composer, and was one of the core members of the synthpop band Art of Noise. In 1998, Dudley won an Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score for The Full Monty. In addition to over twenty other film scores, in 2012 she served as music producer for the film version of Les Mis√©rables, also acting as arranger and composing some new additional music. Career Dudley was born in Beckenham, Kent. She graduated with a master's in music from King's College London in 1978. Trained as a classical performer, she moved into the competitive commercial field as a session musician, where her professional relationship with Trevor Horn began. In 1982 Dudley made significant contributions to the Horn-produced The Lexicon of Love album by ABC. She went from fleshing-out keyboard parts to scoring the album's orchestrations (which were, according to Horn, her first-ever string arrangements) and also co-writing some of the songs. In 2019 she conducted the Southbank Sinfonia during Martin Fry's Lexicon of Love tour. Dudley's association with Horn led on to working with artists such as Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Seal, Marc Almond, Rod Stewart, Robbie Williams and, more recently, Siphiwo. She has co-written songs with Malcolm McLaren (\\"Buffalo Gals\\"), Cathy Dennis (\\"Too Many Walls\\"), and a 1930s-inspired song with Sting called \\"This Was Never Meant To Be\\". She produced the Tom Jones hit \\"You Can Leave Your Hat On\\" (1988) and a Debbie Harry single \\"Strike Me Pink\\" (1993). Dudley produced two tracks on the 2002 Opera Babes album Beyond Imagination (ranking No.1 on the UK classical charts for 11 weeks, and No.4 on the US billboard charts). In 2004 she produced the album Voice for Alison Moyet. The album, an eclectic collection of cover versions, reached No.7 in the UK Albums Chart. Dudley was a founding member of the successful band Art of Noise, which helped pioneer the use of sampling within the pop genre. Their stand-out hits include \\"Beat Box\\" (1984), \\"Moments in Love\\" (1985), \\"Close (to the Edit)\\" (1984) and, with Tom Jones, \\"Kiss\\" (1988). Her works for orchestra include \\"Northern Lights\\", a 14-minute reflection of Norway's Aurora Borealis for full orchestra, performed in 2005 and 2006 at the Royal Festival Hall and broadcast on BBC Radio 3's Late Junction programme in May 2005. Her first commission as Composer in Association with the BBC Concert Orchestra was \\"Music and Silence\\", inspired by the novel of the same name by Rose Tremain and first performed at The Royal Festival Hall in 2002. Dudley arranged Bach's Chaconne from Partita in D minor for piano trio, and a recording by the Eroica Trio appears on their Baroque album. Her album Ancient and Modern, with modern versions of some traditional hymns and Bach chorales, was released in 1999. She was the musical director for Bill Bailey's Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra, first performed in Brighton then at the Royal Albert Hall in 2008, which was recorded and released as a DVD in December 2009. The show was toured in 2009 with eight different regional orchestras participating. It involved the orchestra playing the Nokia theme tune and a french horn concerto evolving into the theme from Coronation Street. Dudley collaborated with Sam Taylor-Wood in producing the sound and video installation Sigh at the White Cube in 2008. This work featured the BBC Concert Orchestra on eight large projected screens, miming to Dudley's score. = Film scores = Dudley's career in film music has spanned 20 years and her film scores include: *Buster (1988), a British comedy drama starring musician Phil Collins, Julie Walters, Larry Lamb and Sheila Hancock; *Silence Like Glass (Zwei Frauen) (1989), German-made but set in a cancer ward at a hospital in America; *The Pope Must Die (1991), a comedy film starring Robbie Coltrane the score of which was co-written with Jeff Beck; *Knight Moves (1992), an American thriller directed by Carl Schenkel and starring Christopher Lambert; *The Crying Game (1992), an Irish/British drama film written and directed by Neil Jordan; *Felidae (1994) *The Grotesque (1995), released in the US as Gentlemen Don't Eat Poets a British film starring Alan Bates, Theresa Russell and Sting; *Hollow Reed (1996), a drama directed by Angela Pope and set in Bath; *The Full Monty (1997), a Peter Cattaneo-directed comedy about six unemployed steel workers who decide to form a male striptease act.

Early life and career Named after St. Nicholas Church in Newport, Shropshire of which his grandfather was priest, Budgen was baptised at Lichfield Cathedral by his grandfather, who had also baptised Enoch Powell, as well as marrying his parents. Thirty-seven years later he would succeed Powell as the Conservative member of Parliament for Wolverhampton South West. Nicholas Budgen was educated at St Edward's School in Oxford and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Budgen was raised by his grandfather after his father had been killed during the Second World War, one of his uncles having been killed during the First World War and another during the second. During his National Service he rose to the rank of Lieutenant in the North Staffordshire Regiment. In 1959 he transferred to the Staffordshire Yeomanry. He became a barrister at Gray's Inn in 1962. He was also a very keen amateur rider under National Hunt rules and in the spring of 1971, won two steeplechases (at Market Rasen and Stratford) on his mare Jocelin, who later became the dam of the very useful steeplechaser Brown Chamberlin. Political career In the 1970 general election he stood for the Conservatives in Birmingham, Small Heath, but failed to gain election. In 1974, when the Conservative MP Enoch Powell left the party and resigned from his seat over their policy on the EEC, only six weeks before the 1974 general election, Budgen was selected to stand for the Conservatives in Powell's old seat: Wolverhampton South West. In 1975 he voted to remain in the Common Market. In 1981 he was made a Conservative whip, at the time a sure way of becoming a minister. On 8 May 1982, however, he resigned as a whip over his opposition to the creation of a Northern Ireland Assembly with no government powers.Tim Jones, \\"Tory rebels unlikely to defeat Ulster Bill\\", The Times, 10 May 1982, p. 2. However, to compensate, The Spectator magazine selected him as their 1984 Backbencher of the Year. His speeches in 1985 against the Anglo-Irish Agreement persuaded his cousin Ian Gow to resign as a minister from Margaret Thatcher's government. According to Michael Brown, who was at the time a government whip, Nick Budgen was the only critic of the 1988 Budget, which contained many \\"giveaways\\" and led to high inflation and the 1990 recession. Brown described the situation in the Commons tea room after the budget as one of congratulatory atmosphere until Nick Budgen entered and proceeded to tell those present, \\"It is the most irresponsible budget I have ever heard, it will be downhill from now on. In one fell swoop Mr Lawson has squandered five years of responsible economic management\\". He was also opposed to immigration to the UK and on 10 October 1989, at the Conservative Party Conference, he, with Tim Janman, MP, and Jonathan Guinness (in the chair), addressed a controversial fringe meeting organized by the Young Monday Club, advertised as The End of the English? - Immigration and Repatriation. Charles Moore described at Budgen's memorial service how he once rang Budgen pretending to be a racist constituent. He said that Budgen said he supported a firm immigration policy, but when pushed to agree that all immigrants should be sent home, he forcefully defended their right to be in Britain. \\"His distaste was palpable. I can think of many more liberal-minded MPs who might have given less firm answers to someone they thought might vote for them,\\" he said.MP's election defeat may have brought on cancer, The Birmingham Post, 4 February 1999 In the 2019 release of government papers it was revealed that Budgen avoided Black and Irish people in his constituency. He called for the Prime Minister John Major to sack the then Chancellor Kenneth Clarke because Clarke had resuscitated the idea of the United Kingdom joining the European Single Currency. In spite of this Clarke who had been at Cambridge with Budgen, invited Budgen (who had at the time lost the Conservative Party whip) to his 50th birthday party at 11 Downing Street. But his real prominence came in the 1990s when he was one of the whipless eight; the Maastricht Rebels. The whipless eight had taken to having their own policy meetings, leading former pro-EU Prime Minister Edward Heath to describe them as \\"a party within a party\\". To Budgen the European question was an issue far more important than mere party loyalty. He had a contemptuous attitude towards both party and his leaders, having the second most rebellious voting record in the House of Commons for the period from 1979 to 1997. He is quoted as saying, \\"you know, this is a government you can push\\" and was acutely aware that John Major's government was reliant upon the right wing of its party because of its small majority in the House of Commons.He let the bastards grind him down, The Guardian, 17 October 1999 To this end, he helped lead a hardcore of approximately 50 right-wing Conservative Party MPs to influence government policy on Northern Ireland and Europe among other things. His hard line on the Northern Ireland situation was perhaps stiffened by the IRA murder of his cousin Ian Gow MP, who bled to death in his wife's arms in 1990. He was popular with right-wingers not only for his intelligence but also because he had been campaigning against the UK's gradual European drift since he resigned as a Whip in 1983. The day after a conciliatory article in The Times by Budgen, John Major returned the Conservative whip to the rebels. Additionally, of the whipless rebels, he was the only one to vote with the government on VAT on fuel in November 1994; the government were, however, defeated, forcing the then Chancellor Ken Clarke to return to Parliament with a \\"mini budget\\", an unprecedented event. It was Budgen who first mooted the idea of a referendum on the European Single Currency in 1993, with his proposed European Currency (Referendum) Bill. Budgen was also a leading member of the Treasury Select Committee, who questioned every tax rise and attacked Kenneth Clarke as being \\"intellectually dishonest\\".Clarke sympathy for money union angers sceptics, The Daily Telegraph, 2 May 1996 It was his position on this committee that persuaded him that the Bank of England should be made independent of political interference, this led to his private members bill in 1994, an attempt to privatise the Bank of England. The bill failed; however, in 1997 when the Labour Party was in government, it made the Bank of England independent as one of its first measures. Budgen was also vociferous in protecting the rights of gun owners following the Dunblane massacre. His speech was described in the left-leaning Guardian newspaper by columnist Simon Hoggart as \\"one of the last great parliamentary speeches\\". The Dunblane bill created a situation where small calibre pistols were illegal in the UK (apart from a 3-week period in 2002 for the Commonwealth Games being held in Manchester, with British teams being forced to practise in France). Due to his support for a referendum on the question of European integration, James Goldsmith's Referendum Party decided not to run a candidate against him. Budgen had in fact suggested to the seatless former Conservative Government minister Alan Clark that he should stand for the Referendum Party. He had said that the Conservatives \\"in the West Midlands will be running on alternative manifesto\\", presumably meaning with other local Maastricht Rebels, Christopher Gill (Ludlow) and Richard Shepherd (Aldridge & Brownhills). Despite losing with a 9.9% swing from the Conservatives to Labour, of the 144 seats that Labour gained from the Conservatives it had the joint-tenth lowest swing, and was one of only 13 seats that changed hands with a swing in single figures. Whilst Budgen was in favour of limiting immigration and opposed a ban on handguns, unusually for a right-wing MP (but like Powell), he voted against capital punishment. Budgen was a keen huntsman. He had hunted in 29 of the UK's counties, and in his youth was well known as a particularly fearless rider; he wrote regularly for Horse and Hound and occasionally for the Wall Street Journal, The Times, Daily Mail, Glasgow Herald and The Irish Times. Budgen was described in the Commons by one former minister as being \\"worth ten placeman\\" and by the Daily Telegraph as the \\"late, great Nicholas Budgen\\". He seemed to take great joy in continuing Wolverhampton South West's feud (begun by Enoch Powell) with Edward Heath, heckling him at any opportunity. Powell had let it be known that he would refuse a peerage while Heath was still in the Commons, and the latter refused to retire from the Commons for so long as he thought Powell might have a chance of a peerage. According to Julian Critchley, Budgen purchased his suits from Oxfam and rarely bought anyone a drink. Budgen died of liver cancer at Stafford General Hospital on 26 October 1998. His funeral service was near his Lichfield farm at Lichfield Cathedral, where his grandfather had been Dean.No Cynic Where It Mattered, Jonathan Aitken, The Spectator, 31 October 1998 The eulogy was given by his close friend and fellow Maastricht rebel Richard Shepherd, at his memorial service at St Margaret's Church, Westminster another close friend Charles Moore gave a eulogy. Quotations On the Downing Street Declaration which stated that Britain has \\"no selfish, strategic or economic interest\\" in maintaining the Union with Northern Ireland, Budgen asked John Major the question - \\"Can I reassure my constituents that the United Kingdom has an interest in maintaining Wolverhampton in the Union?\\" On the 1988 Budget - \\"It is the most irresponsible budget I have ever heard, it will be downhill from now on. In one fell swoop Mr Lawson has squandered five years of responsible economic management.\\" On supporting Douglas Hurd in the 1990 Conservative leadership contest: \\"it is the Conservative worker's fate to be betrayed by his leader, so we may at least be betrayed elegantly.\\" \\"New Labour will not nationalise industry, it will instead nationalise people.\\" \\"If the Conservatives say beggars should be kicked once, then New Labour will say that beggars should be kicked twice.\\" \\"It would be my general feeling that the transference of power to Europe was so important a matter as to require a vote against any organisation and any party that wished to transfer that power.\\" On John Major: \\"he would make a reasonably competent head of a Wolverhampton Social Security office.\\"Politicians are not self-interested shysters, Daily Telegraph, 28 August 2003 \\"If it [Labour] comes to power, those solid citizens will put pressure on the fresh-faced public school boy (Tony Blair) and we shall be back to the old story of an enormous public sector borrowing requirement, higher taxes and higher interest rates, and there will be no difference whatsoever in substance between the fresh-faced public school boy and all the old chaps who are in favour of old Labour.\\"The Economy, HC Deb 12 July 1995, vol 263 cc971-1062 Former Labour MP Ken Livingstone once \\"said admiringly\\" to Nick Budgen in 1996: \\"you've made Major change his policy on Europe, again and again.\\".What reasons are there for supposing a Blair Government will not be as stricken by party Dissenters as Major's has been?

It crosses the counties of Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent. It has three separate parts: the sandstone \\"High Weald\\" in the centre; the clay \\"Low Weald\\" periphery; and the Greensand Ridge, which stretches around the north and west of the Weald and includes its highest points. The Weald once was covered with forest, and its name, Old English in origin, signifies \\"woodland\\". The term is still used today, as scattered farms and villages sometimes refer to the Weald in their names. Etymology The name \\"Weald\\" is derived from the Old English ', meaning \\"forest\\" (cognate of German Wald, but unrelated to English \\"wood\\", which has a different origin). This comes from a Germanic root of the same meaning, and ultimately from Indo-European. Weald is specifically a West Saxon form; wold is the Anglian form of the word.Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, edited by C.T. Onions, Oxford, 1966. The Middle English form of the word is wƒìld, and the modern spelling is a reintroduction of the Old English form attributed to its use by William Lambarde in his A Perambulation of Kent of 1576.Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989 In early medieval Britain, the area had the name Andredes weald, meaning \\"the forest of Andred\\", the latter derived from Anderida, the Roman name of present-day Pevensey. The area is also referred to in early English texts as Andredesleage, where the second element, leage, is another Old English word for \\"woodland\\", represented by the modern '.Eilert Ekwall, The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names, Oxford, 1936, under \\"Weald\\" and \\"Andred\\" The adjective for \\"Weald\\" is \\"wealden\\". Geology Geology of south-eastern England showing the High Weald in yellow- green (9a) and the Low Weald in darker green (9); chalk downland is in pale green (6) Geological section from north to south: High and Low Weald shown as one The Weald is the eroded remains of a geological structure, an anticline, a dome of layered Lower Cretaceous rocks cut through by weathering to expose the layers as sandstone ridges and clay valleys. The oldest rocks exposed at the centre of the anticline are correlated with the Purbeck Beds of the Upper Jurassic. Above these, the Cretaceous rocks, include the Wealden Group of alternating sands and claysthe Ashdown Sand Formation, Wadhurst Clay Formation, Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation (collectively known as the Hastings Beds) and the Weald Clay. The Wealden Group is overlain by the Lower Greensand and the Gault Formation, consisting of the Gault and the Upper Greensand.Gallois, R.. & Edmunds, M.A. (4th Ed 1965), The Wealden District, British Regional Geology series, British Geological Survey, The rocks of the central part of the anticline include hard sandstones, and these form hills now called the High Weald. The peripheral areas are mostly of softer sandstones and clays and form a gentler rolling landscape, the Low Weald. The Weald‚ÄìArtois Anticline continues some further south-eastwards under the Straits of Dover, and includes the Boulonnais of France. Many important fossils have been found in the sandstones and clays of the Weald, including, for example, Baryonyx. The famous scientific hoax of Piltdown Man was claimed to have come from a gravel pit at Piltdown near Uckfield. The first Iguanodon was identified after Mary Mantell unearthed some fossilised teeth by a road in Sussex in 1822. Her husband, the geologist Gideon Mantell, noticed they were similar to modern iguana teeth but many times larger; this important find led to the discovery of dinosaurs. The area contains significant reserves of shale oil, totalling 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the Wealden basin according to a 2014 study, which then Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said \\"will bring jobs and business opportunities\\" and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency. Fracking in the area is required to achieve these objectives, which has been opposed by environmental groups. History The Forest of Anderida during the Roman occupation of Britain Prehistoric evidence suggests that, following the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, the Neolithic inhabitants had turned to farming, with the resultant clearance of the forest. With the Iron Age came the first use of the Weald as an industrial area. Wealden sandstones contain ironstone, and with the additional presence of large amounts of timber for making charcoal for fuel, the area was the centre of the Wealden iron industry from then, through the Roman times, until the last forge was closed in 1813.Wealden History of Early Iron MakingHigh Weald Timeline The index to the Ordnance Survey Map of Roman Britain lists 33 iron mines; and 67% of these are in the Weald. The entire Weald was originally heavily forested. According to the 9th-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Weald measured or longer by in the Saxon era, stretching from Lympne, near Romney Marsh in Kent, to the Forest of Bere or even the New Forest in Hampshire.'The Kent and Sussex Weald, Peter Brandon, published by Phillimore and Company, 2003 The area was sparsely inhabited and inhospitable, being used mainly as a resource by people living on its fringes, much as in other places in Britain such as Dartmoor, the Fens and the Forest of Arden. The Weald was used for centuries, possibly since the Iron Age, for transhumance of animals along droveways in the summer months. Over the centuries, deforestation for the shipbuilding, charcoal, forest glass, and brickmaking industries has left the Low Weald with only remnants of that woodland cover. While most of the Weald was used for transhumance by communities at the edge of the Weald, several parts of the forest on the higher ridges in the interior seem to have been used for hunting by the kings of Sussex. The pattern of droveways which occurs across the rest of the Weald is absent from these areas. These areas include St Leonard's Forest, Worth Forest, Ashdown Forest and Dallington Forest. The forests of the Weald were often used as a place of refuge and sanctuary. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle relates events during the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Sussex when the native Britons (whom the Anglo-Saxons called Welsh) were driven from the coastal towns into the recesses of the forest for sanctuary,: Until the Late Middle Ages the forest was a notorious hiding place for bandits, highwaymen and outlaws.Heathfield.net Settlements on the Weald are widely scattered. Villages evolved from small settlements in the woods, typically apart; close enough to be an easy walk but not so close as to encourage unnecessary intrusion. Few of the settlements are mentioned in the Domesday Book; however Goudhurst's church dates from the early 12th century or before and Wadhurst was big enough by the mid-13th century to be granted a royal charter permitting a market to be held. Before then, the Weald was used as summer grazing land, particularly for pannage by inhabitants of the surrounding areas. Many places within the Weald have retained names from this time, linking them to the original communities by the addition of the suffix \\"-den\\": for example, Tenterden was the area used by the people of Thanet. Permanent settlements in much of the Weald developed much later than in other parts of lowland Britain, although there were as many as one hundred furnaces and forges operating by the later 16th century, employing large numbers of people. In 1216 during the First Barons' War, a guerilla force of archers from the Weald, led by William of Cassingham (nicknamed Willikin of the Weald), ambushed the French occupying army led by Prince Louis near Lewes and drove them to the coast at Winchelsea. The timely arrival of a French Fleet allowed the French forces to narrowly escape starvation. William was later granted a pension from the crown and made warden of the Weald in reward for his services. In the first edition of On The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin used an estimate for the erosion of the chalk, sandstone and clay strata of the Weald in his theory of natural selection. Charles Darwin was a follower of Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism and decided to expand upon Lyell's theory with a quantitative estimate to determine if there was enough time in the history of the Earth to uphold his principles of evolution. He assumed the rate of erosion was around one inch per century and calculated the age of the Weald at around 300 million years. Were that true, he reasoned, the Earth itself must be much older. In 1862, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) published a paper \\"On the age of the sun's heat\\", in which ‚Äì unaware of the process of solar fusion ‚Äì he calculated the Sun had been burning for less than a million years, and put the outside limit of the age of the Earth at 200 million years. Based on these estimates he denounced Darwin's geological estimates as imprecise. Darwin saw Lord Kelvin's calculation as one of the most serious criticisms to his theory and removed his calculations on the Weald from the third edition of On the Origin of Species.Joel Levy, Scientific Feuds, New Holland Publishers (2010) Modern chronostratigraphy shows that the Weald Clays were laid down around 130 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous. Geography Autumn, Weald of Kent (1904), by Benjamin Haughton The Weald begins north-east of Petersfield in Hampshire and extends across Surrey and Kent in the north, and Sussex in the south. The western parts in Hampshire and West Sussex, known as the Western Weald, are included in the South Downs National Park. Other protected parts of the Weald are included in the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In extent it covers about from west to east, and about from north to south, covering an area of some . The eastern end of the High Weald, the English Channel coast, is marked in the centre by the high sandstone cliffs from Hastings to Pett Level; and by former sea cliffs now fronted by the Pevensey and Romney Marshes on either side. Much of the High Weald, the central part, is designated as the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Its landscape is described as one of Ashdown Forest, an extensive area of heathland and woodland occupying the highest sandy ridge-top at the centre of the High Weald, is a former royal deer-hunting forest created by the Normans and said to be the largest remaining part of Andredesweald.Brandon (2003), p.23. There are centres of settlement, the largest of which are Horsham, Burgess Hill, East Grinstead, Haywards Heath, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells, Crowborough; and the area along the coast from Hastings and Bexhill-on-Sea to Rye and Hythe. The geological map shows the High Weald in lime green (9a). The Low Weald,Natural England: Notes on the Low Weald the periphery of the Weald, is shown as darker green on the map (9),The additional green section on the map, outside the other two, is not part of The Weald: to the north it is the Vale of Holmesdale; to the south the Vale of Sussex and has an entirely different character. It is in effect the eroded outer edges of the High Weald, revealing a mixture of sandstone outcrops within the underlying clay. As a result, the landscape is of wide and low- lying clay vales with small woodlands (‚Äúshaws‚Äù) and fields. There is a great deal of surface water: ponds and many meandering streams. Some areas, such as the flat plain around Crawley, have been utilised for urban use: here are Gatwick Airport and its related developments and the Horley-Crawley commuter settlements. Otherwise the Low Weald retains its historic settlement pattern, where the villages and small towns occupy harder outcrops of rocks. There are no large towns on the Low Weald, although Ashford, Sevenoaks and Reigate lie immediately on the northern edge. Settlements tend to be small and linear, because of its original wooded nature and heavy clay soils.Notes on the Low Weald The Weald is drained by the many streams radiating from it, the majority being tributaries of the surrounding major rivers: particularly the Mole, Medway, Stour, Rother, Cuckmere, Ouse, Adur and Arun. Many of these streams provided the power for the watermills, blast furnaces and hammers of the iron industry and the cloth mills. Transport infrastructure The M25, M26 and M20 motorways all use the Vale of Holmesdale to the north, and therefore run along or near the northern edge of the Weald. The M23/A23 road to Brighton, uses the western, narrower, part of the Weald where there are stream headwaters, crossing it from north to south. Other roads take similar routes, although they often have long hills and many bends: the more sedate, but busy A21 trunk road to Hastings is still beset with traffic delays, despite having had some new sections. Five railways once crossed the Weald, now reduced to three. Building them provided the engineers with difficulties in crossing the terrain, with the hard sandstone adding to their problems. The Brighton Main Line followed the same route as its road predecessors: although it necessitated the long tunnel near Balcombe and the Ouse Valley Viaduct. Tributaries of the River Ouse provided some assistance in the building of now- closed East Grinstead-Lewes and the Uckfield-Lewes lines. The principal main- line railway to Hastings had to negotiate difficult terrain when it was first built, necessitating many sharp curves and tunnels; and similar problems had to be faced with the Ashford-Hastings line. Several long-distance footpaths criss-cross the Weald, and it is well-mapped recreationally, covered by routes from: *The Ramblers' Associations and most District Councils for walkers *Sustrans and local county councils for cyclists Farming Neither the thin infertile sands of the High Weald or the wet sticky clays of the Low Weald are suited to intensive arable farming and the topography of the area often increases the difficulties. There are limited areas of fertile greens and which can be used for intensive vegetable growing, as in the valley of the Western Rother. Historically the area of cereals grown has varied greatly with changes in prices, increasing during the Napoleonic Wars and during and since World War II. The Weald has its own breed of cattle, called the Sussex, although it has been as numerous in Kent and parts of Surrey. Bred from the strong hardy oxen, which continued to be used to plough the clay soils of the Low Weald longer than in most places, these red beef cattle were highly praised by Arthur Young in his book Agriculture of Sussex when visiting Sussex in the 1790s. William Cobbett commented on finding some of the finest cattle on some of the region's poorest subsistence farms on the High Weald. Pigs, which were kept by most households in the past, were able to be fattened in autumn on acorns in the extensive oak woods. In his novel Memoirs of a Fox- hunting Man, the poet and novelist Siegfried Sassoon refers to \\"the agricultural serenity of the Weald widespread in the delicate hazy sunshine\\". Wildlife The Weald has largely maintained its wooded character, with woodland still covering 23% of the overall area (one of the highest levels in England) and the proportion is considerably higher in some central parts. The sandstones of the Wealden rocks are usually acidic, often leading to the development of acidic habitats such as heathland, the largest remaining areas of which are in Ashdown Forest and near Thursley. Although common in France, the wild boar became extinct in Great Britain by the 17th century, but wild breeding populations have recently returned in the Weald, following escapes from boar farms. Culture The Weald has been associated with many writers, particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These include Vita Sackville-West (1892‚Äì1962), Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) and Rudyard Kipling (1865‚Äì1936). The setting for A.A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories was inspired by Ashdown Forest, near Milne's country home at Hartfield. John Evelyn (1620‚Äì1706), particularly noted for his house, gardens and books which inspired others in the wider area, Wotton House, Surrey in the Vale of Holmesdale by Dorking just north of the Weald proper was a diarist, essayist and early author of botany, gardening and geography. The second half of E. M. Forster's A Room with a View takes place at the protagonist's family home, \\"Windy Corner\\", in the Weald. In the early 21st century, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council promoted \\"Seven Wonders of the Weald\\": *Bayham Old Abbey *Bedgebury Pinetum *Bewl Water *Finchcocks *Lamberhurst Vineyard *Marle Place *Scotney Castle Sport The game of cricket may have originated prior to the 13th century in the Weald (see History of English cricket to 1696). The related game stoolball is still popular in the Weald, mostly played by ladies' teams. Other English wealds and wolds Several other areas in southern England have the name \\"Weald\\", including North Weald in Essex, and Harrow Weald in north-west London. \\"Wold\\" is used as the name for various open rolling upland areas in the North of England, including the Yorkshire Wolds and the Lincolnshire Wolds, although these are, by contrast, chalk uplands. The Cotswolds are a major geographical feature of central England, forming a south-west to north-east line across the country.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1835 to 1898, making him the longest-serving Member of Parliament (MP). He also holds the distinction of the oldest candidate to win a parliamentary seat, at 93. He was a radical and reformer who often collaborated with John Bright and had a noteworthy effect in the leadership of the Anti-Corn Law League, until its repeal in 1846. Lord Palmerston appointed him to the cabinet as president of the Poor-Law Board in 1859. His Public Works (Manufacturing Districts) Act of 1863 opened job-creating schemes in public health projects. He progressed numerous other reforms, most notably the Metropolitan Poor Law Act of 1867. Florence Nightingale helped him formulate the reform, in particular, ensure professionalisation of nursing as part of the poor law regime, the workhouses of which erected public infirmaries under an Act of the same year. His political importance was overshadowed by his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, and undercut by the hostility of Gladstone.A. C. Howe, \\"Villiers, Charles Pelham (1802‚Äì1898)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2004; online edn, Oct 2009 accessed 8 Nov 2017. Background and education Villiers was the son of the Hon. George Villiers and the Hon. Theresa, daughter of John Parker, 1st Baron Boringdon. He was the grandson of Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon and brother of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon. He was educated at East India Company College and St John's College, Cambridge, becoming a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in 1827. He was raised to the rank of an Earl's son in 1839 and thus entitled to be styled the Honourable Charles Pelham Villiers. Political career Villiers held Benthamite political views and enjoyed a long career in public service and Parliament. In 1832, he was a Poor Law Commissioner, and from 1833 to 1852 was an examiner of witnesses in the Court of Chancery. Villiers was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Wolverhampton in 1835. In each year from 1837 to 1845, he launched parliamentary debates in attempts to repeal the Corn Laws. In 1838, he spoke to over 5,000 \\"working-class men\\" in Manchester and told them that the presence of so large an audience gave him the proof that \\"the working class man was with him.\\" Villiers was unsuccessful in his attempts, but in 1840 sat on the Committee on Import Duties that provided much of the evidence that pressured Robert Peel into his sliding scale concession in 1842. The bluebook produced by the Committee on Import Duties was published in pamphlet form and distributed across the country by the Anti-Corn Law League, it was reprinted in America and quoted by all leading newspapers of the day, the Spectator published it in abridged form. In February 1842, Villiers was called by Monckton Milnes MP, the \\"solitary Robinson Crusoe standing on the barren rock of Corn Law repeal.\\" In 1842, the majority in favour of retaining the Corn Laws had been 303, at the vote on Villiers motion in June 1845 it was down to 132. After the repeal in 1846, the press said of Villiers that he was \\"the most persevering and undaunted supporter of those principles within the house.\\" David Ricardo, Chairman of the Free Traders in London, wished to raise money to give to Villiers in recognition of his work, Villiers declined this. Villiers was a corresponding member of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, and he attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840.BFASS Convention 1840, List of delegates, Retrieved 15 January 2016 In 1847 Villiers returned for Lancashire South but elected to sit for his former constituency; his election in Lancashire South was unsolicited but an honour conferred by the people there to express their gratitude for his good work with the repeal of the Corn Laws. Villiers was sworn of the Privy Council in 1853 and served under Lord Aberdeen and Lord Palmerston as Judge Advocate General from 1852 to 1858. In 1853 the Times observed that \\"it was Mr. Charles Villiers who practically originated the Free Trade movement.\\" He served under Palmerston and Lord Russell as President of the Poor Law Board (with a seat in the cabinet) from 1859 to 1866. In 1876 he wrote to the Manchester-based Women's Suffrage Journal in which he stated, in the words of the Journal, that \\"he had voted for the measure [suffrage] on more than one occasion, and should do so again. As far as he was acquainted with the objections usually alleged, he was bound to say they only appear to be those which have always been offered whenever any fresh extension of liberty to the subject has been proposed, and which he had himself heard urged against personal freedom in the colonies, religious liberty in this country, the enfranchisement of the working classes, and against the abolition of every monopoly, political and commercial, wherever it has been assailed.\\" Villiers was offered a peerage in June 1885, but declined.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 His Wolverhampton constituency was divided under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 and he was then elected for Wolverhampton South, switching to the Liberal Unionist party in 1886. He was the Father of the House of Commons from 1890 until his death in 1898. However, the last time he attended Parliament was in 1895. During his time in Parliament he worked towards free trade and opposed the Corn Laws and home rule for Ireland. He is noted as being the voice in parliament of the free trade movement before the election of Richard Cobden and John Bright. Personal life Villiers died unmarried in January 1898, aged 96. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. A statue of him stands in West Park in Wolverhampton.  References  Further reading * Swift, Roger.

Sayers. The novel is Walsh's first original Lord Peter Wimsey novel, following Thrones, Dominations, which Sayers left as an unfinished manuscript, and was completed by Walsh. A Presumption of Death is written by Walsh, except for excerpts from The Wimsey Papers. Plot Harriet (Lady Peter Wimsey) has evacuated her family to the Wimseys' country house, Talboys in Hertfordshire, taking her two children, along with the three children of her sister-in-law, Lady Mary, and Peter's venerable old housekeeper, Mrs Trapp. Peter and Bunter are away on an undercover assignment. During an ARP drill, a young woman is murdered in the village, and Superintendent Kirk (who last appeared in Busman's Honeymoon) recruits Harriet to help solve the murder, as the police are short-staffed due to the war and Harriet, as a crime novelist and the wife of a detective, is felt to be the best-qualified available person to find the murderer. The murdered girl, Wendy Percival, had come from the city as a Land Girl, to do agricultural work and help the war effort. She was killed in the village street while most people were in the village's two air raid shelters during the drill, and much of the investigation turns on who had been, or could have been, outside the shelters when the murder was committed. Patient investigation leads Harriet to eliminate several potential suspects, including two young men in the village with whom Wendy flirted and the RAF pilot who was last with her on the night she died. She also establishes that everyone in the shelters is accounted for, and that there was no way for anyone to leave either shelter unnoticed during the drill. Glumly, she reflects that her list of possible suspects has been reduced to a random \\"wandering maniac\\". Returning home from one of her investigations, Harriet encounters \\"Bungo\\", Peter's old school friend and now a high-ranking officer in British Intelligence, who has received a coded message from Peter which Peter had said only she could decipher. The message is based on a book code, and after thinking carefully she realises that the key to the code is the sonnet which she started and Peter completed in Gaudy Night. The decoded message says that Peter and Bunter have accomplished their mission, but their danger is now great and they must come home separately. They require assistance to get home, and the message says which routes they will be taking. By solving the cipher, Harriet has saved Peter's life, just as he once saved her life. The message also instructs Harriet, in the event of his death, to read the letter he left for her in his bureau. Handling the unopened letter, Harriet reflects ruefully on the years she spent avoiding Peter's proposals of marriage, when all she wants now is to be with him again. Then she realises that she married him when the time was right for her, and that to have \\"settled\\" on the wrong terms would have been disastrous for both of them. =Bunter returns= On a brief trip to London to meet the Wimsey family solicitor, Harriet is trapped in the basement of her old home by a sudden air raid, and is surprised to encounter a dishevelled Bunter, returned home from his and Peter's mission. He says he has no word from Peter. The following week, he appears at Talboys to resume service with the household, since he has been denied permission to re-enlist in the army because of his age. At the suggestion of Peter's sister Mary, Harriet summarises her progress in the murder investigation in letters to Peter, which she does not send. While writing one of these letters, Harriet realises that there is one person she has overlooked: an RAF pilot named Alan Brinklow, billeted in the village while recovering from a broken ankle. Not being a villager, he would not have been in either of the air raid shelters, but not being posted to any of the surrounding air bases, he would not have been expected there either. Although she has no reason to suspect Brinklow of having a motive to kill Wendy, Superintendent Kirk agrees to question him. =Peter returns= Peter returns, alive and well, to Harriet's immense relief and joy. A short time later, Kirk returns to Talboys to report that Brinklow's dead body has been found buried behind a farmer's shed. Peter is confused, saying he recognises the name Brinklow from his own mission and the man is already long dead. Bungo is summoned to Talboys, and is present as Peter explains that Alan Brinklow was shot down over the North Sea some weeks ago; his body was recovered by a British patrol boat, whose captain decided to plant some false papers on the body and send it drifting into enemy territory, hoping to mislead the enemy. The ploy worked, but the Germans decided to infiltrate an enemy agent into Britain, using Brinklow's name, as they thought the British were unaware that the real Brinklow was dead. The \\"Brinklow\\" who had been living in Paggleham for the past few weeks was actually a German spy. Bungo explains that \\"pseudo-Brinklow\\" is unlikely to have been killed by anyone from British Intelligence, as they would want any enemy agent captured alive. Kirk is at a loss for any other suspects, until Harriet suggests that the real Alan Brinklow might have had an enemy for some reason. In Brinklow's records, Peter and Harriet trace the name of a young woman, Joan Quarley, living in Northumberland. When they confront Joan's brother, an RAF pilot named Jeff, he admits that Alan was his squadmate, and that he and Joan fell in love, and she became pregnant with his child before his last mission. Officially they were told that Alan was missing and presumed dead, but then they heard rumours that an \\"Alan Brinklow\\" was living in Paggleham. Jeff went there to confront Alan, and forced pseudo-Brinklow to meet him in private, at night. Not seeing the man clearly, Jeff demanded to know what \\"Alan\\" was going to do about Joan. When the man responded, \\"Who is Joan?\\", Jeff went berserk and attacked him. Finding himself in a fight to the death, Jeff drew a knife and tried to cut Alan's hamstrings, but accidentally cut the man's throat instead. Seeing the man in the light, Jeff saw that it was not Alan after all, so he buried the body in a panic and fled Paggleham. After repeating this story for Bungo, Superintendent Kirk, and his commanding officer, Jeff is allowed to return to duty. Bungo tells Mrs Quarley that Jeff will not be charged with any crime, and the real Alan Brinklow acted honourably and died bravely. Mrs Quarley, who suspected Jeff's role in pseudo-Brinklow's murder, is vastly relieved, while Joan is triumphant, vindicated in her faith in the man she loved. =Return from Northumberland= On their way back to Hertfordshire, Peter and Harriet make a brief overnight stop at Duke's Denver, where Peter reflects that his nephew, Lord St. George, also an RAF pilot, is unlikely to survive the war, which would mean that Peter would become the heir to the dukedom. However, Peter is determined that he and Harriet will raise their sons as \\"normal\\" boys, not as aristocrats, since the privileges accorded to the nobility become harder to justify with each passing year, and will become even harder to justify when the war is over. Over dinner with Peter's mother, the Dowager Duchess, the news service announces Neville Chamberlain's resignation as Prime Minister and his replacement by Winston Churchill, who promises only \\"blood, toil, tears and sweat\\". Returning to Talboys, Harriet says she is unhappy to be coming home to a still-unsolved murder. Peter says that, on the contrary, Harriet did solve Wendy Percival's murder, having eliminated all the possible suspects except pseudo-Brinklow. As to his motive, Peter says they may never know for sure, but he can make an educated guess: Wendy, who traveled extensively in Europe before the war and was drawn to handsome men of any nationality, must have met pseudo-Brinklow in Germany, and recognised him instantly when they encountered each other, by chance, in the village during the drill. He had no choice but to silence her immediately. Harriet remarks that it is a strange inversion: pseudo-Brinklow killed Wendy because she recognised him for who he really was, yet he was killed himself because of who he was pretending to be. =The radio signals= The only mystery, Peter says, is exactly what pseudo-Brinklow's mission in Paggleham was. This mystery is solved by, of all people, Peter's ten-year-old nephew, Charlie Parker, and his friend from the village, Sam Bateson. Charlie got a crystal radio set from Lord St. George as a present, but was frustrated because it had an intermittent fault. Now he realises it was working perfectly, but intercepting signals from a transmitter in the village: the last of which occurred just before pseudo-Brinklow was killed. Charlie and Sam borrowed a book on Morse code and wrote down their intercepts, even though they cannot decipher them. Peter delivers the intercepts to Bungo, and a few days later a secret air base near Paggleham is closed and relocated. Peter is retired from active service and, while still involved in intelligence, assures Harriet that he will not be sent abroad again. He confesses to Harriet his worry that being married to her, and fathering their children, has sapped his bravery, and made him unfit to undertake another assignment. Harriet shrewdly points out that this is not true: she recalls Bunter's account of his separation from Peter during the mission, when one of them had to go home by the safer of two routes, and they decided to flip a coin for it. Bunter suspected, and Peter now admits to Harriet, that Peter deliberately faked the coin toss to send Bunter home by the safer route. Peter is reminded of why he loves Harriet: she sees him more clearly than he sees himself. Embracing her, he recalls a poem by Shelley that states that true love between two persons is not war, but it is the surest form of victory.

Polyphase systems have three or more energized electrical conductors carrying alternating currents with a defined phase angle between the voltage waves in each conductor; for three-phase voltage, the phase angle is 120¬∞ or ~2.09 radians. Polyphase systems are particularly useful for transmitting power to electric motors which rely on alternating current to rotate. The most common example is the three-phase power system used for industrial applications and for power transmission. Compared to a single-phase, two-wire system, a three-phase three-wire system transmits three times as much power for the same conductor size and voltage. Systems with more than three phases are often used for rectifier and power conversion systems, and have been studied for power transmission. Phases In the very early days of commercial electric power, some installations used two-phase four-wire systems for motors. The chief advantage of these was that the winding configuration was the same as for a single-phase capacitor-start motor and, by using a four-wire system, conceptually the phases were independent and easy to analyse with mathematical tools available at the time. Terrell Croft, American Electricians' Handbook, Sixth Edition, McGraw Hill, 1948, pp. 54‚Äì57 Two-phase systems can also be implemented using three wires (two \\"hot\\" plus a common neutral). However this introduces asymmetry; the voltage drop in the neutral makes the phases not exactly 90 degrees apart. Two-phase systems have been replaced with three-phase systems. A two-phase supply with 90 degrees between phases can be derived from a three-phase system using a Scott-connected transformer. A polyphase system must provide a defined direction of phase rotation, so that mirror image voltages do not count towards the phase order. A 3-wire system with two phase conductors 180 degrees apart is still only single phase. Such systems are sometimes described as split-phase. Motors Three-phase electric machine with rotating magnetic fields Polyphase power is particularly useful in AC motors, such as the induction motor, where it generates a rotating magnetic field. When a three- or-more-phase supply completes one full cycle, the magnetic field of a two- poles-per-phase motor has rotated through 360¬∞ in physical space; motors with more than two poles per phase require more power supply cycles to complete one physical revolution of the magnetic field and so these motors run slower. Induction motors using a rotating magnetic field were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla and developed in a three-phase form by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky in 1889.Ion Boldea, Syed Abu Nasar, The Induction Machine Handbook - CRC Press, 2002, page 2 Previously all commercial motors were DC, with expensive commutators, high-maintenance brushes and characteristics unsuitable for operation on an alternating current network. Polyphase motors are simple to construct, are self-starting and have little vibration compared with single-phase motors. Higher phase order Once polyphase power is available, it may be converted to any desired number of phases with a suitable arrangement of transformers. Thus, the need for more than three phases is unusual, but higher phase numbers than three have been used. Between 1992 and 1995, New York State Electric & Gas operated a 1.5 mile converted from a double-circuit 3-phase 115KV transmission line to a 93KV 6-phase transmission line. The primary result was that it is economically favorable to operate an existing double-circuit 115KV 3-phase line as a 6-phase line for distances greater than 23‚Äì28 miles. Multi-phase power generation designs with 5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 phases in conjunction with multi- phase induction generators (MPIGs) driven by wind turbines have been proposed. An induction generator produces electrical power when its rotor is turned faster than the synchronous speed. A multi-phase induction generator has more poles, and therefore a lower synchronous speed. Since the rotation speed of a wind turbine may be too slow for a substantial portion of its operation to generate single-phase or even three-phase AC power, higher phase orders allow the system to capture a larger portion of the rotational energy as electric power. High-phase-order (HPO) power transmission has been frequently proposed as a way to increase transmission capacity within a limited-width right of way. The required conductor spacing is determined by the phase-to-phase voltages, and six-phase power has the same voltage between adjacent phases as between phase and neutral. However voltages between non-adjacent phase conductors increases as the difference increases between phase angles of the conductors. Conductors can be arranged so that non-adjacent phases are spaced farther apart than adjacent phases. This lets an existing double-circuit transmission line carry more power with minimal change to the existing cable plant. This is particularly economical when the alternative is upgrading an existing extra high voltage (EHV, more than 345 kV phase-to-phase) transmission line to ultra-high voltage (UHV, more than 800 kV) standards. By contrast, three-phase power has phase-to-phase voltages equal to = 1.732 times the phase-to-neutral voltage.

This name was first proposed in the Nagoya Resolution whereby the ROC/Taiwan and the People's Republic of China (PRC) recognize the right of participation to each other when it comes to the activities of the International Olympic Committee and its correlates. The ROC participates under this name in various international organizations and events, including the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, the Metre Convention, and international pageants. The term is deliberately ambiguous. To the PRC, \\"Chinese Taipei\\" is ambiguous about the political status or sovereignty of the ROC/Taiwan; to the ROC, it is a more inclusive term than just \\"Taiwan\\" (which to the Kuomintang of the ROC in power at the time, and the PRC, is just one part of \\"China\\", and both claim to be the rightful government of China in its entirety, and to the PRC the use of \\"Taiwan\\" as a national name would imply a de jure independence of Taiwan apart from the PRC) and \\"Taiwan, China\\" (might be construed as a subordinate area to the PRC). Origins Before the 1600s, the island of Taiwan had numerous independent Taiwanese Aborigines tribes, before being colonized by the Dutch and Spanish colonizers in the northern areas. Small portions of Taiwan were colonized by the Chinese and these few southern areas were governed by the Kingdom of Tungning before being annexed by the Qing dynasty in 1683. The central and mountainous areas were still under Indigenous control. Following the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, Taiwan was annexed by Japan. After the Surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, the island of Taiwan was placed under the administration of Nationalist Republic of China (ROC) in 1945 and became their newest province. Near the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949, before the post-war treaties were to be signed, the Kuomintang were driven out of the mainland by the Communists who would later establish the People's Republic of China (PRC) in October 1949. The then ruling-party Kuomintang, however, retreated to the occupied Taiwan, thus becoming government in exile and remained for a time as the internationally recognized government of all of China. Most democratic countries (including the United States) initially continued to support the Nationalist government while communist nations recognized the Communist government. As time went on, the increased official recognition of the PRC in international activities, such as when accorded recognition in 1971 by the United Nations, instead of that accorded previously to the ROC saw previously existing diplomatic relations transfer from Taipei to Beijing.Eyal Propper. \\"How China Views its National Security,\\" The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, May 2008. The ROC needed to come to a beneficial conclusion to how it would be referred when there was in the same forum participation by the PRC. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), had informally been using in international Olympic activities a number of names to differentiate the ROC from the PRC. \\"Taiwan\\" was used at the Tokyo Games. In 1979, the PRC agreed to participate in IOC activities if the Republic of China was referred to as \\"Chinese Taipei\\". The Nagoya Resolution sanctioned that the Beijing Olympic Committee would be called the \\"Chinese Olympic Committee\\" and another name would need to be found for the ROC Olympic Committee (ROCOC). The majority view of the ROC leadership at the time was that they did not want to change, \\"Taiwan\\" might imply without China or Chinese being in the name subordination to the PRC, did not represent all the regions/islands of the ROC and did not give the ROC an opportunity to assert, when wanted, a claim to territory outside of the ROC. What people refer to as Taiwan is one of several areas or islands (Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu in addition to Taiwan) and Taiwan alone did not reflect the \\"territorial extent\\" of the ROC. Furthermore, although it is true that most products from the area controlled by the ROC are labeled \\"made in Taiwan\\", the trade practices of the ROC are such that the regional area of production is used for labeling. Some wines from Kinmen are labeled \\"made in Kinmen\\", just as some perfume is labeled \\"made in Paris\\" and not \\"made in France\\". Taiwan's own government, the ROC government under the Kuomintang (KMT), rejected the designation of \\"Taiwan, China\\" on the grounds that this would imply subordination to the PRC. However, it also refused the names \\"Taiwan\\" and \\"Formosa ()\\" as a means of reasserting both its claim as the only legitimate government of all of China, and its uncompromising rejection of Taiwan independence. Instead, deriving from the name of its capital city, the ROC government finally formulated the name ‚ÄúChinese Taipei,‚Äù instead of accepting the offer of ‚ÄúTaiwan,‚Äù because ‚ÄúChinese Taipei‚Äù signified an uncertain boundary that could exceed the ROC‚Äôs actual territory of control of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, whenever the ROC government wished to assert it. It regarded the term Chinese Taipei as both acceptably neutral and hopeful of assent from other interested parties. Its proposal found agreement. Beijing accepted the compromise position that the ROC Olympic Committee could be named the \\"Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee\\". In April 1979, in a plenary session of the IOC, He Zhenliang, a representative of the PRC, stated: > According to the Olympic Charter, only one Chinese Olympic Committee should > be recognized. In consideration of the athletes in Taiwan having an > opportunity to compete in the Olympic Games, the sports constitution in > Taiwan could function as a local organization of China and still remain in > the Olympic Movement in the name of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee. > However, its anthem, flag and constitutions should be changed > correspondingly.Brian B. Pendleton, \\"The People's Republic of China and the > Olympic Movement: A Question of Recognition,\\" Unpublished Doctoral > dissertation, The University of Alberta, 1978, p. 115. In November 1979, in Nagoya, Japan, the International Olympic Committee, and later all other international sports federations, adopted a resolution under which the National Olympic Committee of the ROC would be recognized as the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, and its athletes would compete under the name Chinese Taipei. The National Olympic Committee of the ROC boycotted the Summer and Winter Games in protest of not being allowed to use the Republic of China's official flag and national anthem. The name \\"Chinese Taipei\\" was formally accepted by the Government of the Republic of China in 1981.However, the name of the committee in Chinese continues to be \\"‰∏≠ËèØÂ•ßÊûóÂåπÂÖãÂßîÂì°ÊúÉ\\" (\\"Chinese Olympic Committee\\"): see Official Website. A flag bearing the emblem of its Olympic Committee against a white background as the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag was confirmed in January 1981. The agreement was signed March 23 in Lausanne by Shen Chia-ming, the President of Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, and Juan Antonio Samaranch, the President of the IOC. In 1983, the National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China was chosen as the anthem of the Chinese Taipei delegation. Taiwan has competed under this flag and name exclusively at each Games since the 1984 Winter Olympics, as well as at the Paralympics and at other international events (with the Olympic rings replaced by a symbol appropriate to the event). Translation compromise Both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) agree to use the English name \\"Chinese Taipei\\". This is possible because of the ambiguity of the English word \\"Chinese\\", which may mean either the state or the culture. In French, multiple different names have been officially used. The World Trade Organization officially translates the name as \\"Taipei chinois\\", which has an ambiguous meaning. The text of the Nagoya Resolution uses the name \\"Taipei de Chine\\" suggesting the 'state' meaning of \\"Chinese\\". Chinese Taipei's page on the French-language IOC's website internally uses both \\"Taipei de Chine\\" and \\"Taipei chinois\\" for some image alt text, but on the title of the page itself, and when the name is announced during the Parade of Nations, the French announcer simply announces the English name \\"Chinese Taipei\\", after which the English announcer repeats the identical name.https://www.olympic.org/fr/chinese-taipei By contrast, no deliberately ambiguous name is available in Chinese. The PRC translates \\"Chinese Taipei\\" as Zh≈çnggu√≥ T√°ibƒõi () or literally \\"Taipei, China\\", in the same manner as Zh≈çnggu√≥ XiƒÅngg«éng () (\\"Hong Kong, China\\"), explicitly connoting that Taipei is a part of the Chinese state. Meanwhile, the ROC translates the name as Zh≈çnghu√° T√°ibƒõi (), explicitly asserting the term \\"Chinese\\" as referencing the cultural entity rather than the state. The disagreement was left unresolved, with both governments using their own translation domestically, until just before the 1990 Asian Games where Taiwan would officially participate under the Chinese Taipei name in a Chinese-language region for the first time, forcing the need for an agreement. In 1989, the two Olympic committees signed a pact in Hong Kong where the PRC agreed to use the ROC's translation in international forums only. Domestically, the PRC continues to use its own \\"Taipei, China\\" translation. In East Asian languages that would normally transcribe directly from Chinese, an English transliteration is used instead to sidestep the issue. Thus Japan uses Chainƒ´zu Taipei () while South Korea uses Chainiseu Taibei (Ï∞®Ïù¥ÎãàÏä§ ÌÉÄÏù¥Î≤†Ïù¥) for their respective-language announcements during the Olympic Games. Use of the name The name \\"Chinese Taipei\\" has spilled into apolitical arenas. The PRC has successfully pressured some religious organizations and civic organizations to refer to the ROC as \\"Chinese Taipei\\". The Lions Club used to refer to Taiwan as \\"Chinese Taipei\\", but it now uses the name \\"Taiwan MD 300\\". Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank refer to Taiwan as \\"Chinese Taipei\\", and \\"Taiwan\\" does not appear on the member countries list of either organization. The ICSU also refers to Taiwan as \\"China: Taipei\\", right below \\"China CAST\\". Taiwan is a member economy of APEC, and its official name in the organization is \\"Chinese Taipei\\". It has also participated as an invited in the World Health Organization (WHO) under the name Chinese Taipei. It is the only agency of the United Nations that the ROC is able, provided it is invited each year, to participate in since 1971. In the Miss World 1998, the government of the People's Republic of China pressured the Miss World Organization to rename Miss Republic of China 1998 to \\"Miss Chinese Taipei\\"; it has been competing ever since under that designation. The same happened in 2000, but with the Miss Universe Organization. Three years later at the Miss Universe pageant in Panama, the first official Miss China and Miss Taiwan competed alongside each other for the first time in history, prompting the PRC government to again demand that Miss Taiwan assume the title \\"Miss Chinese Taipei\\". The contestant in question, Chen Szu-yu, was famously photographed holding her two sashes. Today, neither Miss Universe nor Miss World, the two largest pageant contests in the world, allow Taiwan's entrants to compete under the Taiwan label. In 2005, the third-largest pageant contest, Miss Earth, initially allowed beauty contestant Li Fan Lin to compete as \\"Miss Taiwan\\"; a week into the pageant, however, her sash was updated to \\"Taiwan ROC\\". In 2008, Miss Earth changed the country's label to \\"Chinese Taipei\\". The title \\"Chinese Taipei\\" leads some people to believe that \\"Taipei\\" is a country. During the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, while Chinese and Taiwanese news channels referred to the team as Chinese Taipei, most foreign outlets simply called the team Taiwan. For sporting events, the ROC team is abbreviated in Taiwan as the Zhonghua Team (), where Zhonghua is a more cultural rather than political variation of the term China. This, in effect, labels it the \\"Chinese Team\\", in the sense of a \\"team that is of Chinese ethnicity\\" as opposed to a \\"team from China\\". Chinese Taipei Deaflympics flag Starting around the time of the 2004 Summer Olympics, there has been a movement in Taiwan to change all media references to the team to the \\"Taiwanese Team\\", and the mainstream Taiwan Television (TTV) is one of the first Taiwanese media outlets to do so. Such usage remains relatively rare, however, and other cable TV channels currently refer to the ROC as the Zhonghua Team and the PRC as the Zhongguo Team, the China team or the mainland China team. In the 2005 International Children's Games in Coventry, United Kingdom, as well as the National Geographic World Championship, the name Chinese Taipei was used too. Chinese Taipei was also the term used by Major League Baseball for the Taiwanese teams that participated in the World Baseball Classic competitions in 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2017, competing under the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag. The Little League World Series also refers to the Taiwanese teams as Chinese Taipei (although the uniforms stated Asia- Pacific). Tennis players play for teams using the Chinese Taipei name and Olympic flag in national competitions such as the Davis Cup, Fed Cup and Hopman Cup. 2008 APEC Summit in Peru Criticism of the term Use of the label came under vigorous renewed criticism during the run-up to the 2017 Summer Universiade, hosted in Taiwan. Changing demographics and opinions in the country mean that more than 80% of citizens now see themselves as Taiwanese, not Chinese whereas in 1991 this figure was only 13.6%. This radical upswell in Taiwanese national identity has seen a re-appraisal and removal of \\"sinocentric\\" labels and figures established by the government during the period of Martial Law. Moved by a desire to use the country's own national flag and anthem this has included ridiculing the term \\"Chinese Taipei\\" not only in the national and international press but by Taiwanese legislators; New Power Party (NPP) Executive Chairman Huang Kuo-chang in particular lambasted the English-language guide to the Universiade for its \\"absurd\\" use of the label, illustrating this with statements extracted from the guide rendered nonsensical by their author's insistence on completely avoiding the name \\"Taiwan\\" not only when referring to the label under which Taiwanese athletes compete, but even when referring to geographical features such as the island of Taiwan itself. These statements included \\"Introduction of our Island: [...] Chinese Taipei is long and narrow that lies north to south [sic],\\" and \\"Chinese Taipei is a special island and its Capital Taipei is a great place to experience Taipei's culture.\\" Huang added sarcastically, \\"Welcome to Taipei, Chinese Taipei!\\" In response, the guide was withdrawn and shortly thereafter re-issued with the designation \\"Taiwan\\" reinstated. The Department of Information and Tourism's division chief explained that Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-Je originally wrote \\"Taiwan\\" throughout his introduction of the guide, but that it was changed to \\"Chinese Taipei\\" by the International University Sports Federation (FISU) during their review of the document. Due to the public outcry over the controversy, the re-issued \\"Taiwan\\" guide was sent for printing without waiting for the response of the FISU. Taiwan's Social Democratic Party (SDP) member Miao Po-Ya separately criticized the FISU's indiscriminate substitution of \\"Taiwan\\" with \\"Chinese Taipei\\", pointing out that the \\"Olympic model\\" does not prohibit the use of \\"Taiwan\\" and citing the example of the 2009 Kaohsiung World Games, in whose material Taiwan was referred to extensively by name, and as a country, without issue. Miao also claimed that the FISU had also asked organizers to change \\"Taiwan\\" to \\"Chinese Taipei Island\\" and \\"New Taiwan Dollar\\" to \\"Chinese Taipei Dollar\\", suggesting that FISU Vice President Liguo Yang (who is also Secretary-General of the Federation of University Sports of China, which is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party) and Xue Yangquing (member of the Federation's media and communication committee) might have exerted China's political influence over the ostensibly non-partisan FISU to downplay Taiwan's national status. Despite these corrections, hundreds of Taiwanese demonstrated in Taipei, demanding that Taiwan cease using \\"Chinese Taipei\\" at sporting events. In a bid to raise international awareness demonstrators unfurled huge banners reading, in English, ‚ÄúTaiwan is not Chinese Taipei‚Äù and ‚ÄúLet Taiwan be Taiwan‚Äù. In an apparent error, the re-issued guide still contained a passage reading, \\"Bravo the Bear, the Universiade mascot, is based on the Formosan black bear, a species endemic to Chinese Taipei.\\" Reporting on the controversy at the opening of the Universiade, the New York Times shared Taiwanese indignation over the designation, writing \\"Imagine if the United States were to hold a major international event, but one of the conditions was for it to call itself 'British Washington.'\\" =2018 referendum= However, the Taiwanese people voted during a referendum in November 2018 to reject a proposal to change their official Olympic-designated name from Chinese Taipei to Taiwan. The main argument for opposing the name change was worrying that Taiwan may lose its Olympic membership under Chinese pressure, which would result in athletes unable to compete in the Olympics.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/top-taiwan-athletes-speak- out-against-changing-island-s-name-10955272Error  Focus Taiwan - CNA English News Other alternative references to Taiwan References used in the international context to refer to Taiwan differ according to the type of the organization. =Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu= The World Trade Organization officially uses \\"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu\\" for Taiwan, but frequently also uses the shorter name \\"Chinese Taipei\\" in official documents. As with \\"Chinese Taipei\\", the ROC and PRC also disagree on the Chinese translation of this name. The ROC uses T√°i Pƒìng Jƒ´n M«é G√®bi√© GuƒÅnshu√¨ L«êngy√π () or approximately \\"TPKM Separate Customs Territory\\", while the PRC uses Zh≈çnggu√≥ T√°ibƒõi DƒÅnd√∫ GuƒÅnshu√¨ Q≈´ () or approximately \\"Separate Customs Territory of Taipei, China\\". =Taiwan, Province of China= International organizations in which the PRC participates generally do not recognize Taiwan or allow its membership. Thus, for example, whenever the United Nations makes reference to Taiwan, which does not appear on its member countries list, it uses the designation \\"Taiwan, Province of China\\", and organizations that follow UN standards usually do the same, such as the International Organization for Standardization in its listing of ISO 3166-1 country codes. Certain web-based postal address programs also label the country designation name for Taiwan as \\"Taiwan, Province of China\\". =Island of Taiwan/Formosa= The term island of Taiwan or Formosa is used sometimes to avoid any misunderstanding about the Taiwan independence movement just referring to the island. =China or Republic of China= President Chen Shui-bian (far left) who attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II was seated in the first row in French alphabetical order beside the then-first lady and president of Brazil. Some non-governmental organizations which the PRC does not participate in continue to use \\"China\\" or the \\"Republic of China\\". The World Organization of the Scout Movement is one of few international organizations that continue to use the name of \\"Republic of China\\", and the ROC affiliate as the Scouts of China. This is because such Scouting in Mainland China is very limited or not really active.Although such organizations are established in the mainland, there is no or less governmental or CPC support to them. Likewise, Freemasonry is outlawed in the PRC and thus the Grand Lodge of China is based in Taiwan. Countries that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan, especially the ROC's older diplomatic affiliates, also refer to the ROC as \\"China\\" on occasion; for example, during the funeral of Pope John Paul II, the President of the Republic of China, Chen Shui-bian, was seated as part of the French alphabetical seating arrangement as the head of state of \\"\\" between the first lady of Brazil, and the president of Cameroon. =Other non-specified areas= The United Nations publishes population projections for each nation, with nations grouped under geographic area; in 2015, the East Asia group contained an entry named \\"Other non-specified areas\\" referring to Taiwan.

Publication While the publishing history of the work is not absolutely clear, Histriomastix was published late in 1632 by the bookseller Michael Sparke. It had been in preparation by its author for almost ten years before its printing. The title page of the first edition is erroneously dated 1633; as a result many sources cite this as the date of publication.W. W. Greg, A Companion to Arber, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1967; p. 85. See also The Cambridge History of Theatre, Vol. 1, edited by Jane Milling and Peter Thomson, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 379. Depositions given in connection with Prynne's trial indicate that the actual writing of the text was accomplished between spring 1631 and mid-to- late 1632. Themes Histriomastix represents the culmination of the Puritan attack on the English Renaissance theatre and celebrations such as Christmas, as noted in the following: \\"Our Christmas lords of misrule, together with dancing, masks, mummeries, state players, and such other Christmas disorders, now in use with Christians, were derived from these Roman Saturnalia and Bacchanalian festivals, which should cause all pious Christians eternally to abominate them.\\" Running to over a thousand pages, and with a main title of 43 lines, Histriomastix marshals a multitude of ancient and medieval authorities against the \\"sin\\" of dramatic performance. The book condemns most aspects of dramatic performance in its era, from the practice of boy actors representing women to the \\"obscene lascivious love songs, most melodiously chanted out upon the stage....\\" Theological and political context Prynne's book was not by any means the first such attack on the stage,Laura Levine, Men in Women's Clothing: Anti-theatricality and Effeminization, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1994. though it certainly was the longest. Its Puritan theology was in any case unwelcome to the civil authorities, led by Attorney General William Noy. Trial and sentence Prynne was imprisoned in 1633 but not tried until 1634, at which time he had to appear before the Star Chamber on a charge of seditious libel. Prosecuted by the barrister William Hudson on behalf of Noy, he was defended by Edward Atkyns and John Herne. Sentence on Prynne was pronounced by Lord Cottington, and the other judges (Sir John Coke, Robert Heath, the Earl of Pembroke, and Sir Thomas Richardson) concurred. At Prynne's trial, some fifty separate and allegedly seditious excerpts from the book were quoted; but the one that has attracted most attention from subsequent critics is Prynne's attack on women actors as \\"notorious whores.\\" Though Prynne's text made clear he was referring to French actresses who had recently performed at Blackfriars, the remark was, at the time, taken as a direct reference to Queen Henrietta Maria. The Queen had had a speaking role in Walter Montagu's masque The Shepherd's Paradise, which was staged on January 9, 1633, most likely after Prynne's book was in print, but she had also appeared and danced in two earlier masquesChloridia (1631) and Tempe Restored (1632). and performed a spoken part in French in a private performance of Honorat de Racan's pastoral, Artenice, in 1626.Michael Leapman, Inigo: The Troubled Life of Inigo Jones, Architect of the English Renaissance, London, Headline Book Publishing, 2003; pp. 222-3, 298-300. In the end, Prynne was sentenced to be pilloried twice, fined ¬£5,000, and imprisoned for life. In addition, his book was to be burned by the common hangman, and he was expelled from his university, prohibited from practicing law, and mutilated by the severance of his ears. During his imprisonment, Prynne continued to produce anonymous pamphlets attacking leaders of the Anglican Church, which induced the authorities, in 1637, to inflict further mutilation: first, the surviving stumps of his severed ears were cut off, and, second, his cheeks were branded with the letters ‚ÄúS.L.‚Äù The letters represented the words ‚ÄúSeditious Libeler,‚Äù but since his biting words sometimes attacked Archbishop Laud, Prynne preferred to render them as ‚ÄúStigmata Laudis,‚Äù or, ‚Äúthe marks of Laud.‚Äù Purported retraction Not long before the execution of Charles I, which occurred on 30 January 1649, a tract began to circulate, datelined \\"London, printed in the year 1649,\\" and bearing the title Mr. William Prynn His Defence of Stage Plays in a Retractation of a former Book of his called Histrio- Mastix. Written in Prynne‚Äôs style and under his name, the text purported to be a retraction of the sentiments expressed in Histriomastix. Prynne responded with a ‚Äúposting-bill,‚Äù or flyer, of his own under the title ‚ÄúVindication,‚Äù which bore the date January 10, 1648, oddly a full year before the publication of the alleged retraction. In 1825, the antiquarian E. W. Brayley undertook to expose the ‚Äúretraction‚Äù as a hoax in a slim volume entitled An Enquiry into the Genuineness of Prynne‚Äôs ‚ÄúDefense of Stage Plays,‚Äù and his argument addresses, in part, the anomaly of the dates by explaining the slow acceptance of the calendar reforms of 1582. Aftermath Prynne was released from prison during the Long Parliament. The notorious book was never fully suppressed; however, in the next generation, even King Charles II had a copy in his library.

The religious, magical, shamanic, or spiritual significance of entheogens is well established in anthropological and modern contexts; entheogens have traditionally been used to supplement many diverse practices geared towards achieving transcendence, including divination, meditation, yoga, sensory deprivation, asceticism, prayer, trance, rituals, chanting, hymns like peyote songs, drumming, and ecstatic dance. Etymology Brugmansia suaveolens, one of a group of species referred to as 'Angel's trumpets'. Brugmansia plants are rich in the chemical compound scopolamine, an example of an entheogen. Brugmansia has been cultivated by native tribes in South America for this reason. The neologism entheogen was coined in 1979 by a group of ethnobotanists and scholars of mythology (Carl A. P. Ruck, Jeremy Bigwood, Danny Staples, Richard Evans Schultes, Jonathan Ott and R. Gordon Wasson). The term is derived from two words of Ancient Greek, ·ºîŒΩŒ∏ŒµŒøœÇ (√©ntheos) and Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ≠œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ (gen√©sthai). The adjective entheos translates to English as \\"full of the god, inspired, possessed\\", and is the root of the English word \\"enthusiasm.\\" The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists. Genesthai means \\"to come into being.\\" Thus, an entheogen is a drug that causes one to become inspired or to experience feelings of inspiration, often in a religious or \\"spiritual\\" manner. Entheogen was coined as a replacement for the terms hallucinogen and psychedelic. Hallucinogen was popularized by Aldous Huxley's experiences with mescaline, which were published as The Doors of Perception in 1954. Psychedelic, in contrast, is a Greek neologism for \\"mind manifest\\", and was coined by psychiatrist Humphry Osmond; Huxley was a volunteer in experiments Osmond was conducting on mescaline. Ruck et al. argued that the term hallucinogen was inappropriate owing to its etymological relationship to words relating to delirium and insanity. The term psychedelic was also seen as problematic, owing to the similarity in sound to words pertaining to psychosis and also due to the fact that it had become irreversibly associated with various connotations of 1960s pop culture. In modern usage entheogen may be used synonymously with these terms, or it may be chosen to contrast with recreational use of the same drugs. The meanings of the term entheogen were formally defined by Ruck et al.: History Entheogens have been used by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Some countries have legislation that allows for traditional entheogen use. However, in the mid-20th century, after the discovery of LSD, and the intervention of psychedelic therapy, the term entheogen, invented in 1979, later became an umbrella term used to include artificial drugs, alternative medical treatment, and spiritual practices, whether or not in a formal religious or traditional structure. = Ancient times = San Pedro, an entheogenic cactus that has been used for over 3,000 years. Today the vast majority of extracted mescaline is from columnar cacti, not vulnerable peyote. R. Gordon Wasson and Giorgio Samorini have proposed several examples of the cultural use of entheogens that are found in the archaeological record. Hemp seeds discovered by archaeologists at Pazyryk suggest early ceremonial practices by the Scythians occurred during the 5th to 2nd century BCE, confirming previous historical reports by Herodotus. =1950s‚Äìpresent= Laboratory synthetic mescaline. Mescaline was the first (1887) psychedelic compound to be extracted and isolated from nature (from peyote). There now exist many synthetic drugs with similar psychoactive properties, many derived from plants. Many pure active compounds with psychoactive properties have been isolated from these respective organisms and chemically synthesized, including mescaline, psilocybin, DMT, salvinorin A, ibogaine, ergine, and muscimol. Semi-synthetic (e.g., LSD) and synthetic drugs (e.g., DPT and 2C-B used by the Sangoma) have also been developed. Alexander Shulgin developed hundreds of entheogens in PiHKAL and TiHKAL. Most of the drugs in PiHKAL are synthetic. Religious movements 2C-B is an entactogen commonly used at public places, like rave parties. Entheogens used by movements includes biota like peyote (Native American Church), extracts like ayahuasca (Santo Daime, Uni√£o do Vegetal), the semi-synthetic drug LSD (Neo-American Church), and synthetic drugs like DPT (Temple of the True Inner Light) and 2C-B (Sangoma). Both Santo Daime and Uni√£o do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world. Psychedelic therapy Psychedelic therapy refers to therapeutic practices involving the use of psychedelic drugs, particularly serotonergic psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline, and 2C-i, primarily to assist psychotherapy. MAPS has pursued a number of other research studies examining the effects of psychedelics administered to human subjects. These studies include, but are not limited to, studies of ayahuasca, DMT, ibogaine, ketamine, LSA, LSD, MDE, MDMA, mescaline, peyote, psilocybin, Salvia divinorum and conducted multi-drug studies as well as cross cultural and meta-analysis research. Usage =Use and abuse= Entheogens have been used by individuals to pursue spiritual goals such as divination, ego death, egolessness, faith healing, psychedelic therapy and spiritual formation. > \\"Don Alejandro (a Mazatecan shaman) taught me that the visionary experiences > are much more important than the plants and drugs that produce them. He no > longer needed to take the vision-inducing plants for his journeys.\\" There are also instances where people have been given entheogens without their knowledge or consent (e.g., tourists in ayahuasca), as well as attempts to use such drugs in other contexts, such as cursing, psychochemical weaponry, psychological torture, brainwashing and mind control; CIA experiments with LSD were used in Project MKUltra. = Religious use =  Peyotism  A Native American Peyote Drummer (c. 1927) The Native American Church (NAC) is also known as Peyotism and Peyote Religion. Peyotism is a Native American religion characterized by mixed traditional as well as Protestant beliefs and by sacramental use of the entheogen peyote. The Peyote Way Church of God believe that \\"Peyote is a holy sacrament, when taken according to our sacramental procedure and combined with a holistic lifestyle\\".  Black shamanism  Black shamanism is a kind of shamanism practiced in Mongolia and Siberia. It is specifically opposed to yellow shamanism, which incorporates rituals and traditions from Buddhism. Black Shamans are usually perceived as working with evil spirits, while white Shamans with spirits of the upper world.Kevin B. Turner Sky Shamans of Mongolia: Meetings with Remarkable Healers North Atlantic Books, 12.04.2016 In some areas, there are purported malevolent sorcerers who masquerade as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink ayahuasca in their presence. Shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile.  Judaism and Christianity  Many Christian denominations disapprove of the use of most illicit drugs. The early history of the Church, however, was filled with a variety of drug use, recreational and otherwise.The Chemical Muse: Drug Use and the Roots of Western Civilization by D. C.A. Hillman PhD The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis in early Judaism was Polish anthropologist Sara Benetowa (also known as Sula Benet), who claimed in 1967 that the plant kneh bossem ◊ß÷∞◊†÷µ◊î-◊ë÷π◊©÷∂◊Ç◊ù - mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the holy anointing oil of the Book of Exodus - was in fact cannabis.Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health & Fitness, 1995, pg. 89 The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church confirmed it as a possible valid interpretation. The lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by Michael Zohary (1985), Hans Arne Jensen (2004) and James A. Duke (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either Acorus calamus or Cymbopogon citratus.Lytton J. Musselman Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran 2007 pg. 73 Kneh-bossem is listed as an incense in the Old Testament. Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi (founder of Jewish Renewal) and Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) were influential early Jewish explorers of the connections between hallucinogenics and spirituality, from the early 1960s onwards. It is generally held by academics specializing in the archaeology and paleobotany of Ancient Israel, and those specializing in the lexicography of the Hebrew Bible that cannabis is not documented or mentioned in early Judaism. Against this some popular writers have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible,Dan Merkur The Mystery of Manna: The Psychedelic Sacrament of the Bible (2001)James D. Dure, Manna Magic Mushroom of Moses : Manna Botanical I.D. of a Biblical Sacrament (self published, 2000) although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., John Allegro in relation to Qumran, 1970) have been \\"widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue\\". According to The Living Torah, cannabis may have been one of the ingredients of the holy anointing oil mentioned in various sacred Hebrew texts.Kaplan, Aryeh. (1981). The Living Torah New York. p. 442. The herb of interest is most commonly known as kaneh- bosm (Hebrew: ◊ß÷∞◊†÷µ◊î-◊ë÷π◊©÷∂◊Ç◊ù). This is mentioned several times in the Old Testament as a bartering material, incense, and an ingredient in holy anointing oil used by the high priest of the temple. Although Chris Bennett's research in this area focuses on cannabis, he mentions evidence suggesting use of additional visionary plants such as henbane, as well.Sex, Drugs, Violence and the Bible, by Chris Bennett and Neil McQueen, 2001, Forbidden Fruit Publishing. The Septuagint translates kaneh-bosm as calamus, and this translation has been propagated unchanged to most later translations of the old testament. However, Polish anthropologist Sula Benet published etymological arguments that the Aramaic word for hemp can be read as kannabos and appears to be a cognate to the modern word 'cannabis', with the root kan meaning reed or hemp and bosm meaning fragrant. Both cannabis and calamus are fragrant, reedlike plants containing psychotropic compounds. In his research, Professor Dan Merkur points to significant evidence of an awareness within the Jewish mystical tradition recognizing manna as an entheogen, thereby substantiating with rabbinic texts theories advanced by the superficial biblical interpretations of Terence McKenna, R. Gordon Wasson and other ethnomycologists. The historical picture portrayed by the Entheos journal is of fairly widespread use of visionary plants in early Christianity and the surrounding culture, with a gradual reduction of use of entheogens in Christianity.Conjuring Eden: Art and the Entheogenic Vision of Paradise , by Mark Hoffman, Carl Ruck, and Blaise Staples. Entheos: The Journal of Psychedelic Spirituality, Issue No. 1, Summer, 2001 R. Gordon Wasson's book Soma prints a letter from art historian Erwin Panofsky asserting that art scholars are aware of many \\"mushroom trees\\" in Christian art.Wasson and Allegro on the Tree of Knowledge as Amanita , Michael S. Hoffman, Journal of Higher Criticism, 2007 The question of the extent of visionary plant use throughout the history of Christian practice has barely been considered yet by academic or independent scholars. The question of whether visionary plants were used in pre-Theodosius Christianity is distinct from evidence that indicates the extent to which visionary plants were utilized or forgotten in later Christianity, including heretical or quasi- Christian groups,Daturas for the Virgin, Jos√© Celdr√°n and Carl Ruck, Entheos: The Journal of Psychedelic Spirituality, Vol. I, Issue 2, Winter, 2002 and the question of other groups such as elites or laity within orthodox Catholic practice.The Hidden World: Survival of Pagan Shamanic Themes in European Fairytales, by Carl Ruck, Blaise Staples, Jose Alfredo Celdran, Mark Hoffman, Carolina Academic Press, 2007  Buddhism  Mandala of the Buddhist Deity Chakrasamvara According to R.C. Parker, \\"The use of entheogens in the Vajrayana tradition has been documented by such scholars as Ronald M Davidson, William George Stablein, Bulcs√∫ Sikl√≥s, David B. Gray, Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, Shashibhusan Das Gupta, Francesca Fremantle, Shinichi Tsuda, David Gordon White, Rene de Nebesky- Wojkowitz, James Francis Hartzell, Edward Todd Fenner, Ian Baker, Dr. Pasang Yonten Arya and numerous others.\\" These scholars have established entheogens were used in Vajrayana (in a limited context) as well as in Tantric Saivite traditions. The major entheogens in the Vajrayana Anuttarayoga Tantra tradition are cannabis and Datura metel which were used in various pills, ointments, and elixirs. Several tantras within Vajrayana specifically mention these entheogens and their use, including the Laghusamvara-tantra (aka Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra), Samputa-tantra, Samvarodaya-tantra, Mahakala-tantra, Guhyasamaja-tantra, Vajramahabhairava-tantra, and the Krsnayamari- tantra.Parker, R.C. The Use of Entheogens in the Vajrayana Tradition: a brief summary of preliminary findings together with a partial bibliography. 2007 (updated 2008), http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/rich_text_5.html In the Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra, the use of entheogens is coupled with meditation practices such as the use of a mandala of the Heruka meditation deity (yidam) and visualization practices which identify the yidam's external body and mandala with one's own body and 'internal mandala'.Tsunehiko SUGIKI, BOOK REVIEW [David B. Gray, The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of ≈örƒ´ Heruka): A Study and Annotated Translation.] It has also been proposed by Scott Hajicek-Dobberstein that the Amanita muscaria mushroom was used by the Tantric Buddhist mahasiddha tradition of the 8th to 12th century. In the West, some modern Buddhist teachers have written on the usefulness of psychedelics. The Buddhist magazine Tricycle devoted their entire fall 1996 edition to this issue.Tricycle: Buddhism & Psychedelics, Fall 1996 Some teachers such as Jack Kornfield have acknowledged the possibility that psychedelics could complement Buddhist practice, bring healing and help people understand their connection with everything which could lead to compassion.Kornfield, Jack; \\"Bringing Home the Dharma: Awakening Right Where You Are\\", excerpted at / Kornfield warns however that addiction can still be a hindrance. Other teachers such as Michelle McDonald-Smith expressed views which saw entheogens as not conductive to Buddhist practice (\\"I don't see them developing anything\\").  Contemporary movements  =Santo Daime= Santo Daime is a syncretic religion founded in the 1930s in the Brazilian Amazonian state of Acre by Raimundo Irineu Serra,Mestre Irineu photos known as Mestre Irineu. Santo Daime incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including Folk Catholicism, Kardecist Spiritism, African animism and indigenous South American shamanism, including vegetalismo. Ceremonies -- trabalhos (Brazilian Portuguese for \\"works\\") -- are typically several hours long and are undertaken sitting in silent \\"concentration\\", or sung collectively, dancing according to simple steps in geometrical formation. Ayahuasca, referred to as Daime within the practice, which contains several psychoactive compounds, is drunk as part of the ceremony. The drinking of Daime can induce a strong emetic effect which is embraced as both emotional and physical purging. Santo Daime churches promote a wholesome lifestyle in conformity with Irineu's motto of \\"harmony, love, truth and justice\\", as well as other key doctrinal values such as strength, humility, fraternity and purity of heart. The practice became a worldwide movement in the 1990s. =Uni√£o do Vegetal= Uni√£o do Vegetal ( ; or UDV) is a religious society founded on July 22, 1961 by Jos√© Gabriel da Costa, known as Mestre Gabriel. The translation of Uni√£o do Vegetal is Union of the Plants referring to the sacrament of the UDV, Hoasca tea (also known as ayahuasca). This beverage is made by boiling two plants, Mariri (Banisteriopsis caapi) and Chacrona (Psychotria viridis), both of which are native to the Amazon rainforest. In its sessions, UDV members drink Hoasca Tea for the effect of mental concentration. In Brazil, the use of Hoasca in religious rituals was regulated by the Brazilian Federal Government's National Drug Policy Council on January 25, 2010. The policy established legal norms for the religious institutions that responsibly use this tea. The Supreme Court of the United States unanimously affirmed the UDV's right to use Hoasca tea in its religious sessions in the United States, in a decision published on February 21, 2006. =Others= Entheogens also play an important role in contemporary religious movements such as the Rastafari movement and the Church of the Universe.  Prohibition  Some religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic beverages. These include Islam, Jainism, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, the Mormons, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Church of Christ, Scientist, the United Pentecostal Church International, Theravada, most Mahayana schools of Buddhism, some Protestant denominations of Christianity, some sects of Taoism (Five Precepts and Ten Precepts), and Hinduism. The Pali Canon, the scripture of Theravada Buddhism, depicts refraining from alcohol as essential to moral conduct because intoxication causes a loss of mindfulness. The fifth of the Five Precepts states, \\"SurƒÅ- meraya-majja-pamƒÅda·π≠·π≠hƒÅnƒÅ verama·πáƒ´ sikkhƒÅpada·πÉ samƒÅdiyƒÅmi.\\" In English: \\"I undertake to refrain from meraya and majja (the two fermented drinks used in the place and time of writing) to heedless intoxication.\\" Although the Fifth Precept only names a specific wine and cider, this has traditionally been interpreted to mean all alcoholic beverages. Technically, this prohibition does not include light to moderate drinking, only drinking to the point of drunkenness. It also doesn't include other mind-altering drugs, but Buddhist tradition includes all intoxicants. The canon does not suggest that alcohol is evil but believes that the carelessness produced by intoxication creates bad karma. Therefore, any drug (beyond tea or mild coffee) that affects one's mindfulness be considered by some to be covered by this prohibition. = Cultural use = Entheogens have been used in various ways, e.g., as part of established religious rituals, as aids for personal spiritual development (\\"plant teachers\\"), as recreational drugs, and for medical and therapeutic use. The use of entheogens in human cultures is nearly ubiquitous throughout recorded history. Naturally occurring entheogens such as psilocybin and DMT (in the preparation ayahuasca), were, for the most part, discovered and used by older cultures, as part of their spiritual and religious life, as plants and agents that were respected, or in some cases revered for generations and may be a tradition that predates all modern religions as a sort of proto- religious rite. One of the most widely used entheogens is cannabis, entheogenic use of cannabis has been used in regions such as China, Europe, and India, and, in some cases, for thousands of years. It has also appeared as a part of religions and cultures such as the Rastafari movement, the Sadhus of Hinduism, the Scythians, Sufi Islam, and others.  Africa  The best- known entheogen-using culture of Africa is the Bwitists, who used a preparation of the root bark of Tabernanthe iboga.Bwiti: An Ethnography of the Religious Imagination in Africa by James W. Fernandez, Princeton University Press, 1982 Although the ancient Egyptians may have been using the sacred blue lily plant in some of their religious rituals or just symbolically, it has been suggested that Egyptian religion once revolved around the ritualistic ingestion of the far more psychoactive Psilocybe cubensis mushroom, and that the Egyptian White Crown, Triple Crown, and Atef Crown were evidently designed to represent pin-stages of this mushroom. There is also evidence for the use of psilocybin mushrooms in Ivory Coast. Numerous other plants used in shamanic ritual in Africa, such as Silene capensis sacred to the Xhosa, are yet to be investigated by western science. A recent revitalization has occurred in the study of southern African psychoactives and entheogens (Mitchell and Hudson 2004; Sobiecki 2002, 2008, 2012). Among the amaXhosa, the artificial drug 2C-B is used as entheogen by traditional healers or amagqirha over their traditional plants; they refer to the chemical as Ubulawu Nomathotholo, which roughly translates to \\"Medicine of the Singing Ancestors\\".The Nexus Factor - An Introduction to 2C-B ErowidUbulawu Nomathotholo Pack Photo by Erowid. 2002 Erowid.org  Americas  Salvia divinorum (Herba de Maria) Entheogens have played a pivotal role in the spiritual practices of most American cultures for millennia. The first American entheogen to be subject to scientific analysis was the peyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii). For his part, one of the founders of modern ethno-botany, the late-Richard Evans Schultes of Harvard University documented the ritual use of peyote cactus among the Kiowa, who live in what became Oklahoma. While it was used traditionally by many cultures of what is now Mexico, in the 19th century its use spread throughout North America, replacing the toxic mescal bean (Calia secundiflora). Other well-known entheogens used by Mexican cultures include the alcoholic Aztec sacrament, pulque, ritual tobacco (known as 'picietl' to the Aztecs, and 'sikar' to the Maya (from where the word 'cigar' derives)), psilocybin mushrooms, morning glories (Ipomoea tricolor and Turbina corymbosa), and Salvia divinorum. Datura wrightii is sacred to some Native Americans and has been used in ceremonies and rites of passage by Chumash, Tongva, and others. Among the Chumash, when a boy was 8 years old, his mother would give him a preparation of momoy to drink. This supposed spiritual challenge should help the boy develop the spiritual wellbeing that is required to become a man. Not all of the boys undergoing this ritual survived. Momoy was also used to enhance spiritual wellbeing among adults. For instance, during a frightening situation, such as when seeing a coyote walk like a man, a leaf of momoy was sucked to help keep the soul in the body.  Asia  The indigenous peoples of Siberia (from whom the term shaman was borrowed) have used Amanita muscaria as an entheogen. In Hinduism, Datura stramonium and cannabis have been used in religious ceremonies, although the religious use of datura is not very common, as the primary alkaloids are strong deliriants, which causes serious intoxication with unpredictable effects. Also, the ancient drink Soma, mentioned often in the Vedas, appears to be consistent with the effects of an entheogen. In his 1967 book, Wasson argues that Soma was Amanita muscaria. The active ingredient of Soma is presumed by some to be ephedrine, an alkaloid with stimulant properties derived from the soma plant, identified as Ephedra pachyclada. However, there are also arguments to suggest that Soma could have also been Syrian rue, cannabis, Atropa belladonna, or some combination of any of the above plants.  Europe  Fermented honey, known in Northern Europe as mead, was an early entheogen in Aegean civilization, predating the introduction of wine, which was the more familiar entheogen of the reborn Dionysus and the maenads. Its religious uses in the Aegean world are bound up with the mythology of the bee. Dacians were known to use cannabis in their religious and important life ceremonies, proven by discoveries of large clay pots with burnt cannabis seeds in ancient tombs and religious shrines. Also, local oral folklore and myths tell of ancient priests that dreamed with gods and walked in the smoke. Their names, as transmitted by Herodotus, were \\"kap-no-batai\\" which in Dacian was supposed to mean \\"the ones that walk in the clouds\\". The growth of Roman Christianity also saw the end of the two-thousand-year-old tradition of the Eleusinian Mysteries, the initiation ceremony for the cult of Demeter and Persephone involving the use of a drug known as kykeon. The term 'ambrosia' is used in Greek mythology in a way that is remarkably similar to the Soma of the Hindus as well. A theory that natural occurring gases like ethylene used by inhalation may have played a role in divinatory ceremonies at Delphi in Classical Greece received popular press attention in the early 2000s, yet has not been conclusively proven. Mushroom consumption is part of the culture of Europeans in general, with particular importance to Slavic and Baltic peoples. Some academics consider that using psilocybin- and or muscimol-containing mushrooms was an integral part of the ancient culture of the Rus' people.  Middle East  It has been suggested that the ritual use of small amounts of Syrian rue is an artifact of its ancient use in higher doses as an entheogen (possibly in conjunction with DMT containing acacia). John Marco Allegro argued that early Jewish and Christian cultic practice was based on the use of Amanita muscaria, which was later forgotten by its adherents, but this view has been widely disputed.  Oceania  In general, indigenous Australians are thought not to have used entheogens, although there is a strong barrier of secrecy surrounding Aboriginal shamanism, which has likely limited what has been told to outsiders. A plant that the Australian Aboriginals used to ingest is called Pitcheri, which is said to have a similar effect to that of coca. Pitcheri was made from the bark of the shrub Duboisia myoporoides. This plant is now grown commercially and is processed to manufacture an eye medication. There are no known uses of entheogens by the MƒÅori of New Zealand aside from a variant species of kava, although some modern scholars have claimed that there may be evidence of psilocybin mushroom use. Natives of Papua New Guinea are known to use several species of entheogenic mushrooms (Psilocybe spp, Boletus manicus). Kava or kava kava (Piper Methysticum) has been cultivated for at least 3000 years by a number of Pacific island-dwelling peoples. Historically, most Polynesian, many Melanesian, and some Micronesian cultures have ingested the psychoactive pulverized root, typically taking it mixed with water. In these traditions, taking kava is believed to facilitate contact with the spirits of the dead, especially relatives and ancestors.  Research  Studies such as Timothy Leary's Marsh Chapel Experiment and Roland R. Griffiths' psilocybin studies at Johns Hopkins have documented reports of mystical/spiritual/religious experiences from participants who were administered psychoactive drugs in controlled trials. Ongoing research is limited due to widespread drug prohibition. Mandala-like round window above the altar at Boston University's Marsh Chapel, site of Marsh Chapel Experiment Notable early testing of the entheogenic experience includes the Marsh Chapel Experiment, conducted by physician and theology doctoral candidate, Walter Pahnke, under the supervision of Timothy Leary and the Harvard Psilocybin Project. In this double-blind experiment, volunteer graduate school divinity students from the Boston area almost all claimed to have had profound religious experiences subsequent to the ingestion of pure psilocybin. In 2006, a more rigorously controlled experiment was conducted at Johns Hopkins University, and yielded similar results. To date there is little peer-reviewed research on this subject, due to ongoing drug prohibition and the difficulty of getting approval from institutional review boards. Furthermore, scientific studies on entheogens present some significant challenges to investigators, including philosophical questions relating to ontology, epistemology and objectivity.  Legal status  =United Nations= =By country= Australia Between 2011 and 2012, the Australian Federal Government was considering changes to the Australian Criminal Code that would classify any plants containing any amount of DMT as \\"controlled plants\\". DMT itself was already controlled under current laws. The proposed changes included other similar blanket bans for other substances, such as a ban on any and all plants containing mescaline or ephedrine. The proposal was not pursued after political embarrassment on realisation that this would make the official Floral Emblem of Australia, Acacia pycnantha (golden wattle), illegal. The Therapeutic Goods Administration and federal authority had considered a motion to ban the same, but this was withdrawn in May 2012 (as DMT may still hold potential entheogenic value to native and/or religious peoples).  United States  In 1963 in Sherbert v. Verner the Supreme Court established the Sherbert Test, which consists of four criteria that are used to determine if an individual's right to religious free exercise has been violated by the government. The test is as follows: For the individual, the court must determine * whether the person has a claim involving a sincere religious belief, and * whether the government action is a substantial burden on the person's ability to act on that belief. If these two elements are established, then the government must prove * that it is acting in furtherance of a \\"compelling state interest,\\" and * that it has pursued that interest in the manner least restrictive, or least burdensome, to religion. This test was eventually all-but-eliminated in Employment Division v. Smith 494 U.S. 872 (1990) which held that a \\"neutral law of general applicability\\" was not subject to the test. Congress resurrected it for the purposes of federal law in the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. In City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997) RFRA was held to trespass on state sovereignty, and application of the RFRA was essentially limited to federal law enforcement. In Gonzales v. O Centro Esp√≠rita Beneficente Uni√£o do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), a case involving only federal law, RFRA was held to permit a church's use of a DMT-containing tea for religious ceremonies. Some states have enacted State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts intended to mirror the federal RFRA's protections. =Religious discrimination= Peyote is listed by the United States DEA as a Schedule I controlled substance. However, practitioners of the Peyote Way Church of God, a Native American religion, perceive the regulations regarding the use of peyote as discriminating, leading to religious discrimination issues regarding about the U.S. policy towards drugs. As the result of Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 was passed. This federal statute allow the \\"Traditional Indian religious use of the peyote sacrament,\\" exempting only use by Native American persons.  Classical mythology and cults  Although entheogens are taboo and most of them are officially prohibited in Christian and Islamic societies, their ubiquity and prominence in the spiritual traditions of various other cultures is unquestioned. \\"The spirit, for example, need not be chemical, as is the case with the ivy and the olive: and yet the god was felt to be within them; nor need its possession be considered something detrimental, like drugged, hallucinatory, or delusionary: but possibly instead an invitation to knowledge or whatever good the god's spirit had to offer.\\" Most of the well-known modern examples, such as peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, and morning glories are from the native cultures of the Americas. However, it has also been suggested that entheogens played an important role in ancient Indo-European culture, for example by inclusion in the ritual preparations of the Soma, the \\"pressed juice\\" that is the subject of Book 9 of the Rig Veda. Soma was ritually prepared and drunk by priests and initiates and elicited a paean in the Rig Veda that embodies the nature of an entheogen: The kykeon that preceded initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries is another entheogen, which was investigated (before the word was coined) by Carl Ker√©nyi, in Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter. Other entheogens in the Ancient Near East and the Aegean include the opium poppy, datura, and the unidentified \\"lotus\\" (likely the sacred blue lily) eaten by the Lotus-Eaters in the Odyssey and Narcissus. According to Ruck, Eyan, and Staples, the familiar shamanic entheogen that the Indo-Europeans brought knowledge of was Amanita muscaria. It could not be cultivated; thus it had to be found, which suited it to a nomadic lifestyle. When they reached the world of the Caucasus and the Aegean, the Indo-Europeans encountered wine, the entheogen of Dionysus, who brought it with him from his birthplace in the mythical Nysa, when he returned to claim his Olympian birthright. The Indo-European proto-Greeks \\"recognized it as the entheogen of Zeus, and their own traditions of shamanism, the Amanita and the 'pressed juice' of Soma ‚Äì but better, since no longer unpredictable and wild, the way it was found among the Hyperboreans: as befit their own assimilation of agrarian modes of life, the entheogen was now cultivable.\\" Robert Graves, in his foreword to The Greek Myths, hypothesises that the ambrosia of various pre-Hellenic tribes was Amanita muscaria (which, based on the morphological similarity of the words amanita, amrita and ambrosia, is entirely plausible) and perhaps psilocybin mushrooms of the genus Panaeolus. Amanita was divine food, according to Ruck and Staples, not something to be indulged in or sampled lightly, not something to be profaned. It was the food of the gods, their ambrosia, and it mediated between the two realms. It is said that Tantalus's crime was inviting commoners to share his ambrosia. =Assassins= The legends of the Assassins had much to do with the training and instruction of Nizari fida'is, famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries. The tales of the fida'is' training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalists writers were confounded and compiled in Marco Polo's account, in which he described a \\"secret garden of paradise\\". After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said to be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these fida'is would awaken. Here, they were told by an old man that they were witnessing their place in Paradise and that should they wish to return to this garden permanently, they must serve the Nizari cause(History of Nizari Ismailism). So went the tale of the \\"Old Man in the Mountain\\", assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774‚Äì1856), a prominent orientalist writer responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, von Hammer's retelling of the Assassin legends served as the standard account of the Nizaris across Europe.  Literature  Many works of literature have described entheogen use; some of those are: * The drug melange (spice) in Frank Herbert's Dune universe acts as both an entheogen (in large enough quantities) and an addictive geriatric medicine. Control of the supply of melange was crucial to the Empire, as it was necessary for, among other things, faster-than-light (folding space) navigation. * Consumption of the imaginary mushroom anochi [enoki] as the entheogen underlying the creation of Christianity is the premise of Philip K. Dick's last novel, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, a theme that seems to be inspired by John Allegro's book. * Aldous Huxley's final novel, Island (1962), depicted a fictional psychoactive mushroom ‚Äì termed \\"moksha medicine\\" ‚Äì used by the people of Pala in rites of passage, such as the transition to adulthood and at the end of life. * Bruce Sterling's Holy Fire novel refers to the religion in the future as a result of entheogens, used freely by the population. * In Stephen King's The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, Book 1 of The Dark Tower series, the main character receives guidance after taking mescaline. * The Alastair Reynolds novel Absolution Gap features a moon under the control of a religious government that uses neurological viruses to induce religious faith. * A critical examination of the ethical and societal implications and relevance of \\"entheogenic\\" experiences can be found in Daniel Waterman and Casey William Hardison's book Entheogens, Society & Law: Towards a Politics of Consciousness, Autonomy and Responsibility (Melrose, Oxford 2013). This book includes a controversial analysis of the term entheogen arguing that Wasson et al. were mystifying the effects of the plants and traditions it refers to.

He was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1982. Hodges is generally considered to be the best defensive first baseman of the 1950s. He was an All-Star for eight seasons and a Gold Glove Award winner for three consecutive seasons. Hodges and Duke Snider are the only players to have the most home runs or runs batted in together during the decade with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Hodges was the National League (NL) leader in double plays four times and in putouts, assists and fielding percentage three times each. He ranked second in NL history with 1,281 assists and 1,614 double plays when his career ended, and was among the league's career leaders in games (6th, 1,908) and total chances (10th, 16,751) at first base. Hodges also managed the New York Mets to the 1969 World Series title over the favored Baltimore Orioles, one of the greatest upsets in Fall Classic history. In 2014, Hodges appeared for the second time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballothttp://baseballhall.org/hall-of-fame/2015-golden-era-committee-ballot for possible Hall of Fame consideration in 2015. He and the other candidates all missed getting elected.National Baseball Hall of Fame, 12/8/2014, \\"Golden Era Announces Results\\" Retrieved April 23, 2015 The committee meets and votes on ten candidates selected from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years.MLB.com, \\"No one elected to Hall of Fame by Golden Era Committee\\" Retrieved April 24, 2015 Early years Hodges was born in Princeton, Indiana, the son of coal miner Charles and his wife Irene, (nee Horstmeyer). He had an older brother, Robert, and a younger sister, Marjorie. The family moved to nearby Petersburg when Hodges was seven. He was a star four-sport athlete at Petersburg High School, earning a combined seven varsity letters in football, baseball, basketball and track. Hodges declined a contract offer from the Detroit Tigers, instead attending Saint Joseph's College with the hope of eventually becoming a collegiate coach. Hodges spent two years (1941‚Äì1942 and 1942‚Äì1943) at St Joseph's, competing in baseball, basketball and briefly in football. He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1943, and appeared in one game for the team as a third baseman that year. Hodges entered the United States Marine Corps during World War II after having participated in its Reserve Officers' Training Corps program at Saint Joseph's. He served in combat as an anti-aircraft gunner in the 16th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, participating in the battles of Tinian and Okinawa, and received a Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\" for heroism under fire. Following the war, Hodges also spent time completing course work at Oakland City University, near his hometown, playing basketball for the Mighty Oaks, joining the 1947‚Äì48 team after four games (1‚Äì3 record); they finished at 9‚Äì10. One of his teammates, Bob Lochmueller, would go on to star at the University of Louisville and play in the NBA.https://www.courierpress.com/story/sports/2019/09/02/hodges-so- beloved-he-claimed-two-communities/2101641001/ Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers Hodges was discharged from the Marine Corps in 1946, and returned to the Dodgers organization as a catcher with the Newport News Dodgers of the Piedmont League, batting .278 in 129 games as they won the league championship; his teammates included first baseman and future film and television star Chuck Connors. Hodges was called up to Brooklyn in 1947, the same year that Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier. He played as a catcher, joining the team's nucleus of Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Carl Furillo. With the emergence of Roy Campanella behind the plate, manager Leo Durocher shifted Hodges to first base. Hodges' only appearance in the 1947 World Series against the New York Yankees was as a pinch hitter for pitcher Rex Barney in Game Seven, but he struck out. As a rookie in , he batted .249 with 11 home runs and 70 runs batted in. Hodges in 1949 On June 25, , Hodges hit for the cycle on his way to his first of seven consecutive All-Star teams. For the season, his 115 runs batted in ranked fourth in the NL, and he tied Hack Wilson's club record for right-handed hitters with 23 home runs. Defensively, he led the NL in putouts (1,336), double plays (142) and fielding average (.995). Facing the Yankees again in the Series, he batted only .235 but drove in the sole run in Brooklyn's only victory, a 1‚Äì0 triumph in Game Two. In game five, he hit a two out, three-run homer in the seventh to pull the Dodgers within 10‚Äì6, but struck out to end the game and the Series. On August 31, against the Boston Braves, Hodges joined Lou Gehrig as only the second player since 1900 to hit four home runs in a game without the benefit of extra innings; he hit them against four different pitchers, with the first coming off Warren Spahn. He also had seventeen total bases in the game, tied for third in MLB history. That year he also led the league in fielding (.994) and set an NL record with 159 double plays, breaking Frank McCormick's mark of 153 with the Cincinnati Reds; he broke his own record in 1951 with 171, a record which stood until Donn Clendenon had 182 for the 1966 Pittsburgh Pirates. He finished 1950 third in the league in both homers (32) and runs batted in (113), and came in eighth in the Most Valuable Player voting. In 1951 he became the first member of the Dodgers to ever hit 40 home runs, breaking Babe Herman's 1930 mark of 35; Campanella hit 41 in 1953, but Hodges recaptured the record with 42 in 1954 before Snider eclipsed him again with 43 in 1956. His last home run of 1951 came on October 2 against the New York Giants, as the Dodgers tied the three-game NL playoff series at a game each with a 10‚Äì0 win; New York won the pennant the next day on Bobby Thomson's \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\". Hodges also led the NL with 126 assists in 1951, and was second in home runs, third in runs (118) and total bases (307), fifth in slugging percentage (.527), and sixth in runs batted in (103). Hodges was an eight-time All-Star, from 1949 to 1955 and in 1957. With his last home run of 1952, he tied Dolph Camilli's Dodger career record of 139, surpassing him in 1953; Snider moved ahead of Hodges in 1956. He again led the NL with 116 assists in the 1952 campaign and was third in the league in home runs (32) and fourth in runs batted in (102) and slugging (.500). Hodges attempting to make a catch at Ebbets Field A great fan favorite in Brooklyn, Hodges was perhaps the only Dodgers regular never booed at their home park Ebbets Field. Fans were supportive even when Hodges suffered through one of the most famous slumps in baseball history: after going hitless in his last four regular- season games of 1952, he also went hitless in all seven games of the 1952 World Series against the Yankees (finishing the Series 0-for-21 at the plate), with Brooklyn losing to the Yankees in the seven games. When Hodges' slump continued into the following spring, fans reacted with countless letters and good-luck gifts, and one Brooklyn priest ‚Äì Father Herbert Redmond of St. Francis Roman Catholic Church ‚Äì told his flock: \\"It's far too hot for a homily. Keep the Commandments and say a prayer for Gil Hodges.\\" Hodges began hitting again soon afterward, and rarely struggled again in the World Series. Teammate Carl Erskine, who described himself as a good Baptist, kidded him by saying, \\"Gil, you just about made a believer out of me.\\"Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Peter Golenbock, Dover Publications, 1984. Hodges was involved in a blown call in the 1952 World Series. Johnny Sain was batting for the Yankees in the 10th inning of Game 5 and grounded out, as ruled by first base umpire Art Passarella. The photograph of the play, however, shows Sain stepping on first base while Hodges, also with a foot on the bag, is reaching for the ball that is about a foot shy of entering his glove. Baseball commissioner Ford Frick, an ex-newspaperman himself, refused to defend Passarella. Hodges ended 1953 with a .302 batting average, finishing fifth in the NL in runs batted in (122) and sixth in home runs (31). Against the Yankees in the 1953 Series, Hodges hit .364; he had three hits, including a homer in the 9‚Äì5 Game 1 loss, but the Dodgers again lost in six games. Under their new manager Walter Alston in 1954, Hodges set the team home run record with 42, hitting a career-high .304 and again leading the NL in putouts (1,381) and assists (132). He was second in the league to Ted Kluszewski in home runs and runs batted in (130), fifth in total bases (335), and sixth in slugging (.579) and runs (106), and placed tenth in the Most Valuable Player vote. =The Boys of Summer= In the 1955 season, Hodges' regular-season production declined to a .289 average, 27 home runs and 102 runs batted in. Facing the Yankees in the World Series for the fifth time, he was 1-for-12 in the first three games before coming around. In Game 4, Hodges hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning to put Brooklyn ahead, 4‚Äì3, and later had a single that drove in a run as they held off the Yankees, 8‚Äì5; he also scored the first run in the Dodgers' 5‚Äì3 win in Game 5. In Game 7, he drove in Campanella with two out in the fourth inning for a 1‚Äì0 lead and added a sacrifice fly to score Reese with one out in the sixth inning. Johnny Podres scattered eight New York hits, and when Reese threw Elston Howard's grounder to Hodges for the final out, Brooklyn had a 2‚Äì0 win and their first World Series title in franchise history and their only championship in Brooklyn. Hodges in 1958-59 In 1956, Hodges had 32 home runs and 87 runs batted in as Brooklyn won the pennant again, and once more met the Yankees in the World Series. In the third inning of Game 1, he hit a three-run homer to put Brooklyn ahead, 5‚Äì2, as they went on to a 6‚Äì3 win; he had three hits and four runs batted in during the 13‚Äì8 slugfest in Game 2, scoring to give the Dodgers a 7‚Äì6 lead in the third and doubling in two runs each in the fourth and fifth innings for an 11‚Äì7 lead. In Don Larsen's perfect game Hodges struck out, flied to center, and lined to third base, as Brooklyn went on to lose in seven games. In 1957 Hodges set the NL record for career grand slams, breaking the mark of 12 shared by Rogers Hornsby and Ralph Kiner; his final total of 14 was tied by Hank Aaron and Willie McCovey in 1972, and broken by Aaron in 1974. He finished seventh in the NL with a .299 batting average and fifth with 98 runs batted in, and leading the league with 1,317 putouts. He was also among the NL's top ten players in home runs (27), hits (173), runs (94), triples (7), slugging (.511) and total bases (296); in late September, he drove in the last Dodgers run ever at Ebbets Field, and the last run in Brooklyn history. Hodges was named to his last All-Star team and placed seventh in the Most Valuable Player balloting. After the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, on April 23, 1958, Hodges became the seventh player to hit 300 home runs in the NL, connecting off Dick Drott of the Chicago Cubs. That year he also tied a post-1900 record by leading the league in double plays (134) for the fourth time, equaling Frank McCormick and Ted Kluszewski; Donn Clendenon eventually broke the record in 1968. Hodges' totals were 22 home runs and 64 runs batted in as the Dodgers finished in seventh place in their first season in California. He also broke Dolph Camilli's NL record of 923 career strikeouts in 1958. In 1959, the Dodgers captured another NL title, with Hodges contributing 25 home runs, 80 runs batted in, and a batting average of .276, coming in seventh in the league with a .513 slugging mark; he also led the NL with a .992 fielding average. He batted .391 in the 1959 World Series against the Chicago White Sox (his first against a team other than the Yankees), with his solo home run in the eighth inning of Game 4 giving the Dodgers a 5‚Äì4 win, as they triumphed in six games for another Series championship. In 1960, Hodges broke Kiner's NL record for right-handed hitters of 351 career home runs, and appeared on the TV program Home Run Derby. In his last season with the Dodgers in 1961, he became the team's career runs batted in leader with 1,254, passing Zack Wheat; Snider moved ahead of him the following year. Hodges received the first three Rawlings Gold Glove Awards, from 1957 to 1959. Return to New York After being chosen in the 1961 MLB Expansion Draft, Hodges was one of the original 1962 Mets and despite knee problems was persuaded to continue his playing career in New York, hitting the first home run in franchise history. By the end of the year, in which he played only 54 games, he ranked tenth in MLB history with 370 home runs ‚Äì second to only Jimmie Foxx among right-handed hitters. He also held the National League (NL) record for career home runs by a right-handed hitter from 1960 to 1963, and held the NL record for career grand slams from 1957 to 1974. Managerial career After 11 games with the Mets in 1963, during which he batted .227 with no homers and was plagued by injuries, he was traded to the Washington Senators in late May for outfielder Jimmy Piersall so that he could replace Mickey Vernon as Washington's manager. Hodges immediately announced his retirement from playing in order to focus on his new position. The Giants' Willie Mays had passed him weeks earlier on April 19 to become the NL's home run leader among right-handed hitters; Hodges' last game had been on May 5 in a doubleheader hosting the Giants (who had moved to San Francisco in 1958). Hodges managed the Senators through 1967, and although they improved in each season they never achieved a winning record. In 1968 Hodges was brought back to New York to manage the perennially woeful Mets, and while the team only posted a 73‚Äì89 record it was nonetheless the best mark in their seven years of existence up to that point. In 1969, he led the \\"Miracle Mets\\" to the World Series championship, defeating the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles; after losing Game 1, they came back for four straight victories, including two by 2‚Äì1 scores. Finishing higher than ninth place for the first time, the Mets became not only the first expansion team to win a World Series, but also the first team ever to win the Fall Classic after finishing at least 15 games under .500 the previous year. Hodges was named The Sporting News' Manager of the Year, in skillfully platooning his players, utilizing everyone in the dugout, keeping everyone fresh. Hodges continued as manager through the 1971 season. He died before the opening of the 1972 season and was succeeded by Yogi Berra. In the second game of doubleheader on July 30, 1969, the Houston Astros, after scoring 11 runs in the ninth inning of the first game, were in the midst of a 10-run third inning, hitting a number of line drives to left field. When the Mets' star left fielder Cleon Jones failed to hustle after a ball hit to the outfield, Hodges removed him from the game, but rather than simply signal from the dugout for Jones to come out, or delegate the job to one of his coaches, Hodges left the dugout and slowly, deliberately, walked all the way out to left field to remove Jones, and walked him back to the dugout, which was a resounding message to the whole team. Jones reportedly never again had to be reminded to hustle. Death and impact Hodges at Ebbets Field, circa 1953 On the afternoon of April 2, 1972, Easter Sunday, Hodges was in West Palm Beach, Florida completing a round of golf with Mets coaches Joe Pignatano, Rube Walker, and Eddie Yost, when he collapsed en route to his motel room at the Ramada Inn across the street from Municipal Stadium, then the spring training facility of the Atlanta Braves and Montreal Expos. Hodges had suffered a sudden heart attack and was rushed to Good Samaritan Hospital where he died within 20 minutes of arrival. Pignatano later recalled Hodges falling backwards and hitting his head on the sidewalk with a \\"sickening knock\\", bleeding profusely and turning blue. Pignatano said \\"I put my hand under Gil's head, but before you knew it, the blood stopped. I knew he was dead. He died in my arms.\\" A lifelong chain smoker, Hodges had suffered a minor heart attack in 1968, during a game in late September. Jackie Robinson, himself ill with heart disease and diabetes, told the Associated Press, \\"He was the core of the Brooklyn Dodgers. With this, and what's happened to Campy (Roy Campanella) and lot of other guys we played with, it scares you. I've been somewhat shocked by it all. I have tremendous feelings for Gil's family and kids.\\" Robinson died of a heart attack six months later on October 24 at age 53. Duke Snider said \\"Gil was a great player, but an even greater man.\\" \\"I'm sick,\\" said Johnny Podres, \\"I've never known a finer man.\\" A crushed Carl Erskine said \\"Gil's death is like a bolt out of the blue.\\" Don Drysdale, who himself died in Montreal of a sudden heart attack in 1993 at age 56, wrote in his autobiography that Hodges' death \\"absolutely shattered me. I just flew apart. I didn't leave my apartment in Texas for three days. I didn't want to see anybody. I couldn't get myself to go to the funeral. It was like I'd lost a part of my family.\\" The wake was held at Our Lady Help of Christians Church in Midwood, Brooklyn, on April 4, what would have been Hodges' 48th birthday. Approximately 10,000 mourners attended the service. Television broadcaster Howard Cosell was one of the many attendees at the wake. According to Gil Hodges Jr., Cosell brought him into the back seat of a car, where Jackie Robinson had been crying hysterically. Robinson then held Hodges Jr. and said, \\"Next to my son's death, this is the worst day of my life.\\" Hodges was survived by his wife, the former Joan Lombardi (b. 1926 in Brooklyn), whom he had married on December 26, 1948, and their children Gil Jr. (b. 1950), Irene, Cynthia and Barbara. He is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. Yogi Berra succeeded him as manager, having been promoted on the day of the funeral. The American flag flew at half-staff on Opening Day at Shea Stadium, while the Mets wore black armbands on their left arms during the entire 1972 season in honor of Hodges. On June 9, 1973, the Mets again honored Hodges by retiring his uniform number 14. Accomplishments The Marine Parkway‚ÄìGil Hodges Memorial Bridge at night, circa 2014 Hodges batted .273 in his career with a .487 slugging percentage, 1,921 hits, 1,274 runs batted in, 1,105 runs, 370 home runs, 295 doubles and 63 stolen bases in 2,071 games. His 361 home runs with the Dodgers remain second in team history to Snider's 389. His 1,614 career double plays placed him behind only Charlie Grimm (1733) in NL history, and were a major league record for a right-handed fielding first baseman until Chris Chambliss surpassed him in 1984. His 1,281 career assists ranked second in league history to Fred Tenney's 1,363, and trailed only Ed Konetchy's 1,292 among all right-handed first basemen. Snider broke his NL record of 1,137 career strikeouts in 1964. When he retired after the 1963 season, he had hit the most home runs (370) ever by a right-handed batter up to that point in time (surpassed by Willie Mays) and the most career grand slams (14) by a National League player (eclipsed by Willie McCovey). He shares the major league record of having hit four home runs in a single game (only 18 players have ever done so in MLB history). Hodges received New York City's highest civilian honor, the Bronze Medallion, in 1969. On April 4, 1978 (what would have been Hodges' 54th birthday), the Marine Parkway Bridge, connecting Marine Park, Brooklyn with Rockaway, Queens, was renamed the Marine Parkway‚ÄìGil Hodges Memorial Bridge in his memory. Other Brooklyn locations named for him are a park on Carroll Street, a Little League field on Shell Road in Brooklyn, a section of Avenue L and P.S. 193. In addition, part of Bedford Avenue in Midwood, Brooklyn, is named Gil Hodges Way. A Brooklyn bowling alley, Gil Hodges Lanes is named in his honor. He is an inaugural member (1979) of the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame.http://www.indbaseballhalloffame.org/inductees/http://www.indbaseballhalloffame.org/inductees/inductee- gilbert-ray-hodges/ Hodges was also inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1982. In Indiana, the high school baseball stadium in his birthplace of Princeton and a bridge spanning the East Fork of the White River in northern Pike County on State Road 57 bear his name. In addition, a Petersburg Little League baseball team is named in his honor, the Hodges Dodgers. In 2007, Hodges was inducted into the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame.Marine Corps Community Services: Gil Hodges Hall of Fame consideration There has been continuing controversy for decades over the fact Gil Hodges has not been elected to membership in the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was considered to be one of the finest players of the 1950s, and graduated to managerial success with the Mets. However, critics of his candidacy point out that despite his offensive prowess, he never led the National League in any offensive category such as home runs, runs batted in, or slugging percentage, and never came close to winning a Most Valuable Player award. Hodges' not having been voted a Most Valuable Player may have been based in part on his having had some of his best seasons (1950, 1954 and 1957) in years when the Dodgers did not win the pennant. Another thing that has probably hurt his Hall of Fame candidacy was the fact he went hitless in the 1952 World Series, going 0 for 21 with just one run scored and one batted in. In addition, his career batting average of .273 was likely frowned on by many Hall of Fame voters in his early years of eligibility; at the time of his death, only five players had ever been elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America with batting averages below .300 ‚Äì all of them catchers or shortstops, and only one (Rabbit Maranville) who had an average lower than Hodges' or who had not won an Most Valuable Player award. By the time his initial eligibility expired in 1983, the Baseball Writers' Association of America had elected only two more players with averages below .274 ‚Äì third basemen Eddie Mathews (.271), who hit over 500 home runs, leading the NL twice, and Brooks Robinson (.267), who won an Most Valuable Player award and set numerous defensive records. In Hodges' defense, however, it bears mentioning that numerous other players, including Mathews, Al Kaline, Billy Williams and Eddie Murray, have been elected to the Hall of Fame despite never having been voted Most Valuable Player. Others, most notably Tony P√©rez and Barry Larkin, have been elected despite never having led their leagues in any important offensive category in a season. (Perez, like Hodges, also was never voted Most Valuable Player, and his overall career statistics are very similar to Hodges'.) While Hodges did post some of his best season performances in years in which the Dodgers failed to win the pennant, he was nevertheless a significant contributor for the Dodgers in the seasons in which they did win pennants, as well. His contributions to the Dodgers' successful 1949, 1953, 1955 and 1959 campaigns are particularly noteworthy. With regard to Hodges' 1952 World Series slump, several Hall of Fame honorees, among them Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Stan Musial and Ted Williams, also endured severe batting slumps in World Series play. More to the point, Hodges' failure in the 1952 World Series does not obscure his fine performances for the Dodgers in the other World Series they played during his tenure with the club. Hodges led the Dodger hitters in the 1953 World Series, posting a batting average of .364. Hodges' .304 mark in the 1956 Series earned him a tie with Duke Snider for the top Dodgers batting average, while his eight World Series runs batted in were good enough for the outright lead among Dodgers hitters in that department. Hodges shared top hitting honors for all starting position players on both teams in the 1959 Fall Classic with Chicago's Ted Kluszewski, both first basemen hitting at a .391 clip. He also drove in both runs in the Dodgers' decisive 2‚Äì0 victory in the seventh game of the 1955 Series, which brought Brooklyn its first (and only) World Series title. Hodges was the prototype of the modern slugging first baseman, and while the post-1961 expansion era has resulted in numerous players surpassing his home run and runs batted in totals, he remains the only one of the 21 players who had 300 or more home runs by the time of his retirement who has not yet been elected (all but Chuck Klein and Johnny Mize were elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America). Some observers have also suggested that his death in 1972 removed him from public consciousness, whereas other ballplayers ‚Äì including numerous Dodger greats ‚Äì were in the public eye for years afterward, receiving the exposure which assisted in their election. He did, however, collect 3,010 votes cast by the Baseball Writers' Association of America during his initial eligibility period from 1969 to 1983 ‚Äì the second most for an unselected player, he was passed by Jack Morris in 2014 when he collected 351 votes to push his total to 3,324. Hodges was regularly considered for selection by the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee from 1987 on, falling one vote short of election in 1993, when no candidates were selected. =Golden Era candidate= In the years since Hodges' retirement, the Hall of Fame has refused admittance to many players with similar or even superior records. In 2011, Hodges became a Golden Era candidate (1947‚Äì1972 era) for consideration to be elected to the Hall of Fame by the Golden Era Committee (which replaced the Veterans Committee in 2010) on December 5, 2011. The voting by the committee took place during the Hall of Fame's two day winter meeting in Dallas, Texas. Ron Santo was the only one elected of the ten Golden Era candidates with 15 votes; Jim Kaat had 10 votes, and Hodges and Minnie Mi√±oso were tied with 9 votes. Hodges' next chance under the 16-member Golden Era Committee's electorates was on December 8, 2014, when the committee voted at the MLB winter meeting.

In his later years he may have suffered from schizophrenia (although this claim is disputed among specialists), which, according to some psychiatrists, can be seen in his works. Life and work A naturalistic cat from early in Wain's career Drawing by Louis Wain entitled 'Caught! Keep your mouth shut and let me open your mind for you' Louis William Wain was born on 5 August 1860 in Clerkenwell in London. His father, William Matthew Wain, was a textile trader and embroiderer; his mother, Felicia Marie/Julie Felicie (Boiteux) was French.https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-36677 He was the first of six children and the only male child. None of his five sisters ever married. At the age of thirty, his youngest sister was certified as insane, and admitted to an asylum. The remaining sisters lived with their mother for the duration of their lifetimes, as did Louis for the majority of his life. Wain was born with a cleft lip and the doctor gave his parents the orders that he should not be sent to school or taught until he was ten years old. As a youth, he was often truant from school and spent much of his childhood wandering around London. Following this period, Louis studied at the West London School of Art and eventually became a teacher there for a short period. At the age of 20, Wain was left to support his mother and his five sisters after his father's death. An early Louis Wain caricature, featuring bulldogs rather than cats Wain soon quit his teaching position to become a freelance artist, and in this role, he achieved substantial success. He specialized in drawing animals and country scenes, and worked for several journals including the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, where he stayed for four years, and The Illustrated London News, beginning in 1886. Through the 1880s, Wain's work included detailed illustrations of English country houses and estates, along with livestock he was commissioned to draw at agricultural shows. His work at this time includes a wide variety of animals, and he maintained his ability to draw creatures of all kinds throughout his lifetime. At one point, he hoped to make a living by drawing dog portraits. At the age of 23, Wain married his sisters' governess, Emily Richardson, who was ten years his senior (which was considered quite scandalous at the time), and moved with her to Hampstead in north London. Emily soon began to suffer from breast cancer and died three years into their marriage. Prior to Emily's death, Wain discovered the subject that would define his career. During her illness, Emily was comforted by their pet cat Peter, a stray black and white kitten they had rescued after hearing him mewing in the rain one night. Emily's spirits were greatly lifted by Peter, and Louis began to draw extensive sketches of him, which Emily strongly encouraged him to have published. She died before this happened, but he continued to make cat sketches. He later wrote of Peter, \\"To him, properly, belongs the foundation of my career, the developments of my initial efforts, and the establishing of my work.\\" Peter can be recognized in many of Wain's early published works.Wain is known for his anthropomorphic cats. In 1886, Wain's first drawing of anthropomorphized cats was published in the Christmas issue of the Illustrated London News, titled \\"A Kittens' Christmas Party\\". The illustration depicted 150 cats, many of which resembled Peter, doing things such as sending invitations, holding a ball, playing games, and making speeches, spread over eleven panels. Still, the cats remain on all fours, unclothed, and without the variety of human-like expression that would characterize Wain's later work. Under the pseudonym of George Henri Thompson, he illustrated numerous books for children by Clifton Bingham published by Ernest Nister. In subsequent years, Wain's cats began to walk upright, smile broadly and use other exaggerated facial expressions and would wear sophisticated, contemporary clothing. Wain's illustrations showed cats playing musical instruments, serving tea, playing cards, fishing, smoking, and enjoying a night at the opera. Such anthropomorphic portrayals of animals were very popular in Victorian England and were often found in prints, on greeting cards and in satirical illustrations such as those of John Tenniel. Wain was a prolific artist over the next thirty years, sometimes producing as many as several hundred drawings a year. He illustrated about one hundred children's books, and his work appeared in papers, journals, and magazines, including the Louis Wain Annual, which ran from 1901 to 1915. His work was also regularly reproduced on the picture postcards, and these are highly sought after by collectors today. In 1898 and 1911 he was chairman of the National Cat Club. Wain's illustrations often parody human behaviour, satirizing fads and fashions of the day. He wrote, \\"I take a sketch-book to a restaurant, or other public places, and draw the people in their different positions as cats, getting as near to their human characteristics as possible. This gives me doubly nature, and these studies I think [to be] my best humorous work.\\" Wain was involved with several animal charities, including the Governing Council of Our Dumb Friends League, the Society for the Protection of Cats, and the Anti- Vivisection Society. He was also active in the National Cat Club, acting as President and Chairman of the committee at times. He felt that he helped \\"to wipe out the contempt in which the cat has been held\\" in England. Despite his popularity, Wain suffered financial difficulty throughout his life. He remained responsible for supporting his mother and sisters and had little business sense. Wain was modest, naive and easily exploited, ill-equipped for bargaining in the world of publishing. He often sold his drawings outright, retaining no rights over their reproduction. He was easily misled and occasionally found himself duped by the promise of a new invention or other money-making schemes. Cats bringing in a Yule log; one of Louis Wain's images of Catland. From a postcard, 1910. He travelled to New York in 1907, where he drew some comic strips, such as Cats About Town and Grimalkin, for Hearst newspapers. His work was widely admired, although his critical attitude towards the city made him the subject of sniping in the press. He returned home with even less money than before, due to imprudent investment in a new type of oil lamp.  Mental disorder  This cat, like many painted during this period, is shown with abstract patterns behind it. Psychologists have cited this increased abstraction as symptomatic of Wain's schizophrenia, but others have argued that his \\"wallpaper cats\\" simply recall the patterns in his mother's fabrics. The onset of Wain's schizophrenia may have been precipitated by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite which is excreted by cats in their faeces. The theory that toxoplasmosis can trigger schizophrenia is the subject of ongoing research, though the origins of the theory can be traced back as early as 1953.free full text When his sisters could no longer cope with his erratic and occasionally violent behaviour in 1924, Wain was committed to a pauper ward of Springfield Mental Hospital in Tooting. A year later, he was discovered there, and his circumstances were widely publicized, leading to appeals from such figures as H. G. Wells and the personal intervention of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Wain was transferred to the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark, and again in 1930 to Napsbury Hospital near St Albans in Hertfordshire, north of London. Napsbury was relatively pleasant, with a garden and colony of cats, and he spent his final 15 years there in peace. While he became increasingly deluded, his erratic mood swings subsided, and he continued drawing for pleasure. His work from this period is marked by bright colours, flowers, and intricate and abstract patterns, though his primary subject remained the same. He is buried in his father's grave at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, London. One of many pieces Wain produced at the Bethlem Royal Hospital Writing in 2001, Dr Michael Fitzgerald disputes the claim of schizophrenia, saying that Wain more likely had Asperger's syndrome (AS). Of particular note, Fitzgerald indicates that while Wain's art took on a more abstract nature as he grew older, his technique and skill as a painter did not diminish, as one would expect from a person with schizophrenia. Moreover, elements of visual agnosia (the inability to recognize certain objects, even though a person can recall them if asked) are demonstrated in his painting. If Wain had visual agnosia, it might have manifested itself merely as extreme attention to detail. Various art styles used by Louis Wain over the course of his life within mental institutions. It is completely unknown what chronological order they may have been done in. Indeed, some may have been in progress while others were started and completed. Series of his paintings have commonly been used as examples in psychology textbooks to putatively show the change in his style as his psychological condition deteriorated. However, given that Wain did not date his works, it is not known if these works were created in the order usually presented. Rodney Dale, the author of Louis Wain: The Man Who Drew Cats, has criticized the belief that the paintings can be used as an example of Wain's deteriorating mental health, arguing that \\"Wain experimented with patterns and cats, and even quite late in life was still producing conventional cat pictures, perhaps 10 years after his [supposedly] 'later' productions which are patterns rather than cats.\\" In 2012 however, Dr Kevin Van Eeckelen, in an article about psychotic patterns proposed that evidence of deterioration was found in Louis Wain's earlier (narrative) work, for instance in his Louis Wain Kitten Book (1903). This analysis is based on the mimetic (girardian) view on psychosis, which focuses on the continuity between 'normality' and 'madness'. In December 2012, the psychiatrist Dr David O‚ÄôFlynn, at a gallery talk at an exhibition of \\"Kaleidoscopic Cats\\" at the Bethlem Royal Hospital Archives & Museum, proposed viewing the series as the creation of two men, \\"Louis Wain, who created them, and Walter Maclay (1902‚Äì1964), the psychiatrist who organised them into a series.\\" O'Flynn suggests Maclay saw in the series a proof of his own ideas, partly based on his 1930s experiments with art and mescaline-induced psychosis. Maclay concluded that the creative ability of people with schizophrenia deteriorated. O'Flynn says that in the experiences of those who produce outsider art, that is artists who are self-taught, and who often work outside the formal art world, the link between schizophrenia and the deterioration of artwork doesn't hold true. Looking at Wain's late work, O'Flynn sees greater experimentation and use of colour, not a deterioration. Despite the series being known to be assembled, and the pictures not dated since the 1960s, \\"their representation of something that doesn't exist, namely psychotic deterioration, has been surprisingly robust\\". The series has become \\"the Mona Lisa of asylum art\\". Legacy H. G. Wells said of him, \\"He has made the cat his own. He invented a cat style, a cat society, a whole cat world. English cats that do not look and live like Louis Wain cats are ashamed of themselves.\\" His work is now highly collectable, but forgeries are common. Wain also created a number of ceramic pieces produced by Amphora Ceramics. Dubbed the \\"futurist cat\\" the pieces were of cats and dogs in angular shapes and with geometrical markings. They are considered to be in the Cubist art style and represent Wain's artistic expression in ceramics.

His pupils included Eleanor Roosevelt, the Duke of Windsor, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, Barbara Hutton, Elizabeth Arden, Manuel L. Quezon, Johnny Mercer, and Jack Dempsey. Television evangelist D. James Kennedy and Little House on the Prairie actress Katherine MacGregor were instructors of Murray's technique. Arthur Murray was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 2007. Early life and start in dance Blueprint; \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" was one of the songs played that night. Arthur Murray was born in 1895 as Moses Teichman in Galicia, Austria-Hungary, to a family of Jewish background.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X4GD-G8V In August 1897, he was brought to America by his mother Sarah on the S.S. Friesland, and landed at Ellis Island. They settled in Ludlow Street, in the Lower East Side of Manhattan with his father, Abraham Teichmann. Murray was shy as a child and self-conscious about his tall, lanky appearance. He wanted very much to be a part of the social activities that most of his friends enjoyed, particularly the dances, but was afraid to socialize with girls. At the age of 14, Joe Feigenbaum, a friend of his whom he admired because of his popularity with girls, taught him his first dance steps. To get practice on the dance floor, Murray attended weddings in his neighborhood, where he found willing dance partners of every size and age. In 1912, at the age of 17, he taught dance at night while working as a draftsman by day. He studied under the popular dance team of Irene and Vernon Castle and went to work for them. Murray won his first dance contest at the Grand Central Palace, a public dance hall where he later became a part-time dance teacher after graduation from high school. The first prize had been a silver cup, but Murray went home with nothing to show for his win. His partner of the evening took it; it was destined for a pawnshop. This loss made an impression on Murray, and in later years every winner in his dance contests took home a prize. Between jobs as a dance instructor, Murray worked as a draftsman at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and as a reporter at the New Haven Register. He soon began teaching ballroom dancing to patients from the greater Boston, Massachusetts area, at the Devereux Mansion Physical Therapy Clinic in Marblehead, Massachusetts, before moving to Asheville, North Carolina. Murray arrived at the Battery Park Hotel November 28, 1914 at age 19 and began teaching dance there. At the outbreak of World War I, under the pressure of the anti-German sentiment prevalent in the U.S., Murray changed his last name of Teichman to a less German-sounding name. The Asheville Citizen reported in 1920 that Murray had spent six summers teaching at the Battery Park. At that time, he had also began his chain of dance studios and become a well-paid dance writer. He had also signed a deal to produce records for teaching dance for Columbia Gramophone Company. In 1919, Murray began studying business administration at the Georgia School of Technology, and taught ballroom dancing in Atlanta at the Georgian Terrace Hotel. In 1920, he organized the world's first \\"radio dance\\"; a band on the Georgia Tech campus played \\"Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech\\" and other songs, which were broadcast to a group of about 150 dancers (mostly Tech students) situated atop the roof of the Capital City Club in downtown Atlanta. Murray was inspired by a casual remark made by William Jennings Bryan one evening at the hotel: \\"... You know, I have a fine idea on how you can collect your money. Just teach 'em with the left foot and don't tell 'em what to do with the right foot until they pay up!\\" Murray thought about Bryan's remark, and devised the idea of teaching dance steps with footprint diagrams supplied by mail. Within a couple of years, over 500,000 dance courses had been sold. On April 24, 1925, Murray married his famous dance partner, Kathryn Kohnfelder (September 15, 1906, Jersey City, New Jersey ‚Äì August 6, 1999, Honolulu, Hawaii), whom he had met at a radio station in New Jersey. She had been in the audience while he was broadcasting a dance lesson. After their marriage, the mail-order business declined and the Murrays opened a dance school offering personal instruction. Their business prospered, especially in 1938 and 1939 when Arthur picked two little-known dances, the \\"Lambeth Walk\\" and \\"The Big Apple\\", and turned them into dance crazes. They were taught at hotel chains throughout the country, and the name \\"Arthur Murray\\" became a household word. There are now hundreds of Arthur Murray studios globally, with specially trained instructors, making Arthur Murray the most successful dance instructor in history. Arthur and Kathryn Murray had twin daughters, Jane and Phyllis. On June 4, 1951, Jane married Dr. Henry Heimlich who became famous for the Heimlich maneuver in 1974. Phyllis married educator Edward Irvine \\"Ted\\" McDowell. The start of Arthur Murray Studios A 1922 advertisement for Arthur Murray's dance system Arthur Murray dance class at a Municipal Band concert in Eau Claire, Wisconsin His first business was selling dance lessons by mail, using a kinetoscope. Though the idea was successful, he had problems with the business, which failed. His second business was drawing and selling \\"footprints\\" which prospective dancers placed on the floor and followed to learn dancing. This mail-order business remained successful. His third business, launched in 1925, involved selling branded dance lessons through franchising. He trained dance instructors for the Statler Hotel chain, who then went to various hotels and gave lessons; Murray kept some of the profits from each franchise. This business was expanded more widely in 1938, when an Arthur Murray dance studio franchise was opened in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Others followed. His slogan was: \\"If you can walk, we teach you how to dance\\", and the company guaranteed that the pupils learn to dance in ten lessons. After WWII, Murray's business grew with the rise of interest in Latin dance, and he regularly taught and broadcast in Cuba in the 1950s. Murray went on television with a dance program hosted by his wife, Kathryn Murray, The Arthur Murray Party, which ran from 1950 to 1960, on CBS, NBC, DuMont, ABC, and then on CBS. Among the Arthur Murray dance instructors in the early 1950s was future television evangelist D. James Kennedy, who won first prize in a nationwide dance contest. He appeared as a guest on the June 17, 1956 episode of What's My Line?. The Murrays retired in 1964; but they continued to be active for some time, appearing as guests on the Dance Fever disco show in the late 1970s. By then, there were more than 3,560 dance studios bearing his name. In 2007, about 220 Arthur Murray Studios remained in operation. Arthur Murray Dance Studios claims to be the second-oldest franchised company (the first, A&W; Restaurants, began in 1919). In 2019, Arthur Murray Studios celebrated more than 100 years of teaching dance at over 270 Arthur Murray Dance Studios in 22 countries across the globe. These range from studios in Australia (where the prestigious Crows Nest and Parramatta Dance Studios are located) all the way throughout America, Europe and Asia. Death For many years, Murray had two homes - one in Honolulu and another in Rye, New York. He died at his Honolulu home at the age of 95; according to his daughter, Phyllis Murray McDowell, pneumonia was the cause of death. He had been active and in good health until a short time before his death.

The term refers to a person who rejects or disbelieves in God as per Islam (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá‚Äé AllƒÅh) or the tenets of Islam, denying the dominion and authority of God, and is thus often translated as \\"infidel\\". The term is used in different ways in the Quran, with the most fundamental sense being \\"ungrateful\\" (toward God). Historically, while Islamic scholars agreed that a polytheist is a kafir, they sometimes disagreed on the propriety of applying the term to Muslims who committed a grave sin and to the People of the Book. The Quran distinguishes between mushrikun and People of the Book, reserving the former term for idol worshipers, although some classical commentators considered Christian doctrine to be a form of shirk. In modern times, kafir is sometimes used as a derogatory term, particularly by members of Islamist movements.Emmanuel M. Ekwo Racism and Terrorism: Aftermath of 9/11 Author House 2010 page 143 Unbelief is called kufr. Kafir is sometimes used interchangeably with mushrik (, those who commit polytheism), another type of religious wrongdoer mentioned frequently in the Quran and other Islamic works. The act of declaring another self-professed Muslim a kafir is known as takfir, a practice that has been condemned but also employed in theological and political polemics over the centuries. The person who denies the existence of a creator is called dahriya. Etymology The word ' is the active participle of the root K-F-R. As a pre-Islamic term it described farmers burying seeds in the ground. One of its applications in the Quran has also the same meaning as farmer.(ÿ£ŸéÿπŸíÿ¨Ÿéÿ®Ÿé ÿßŸÑŸíŸÉŸèŸÅŸéŸëÿßÿ±Ÿé ŸÜŸéÿ®Ÿéÿßÿ™ŸèŸáŸè) Surah 57 Al-Hadid (Iron) Ayah 20 Since farmers cover the seeds with soil while planting, the word ' implies a person who hides or covers. Ideologically, it implies a person who hides or covers the truth. Poets personify the darkness of night as k√¢fir, perhaps as a survival of pre-Islamic religious or mythological usage. The noun for disbelief, \\"blasphemy\\", \\"impiety\\" rather than the person who disbelieves, is kufr. The Hebrew words \\"kipper\\" and \\"kofer\\" share the same root as \\"kafir\\" ◊õ÷¥÷º◊§÷µ÷º◊®, or K-F-R. \\"Kipper\\" has many meanings, including to \\"deny\\", \\"atone for\\", \\"cover\\", \\"purge\\", \\"represent\\", or \\"transfer\\". The last two meanings involve \\"kofer\\", meaning \\"ransom\\". \\"Kipper\\" and \\"kofer\\" are mostly likely used together in the Jewish faith to indicate God's transfer of guilt from innocent parties using guilty parties as \\"ransom\\". Hence also Yom Kippur, literally meaning \\"Day of Atonement.\\" Usage The practice of declaring another Muslim as a kafir is takfir. Kufr (unbelief) and shirk (idolatry) are used throughout the Quran and sometimes used interchangeably by Muslims. According to Salafist scholars, Kufr is the \\"denial of the Truth\\" (truth in the form of articles of faith in Islam), and shirk means devoting \\"acts of worship to anything beside God\\" or \\"the worship of idols and other created beings\\". So a mushrik may worship other things while also \\"acknowledging God\\". In the Quran The distinction between those who believe in Islam and those who do not is an essential one in the Quran. Kafir, and its plural kuffaar, is used directly 134 times in Quran, its verbal noun \\"kufr\\" is used 37 times, and the verbal cognates of kafir are used about 250 times. By extension of the basic meaning of the root, \\"to cover\\", the term is used in the Quran in the senses of ignore/fail to acknowledge and to spurn/be ungrateful. The meaning of \\"disbelief\\", which has come to be regarded as primary, retains all of these connotations in the Quranic usage. In the Quranic discourse, the term typifies all things that are unacceptable and offensive to God. The most fundamental sense of kufr in the Quran is \\"ingratitude\\", the willful refusal to acknowledge or appreciate the benefits that God bestows on humankind, including clear signs and revealed scriptures. According to the E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913‚Äì1936, Volume 4, the term first applied in the Quran to unbelieving Meccans, who endeavoured \\"to refute and revile the Prophet\\". A waiting attitude towards the kafir was recommended at first for Muslims; later, Muslims were ordered to keep apart from unbelievers and defend themselves against their attacks and even take the offensive. Most passages in the Quran referring to unbelievers in general talk about their fate on the day of judgement and destination in hell. According to scholar Marilyn Waldman, as the Quran \\"progresses\\" (as the reader goes from the verses revealed first to later ones), the meaning behind the term kafir does not change but \\"progresses\\", i.e. \\"accumulates meaning over time\\". As the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's views of his opponents change, his use of kafir \\"undergoes a development\\". Kafir moves from being one description of Muhammad's opponents to the primary one. Later in the Quran, kafir becomes more and more connected with shirk. Finally, towards the end of the Quran, kafir begins to also signify the group of people to be fought by the mu'minƒ´n (believers). Types of unbelievers =People of the Book= The status of the Ahl al-Kitab (People of the Book), particularly Jews and Christians, with respect to the Islamic notions of unbelief is not clearcut. Charles Adams writes that the Quran reproaches the People of the Book with kufr for rejecting Muhammad's message when they should have been the first to accept it as possessors of earlier revelations, and singles out Christians for disregarding the evidence of God's unity. The Quranic verse 5:73 (\\"Certainly they disbelieve [kafara] who say: God is the third of three\\"), among other verses, has been traditionally understood in Islam as rejection of the Christian Trinity doctrine, though modern scholarship has suggested alternative interpretations. Other Quranic verses strongly deny the deity of Jesus Christ, son of Mary and reproach the people who treat Jesus as equal with God as disbelievers who will have strayed from the path of God which would result in the entrance of hellfire.Joseph, Jojo, Qur‚Äôan-Gospel Convergence: The Qur‚Äôan‚Äôs Message To Christians, Journal of Dharma, 1 (January‚ÄìMarch 2010), pp. 55-76Mazuz, Haggai (2012) Christians in the Qur æƒÅn: Some Insights Derived from the Classical Exegetic Approach, Journal of Dharma 35, 1 (January‚ÄìMarch 2010), 55-76 While the Quran does not recognize the attribute of Jesus as the Son of God or God himself, it respects Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God sent to children of Israel.Schirrmacher, Christine, The Islamic view of Christians: Qur‚Äôan and Hadith, http://www.worldevangelicals.org Some Muslim thinkers such as Mohamed Talbi have viewed the most extreme Quranic presentations of the dogmas of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus (5:19, 5:75-76, 5:119) as non-Christian formulas that were rejected by the Church. Cyril Glasse criticizes the use of kafirun [pl. of kafir] to describe Christians as \\"loose usage\\". According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, in traditional Islamic jurisprudence, ahl al-kitab are \\"usually regarded more leniently than other kuffar [pl. of kafir]...\\" and \\"in theory\\" a Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Jew or a Christian: \\"Thou unbeliever\\". Historically, People of the Book permanently residing under Islamic rule were entitled to a special status known as dhimmi, while those visiting Muslim lands received a different status known as musta'min. =Mushrikun= Mushrikun (pl. of mushrik) are those who practice shirk, which literally means \\"association\\" and refers to accepting other gods and divinities alongside the god of the Muslims - Allah (as God's \\"associates\\"). The term is often translated as polytheism. The Quran distinguishes between mushrikun and People of the Book, reserving the former term for idol worshipers, although some classical commentators considered Christian doctrine to be a form of shirk. Shirk is held to be the worst form of disbelief, and it is identified in the Quran as the only sin that God will not pardon (4:48, 4:116). Accusations of shirk have been common in religious polemics within Islam. Thus, in the early Islamic debates on free will and theodicy, Sunni theologians charged their Mu'tazila adversaries with shirk, accusing them of attributing to man creative powers comparable to those of God in both originating and executing his own actions. Mu'tazila theologians, in turn, charged the Sunnis with shirk on the grounds that under their doctrine a voluntary human act would result from an \\"association\\" between God, who creates the act, and the individual who appropriates it by carrying it out. In classical jurisprudence, Islamic religious tolerance applied only to the People of the Book, while mushrikun, based on the Sword Verse, faced a choice between conversion to Islam and fight to the death, which may be substituted by enslavement. In practice, the designation of People of the Book and the dhimmi status was extended even to non-monotheistic religions of conquered peoples, such as Hinduism. Following destruction of major Hindu temples during the Muslim conquests in South Asia, Hindus and Muslims on the subcontinent came to share a number of popular religious practices and beliefs, such as veneration of Sufi saints and worship at Sufi dargahs, although Hindus may worship at Hindu shrines also. =Sinners= Whether a Muslim could commit a sin great enough to become a kafir was disputed by jurists in the early centuries of Islam. The most tolerant view (that of the Murji'ah) was that even those who had committed a major sin (kabira) were still believers and \\"their fate was left to God\\". The most strict view (that of Kharidji Ibadis, descended from the Kharijites) was that every Muslim who dies having not repented of his sins was considered a kafir. In between these two positions, the Mu'tazila believed that there was a status between believer and unbeliever called \\"rejected\\" or fasiq. =Takfir= The Kharijites view that the self- proclaimed Muslim who had sinned and \\"failed to repent had ipso facto excluded himself from the community, and was hence a kafir\\" (a practice known as takfir) was considered so extreme by the Sunni majority that they in turn declared the Kharijites kafir, following the hadith that declared, \\"If a Muslim charges a fellow Muslim with kufr, he is himself a kafir if the accusation should prove untrue\\". Nevertheless, in Islamic theological polemics kafir was \\"a frequent term for the Muslim protagonist\\" holding the opposite view, according to Brill's Islamic Encyclopedia. Present day Muslims who make interpretations that differ from what others believe are declared kafirs, fatwas (edicts by Islamic religious leaders) are issued ordering Muslims to kill them and some such people have been killed also. =Murtad= Another group that are \\"distinguished from the mass of kafirun\\" are the murtad, or apostate ex-Muslims, who are considered renegades and traitors. Their traditional punishment is death, even, according to some scholars, if they recant their abandonment of Islam. = Mu'ahid / dhimmi = Non-Muslims living under the protection of an Islamic state.‚Äúmu øƒÅhad‚Äù, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Glossary and Index of Terms, Edited by: P.J.

Consulted online on 06 August 2018 First published online: 2012 First print edition: , 1960-2007 Types of disbelief Muslim belief/doctrine is often summarized in \\"the Six Articles of Faith\\", (the first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an 2:285). # God # His angels # His Messengers # His Revealed Books, # The Day of Resurrection # Al-Qadar, Divine Preordainments, i.e. whatever God has ordained must come to pass According to the Salafi scholar Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali, \\"kufr is basically disbelief in any of the articles of faith. He also lists several different types of major disbelief, (disbelief so severe it excludes those who practice it completely from the fold of Islam): # Kufr-at-Takdhib: disbelief in divine truth or the denial of any of the articles of Faith (quran 39:32) # Kufr-al- iba wat-takabbur ma'at-Tasdiq: refusing to submit to God's Commandments after conviction of their truth (quran 2:34) # Kufr-ash-Shakk waz-Zann: doubting or lacking conviction in the six articles of Faith. (quran 18:35‚Äì38) # Kufr- al-I'raadh: turning away from the truth knowingly or deviating from the obvious signs which God has revealed. (quran 46:3) # Kufr-an-Nifaaq: hypocritical disbelief (quran 63:2‚Äì3) Minor disbelief or Kufran-Ni'mah indicates \\"ungratefulness of God's Blessings or Favours\\". According to another source, a paraphrase of the Tafsir by Ibn Kathir, there are eight kinds of Al- Kufr al-Akbar (major unbelief), some are the same as those described by Al- Hilali (Kufr-al-I'rad, Kufr-an-Nifaaq) and some different. # Kufrul-'Inaad: Disbelief out of stubbornness. This applies to someone who knows the Truth and admits to knowing the Truth, and knowing it with his tongue, but refuses to accept it and refrains from making a declaration. God says: Throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever. # Kufrul-Inkaar: Disbelief out of denial. This applies to someone who denies with both heart and tongue. God says: They recognize the favors of God, yet they deny them. Most of them are disbelievers. # Kufrul-Juhood: Disbelief out of rejection. This applies to someone who acknowledges the truth in his heart, but rejects it with his tongue. This type of kufr is applicable to those who call themselves Muslims but who reject any necessary and accepted norms of Islam such as Salaat and Zakat. God says: They denied them (our signs) even though their hearts believed in them, out of spite and arrogance. # Kufrul-Nifaaq: Disbelief out of hypocrisy. This applies to someone who pretends to be a believer but conceals his disbelief. Such a person is called a munafiq or hypocrite. God says: Verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of Hell. You will find no one to help them. # Kufrul-Kurh: Disbelief out of detesting any of God's commands. God says: Perdition (destruction) has been consigned to those who disbelieve and He will render their actions void. This is because they are averse to that which God has revealed so He has made their actions fruitless. # Kufrul-Istihzaha: Disbelief due to mockery and derision. God says: Say: Was it at God, His signs and His apostles that you were mocking? Make no excuses. You have disbelieved after you have believed. # Kufrul-I'raadh: Disbelief due to avoidance. This applies to those who turn away and avoid the truth. God says: And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of his Lord's signs but then turns away from them. Then he forgets what he has sent forward (for the Day of Judgement). # Kufrul-Istibdaal: Disbelief because of trying to substitute God's Laws with man-made laws. God says: Or have they partners with God who have instituted for them a religion that God has not allowed. God says: Say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely (that) is lawful and this is forbidden so as to invent a lie against God. Verily, those who invent a lie against God will never prosper. =Ignorance= In Islam, jahiliyyah (\\"ignorance\\") refers to the time of Arabia before Islam. History of usage =In proper sense= When the Islamic empire expanded, the word \\"kafir\\" was used broadly for all pagans and anyone who disbelieved in Islam. Historically, the attitude toward unbelievers in Islam was determined more by socio-political conditions than by religious doctrine. A tolerance toward unbelievers \\"impossible to imagine in contemporary Christendom\\" prevailed even to the time of the Crusades, particularly with respect to the People of the Book. However, animosity was nourished by repeated wars with unbelievers, and warfare between Safavid Persia and Ottoman Turkey brought about application of the term kafir even to Persians in Turkish fatwas. During the era of European colonialism, the political decline of Islam impeded organized state action against the pressure from Western nations, and the resulting feeling of impotence contributed to a rise of hatred against unbelievers and its periodic manifestations, such as massacres. However, there was extensive religious violence in India between Muslims and non-Muslims during the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire (before the political decline of Islam).Holt et al., The Cambridge History of Islam - The Indian sub-continent, south-east Asia, Africa and the Muslim west, Scott Levi (2002), Hindu beyond Hindu Kush: Indians in Central Asian Slave Trade, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol 12, Part 3, pp. 281‚Äì83 In their memoirs on Muslim invasions, enslavement and plunder of this period, many Muslim historians in South Asia used the term Kafir for Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains.Elliot and Dowson, Tarikh-i Mubarak-Shahi, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians ‚Äì The Muhammadan Period, Vol 4, Trubner London, p. 273 Elliot and Dowson, Tabakat-i-Nasiri, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians ‚Äì The Muhammadan Period, Vol 2, Trubner London, pp. 347‚Äì67Elliot and Dowson, Tarikh-i Mubarak-Shahi, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians ‚Äì The Muhammadan Period, Vol 4, Trubner London, pp. 68‚Äì69 Raziuddin Aquil states that \\"non-Muslims were often condemned as kafirs, in medieval Indian Islamic literature, including court chronicles, Sufi texts and literary compositions\\" and fatwas were issued that justified persecution of the non-Muslims.Raziuddin Aquil (2008), On Islam and Kufr in the Delhi Sultanate, in Rethinking a Millennium: Perspectives on Indian History (Editor: Rajat Datta), , Chapter 7, pp. 168‚Äì85 Relations between Jews and Muslims in the Arab world and use of the word \\"kafir\\" were equally as complex, and over the last century, issues regarding \\"kafir\\" have arisen over the conflict in Israel and Palestine. Calling the Jews of Israel, \\"the usurping kafir\\", Yasser Arafat turned on the Muslim resistance and \\"allegedly set a precedent for preventing Muslims from mobilizing against 'aggressor disbelievers' in other Muslim lands, and enabled 'the cowardly, alien kafir' to achieve new levels of intervention in Muslim affairs.\\" In 2019, Nahdlatul Ulama, the largest independent Islamic organization in the world based in Indonesia, issued a proclamation urging Muslims to refrain from using the theologically violent word kafir to refer to non-Muslims, in the interest of promoting religious tolerance and co-existence.  Muhammad's parents  A hadith in which Muhammad states that his father, Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib, was in Hell, has become a source of disagreement among Islamic scholars about the status of Muhammad's parents. Over the centuries, Sunni scholars have dismissed this hadith despite its appearance in the authoritative Sahih Muslim collection. It passed through a single chain of transmission for three generations, so that its authenticity was not considered certain enough to supersede a theological consensus which stated that people who died before a prophetic message reached them‚Äîas Muhammad's father had done‚Äîcould not be held accountable for not embracing it. Shia Muslim scholars likewise consider Muhammad's parents to be in Paradise.alhassanain. The Nasibis Kufr Fatwa - that the Prophet (s)'sparents were Kaafir (God forbid)Shia Pen. Chapter Four ‚Äì The pure monotheistic lineage of Prophets and Imams (as) In contrast, the Salafi website IslamQA.info, founded by the Saudi Arabian Salafi scholar Muhammad Al-Munajjid, argues that Islamic tradition teaches that Muhammad's parents were kuffƒÅr (\\"disbelievers\\") who are in Hell. =Other uses= The Kafirs of Natal and the Zulu Country by Rev. Joseph Shooter By the 15th century, the word Kaffir was used by Muslims in Africa to refer to the non-Muslim African natives. Many of those kufari were enslaved and sold by their Muslims captors to European and Asian merchants, mainly from Portugal, who by that time had established trading outposts along the coast of West Africa. These European traders adopted that Arabic word and its derivatives. Some of the earliest records of European usage of the word can be found in The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation (1589) by Richard Hakluyt. In volume 4, Hakluyt writes: \\"calling them Cafars and Gawars, which is, infidels or disbelievers. Volume 9 refers to the slaves (slaves called Cafari) and inhabitants of Ethiopia (and they use to go in small shippes, and trade with the Cafars) by two different but similar names. The word is also used in reference to the coast of Africa as land of Cafraria. The 16th century explorer Leo Africanus described the Cafri as \\"negroes\\", and one of five principal population groups in Africa. He identified their geographical heartland as being located in remote southern Africa, an area which he designated as Cafraria. By the late 19th century the word was in use in English-language newspapers and books. One of the Union-Castle Line ships operating off the South African coast was named SS Kafir. In the early twentieth century, in his book The Essential Kafir, Dudley Kidd writes that the word \\"kafir\\" had come to be used for all dark-skinned South African tribes. Thus, in many parts of South Africa, \\"kafir\\" became synonymous with the word, \\"native\\". Currently in South Africa, however, the word kaffir is regarded as a racial slur, applied pejoratively or offensively to blacks. The song \\"Kafir\\" by American technical death metal band Nile from their sixth album Those Whom the Gods Detest uses as subject matter the violent attitudes that Muslim extremists have toward Kafirs. The Nuristani people were formally known as Kaffirs of Kafiristan before the Afghan Islamization of the region. The Kalash people located in the Hindu Kush mountain range south west of Chitral are known as Kafirs by the Muslim population of Chitral. In modern Spanish, the word cafre, derived from the Arabic kafir by way of Portuguese, also means \\"uncouth\\" or \\"savage\\".

Health care, health-care, or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals. Dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, medicine, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health. Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. Providing health care services means \\"the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes\\". Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographic barriers (such as additional transportation costs, the possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services), and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers, poor health literacy, low income). Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates). Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce, reliable information on which to base decisions and policies, and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies. An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy, development, and industrialization. Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world. An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first disease in human history to be completely eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.World Health Organization. Anniversary of smallpox eradication. Geneva, 18 June 2010. Delivery Primary care may be provided in community health centers. The delivery of modern health care depends on groups of trained professionals and paraprofessionals coming together as interdisciplinary teams.United States Department of Labor. Employment and Training Administration: Health care . Retrieved June 24, 2011. This includes professionals in medicine, psychology, physiotherapy, nursing, dentistry, midwifery and allied health, along with many others such as public health practitioners, community health workers and assistive personnel, who systematically provide personal and population-based preventive, curative and rehabilitative care services. While the definitions of the various types of health care vary depending on the different cultural, political, organizational and disciplinary perspectives, there appears to be some consensus that primary care constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process and may also include the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care.Thomas-MacLean R et al. No Cookie-Cutter Response: Conceptualizing Primary Health Care. Retrieved 26 August 2014. Health care can be defined as either public or private. The emergency room is often a frontline venue for the delivery of primary medical care. =Primary care= Hospital train \\"Therapist Matvei Mudrov\\" in Khabarovsk, Russia Primary care refers to the work of health professionals who act as a first point of consultation for all patients within the health care system.World Health Organization. Definition of Terms. Retrieved 26 August 2014. Such a professional would usually be a primary care physician, such as a general practitioner or family physician. Another professional would be a licensed independent practitioner such as a physiotherapist, or a non-physician primary care provider such as a physician assistant or nurse practitioner. Depending on the locality, health system organization the patient may see another health care professional first, such as a pharmacist or nurse. Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may be referred for secondary or tertiary care. Primary care is often used as the term for the health care services that play a role in the local community. It can be provided in different settings, such as Urgent care centers which provide same day appointments or services on a walk-in basis. Primary care involves the widest scope of health care, including all ages of patients, patients of all socioeconomic and geographic origins, patients seeking to maintain optimal health, and patients with all types of acute and chronic physical, mental and social health issues, including multiple chronic diseases. Consequently, a primary care practitioner must possess a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas. Continuity is a key characteristic of primary care, as patients usually prefer to consult the same practitioner for routine check-ups and preventive care, health education, and every time they require an initial consultation about a new health problem. The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) is a standardized tool for understanding and analyzing information on interventions in primary care based on the reason for the patient's visit.World Health Organization. International Classification of Primary Care, Second edition (ICPC-2). Geneva. Accessed 24 June 2011. Common chronic illnesses usually treated in primary care may include, for example: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, COPD, depression and anxiety, back pain, arthritis or thyroid dysfunction. Primary care also includes many basic maternal and child health care services, such as family planning services and vaccinations. In the United States, the 2013 National Health Interview Survey found that skin disorders (42.7%), osteoarthritis and joint disorders (33.6%), back problems (23.9%), disorders of lipid metabolism (22.4%), and upper respiratory tract disease (22.1%, excluding asthma) were the most common reasons for accessing a physician. In the United States, primary care physicians have begun to deliver primary care outside of the managed care (insurance-billing) system through direct primary care which is a subset of the more familiar concierge medicine. Physicians in this model bill patients directly for services, either on a pre-paid monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, or bill for each service in the office. Examples of direct primary care practices include Foundation Health in Colorado and Qliance in Washington. In context of global population aging, with increasing numbers of older adults at greater risk of chronic non-communicable diseases, rapidly increasing demand for primary care services is expected in both developed and developing countries.World Health Organization. Aging and life course: Our aging world. Geneva. Accessed 24 June 2011.Simmons J. Primary Care Needs New Innovations to Meet Growing Demands. HealthLeaders Media, May 27, 2009. The World Health Organization attributes the provision of essential primary care as an integral component of an inclusive primary health care strategy. =Secondary care= Secondary care includes acute care: necessary treatment for a short period of time for a brief but serious illness, injury, or other health condition. This care is often found in a hospital emergency department. Secondary care also includes skilled attendance during childbirth, intensive care, and medical imaging services. The term \\"secondary care\\" is sometimes used synonymously with \\"hospital care\\". However, many secondary care providers, such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, most dental specialties or physiotherapists, do not necessarily work in hospitals. Some primary care services are delivered within hospitals. Depending on the organization and policies of the national health system, patients may be required to see a primary care provider for a referral before they can access secondary care. In countries which operate under a mixed market health care system, some physicians limit their practice to secondary care by requiring patients to see a primary care provider first. This restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private or group health insurance plans. In other cases, medical specialists may see patients without a referral, and patients may decide whether self-referral is preferred. In other countries patient self-referral to a medical specialist for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician (either a primary care physician or another specialist) is considered necessary, regardless of whether the funding is from private insurance schemes or national health insurance. Allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and dietitians, also generally work in secondary care, accessed through either patient self-referral or through physician referral. =Tertiary care= The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, United Kingdom is a specialist neurological hospital. Tertiary care is specialized consultative health care, usually for inpatients and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced medical investigation and treatment, such as a tertiary referral hospital.Johns Hopkins Medicine. Patient Care: Tertiary Care Definition. Accessed 27 June 2011. Examples of tertiary care services are cancer management, neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, plastic surgery, treatment for severe burns, advanced neonatology services, palliative, and other complex medical and surgical interventions.Emory University. School of Medicine. Accessed 27 June 2011. = Quaternary care = The term quaternary care is sometimes used as an extension of tertiary care in reference to advanced levels of medicine which are highly specialized and not widely accessed. Experimental medicine and some types of uncommon diagnostic or surgical procedures are considered quaternary care. These services are usually only offered in a limited number of regional or national health care centers.Alberta Physician Link. Levels of Care. Retrieved 26 August 2014. =Home and community care= Many types of health care interventions are delivered outside of health facilities. They include many interventions of public health interest, such as food safety surveillance, distribution of condoms and needle-exchange programs for the prevention of transmissible diseases. They also include the services of professionals in residential and community settings in support of self care, home care, long-term care, assisted living, treatment for substance use disorders among other types of health and social care services. Community rehabilitation services can assist with mobility and independence after loss of limbs or loss of function. This can include prostheses, orthotics, or wheelchairs. Many countries, especially in the west, are dealing with aging populations, so one of the priorities of the health care system is to help seniors live full, independent lives in the comfort of their own homes. There is an entire section of health care geared to providing seniors with help in day-to-day activities at home such as transportation to and from doctor's appointments along with many other activities that are essential for their health and well-being. Although they provide home care for older adults in cooperation, family members and care workers may harbor diverging attitudes and values towards their joint efforts. This state of affairs presents a challenge for the design of ICT (information and communication technology) for home care. Because statistics show that over 80 million Americans have taken time off of their primary employment to care for a loved one, many countries have begun offering programs such as Consumer Directed Personal Assistant Program to allow family members to take care of their loved ones without giving up their entire income. With obesity in children rapidly becoming a major concern, health services often set up programs in schools aimed at educating children about nutritional eating habits, making physical education a requirement and teaching young adolescents to have positive self-image. =Ratings= Health care ratings are ratings or evaluations of health care used to evaluate the process of care and health care structures and/or outcomes of health care services. This information is translated into report cards that are generated by quality organizations, nonprofit, consumer groups and media. This evaluation of quality is based on measures of: * hospital quality * health plan quality * physician quality * quality for other health professionals * of patient experience Related sectors Health care extends beyond the delivery of services to patients, encompassing many related sectors, and is set within a bigger picture of financing and governance structures. =Health system= A health system, also sometimes referred to as health care system or healthcare system is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to populations in need. =Health care industry= The health care industry incorporates several sectors that are dedicated to providing health care services and products. As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations' International Standard Industrial Classification categorizes health care as generally consisting of hospital activities, medical and dental practice activities, and \\"other human health activities.\\" The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, patient advocates or other allied health professions. In addition, according to industry and market classifications, such as the Global Industry Classification Standard and the Industry Classification Benchmark, health care includes many categories of medical equipment, instruments and services including biotechnology, diagnostic laboratories and substances, drug manufacturing and delivery. For example, pharmaceuticals and other medical devices are the leading high technology exports of Europe and the United States. The United States dominates the biopharmaceutical field, accounting for three-quarters of the world's biotechnology revenues. =Health care research= The quantity and quality of many health care interventions are improved through the results of science, such as advanced through the medical model of health which focuses on the eradication of illness through diagnosis and effective treatment. Many important advances have been made through health research, biomedical research and pharmaceutical research, which form the basis for evidence-based medicine and evidence-based practice in health care delivery. Health care research frequently engages directly with patients, and as such issues for who to engage and how to engage with them become important to consider when seeking to actively include them in studies. While single best practice does not exist, the results of a systematic review on patient engagement suggest that research methods for patient selection need to account for both patient availability and willingness to engage. Health services research can lead to greater efficiency and equitable delivery of health care interventions, as advanced through the social model of health and disability, which emphasizes the societal changes that can be made to make populations healthier. Results from health services research often form the basis of evidence-based policy in health care systems. Health services research is also aided by initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence for the development of systems of health assessment that are clinically useful, timely, sensitive to change, culturally sensitive, low-burden, low-cost, built into standard procedures, and involve the patient. =Health care financing= There are generally five primary methods of funding health care systems:World Health Organization. \\"Regional Overview of Social Health Insurance in South-East Asia.' Retrieved December 02, 2014. # general taxation to the state, county or municipality # social health insurance # voluntary or private health insurance # out-of-pocket payments # donations to health charities In most countries, there is a mix of all five models, but this varies across countries and over time within countries. Aside from financing mechanisms, an important question should always be how much to spend on healthcare. For the purposes of comparison, this is often expressed as the percentage of GDP spent on healthcare. In OECD countries for every extra $1000 spent on healthcare, life expectancy falls by 0.4 years. A similar correlation is seen from analysis carried out each year by Bloomberg. Clearly this kind of analysis is flawed in that life expectancy is only one measure of a health system's performance, but equally, the notion that more funding is better is not supported. In 2011, the health care industry consumed an average of 9.3 percent of the GDP or US$ 3,322 (PPP- adjusted) per capita across the 34 members of OECD countries. The US (17.7%, or US$ PPP 8,508), the Netherlands (11.9%, 5,099), France (11.6%, 4,118), Germany (11.3%, 4,495), Canada (11.2%, 5669), and Switzerland (11%, 5,634) were the top spenders, however life expectancy in total population at birth was highest in Switzerland (82.8 years), Japan and Italy (82.7), Spain and Iceland (82.4), France (82.2) and Australia (82.0), while OECD's average exceeds 80 years for the first time ever in 2011: 80.1 years, a gain of 10 years since 1970. The US (78.7 years) ranges only on place 26 among the 34 OECD member countries, but has the highest costs by far. All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except the US and Mexico. (see also international comparisons.) In the United States, where around 18% of GDP is spent on health care, the Commonwealth Fund analysis of spend and quality shows a clear correlation between worse quality and higher spending. =Administration and regulation= The management and administration of health care is vital to the delivery of health care services. In particular, the practice of health professionals and operation of health care institutions is typically regulated by national or state/provincial authorities through appropriate regulatory bodies for purposes of quality assurance.World Health Organization, 2003.

Robertson is best known for his work as lead guitarist and primary songwriter for The Band, and for his career as a solo recording artist. Robertson's work with The Band was instrumental in creating the Americana music genre. Robertson has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Canadian Music Hall of Fame as a member of The Band, and has been inducted to Canada's Walk of Fame, both with The Band and on his own. He is ranked 59th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitarists. As a songwriter, Robertson is credited for writing \\"The Weight\\", \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\", \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\", \\"Broken Arrow\\", \\"Somewhere Down the Crazy River\\", and many others. He has been inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Songwriters. As a film soundtrack producer and composer, Robertson is known for his collaborations with director Martin Scorsese, which began with the rockumentary film The Last Waltz (1978), and continued through a number of dramatic films, including Raging Bull (1980), Casino (1995), The Departed (2006), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) and The Irishman (2019). He has worked on many other soundtracks for film and television. Early life Robertson was born Jaime Royal Klegerman on July 5, 1943. He was an only child. His mother was Rosemarie Dolly Chrysler, born February 6, 1922, a Cayuga and Mohawk woman who was raised on the Six Nations Reserve southwest of Toronto, Ontario. Chrysler lived with an aunt in the Cabbagetown neighbourhood and worked at a jewellery plating factory. It was at the factory that she met James Patrick Robertson. They married in 1942. Rosemarie and James Robertson continued to work at the factory where they met, and the family lived in several homes in different Toronto neighbourhoods when Robbie Robertson was a child. He often travelled with his mother to the Six Nations Reserve to visit their family. It was here that Robertson was mentored in playing guitar by family members, in particular his older cousin Herb Myke. He became a fan of rock 'n' roll and R&B; through the radio, listening to disc jockey George \\"Hound Dog\\" Lorenz play rock 'n' roll on WKBW in Buffalo, New York, and staying up at night to listen to disc jockey John R.'s all-night blues show on WLAC, a clear-channel station in Nashville, Tennessee. When Robertson was in his early teens, his mother separated from James Robertson. She revealed to Robertson that his biological father was a Jewish professional gambler named Alexander David Klegerman. Klegerman was killed in a hit-and-run accident while changing a tire on the Queen Elizabeth Way; this incident occurred while James Robertson was stationed in Newfoundland with the Canadian Army before Rosemarie married him. Career When Robertson was 14, he worked two brief summer jobs in the travelling carnival circuit, first for a few days in a suburb of Toronto, and later as an assistant at a freak show for three weeks during the Canadian National Exhibition. These experiences later led to the Band song \\"Life is a Carnival\\" and to the 1980 movie Carny, which he would produce and in which he was a lead actor. The first band Robertson joined was Little Caesar and the Consuls, formed in 1956 by pianist/vocalist Bruce Morshead and guitarist Gene MacLellan. He stayed with the group for almost a year, playing popular songs of the day at local teen dances before forming Robbie and the Rhythm Chords in 1957 with his friend Pete \\"Thumper\\" Traynor (who would later found Traynor Amplifiers). They changed the name to Robbie and the Robots after they watched the film Forbidden Planet and took a liking to the film's character Robby the Robot. Traynor customized Robertson's guitar for the Robots, fitting it with antennae and wires to give it a space age look. Traynor and Robertson then joined with pianist Scott Cushnie and became The Suedes. It was at a Suedes show on October 5, 1959, when they played CHUM Radio's Hif Fi Club on Toronto's Merton Street, where Ronnie Hawkins first became aware of the group, and was impressed enough to join them for a few numbers. For Robbie's early-band chronology, see Chapter two \\"Who Do You Love: Ronnie Hawkins & The Hawks\\" in Jason Schneider's book \\"Whispering Pines: The Northern Roots of American Music... From Hank Snow to The Band\\" ECW Press Toronto 2009 First Edition hardcover =With Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks= Robertson began shadowing Hawkins, and after the Suedes opened for the Arkansas-based rockabilly group Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks at Dixie Arena, Hawkins hired Robertson for the Hawks' road crew. Hawkins recorded two songs co-credited to Robertson, \\"Hey Baba Lou\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\", for his album Mr. Dynamo (1959), and brought Robertson to the Brill Building in New York City to help him choose songs for the rest of the album. Ronnie Hawkins performing live in 2014. Hawkins hired Robertson as a member of his backup band the Hawks in 1960. Hawkins hired pianist Scott Cushnie away from the Suedes, and took him on tour with Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks in Arkansas. When the Hawks' bass player left the group, Cushnie recommended that Hawkins hire Robertson to replace him on bass. Hawkins invited him to come to Arkansas, and then flew to the UK to perform on television there, leaving Robertson in Arkansas with the Hawks. Meanwhile, Robertson spent his living allowance on records and practised intensively each day. Upon returning, Hawkins hired him to play bass. Cushnie left the band a few months after joining them. and Robertson soon switched over from bass to playing lead guitar for the Hawks. Robertson soon developed into a guitar virtuoso.Howard Sounes. Down the Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan Doubleday (2001), pg. 189; Roy Buchanan, a few years older than Robertson, was briefly a member of the Hawks and became an important influence on Robertson's guitar style: \\"Standing next to Buchanan on stage for several months, Robertson was able to absorb Buchanan‚Äôs deft manipulations with his volume speed dial, his tendency to bend multiple strings for steel guitar-like effect, his rapid sweep picking and his passion for bending past the root and fifth notes during solo flights.\\"How to Play Guitar Like The Band's Robbie Robertson, Gibson.com Aug 26, 2011; accessed September 2, 2017. Drummer/singer Levon Helm was already a member of the Hawks and soon became close friends with Robertson. The Hawks continued to tour the United States and Canada, adding Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and Garth Hudson to the Hawks lineup in 1961. This lineup, which later became The Band, toured with Hawkins throughout 1962 and into 1963. They also hired the saxophone player Jerry Penfound and later Bruce Bruno, who were both with the group in their intermediary period as Levon and the Hawks. Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks cut sessions for Roulette Records throughout 1961‚Äì1963, all of which Robertson appeared on. The sessions included three singles: \\"Come Love\\" b/w \\"I Feel Good\\" (Roulette 4400 1961); \\"Who Do You Love\\" b/w \\"Bo Diddley\\" (Roulette 4483 1963); and \\"There's A Screw Loose\\" b/w \\"High Blood Pressure\\" (Roulette 4502 1963). =With Levon and the Hawks= The Hawks left Ronnie Hawkins at the beginning of 1964 to go on their own. The members of the Hawks were losing interest in playing in the rockabilly style in favour of playing blues and soul music. In early 1964, the group approached agent Harold Kudlets about representing them, which he agreed to do, booking them a years' worth of shows in the same circuits as they had been in before with Ronnie Hawkins. Originally dubbed The Levon Helm Sextet, the group included all of the future members of The Band, plus Jerry Penfound on saxophone and Bob Bruno on vocals. Bruno left in May 1964, and at that time the group changed their name to Levon and the Hawks. Penfound stayed with the group until 1965. Kudlets kept the group busy performing throughout 1964 and into 1965, finally booking them into two lengthy summer engagements at the popular nightclub Tony Mart's in Somers Point, New Jersey, where they played six nights a week alongside Conway Twitty and other acts. The members of Levon and the Hawks befriended blues artist John P. Hammond while he was performing in Toronto in 1964. Later in the year, the group agreed to work on Hammond's album So Many Roads (released in 1965) at the same time that they were playing the Peppermint Lounge in New York City. Robertson played guitar throughout the album, and was billed \\"Jaime R. Robertson\\" in the album's credits. Levon and the Hawks cut a single \\"Uh Uh Uh\\" b/w \\"Leave Me Alone\\" under the name the Canadian Squires in March 1965. Both songs were written by Robertson. The single was recorded in New York and released on Apex Records in the United States and on Ware Records in Canada. As Levon and the Hawks, the group cut an afternoon session for Atco Records later in 1965, which yielded two singles, \\"The Stones That I Throw\\" b/w \\"He Don't Love You\\" (Atco 6383) and \\"Go, Go, Liza Jane\\" b/w \\"He Don't Love You\\" (Atco 6625). Robertson also wrote all three of the tracks on Levon and the Hawks' Atco singles. =With Bob Dylan and the Hawks= 1965‚Äì1966 World Tour Toward the end of Levon and the Hawks' second engagement at Tony Mart's in New Jersey, in August 1965, Robertson received a call from Albert Grossman Management requesting a meeting with Bob Dylan. The group had been recommended to both Grossman and to Dylan by Mary Martin, one of Grossman's employees, who was originally from Toronto and was a friend of the band. Dylan was also aware of the group through his friend John Hammond, whose album So Many Roads members of the Hawks had performed on. Robertson agreed to meet with Dylan. Initially, Dylan intended to just hire Robertson as the guitarist for his backing group. Robertson refused the offer, but did agree to play two shows with Dylan, one at the Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in Forest Hills, New York on August 28, and one at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on September 3. Robertson suggested they use Levon Helm on drums for the shows. Robertson and Helm performed in Dylan's backing band along with Harvey Brooks and Al Kooper for both shows. The first at Forest Hills received a predominantly hostile response, but the second in Los Angeles was received slightly more favourably. Dylan flew up to Toronto and rehearsed with Levon and the Hawks September 15‚Äì17, as Levon and the Hawks finished an engagement there, and hired the full band for his upcoming tour. Bob Dylan and the Hawks toured the United States throughout October‚ÄìDecember 1965, with each show consisting of two sets: an acoustic show just featuring Dylan on guitar and harmonica, and an electric set featuring Dylan backed by the Hawks. The tours were largely met with a hostile reaction from fans who knew Dylan as a prominent figure in the American folk music revival, perceiving his move into rock music as a betrayal. Helm left the group after their November 28 performance in Washington, D.C. Session drummer Bobby Gregg replaced Helm for the December dates, and Sandy Konikoff was brought in to replace Gregg in January 1966. Dylan and the Hawks played more dates in the continental United States in February‚ÄìMarch 1966 of the 1966 world tour, and then played Hawaii, Australia, Europe, and the UK and Ireland, from April 9 ‚Äì May 27. Drummer Sandy Konikoff left after the Pacific Northwest dates in March, and Mickey Jones replaced him, staying with the group for the remainder of the tour. The Australian and European legs of the tour received a particularly harsh response from disgruntled folk fans, and the May 17 Manchester Free Trade Hall show, best known for an angry audience member audibly yelling \\"Judas!\\" at Dylan, became a frequently-bootlegged live show from the tour; it was eventually released officially as The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert. The European leg of the tour was filmed by documentary filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker, and the footage was edited into the documentary Eat the Document. On November 30, 1965, Dylan cut a studio session with members of the Hawks, which yielded the non-LP single \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\" Dylan completed the Blonde on Blonde album in Nashville in mid-February 1966, employing Robertson for one of these sessions, which took place on February 14. The \\"Basement Tapes\\" period Basement Tapes were recorded, and the music from the Band album Music From Big Pink was written. On July 29, 1966, Dylan sustained an injured neck from a motorcycle accident, and retreated to a quiet domestic life with his new wife and child in upstate New York. Some of the members of the Hawks were living at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City at the time, and were kept on a weekly retainer by Dylan's management. In February 1967, Dylan invited the members of the Hawks to come up to Woodstock, New York to work on music. Robertson had met a French- Canadian girl on the Paris stop of Dylan's 1966 world tour, and the two moved into a house in the Woodstock area. The remaining three members of the Hawks rented a house near West Saugerties, New York that would later be dubbed \\"Big Pink\\" because of its pink exterior. Dylan and the members of the Hawks worked together at the \\"Big Pink\\" house every day to rehearse and generate ideas for new songs, many of which they recorded in \\"Big Pink\\"'s makeshift basement studio. The recordings were made between the late spring and autumn of 1967. Previous Hawks member Levon Helm returned to the group in August 1967. By this time, Robertson's guitar style had evolved to be more supportive of the song and less devoted to displaying speed and virtuosity. In time, word about these sessions began to circulate, and in 1968, Rolling Stone magazine co-founder Jann Wenner brought attention to these tracks in an article entitled \\"Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released\\". In 1969, a bootleg album with a plain white cover compiled by two incognito music industry insiders featured a collection of seven tracks from these sessions. The album, which became known as The Great White Wonder, began to appear in independent record stores and receive radio airplay. This album became a runaway success and helped to launch the bootleg recording industry. In 1975, Robertson would produce an official compilation, The Basement Tapes, which included a selection of tracks from the sessions. An exhaustive collection of all 138 extant recordings was released in 2014 as The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete. =With the Band= 1967‚Äì1968 (Music From Big Pink) Robbie Robertson performing live with the Band In late 1967, Dylan left to record his next album, John Wesley Harding (1967). After recording the basic tracks, Dylan asked Robertson and Garth Hudson about playing on the album to fill out the sound. However, when Robertson heard the tracks, he liked the starkness of the sound and recommended that Dylan leave the songs as they were. Dylan worked with the members of the Hawks once again when they appeared as his backup band at two Woody Guthrie memorial concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York City in January 1968. Three of these performances were later released by Columbia Records on the LP A Tribute to Woody Guthrie, Vol. 1 (1972). Over the course of the \\"Basement Tapes\\" period, the group had developed a sound of their own, and Grossman went to Los Angeles to shop the group to a major label, securing a contract with Capitol Records. The group went to New York to begin recording songs with music producer John Simon. Capitol brought the group to Los Angeles to finish the album. The resulting album, Music From Big Pink, was released in August 1968. Robertson wrote four of the songs on Music From Big Pink, including \\"The Weight\\", \\"Chest Fever\\", \\"Caledonia Mission,\\" and \\"To Kingdom Come\\". Robertson is listed in the songwriting credits as \\"J.R. Robertson\\". Robertson sang lead vocal on the track \\"To Kingdom Come\\"; he would not sing on another Band song released to the public until \\"Knockin' Lost John\\" on 1977's Islands. Two of Robertson's compositions for the album, \\"The Weight\\" and \\"Chest Fever\\", would become important touchstones in the group's career. \\"The Weight\\" was influenced by the films of director Luis Bu√±uel, in particular Nazar√≠n (1959) and Viridiana (1961), and reflects the recurring theme in Bu√±uel's films about the impossibility of sainthood. The song portrays an individual who attempts to take a saintly pilgrimage, and becomes mired down with requests from other people to do favors for them along the way. The mention of \\"Nazareth\\" at the beginning of the song refers to Nazareth, Pennsylvania, where the C. F. Martin & Company guitar manufacturer is located; it was inspired by Robertson seeing the word \\"Nazareth\\" in the hole of his Martin guitar. Although \\"The Weight\\" reached #21 on the British radio charts, it did not fare as well on the American charts, initially stalling at #63. However, the song gained traction due to more successful covers by Jackie DeShannon (US #55, 1968), Aretha Franklin (US #19, 1969), and the Supremes with the Temptations (US #46, 1969), as well as to the song's inclusion in the movie Easy Rider (1969), which became a runaway success. \\"The Weight\\" has since become the Band's best known song. It has been covered by many artists, appeared in dozens of films and documentaries, and has become a staple in American rock music. When Music from Big Pink was released in 1968, the Band initially avoided media attention, and discouraged Capitol Records from promotional efforts. They also did not immediately pursue touring to support the album, and declined to be interviewed for a year. The resulting mystery surrounding the group led to speculation in the underground press. Music from Big Pink received excellent reviews, and the album influenced many well-known musicians of the period. 1969 The Band The Band in 1969, Robertson is second from the right In early 1969, the Band rented a home from Sammy Davis Jr. in Hollywood Hills, and converted the pool house behind it into a studio to recreate the \\"clubhouse\\" atmosphere that they had enjoyed at \\"Big Pink\\" previously. The band began recording every day in the pool house studio, working on a tight schedule to complete the album. An additional three tracks were recorded at The Hit Factory in New York in April 1969. Robertson did most of the audio engineering on the album. The Band began performing regularly in spring 1969, with their first live dates as the Band being at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. Their most notable performances that year were at the 1969 Woodstock Festival and the UK Isle of Wight Festival with Bob Dylan in August. The Band's album The Band was released in September 1969, and became a critical and commercial success. The album received almost universal critical praise, peaked at #9 on the US pop charts, and stayed in the Top 40 for 24 weeks. The Band works as a loose concept album of Americana themes, and was instrumental in the creation of the Americana Music genre. It was included in the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in 2009. The song with the strongest cultural impact on The Band album was \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\". The song tells a fictional story of a Confederate citizen's experiences at the end of the American Civil War, and features actual historical events worked into the song to create a larger American mythos. Although the Band's original version was not released as a single, a cover version by Joan Baez went to #3 on the charts in 1971 and helped to popularize the song. Several other tracks from The Band received significant radio airplay, and would become staples in the group's concert appearances. \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" peaked at #25 in late 1969 in the United States, and would be their only Top 30 hit there. \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" reached #16 in the UK in April 1970, the highest chart position of any single by the group in that country. \\"Whispering Pines\\", co-written by Richard Manuel, was released as a single in France in 1970, and would become the title of a 2009 book about Canadian contributions to the Americana music genre by Jason Schneider. On November 2, 1969, the Band appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show, one of only two television appearances they would make. 1970‚Äì1973 (Stage Fright through Moondog Matinee) On January 12, 1970, the Band was featured on the cover of Time magazine. This was the first time a North American rock band featured on the cover of the magazine. The Band rented The Woodstock Playhouse in Woodstock, New York with the intent of recording a new live album there, but the city council voted against it, so they recorded on location, but without an audience. Robertson handled most of the songwriting duties as before. Robertson brought in Todd Rundgren to engineer the album which was recorded in two weeks' time. These sessions became their third album, Stage Fright, which would become the Band's highest charting album, peaking at #5 on September 5 and staying in the Billboard Top 40 for 14 weeks. Robertson performing live with the Band in 1971 The Band's next album, Cahoots, was recorded at Albert Grossman's newly built Bearsville Studios and was released in October 1971. The album received mixed reviews, and peaked at #24 on the Billboard charts, only remaining in the Billboard Top 40 for five weeks. Cahoots is notable for its cover of Bob Dylan's \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\", as well as for featuring the concert favourite \\"Life Is a Carnival\\". The inclusion of \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" came about when Dylan stopped by Robertson's home during the recording of Cahoots and Robertson asked if he might have any songs to contribute. That led to Dylan playing an unfinished version of \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" for him. Dylan completed the song soon afterwards, and the Band recorded it for the album. \\"Life Is a Carnival\\" features horn parts written by producer and arranger Allen Toussaint. It would be the only track from Cahoots the group would keep in their set list through to The Last Waltz concert and film. The Band continued to tour throughout 1970-71. A live album recorded at a series of shows at the Academy of Music in New York City between December 28‚Äì31, 1971, was released in 1972 as the double album Rock Of Ages. Rock of Ages peaked at #6, and remained in the Top 40 for 14 weeks. After the Academy of Music shows, the Band again retreated from performing live. They returned to the stage on July 28, 1973, to play the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen alongside the Allman Brothers Band and the Grateful Dead. A recording of the Band's performance was released by Capitol Records as the album Live at Watkins Glen in 1995. With over 600,000 people in attendance, the festival set a record for \\"Pop Festival Attendance\\" in the Guinness Book of World Records. The record was first published in the 1976 edition of the book. In October 1973, the Band released an album of cover songs entitled Moondog Matinee, which peaked at #28 on the Billboard charts. Around the time of the recording of Moondog Matinee, Robertson began working on an ambitious project entitled Works that was never finished or released. One lyric from the Works project, \\"Lay a flower in the snow,\\" was used in Robertson's song \\"Fallen Angel\\", which appeared on his 1987 self-titled solo album. 1974 Reunion with Bob Dylan (Planet Waves and Before the Flood) In February 1973, Bob Dylan relocated from Woodstock, New York to Malibu, California. Coincidentally, Robertson moved to Malibu in the summer of 1973, and by October of the year the rest of the members of the Band had followed suit, moving into properties near Zuma Beach. Bob Dylan and the Band performing at the Chicago Stadium in Chicago, Illinois, on the 1974 reunion tour, Robertson is second from the left David Geffen had signed Dylan to Asylum Records, and worked with promoter Bill Graham on the concept that would become the Bob Dylan and the Band 1974 Tour. It would be Dylan's first tour in more than seven years. Meanwhile, Bill Graham took out a full page advertisement for the Bob Dylan and the Band tour in the New York Times. The response was one of the largest in entertainment history up to that point, with between 5 and 6 million requests for tickets mailed in for 650,000 seats. Graham's office ended up selling tickets off on a lottery basis, and Dylan and the Band netted $2 million from the deal. Amongst the rehearsals and preparations, the Band went into the studio with Bob Dylan to record a new album for Asylum Records that would become the Bob Dylan album Planet Waves (1974). Sessions took place at Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, California, from November 2‚Äì14, 1973. Planet Waves was released on February 9, 1974. The album was #1 on the Billboard album charts for four weeks, and spent 12 weeks total in the Billboard Top 40. Planet Waves was Bob Dylan's first #1 album, and the first and only time Bob Dylan and the Band recorded a studio album together. The 1974 tour began at the Chicago Stadium on January 3, 1974, and ended at The Forum in Inglewood, California on February 14. The shows began with more songs from the new Planet Waves album and with covers that Dylan and the Band liked, but as the tour went on, they moved toward playing older and more familiar material, only keeping \\"Forever Young\\" from the Planet Waves album in the set list. Dylan and the Band played a number of tracks from the controversial 1965‚Äì1966 World Tour, this time to wildly enthusiastic response from the audience where there had been mixed reaction and boos a mere nine years previously. The final three shows of the tour at The Forum in Inglewood, California were recorded and assembled into the double album Before the Flood. Credited to \\"Bob Dylan/The Band\\", Before the Flood was released by Asylum Records on July 20, 1974. The album debuted at #3 on the Billboard charts, and spent ten weeks in the Top Forty. 1974‚Äì1975 (Shangri-La Studios, The Basement Tapes, and Northern Lights ‚Äì Southern Cross) Following the 1974 reunion tour with Bob Dylan, rock manager Elliot Roberts booked the Band with the recently reunited Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. On September 4, both artists played Wembley Stadium in London, appearing with Jesse Colin Young and Joni Mitchell. The entrance to Shangri-La Studios in 2016. The Band had the ranch house on the Shangri-La property converted into a recording studio in 1974.After moving to Malibu in 1973, Robertson and the Band had discovered a ranch in Malibu near Zuma Beach called \\"Shangri-La\\", and decided to lease the property. The main house on the property had originally been built by Lost Horizon (1937) actress Margo Albert, and the ranch had been the filming and stabling site for the Mister Ed television show in the 1960s. In the interim, the house had served as a high- class bordello. The album release of The Basement Tapes, credited to Bob Dylan and the Band, was the first album production that took place in the new studio. The album, produced by Robertson, featured a selection of tapes from the original 1967 Basement Tapes sessions with Dylan, as well as demos for tracks eventually recorded for Music From Big Pink album. Robertson cleaned up the tracks, and the album was released in July 1975. Shangri-La Studios proved to be a return to a clubhouse atmosphere that the Band had enjoyed previously at Big Pink, and in the spring of 1975, the group began work on Northern Lights ‚Äì Southern Cross, their first release of original material in four years. One of the best known tracks on the album is \\"Acadian Driftwood\\", the first song with specifically Canadian subject material. Robertson was inspired to write \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" after seeing the documentary L'Acadie, l'Acadie (1971) on Canadian television while in Montreal. Two other notable tracks from that album are \\"It Makes No Difference\\" and \\"Ophelia\\". Northern Lights ‚Äì Southern Cross was released on November 1, 1975. The album received generally positive reviews, and reached #26 on the Billboard charts, remaining in the Top 40 for five weeks. 1976 (Islands and The Last Waltz concert) The Band began touring again in June 1976, performing throughout the summer. The members of the Band were splintering off to work on other projects, with Levon Helm building a studio in Woodstock and Rick Danko having been contracted to Arista Records as a solo artist. While on the summer tour, member Richard Manuel was involved in a boating accident that severely injured his neck, and ten dates of the 25-date tour were cancelled. It was during this time period that Robertson introduced the concept that the Band would cease to operate as a touring act. According to Robertson, the group's mutual agreement was that they would stage one final \\"grand finale\\" show, part ways to work on their various projects, and then regroup. Helm later made the case in his autobiography, This Wheel's on Fire, that Robertson had forced the Band's breakup on the rest of the group.Levon Helm and Stephen Davis. This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band, Chapter Nine: The Last Waltz Concert promoter Bill Graham booked the Band at the Winterland Ballroom on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976. The show was intended as a gala event, with ticket prices of $25 per person. The event would include a Thanksgiving dinner served to the audience, and would feature the Band performing with various musical guests. The onstage guest list included Ronnie Hawkins, Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Dr. John, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and others. The Band with musical guests performing \\"I Shall Be Released\\" at The Last Waltz concert on November 25, 1976 Robertson wanted to document the event on film, and approached director Martin Scorsese to see if he would be interested in shooting the concert. The Winterland concert was called The Last Waltz. Robertson and Scorsese developed a 200-page script for the show, listing out in columns the lyrics of the songs, who was singing what part, and what instruments were being featured. It included columns for the camera and lighting work. Scorsese brought in all-star cameramen such as Michael Chapman, L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs and Vilmos Zsigmond to film the show in 35mm. John Simon, producer on the Band's first two albums, was brought in to coordinate rehearsals and work as musical director. Boris Leven was brought in as art director. Jonathan Taplin assumed the role of executive producer, and Robertson worked as producer of the film. Rehearsals for The Last Waltz concert began in early November. Warner Bros. Records president Mo Ostin offered to finance the production of The Last Waltz film in exchange for the rights to release music from The Last Waltz as an album. However, the group were contractually obligated to supply Capitol Records with one more album before they could be released to work with Warner Bros. So in between rehearsing, the Band worked on the studio album Islands for Capitol. Robertson wrote or co-wrote eight of the ten tracks. One of the songs, \\"Knockin' Lost John\\", features Robertson on vocals, and was the first Band song Robertson had sung on since \\"To Kingdom Come\\" from Music From Big Pink. \\"Christmas Must Be Tonight\\" was inspired by the birth of Robertson's son, Sebastian, in July 1974. The Last Waltz concert event took place on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976. Approximately five thousand people were in attendance. The event began at 5 pm, beginning with the audience members being served a full traditional Thanksgiving meal at candlelit tables, with a vegetarian table serving an alternate menu as an option. The Berkeley Promenade Orchestra played waltz music for dancing afterwards. The tables were cleared and moved at 8 pm. At 9 pm, the Band played songs for an hour, beginning with \\"Up On Cripple Creek\\". Just after 10 pm, Robertson introduced Ronnie Hawkins, the first onstage guest, with a succession of guest stars appearing with the group until just after midnight. The group took a 30-minute break, during which several Bay Area poets performed readings of their poems. After the break, the Band returned to the stage, performing, among other songs, a new composition entitled \\"The Last Waltz Theme\\" that Robertson had just completed less than 48 hours prior. Bob Dylan was brought in at the end of this second set, performing several songs, and finally being joined with the other guest stars for a finale performance of \\"I Shall Be Released\\". This was then followed with two all-star jam sessions, after which the Band returned to the stage to close the show with one more song, their rendition of \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\". 1977‚Äì1978 (The Last Waltz film and album) After The Last Waltz concert event was finished, director Martin Scorsese had 400 reels of raw footage to work with, and began editing the footage. The film was then sold to United Artists. In the meantime, Robertson and Scorsese continued to brainstorm more ideas for the film. In April 1977, country singer Emmylou Harris and gospel vocal group the Staple Singers were filmed on a sound stage at MGM performing with the Band. Emmylou Harris performed on \\"Evangeline\\", a new song written by Robertson, and the Staples Singers performed on a new recording of \\"The Weight,\\" which they themselves had recorded a version of in 1968. Scorsese's next idea was to intersperse the concert footage with interviews of the Band that told their story. Scorsese conducted the interviews. The Last Waltz album was released by Warner Brothers Records on April 7, 1978, as a 3-LP set. The first five sides feature live performances from the concert, and the last side contains studio recordings from the MGM sound stage sessions. The album peaked at #16 on the Billboard charts, and remained in the Top 40 for 8 weeks. The Last Waltz film was released to theatres on April 26, 1978. The film fared well with both rock and film critics. Robertson and Scorsese made appearances throughout America and Europe to promote the film. Over time, The Last Waltz has become lauded by many as an important and pioneering rockumentary. Its influence has been felt on subsequent rock music films such as Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense (1984), and U2's Rattle and Hum (1988). =Production and session work outside of the Band 1970‚Äì1977= Singer-songwriter Jesse Winchester performing in 2011, Robertson produced his self-titled debut album in 1970 Robertson produced Jesse Winchester's debut self-titled album, which was released in 1970 on Ampex Records. The album features Robertson playing guitar throughout the album, and co-credits the track \\"Snow\\" to Robertson as well. Robertson played guitar on ex-Beatle Ringo Starr's third solo album, Ringo (1973), performing with four-fifths of the Band on the track \\"Sunshine Life For Me (Sail Away Raymond)\\". Robertson contributed a guitar solo on the track \\"Snookeroo\\" on Starr's fourth album, Goodnight Vienna (1974). Robertson played guitar for Joni Mitchell on the track \\"Raised on Robbery\\", which was released on her album Court and Spark. In 1974, Robertson also played guitar on Carly Simon's version of \\"Mockingbird\\", which featured Simon singing with her then- husband James Taylor. In 1975, Robertson produced and played guitar on singer/guitarist Hirth Martinez's debut album Hirth From Earth. Bob Dylan had heard Martinez, and recommended him to Robertson. Robertson identified strongly with Martinez' music, helped him to secure a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, and agreed to produce Martinez' debut album. He also played guitar on Martinez' follow-up album, Big Bright Street (1977). In 1975, Eric Clapton recorded the album No Reason to Cry at the Band's Shangri-La Studios with help from members of the Band. Robertson played lead guitar on the track \\"Sign Language\\". In the mid-1970s, Robertson connected with singer Neil Diamond, and the two began collaborating on a concept album about the life and struggles of a Tin Pan Alley songwriter. The resulting album, entitled Beautiful Noise, was recorded at Shangri-La Studios in early 1976. It reached #6 on the Billboard charts and remained in the Top 40 for sixteen weeks. Robertson produced the album, co-wrote the track \\"Dry Your Eyes\\" with Diamond, and played guitar on \\"Dry Your Eyes\\", \\"Lady-Oh\\", and \\"Jungletime\\". He produced Diamond's live double album Love at the Greek (1977), which was recorded in 1976 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. Love at the Greek reached #8 on the Billboard charts and remained in the Top 40 for nine weeks. In 1977, Robertson contributed to two album projects from the Band alumni. Robertson played guitar on \\"Java Blues\\" on Rick Danko's self-titled debut album, and also played guitar on the Earl King-penned \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\" on the album Levon Helm & the RCO All-Stars. Also in 1977, Robertson contributed to the second self-titled album by singer-songwriter Libby Titus, who was the former girlfriend of Levon Helm. Robertson produced the track \\"The Night You Took Me To Barbados In My Dreams\\" (co-written by Titus and Hirth Martinez), and produced and played guitar on the Cole Porter standard \\"Miss Otis Regrets\\". Film career 1980‚Äì1986 =Carny (1980) film and soundtrack= After the release of The Last Waltz, MGM/UA, who released the film, viewed Robertson as a potential film actor, and provided Robertson with an office on the MGM lot. During this time, Martin Scorsese's agent, Harry Ulfand, contacted Robertson about the idea of producing a dramatic film about traveling carnivals, which Robertson was drawn to because of his childhood experiences working in carnivals. The screenplay for the film Carny was directed by documentary filmmaker Robert Kaylor. Although Robertson was initially only intended to be the producer of Carny, he ended up becoming the third lead actor in the film, playing the role of Patch, the patch man. Gary Busey played \\"Frankie\\", the carnival bozo and Patch's best friend. Jodie Foster was selected to play the role of Donna, a small town girl who runs away to join the carnival and threatens to come between the two friends. The film cast real life carnies alongside professional film actors, which created a difficult atmosphere on set. Carny opened to theaters on June 13, 1980. Also in 1980, Warner Bros released a soundtrack album for Carny, which is co- credited to Robertson and composer Alex North, who wrote the orchestral score for the film. The soundtrack was rereleased on compact disc by Real Gone Music in 2015. =Early collaborations with Martin Scorsese 1980‚Äì1986 (Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, The Color of Money)= After the production of Carny was completed, Robertson flew to New York to assist Martin Scorsese on the music for the film Raging Bull (1980). Robertson and Scorsese would have a long- running working relationship. The former would find and/or create music to underscore the latter's films. Raging Bull was the first of these collaborations. Robertson credits his work on Raging Bull for sparking his interest in the work of sourcing and underscoring music for movies. Robertson supplied three newly recorded instrumental jazz tracks for sourced music, which he also produced. These three tracks feature Robertson playing guitar, along with performances from the Band alumni Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel. One of the tracks, \\"Webster Hall\\", is co-written by Robertson and Garth Hudson. Robertson also worked with Scorsese on selecting the film's opening theme music, choosing the intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana by Italian opera composer Pietro Mascagni. The soundtrack was finally released by Capitol Records in 2005 as a 37 track, 2-CD set. Robertson worked with Scorsese again on his next film, The King of Comedy (1983), and is credited in the film's opening credits for \\"Music Production\\". Robertson contributed one original song, \\"Between Trains,\\" to the film's soundtrack. The song was written in tribute to \\"Cowboy\\" Dan Johnson, an assistant of Scorsese's who had recently died. Robertson produced the track, sings lead vocals, and plays guitar and keyboards; the Band alumni Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel appear on the track was well. A soundtrack album for the film was released by Warner Bros. in 1983. In June 1986, Robertson began working with Scorsese on his next film The Color of Money. In addition to sourcing music for the film, Robertson also composed the film's score; it was the first time Robertson had ever written a dramatic underscore for a film. Robertson brought in Canadian jazz composer Gil Evans to orchestrate the arrangements. The best known song on The Color of Money soundtrack is Eric Clapton's \\"It's in the Way That You Use It\\", which was co-written by Robertson. \\"It's in the Way That You Use It\\" reached #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in January 1987. Robertson produced a song for the film with blues player Willie Dixon entitled \\"Don't Tell Me Nothin'\\"; Dixon's track was co-written with Robertson. The Color of Money's soundtrack album was released by MCA Records. Solo career =Geffen Records period= Robbie Robertson (1987) Robertson began work on his first solo album, Robbie Robertson, in July 1986 after signing to Geffen Records. Robertson chose fellow Canadian Daniel Lanois to produce the album. Much of the album was recorded at The Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, California. He recorded at Bearsville Studios near Woodstock, New York, and also in Dublin, Ireland, with U2, and in Bath, England, with Peter Gabriel. He employed a number of guest artists on the album, including U2, Gabriel, the Bodeans, and Maria McKee. Garth Hudson and Rick Danko also made appearances on the album. Robertson wrote one track, \\"Fallen Angel\\", in honor of Richard Manuel, after his passing in March 1986. Released on October 26, 1987, Robbie Robertson peaked at #35 on the Billboard 200, remaining in the top 40 for three weeks. The album charted even higher in the UK, peaking at #23 on the UK Albums Chart and remaining on the chart for 14 weeks. Robbie Robertson received overwhelming critical acclaim at the time of its release, being listed in the Top-Ten Albums of the Year by several critics in Billboard magazine's 1987 \\"The Critics' Choice\\" end of the year feature. The album was listed as #77 in Rolling Stone's 1989 list \\"100 Best Albums of the Eighties.\\" Robertson had his single largest hit in the UK with \\"Somewhere Down The Crazy River\\", which features his spoken word verses contrasted with singing in the choruses. The song reached #15 in the UK Hit Singles chart, and remained in the chart for 11 weeks. The video for \\"Somewhere Down The Crazy River\\" was directed by Martin Scorsese, and features Maria McKee in an acting role. In the US, Robbie Robertson produced several hits on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts, with \\"Showdown At Big Sky\\" coming in the highest (#2) and \\"Sweet Fire Of Love\\" the second highest (#7).

In 1991, Rod Stewart recorded a version of \\"Broken Arrow\\" for his album Vagabond Heart. Stewart's version of the song reached #20 on the Billboard 100 chart in the US and #2 on the Billboard Top Canadian Hit Singles chart in Canada. \\"Broken Arrow\\" was performed live by the Grateful Dead with Phil Lesh on vocals. Storyville (1991) Storyville was released on September 30, 1991. Robertson headed to New Orleans to collaborate with some of the city's natives like Aaron and Ivan Neville and the Rebirth Brass Band. Once again, Robertson brought in Band alumni Garth Hudson and Rick Danko as contributors. The album reached #69 on the Billboard 200 chart. Storyville received numerous positive reviews, with Rolling Stone giving it 4 1/2 stars out of 5, and the Los Angeles Times awarding it 3 stars out of 4.

In 1992, Robertson produced the song \\"Love in Time\\" for Roy Orbison's posthumous album King of Hearts. \\"Love In Time\\" was a basic demo Orbison had recorded that was believed to be lost, but had just recently been rediscovered. Robertson set about augmenting Orbison's basic vocal track with new arrangements and instrumentation, with the intent of making it sound like the arrangements were there from the beginning instead of later additions. =Later solo albums= Music for the Native Americans (1994): In 1994, Robertson returned to his roots, forming a Native American group the Red Road Ensemble for Music for the Native Americans, a collection of songs that accompanied a PBS television documentary series. Like his songs, \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\\" and \\"Acadian Driftwood,\\" Robertson touches on history that connects to his life and family. The Battle Of Wounded Knee and the near extinction of the buffalo in the United States are outlined in the song, \\"Ghost Dance.\\" Robertson was recognized with a Juno Award for Producer of the Year.

Robertson headlined the festival along with other Native American musicians, and portions of the live performance appeared in the PBS documentary. Contact from the Underworld of Redboy (1998): On Contact from the Underworld of Redboy, Robertson departed from his typical production style and delved deep into a mix of rock, native and electronic music. He employed the services of Howie B, DJ Premier and producer Marius De Vries (Bj√∂rk, Massive Attack). Through the songs on the album he takes a close look at native traditions like Peyote Healing. The racial epithet in the album's title comes from an experience when Robertson was referred to as \\"Red Boy,\\" by some bullies, while playing with his cousins.Marius De Vries (Bj√∂rk, Massive Attack) He sampled a young Native American singer from the 1940s which he got from the Library Of Congress on the album's opening track, \\"The Sound Is Fading.\\" Also included is an interview from prison with Leonard Peltier set to a soundscape provided by Robertson on the song \\"Sacrifice\\".

Renowned as \\"The Hollywood Fashion Plate\\", he was a one-time NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion. Childhood Blassie's parents, Jacob and Anna (n√©e Sind), immigrated to the United States from Germany prior to the start of World War I, settling in St. Louis. Fred was an only child, which he claimed was because he weighed 15 pounds when he was born and his mother didn't want to go through childbirth again. His father was abusive and an alcoholic, and Fred often had to take refuge with his grandparents whenever Jacob would beat his mother. His parents continually separated, then reunited. At the age of 13, after his father hit his mother again, Fred threatened to attack his father with a baseball bat, but didn't do it and stayed with his aunt for six months until his mother asked him to return home. Throughout his life, Fred didn't touch alcohol after seeing what kind of person it turned his father into. As a teenager, Blassie went to McKinley High School; after graduating he got a job at a meatpacking plant, which his family hoped he would turn into a lucrative meat cutting job with the local trade union. However, he started boxing at Seward Community Center and won the heavyweight championship. He was more interested in wrestling, though, and would sneak into the matches whenever he could. He would often go to matches at Harry Cook's Gym to watch the hookers of the day lock up. As they began to recognize him, the wrestlers would teach him a hold here and there. His first wrestling match was actually a shoot fight which he accepted in order to impress a girl he brought to the show. Later, he began to get regular work wrestling at local carnivals. His cousin John Frank Holaus would often referee his matches.\\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie with Keith Elliot Greenberg, Listen, You Pencil Neck Geeks, (WWE Books, 2003). Early career Blassie came up with his famous \\"pencil-neck geek\\" catchphrase early in his career to describe a fellow carnival performer known as \\"The Geek\\", who bit the heads off chickens and snakes. Blassie described this geek as having a neck like a stack of dimes, and that he was a real pencil-neck geek. He soon got work from more established promoters: Tom Packs in St. Louis and George Simpson in Kansas City. The more he worked in the business, the more the veterans were willing to let him learn about the wrestling business. Military service After the US entered World War II, Blassie enlisted in the Navy and served in the Pacific Theater for 42 months. The war was a trying time for his family back home because of his parents' German heritage. They were often accused of being unpatriotic. He married a Jewish girl named Nettie Needles in California while on shore leave. He achieved the rank of Petty Officer Second Class before he was discharged. Career Upon Blassie's return from the war, he was billed as \\"Sailor\\" Fred Blassie to capitalize on the wave of war-time patriotism sweeping the country, but that gimmick was unsuccessful. He worked for Jack Pfefer, whom he claimed would only employ people who looked like sideshow freaks at his shows, and whose wrestlers included Tor Johnson, who made movies with director Ed Wood, and Lillian Ellison, the Fabulous Moolah. During this time, he went to New York City to work for promoter Jess McMahon =NWA Los Angeles (1952‚Äì1953)= In 1952, Blassie moved to Los Angeles to work for Jules Strongbow. He grew to love California, and frequently returned there throughout his career to wrestle. He teamed with Billy McDaniel as the McDaniel Brothers, but when they went east, they were known as the Blassie Brothers. =Georgia (1953‚Äì1960)= In 1953, he worked in the Atlanta, territory for Paul Jones (the wrestler of the 1930s, not the wrestler of the 1980s). While there, he won the NWA Georgia Southern Heavyweight Championship, the holder of which was generally first in line to challenge the NWA World Heavyweight Champion whenever he passed through the territory. It was also during this period of his career when he dropped his babyface gimmick and became a full-fledged heel. The fans consistently booed him because he was considered a \\"Yankee\\". He also bleached his hair at this time, as many of the other stars of the era did, such as Gorgeous George, Johnny Valentine, and \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers. He was often billed as \\"The Vampire\\" during this time for biting his opponents and filing his teeth during interviews and promos. =Worldwide Wrestling Associates (1960‚Äì1968)= Blassie in the early 1960s In 1960, Blassie returned to Strongbow's promotion in Los Angeles where he was a big star for Worldwide Wrestling Associates (WWA) of southern California, drawing many fans to the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles.John F. Molinaro, Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time, (Winding Stair Press: 2002), p. 110. He was so hated there that uniformed police officers were regularly brought in to protect him as he made his way to and from the ring. He had main event-level feuds against stars such as The Destroyer.Molinaro, p. 180. On June 12, 1961, Blassie defeated the \\"Flying Frenchman\\" √âdouard Carpentier in a best-of-three-falls match for his first WWA World Heavyweight Championship. On July 7, Blassie successfully defended his title against the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz. During that same title reign, in a match against Lord James Blears a fan threw acid on his back, and he had to return immediately to the locker room to wash it off. Blassie claims that he made Regis Philbin into the celebrity he is today. When Philbin had a late-night weekend talk show in San Diego, Blassie would routinely show up to yell at the audience, throw furniture, and threaten Philbin. In later years, Blassie also appeared on The Mike Douglas Show when Philbin was a guest host. After regaining the WWA Championship from Rikid≈çzan, Blassie lost the title two days later to the \\"Masked Destroyer\\" Dick Beyer. In 1963, Bearcat Wright defeated him to become champion, and it was quite a statement during the fight for civil rights that an African-American had won such a title. In 1964, Dick the Bruiser defeated Blassie to become champion, and Blassie headed east to work for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). Blassie returned to WWA in 1968 just as promoter Mike LeBell decided to rejoin the NWA. In the early 1970s, Blassie \\"turned face\\", or became a good guy, since so many fans were cheering his famous antics. While there, he feuded with Soulman Rocky Johnson, The Sheik, and \\"The Golden Greek\\" John Tolos. One of his most famous feuds took place in southern California in 1971, against Tolos. The final match of their series took place in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and set new California records for both attendance and gate.Molinaro, p. 111. =Japan (1962‚Äì1968)= In 1962, Blassie had a feud with Japanese wrestling icon Rikid≈çzan that established his reputation in Japan. After Blassie lost the WWA World Heavyweight Championship to Rikid≈çzan in Los Angeles, the two had a rematch on live Japanese television. Many of the viewers were horrified by Blassie's treatment of their hero. One of Blassie's gimmicks was to file his teeth, and draw blood from his opponents by biting their foreheads. The sight of the Japanese legend covered in his own blood gave several viewers heart attacks, and some reportedly even died.Molinaro, p. 110. Blassie divorced his wife after leaving on Christmas to wrestle in Knoxville. He claims he isn't sure if she knew of his philandering ways, but Blassie had repeatedly bragged of his infidelity to his ex-wife Nettie. As a result, of his three children Gary, Cheryl, and Ron, only Ron ever spoke to Blassie on a regular basis. While touring Japan in 1965, Blassie met the woman who would later become his third wife, Miyako Morozumi, at a train station. However, later that year Blassie suffered from kidney stones and had surgery to remove them. While recuperating the following year, he sold cars and married a second time to a woman whose name Blassie claimed not to remember. In 1968, Blassie returned to Japan and was reunited with Miyako. When he asked for her parents' blessing, they were unsure of Blassie because of his reputation with Rikid≈çzan and because he was 28 years older than she. However, he eventually got their blessing and took her home to the United States. They were married on September 30, 1968. =World Wide Wrestling Federation (1964; 1971)= In 1964, Blassie feuded with Bruno Sammartino and Bobo Brazil. Blassie came into the WWWF with his own world title belt, claiming to be the Pacific World Champion, and was coming to Sammartino's \\"back yard\\" to unify the world title. The series began at Roosevelt Stadium, Jersey City, New Jersey in 1964, with Blassie winning on a technicality, but not a pin. The rematches were held at Madison Square Garden in New York, with Sammartino winning out. Behind the scenes, Blassie befriended Gorilla Monsoon. He returned to the company in 1971, reaching the final of a tournament in January for the vacant WWWF United States Heavyweight Championship before losing to Pedro Morales. Blassie later challenged Morales for the WWWF Championship. During this stint with the company, Blassie was managed by his future nemesis, \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano. =Management career (1974‚Äì86)= Blassie (right ‚Äì foreground), with clients The Iron Sheik (left, holding flag) and Nikolai Volkoff (right ‚Äì directly behind Blassie) during the mid 1980s at a Madison Square Garden event Blassie retired from active wrestling in 1974, due to a California law that prohibited anyone over 55 from getting a wrestling license. Afterwards he became a manager in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) and its subsequent incarnation the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He performed for that promotion until his full retirement from professional wrestling in 1986. Blassie, Lou Albano, and The Grand Wizard were named \\"The Three Wise Men of the East\\", as the top three heel managers in the company. Among the men he managed were Nikolai Volkoff, Blackjack Mulligan, High Chief Peter Maivia, \\"The Crippler\\" Ray Stevens, Adrian Adonis, Jesse Ventura, Dick Murdoch, The Iron Sheik, Swede Hanson, Killer Khan, George 'The Animal' Steele, Professor Tanaka, Mr. Fuji, Victor Rivera, Kamala, Hercules Hernandez, and Hulk Hogan. Blassie also managed Muhammad Ali in his boxer vs. wrestler match in 1976 against Antonio Inoki. Blassie also publicly represented Ali for media events and interviews for a period in the mid-1970s. One of Blassie's most famous proteges was The Iron Sheik. Blassie led Shiek to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship over Bob Backlund on December 26, 1983 in Madison Square Garden. After Sheik lost the belt to Blassie's former managed wrestler Hulk Hogan, Blassie managed Sheik in various rematches around the country throughout the first half of 1984, culminating into another major televised rematch on December 28, 1984 once again in Madison Square Garden. In this match Hogan was once again victorious. After managing Sheik through a brief feud with Andre the Giant, he also became the manager of Nikolai Volkoff, with Sheik and Volkoff later becoming a tag team. Blassie would gain even more gold when Volkoff and Sheik defeated The US Express for the WWF Tag Team Championship at the first ever Wrestlemania. Blassie got involved when he threw his cane into the ring, with Sheik and Volkoff using it to their advantage to gain the victory. When Gene Okerlund confronted Blassie in an interview after the match, Blassie went, \\"what cane, I didn't have no cane!\\" Blassie would continue to manage Sheik and Volkoff even after they lost the tag team titles. In the Summer of 1985 Blassie would start up a house show feud with former friend Lou Albano, culminating into a few matches, including a steel cage match at the Meadowlands in July 1985. Other than these handful of matches, Blassie mostly stayed out of the ring, sticking to managing from ringside. Blassie unsuccessfully campaigned along with the other managers to manage \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage when Savage first entered the WWF in June 1985. Blassie would continue to interfere from ringside in matches, especially during Volkoff's feud with Corporal Kirchner. Blassie's interference at Wrestlemania 2 cost Volkoff his match with Kirchner, when the cane was grabbed by Kirchner instead of Volkoff. In the Summer of 1986, Blassie started to slowly phase himself out of the WWF and into retirement. On an episode of WWF Championship Wrestling, Blassie barged into the announcer booth to proclaim that he had sold half of the contracts of Sheik and Volkoff to a mysterious benefactor for a large sum of money. This benefactor was later revealed to be Slick. Blassie appeared alongside Slick to co-manage Sheik and Volkoff for a few television appearances before finally bowing out in November 1986, with Albano, the final member of the Three Wise Men, retiring a few weeks later. Because of his close relationship with Vince McMahon, Sr. and his family, Blassie remained on the WWF roster until the day he died. He would sporadically return to make brief appearances following his retirement in 1986, mostly in produced video packages hyping the \\"new generation\\" of wrestling. He was given a commentary tryout in 1986 and 1987 for WWF Wrestling Challenge, calling a few matches with Gorilla Monsoon. He briefly turned face in 1989, making an appearance on Prime Time Wrestling angry with Bobby Heenan over money Heenan hadn't paid him back. Then he returned again in 1990 briefly to do color commentary for Prime Time in April with Vince McMahon, as an emergency fill-in after Tony Schiavone quit, playing a heel once again. =Guest appearances and death= Blassie was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1994. In 1999, he was shown making the opening narration of Wrestlemania XV. In 2000, Blassie made an appearance at the Royal Rumble as a judge in the Miss Rumble 2000 Swimsuit contest. In 2001, Blassie appeared in a special July 16, 2001 Raw is War segment for the Invasion storyline, wherein he exhorts a gathering of WWF wrestlers to stand tall against The Alliance ‚Äì and later gets mocked by Alliance leaders Shane and Stephanie McMahon. Because of this, Blassie is one of if not the only man to have worked with all four generations of the McMahon family. Images from his Wrestlemania XV promo were also included in the opening of the 2001 Survivor Series. Blassie also appeared in a segment at the Vengeance pay-per-view event in December 2001, where an \\"undisputed\\" champion would be crowned. His final wrestling appearance was May 12, 2003 in Philadelphia on Monday Night Raw, three weeks before his death. The segment featured Blassie, his wife, and Raw GM Eric Bischoff, who was about to allow 3 Minute Warning to attack him, until Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Dudley Boyz stepped in. His final words on WWE television were \\"D-Von, Get the table\\", to a monstrous applause. His book, Listen You Pencil Neck Geeks, was released on May 13, 2003. On June 2, 2003, Blassie died of heart and kidney failure at the age of 85. Music career In 1975, Blassie recorded voiceovers for the songs \\"Blassie, King of Men\\" and \\"Pencil Neck Geek\\", which were performed by Johnny Legend, featuring Billy Zoom on guitar, Jay Phillips on guitar, Lon Osgood on bass and Steve Clark on drums. They received acclaim on the Dr. Demento Radio Show, and the latter song was featured on several albums, including Dr. Demento's 20th Anniversary Collection, \\"The Very Best of Dr. Demento\\", and \\"Dr. Demento Presents the Greatest Novelty CDs of All Time\\". In 1983, Rhino Records released a 14-track album by Blassie, titled I Bite the Songs. Film career Blassie appeared in an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show that featured a new dance craze called The Twizzle. Rose Marie's character Sally Rogers brought him on at the end of the episode claiming to have discovered another new dance sensation. In the demonstration of the dance Blassie picked up Rob Petrie and twirled him over his head. Filmed in 1982, My Breakfast with Blassie featured Andy Kaufman and Freddie Blassie eating at a Sambo's in Los Angeles. (The film was referenced by American rock band R.E.M. in their 1992 song about Kaufman, \\"Man on the Moon\\".) \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie appeared in a live-action segment of the cartoon \\"Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling.\\" In the segment he is interviewed by \\"Mean\\" Gene Okerlund when the two are interrupted by a little old lady in a housekeeper outfit that Blassie claims to be his own mother. \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie also made a cameo appearance as himself, along with \\"Wrestling's Living Legend\\" Bruno Sammartino, and Ric Flair in the 1986 film Body Slam starring Dirk Benedict, \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano, and \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper. In the early 1990s, the wrestler starred in a documentary directed by Jeff Krulik, titled Mr. Blassie Goes To Washington. In it, Blassie is picked up at the Washington, D.C., airport by a limo full of young women, escorted around the nation's capital, gives his opinions and confronts tourists. When meeting someone, he would ask where they were from, and no matter their response, he would reply with, \\"Oh, that's God's country!\\"a review of Mr. Blassie Goes to Washington.

Founding staff (Fred Crigger, Jack Schueler and McPhee) were formerly members of Professor Graham's Computer Systems Group at the University of Waterloo, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Watcom produced a variety of tools, including the well-known Watcom C/C++ compiler introduced in 1988. The first company started by Graham and McPhee was Structured Computing Systems, incorporated in 1974. Then the software development company, WATCOM Systems Inc, started in 1981 with three full-time employees, but had been incorporated two years earlier as Waterloo Basic Enterprises Limited. In 1984, the various subsidiary companies of The WATCOM Group software organization‚Äîmarketing and sales, publications, seminars and systems (software development) -- were all renamed as WATCOM companies for consistent branding. These were later all merged into one full-service software company, WATCOM International Inc. History Waterloo BASIC programming language was one of the earliest Watcom products and predates the existence of the company. During 1978 to 1979 Waterloo BASIC was developed targeting the IBM Series/1. In 1979 the system was ported to VM/CMS running on the IBM 370, 3030, and 4300 computers and an agreement was reached with IBM to market the compiler. Between 1980 and 1983 updated versions were released including ports to the MVS/TSO and VM/CMS. In addition to Waterloo BASIC some of the other early products included WATCOM APL, WATCOM GKS, WATCOM COBOL, WATCOM FORTRAN (WATFIV and WATFOR-77), WATCOM Pascal and the Waterloo 6809 Assembler. These were the basis and provided with the Commodore SuperPET . In the mid 1980s Watcom developed compilers for the Unisys ICON computers running the QNX operating system. The Watcom C/C++ compiler with QNX developed a market for embedded applications. In 1988, Watcom released their first C compiler for the IBM PC platform (and compatibles). It was released with a version number of 6 at a time when the latest version numbers of Borland's and Microsoft's C Compilers were version 5. These version numbers signified nothing and were used for marketing purposes. The compiler could create tighter and faster code than its competition.Windows NT: Remember Microsoft's almost perfect 20-year-old?, Andrew Orlowski, accessed on 19.08.2013 In 1992, Watcom began a move into the client-server arena with the introduction of Watcom SQL, a SQL database server product. Being a very small company (about 8 developers) they managed to produce high quality software, famous among software developers. Watcom SQL is still in production, now under the name SAP SQL Anywhere. In 1993, the VX-REXX system was released. Watcom was acquired by Powersoft in 1994, and Powersoft merged with Sybase in 1995. In May 2000, Sybase spun off their mobile and embedded computing division into its own company, Sybase iAnywhere (formerly iAnywhere Solutions Inc.). Sybase tried to re-target the Watcom compiler into a visual RAD tool, Optima++, but in 2003, because the product competed directly with the Sybase offering PowerBuilder, the product was discontinued. Its sister product, Optima-J, was continued. In 2003, the Watcom C/C++ and Fortran compilers were released as an open source project under a new name, Open Watcom. Users and reception Doom, Descent, Magic Carpet, Grand Theft Auto, System Shock, Fast Attack, Atomic Bomberman, Duke Nukem 3D and Fallout are among well known games that were compiled with Watcom C and DOS/4GW.History - Open Watcom.

Along with traditional Chinese characters, they are one of the two standard character sets of the contemporary Chinese written language. The government of the People's Republic of China in mainland China has promoted them for use in printing since the 1950s and 1960s to encourage literacy. Semi-centennial celebration of the publication of Chinese Character Simplification Plan and official press conference. They are officially used in the People's Republic of China and Singapore, while traditional Chinese characters are used in Hong Kong, Macau, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and occasionally in the Chinese community of Malaysia and Singapore. Simplified Chinese characters may be referred to by their official name above or colloquially (). In its broadest sense, the latter term refers to all characters that have undergone simplifications of character \\"structure\\" or \\"body\\"The Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Cidian defines the term as \\"Chinese characters that have undergone simplification\\" (ÁªèËøáÁÆÄÂåñÁöÑÊ±âÂ≠ó). See Xiandai hanyu guifan cidian, 3rd edition (Beijing: Foreign Language and Teaching Press, 2015), s.v. \\"ÁÆÄ‰ΩìÂ≠ó\\"., some of which have existed for millennia alongside regular, more complicated forms. On the other hand, the official name refers to the modern systematically simplified character set, which (as stated by then-Chairman Mao Zedong in 1952) includes not only structural simplification but also substantial reduction in the total number of standardized Chinese characters.Êõ∏ÂêåÊñá :„ÄäÊº¢Â≠óÁ∞°ÂåñÊñπÊ°à„ÄãÂà∂Ë®ÇÂßãÊú´ÔºåÈªÑÂä†‰Ω≥ÔºåÊñ∞ÂçéÁΩë. Detailed account of the Chinese simplification effort. Simplified character forms were created by reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a sizable proportion of Chinese characters. Some simplifications were based on popular cursive forms embodying graphic or phonetic simplifications of the traditional forms. Some characters were simplified by applying regular rules, for example, by replacing all occurrences of a certain component with a simplified version of the component. Variant characters with the same pronunciation and identical meaning were reduced to a single standardized character, usually the simplest amongst all variants in form. Finally, many characters were left untouched by simplification and are thus identical between the traditional and simplified Chinese orthographies. A second round of simplifications was promulgated in 1977, but was later retracted in 1986 for a variety of reasons, largely due to the confusion caused and the unpopularity of the second round simplifications. However, the Chinese government never officially dropped its goal of further simplification in the future. In August 2009, the PRC began collecting public comments for a modified list of simplified characters. . Page about the list at the State Language Commission's website, including a link to a pdf of the list. Accessed 2009.08.18. . Syndicated from (People's Daily), 2009-04-09. Accessed 2009.04.10. Syndicated from , 2009-04-09. Accessed 2009.04.10.China to regulate use of simplified characters_English_Xinhua . News.xinhuanet.com (2009-08-12). Retrieved on 2013-07-21. The new Table of General Standard Chinese Characters consisting of 8,105 (simplified and unchanged) characters was officially implemented for use by the State Council of the People's Republic of China on June 5, 2013. History =China= Before 1949 Although most simplified Chinese characters in use today are the result of the works moderated by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1950s and 60s, the use of some of these forms predates the PRC's formation in 1949. Caoshu, cursive written text, was the inspiration of some simplified characters, and for others, some are attested as early as the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BC) as either vulgar variants or original characters. The first batch of Simplified Characters introduced in 1935 consisted of 324 characters. One of the earliest proponents of character simplification was Lufei Kui, who proposed in 1909 that simplified characters should be used in education. In the years following the May Fourth Movement in 1919, many anti-imperialist Chinese intellectuals sought ways to modernise China as quickly as possible. Traditional culture and values such as Confucianism were challenged and subsequently blamed for their problems. Soon, people in the Movement started to cite the traditional Chinese writing system as an obstacle in modernising China and therefore proposed that a reform be initiated. It was suggested that the Chinese writing system should be either simplified or completely abolished. Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese author in the 20th century, stated that, \\"If Chinese characters are not destroyed, then China will die\\" (). Recent commentators have claimed that Chinese characters were blamed for the economic problems in China during that time.Yen, Yuehping. [2005] (2005). Calligraphy and Power in Contemporary Chinese Society. Routledge. . In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the Kuomintang government, and a large number of the intelligentsia maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. In 1935, 324 simplified characters collected by Qian Xuantong were officially introduced as the table of first batch of simplified characters, but they were suspended in 1936 due to fierce opposition within the party. People's Republic of China The PRC issued its first round of official character simplifications in two documents, the first in 1956 and the second in 1964. Within the PRC, further character simplification became associated with the leftists of the Cultural Revolution, culminating with the second-round simplified characters, which were promulgated in 1977. In part due to the shock and unease felt in the wake of the Cultural Revolution and Mao's death, the second-round of simplifications was poorly received. In 1986, the authorities retracted the second round completely. Later in the same year, the authorities promulgated a final list of simplifications, which is identical to the 1964 list except for six changes (including the restoration of three characters that had been simplified in the first round: , , ; note that the form is used instead of in regions using Traditional Chinese). In 1965, the PRC published the Yinshua tongyong hanzi zixing biao Âç∞Âà∑ÈÄöÁî®Ê±âÂ≠óÂ≠óÂΩ¢Ë°® (zh) (List of commonly used characters for printing), which included the standardized printing forms of 6196 characters. There had been simplification initiatives aimed at eradicating characters entirely and establishing the Hanyu Pinyin romanization as the official written system of the PRC, but the reform never gained quite as much popularity as the leftists had hoped. After the retraction of the second round of simplification, the PRC stated that it wished to keep Chinese orthography stable. Years later in 2009, the Chinese government released a major revision list which included 8,300 characters. No new simplifications were introduced. However, six characters previously listed as \\"traditional\\" characters that have been simplified, as well as 51 other \\"variant\\" characters, were restored to the standard list. In addition, orthographies (e.g., stroke shape) for 44 characters were proposed to be modified slightly to fit traditional calligraphic rules. Also, the practice of unrestricted simplification of rare and archaic characters by analogy using simplified radicals or components is now discouraged. A State Language Commission official cited \\"oversimplification\\" as the reason for restoring some characters. The language authority declared an open comment period until August 31, 2009 for feedback from the public.\\"China to regulate use of simplified characters \\", China View, August 12, 2009. Accessed 2009-08-17. The proposed orthographic changes to 44 characters were not implemented due to overwhelmingly negative public opinion. The officially promulgated version of the Table of General Standard Chinese Characters, announced in 2013, contained 45 newly recognized standard characters that were previously considered variant forms, as well as official approval of 226 characters that had been simplified by analogy and had seen wide use but were not explicitly given in previous lists or documents. =Singapore and Malaysia= Singapore underwent three successive rounds of character simplification, eventually arriving at the same set of simplified characters as Mainland China. The first round, consisting of 498 Simplified characters from 502 Traditional characters, was promulgated by the Ministry of Education in 1969. The second round, consisting of 2287 Simplified characters, was promulgated in 1974. The second set contained 49 differences from the Mainland China system; those were removed in the final round in 1976. In 1993, Singapore adopted the six revisions made by Mainland China in 1986. However, unlike in mainland China where personal names may only be registered using simplified characters, parents have the option of registering their children's names in traditional characters in Singapore. Malaysia promulgated a set of simplified characters in 1981, which were also completely identical to the simplified characters used in Mainland China. Chinese-language schools use these. Traditional characters are still often seen on shop signs, calligraphy, and some newspapers in both countries. =Hong Kong= A small group called Dou Zi Sei () or Dou Zi Wui () attempted to introduce a special version of simplified characters using romanizations in the 1930s. Today, however, the traditional characters remain dominant in Hong Kong. =Japan= After World War II, Japan also simplified a number of Chinese characters (kanji) used in the Japanese language. The new forms are called shinjitai. Compared to Chinese, the Japanese reform was more limited, simplifying only a few hundred characters. Further, the list of simplifications was exhaustive, unlike Chinese simplification ‚Äì thus analogous simplifications of not explicitly simplified characters (extended shinjitai) are not approved, and instead standard practice is to use the traditional forms. The number of characters in circulation was also reduced, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established. The overall effect was to standardize teaching and the use of Kanji in modern literature and media. Method of simplification ;Structural simplification of characters :All characters simplified this way are enumerated in Chart 1 and Chart 2 in Jianhuazi zong biao (), \\"Complete List of Simplified Characters\\" announced in 1986. : Chart 1 lists all 350 characters that are used by themselves, and can never serve as 'simplified character components'. : Chart 2 lists 132 characters that are used by themselves as well as utilized as simplified character components to further derive other simplified characters. Chart 2 also lists 14 'components' or 'radicals' that cannot be used by themselves, but can be generalized for derivation of more complex characters. ;Derivation based on simplified character components : Chart 3 lists 1,753 characters which are simplified based on the same simplification principles used for character components and radicals in Chart 2. This list is non-exhaustive, so if a character is not already found in Chart 1, 2 or 3, but can be simplified in accordance with Chart 2, the character should be simplified. ;Elimination of variants of the same character : Series One Organization List of Variant Characters accounts for some of the orthography difference between Mainland China on the one hand, and Hong Kong and Taiwan on the other. These are not simplifications of character structures, but rather reduction in number of total standard characters. For each set of variant characters that share the identical pronunciation and meaning, one character (usually the simplest in form) is elevated to the standard character set, and the rest are obsoleted. After rounds of revisions, by 1993, some 1,027 variant characters have been declared obsolete by this list. Amongst the chosen variants, those that appear in the \\"Complete List of Simplified Characters\\" are also simplified in character structure accordingly. ;Adoption of new standardized character forms : New standardized character forms originated from the \\"List of character forms of General Used Chinese characters for Publishing\\" containing 6,196 characters, published in 1965. The new forms tend to adopt vulgar variant forms for most of its characters. The List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese list, published in 1988, contains 7,000 commonly used characters, and replaces the 1965 list. Since the new forms take vulgar variants, many characters now appear slightly simpler compared to old forms, and as such are often mistaken as structurally simplified characters. =Structural simplification of characters= All characters simplified this way are enumerated in Chart 1 and Chart 2 in the Complete List of Simplified Characters. Characters in both charts are structurally simplified based on similar set of principles. They are separated into two charts to clearly mark those in Chart 2 as 'usable as simplified character components', based on which Chart 3 is derived.All examples listed here are sourced from ÁÆÄÂåñÂ≠ó#Â≠óÂûãÁµêÊßãÁ∞°Âåñ#Á∞°ÂåñÊñπÊ≥ï where all entries are associated with proper references. Merging two or more usually homophonous characters : : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Using printed forms of cursive shapes (): : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Replacing a component of a character with a simple arbitrary symbol (such as and ): : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Omitting entire components: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí Ê∞î; etc. Further morphing a character after omitting some components: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Preserving the basic outline or shape of the original character : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Replacing the phonetic component of phono- semantic compound characters: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Replacing uncommon phonetic component of a character with a more common one: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Replacing entire character with a newly coined phono-semantic compound character: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Removing radicals from characters : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Only retaining radicals from characters : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Adopting obscure ancient forms or variants:This is very similar to the 'elimination of variants of the same character' in \\"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\\", except that these eliminations happen in Chart 1 and Chart 2 of \\"Complete List of Simplified Characters\\". Characters simplified in Chart 2 can be further used for derivation of Chart 3, but those chosen in \\"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\\" cannot. : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Adopting ancient vulgar variants: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Re-adopting abandoned phonetic-loan characters: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Modifying a traditional character to simplify another traditional character: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. =Derivation based on simplified character components= Based on 132 characters and 14 components listed in Chart 2 of the Complete List of Simplified Characters, the 1,753 'derived' characters found in the non-exhaustive Chart 3 can be created by systematically simplifying components using Chart 2 as a conversion table. While exercising such derivation, following rules should be observed: * The \\"Complete List of Simplified Characters\\" employs character components, not the traditional definition of radicals. A component refers to any conceivable part of a character, regardless of its position within the character, or its relative size compared to other components in the same character. For instance, in the character , not only is (a traditional radical) considered a component, but so is . ** Each of the 132 simplified characters in Chart 2, when used as a component in compound characters, systematically simplify compound characters in exactly the same way the Chart 2 character itself was simplified. For instance, is simplified in Chart 2 to . Based on the same principle, these derivations can be made: ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. ** The 14 simplified components in Chart 2 are never used alone as individual characters. They only serve as components. Example of derived simplification based on the component , simplified to (18px), include: ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. * Chart 1 collects 352 simplified characters that generally cannot be used as components. Even in rare cases where a Chart 1 character is found as a component in a compound character, the compound character cannot be simplified in the same way. For instance, is simplified in Chart 1 to , but cannot be simplified to . * A character that is already explicitly listed as simplified character in the \\"Complete List of Simplified Characters\\" cannot be alternatively simplified based on derivation. For instance, and are simplified in Chart 1 to and respectively, thus they cannot be simplified alternatively by derivation via and in Chart 2 to and . is simplified in Chart 2 to , thus it cannot be alternatively derived via in Chart 2 as . Sample Derivations: : ‚Üí (18px), thus ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. : ‚Üí , thus ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. : ‚Üí , thus ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. : ‚Üí , thus ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. : ‚Üí , thus ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. : ‚Üí , thus ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. : =Elimination of variants of the same character= The \\"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\\" reduces the number of total standard characters. First, amongst each set of variant characters sharing identical pronunciation and meaning, one character (usually the simplest in form) is elevated to the standard character set, and the rest are obsoleted. Then amongst the chosen variants, those that appear in the \\"Complete List of Simplified Characters\\" are also simplified in character structure accordingly. Some examples follow: Sample reduction of equivalent variants: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí etc. In choosing standard characters, often ancient variants with simple structures are preferred: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. Vulgar forms simpler in structure are also chosen: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. The chosen variant was already simplified in Chart 1: : ‚Üí ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ‚Üí ; etc. In some instance, the chosen variant is actually more complex than eliminated ones. An example is the character which is eliminated in favor of the variant form . Note that the \\"hand\\" radical , with three strokes, on the left of the eliminated is now \\"seen\\" as more complex, appearing as the \\"tree\\" radical , with four strokes, in the chosen variant . Not all characters standardised in the Simplified set consists of fewer strokes. For instance, the traditional character , with 11 strokes is standardised as , with 12 strokes, which is a variant character. Such characters do not constitute simplified characters. =Adoption of new standardized character forms= The new standardized character forms started in the \\"List of character forms of General Used Chinese characters for Publishing\\" and revised through the \\"List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese\\" tend to adopt vulgar variant character forms. Since the new forms take vulgar variants, many characters now appear slightly simpler compared to old forms, and as such are often mistaken as structurally simplified characters. Some examples follow: The traditional component becomes : : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. The traditional component becomes : : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. The traditional \\"Break\\" stroke becomes the \\"Dot\\" stroke: : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. The traditional components and become : : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. The traditional component becomes : : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. The traditional component becomes : : ‚Üí ; ‚Üí ; etc. =Inconsistencies= A commonly cited example of the irregularity of simplification involving characters that share the \\"hand\\" component , which is used in many simplified characters. While there is an observable pattern involving the replacement of ¶∞© with Âèà as seen in ‚Üí , ‚Üí , ‚Üí , ‚Üí , ‚Üí , etc., when observing that ‚Üí , ‚Üí , ‚Üí , (not simplified) and (not simplified), an inconsistency arises. This is due to the fact that in the Complete List of Simplified Characters, ‚Üí appears in Chart 1 while ‚Üí is listed in Chart 2 and ‚Üí as a derived character in the non-exhaustive list in Chart 3. Therefore, is defined as a 'simplified character component' according to the standard, while is not. Based on , is simplified to , and to . Since both ‚Üí and ‚Üí appear in Chart 1, they are not defined as derived characters. There are therefore no characters or components found in Chart 2 usable for derivation of and . Further investigation reveals that these two characters do not appear in Chart 1 nor in \\"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\\". Thus they are remain unchanged from traditional forms in the \\"List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese\\". Distribution and use The east square of Guangzhou railway station in 1991. Notice the prevalence of traditional Chinese characters as brand logos during that time, including Jianlibao (ÂÅ•ÂäõÂÆù), Rejoice (È£ÑÊüî) and Âπø‰∏ú‰∏áÂÆ∂‰πê, only Head & Shoulders (Êµ∑È£û‰∏ù) printed in simplified. In Mainland China, it is legal to design brand logos in traditional characters, yet, by 2020, apart from Jianlibao, the other three change to simplified. The slogan (Zh√†n w√∫b√π sh√®ng de M√°o Z√©d≈çng sƒ´xi«éng w√†nsu√¨!; Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!), in simplified script, on Xinhua Gate in Beijing. The People's Republic of China and Singapore generally use simplified characters. They appear very sparingly in printed text produced in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities, although they are becoming more prevalent as China opens to the world. Conversely, the mainland is seeing an increase in the use of traditional forms, where they are often used on signs, and in logos, blogs, dictionaries, and scholarly works. =Mainland China= The Law of the People's Republic of China on the National Common Language and Characters implies simplified Chinese as the standard script, with Traditional Chinese being used for purposes such as ceremonies, cultural purposes (e.g. calligraphy), decoration, publications and books on ancient literature and poetry, and research purposes. Traditional Chinese remains ubiquitous on buildings predating the promotion of simplified characters, such as former government buildings, religious buildings, educational institutions, and historical monuments. Traditional Chinese is also often used for commercial purposes, such as shopfront displays and advertisements. As part of the one country, two systems model, the PRC has not attempted to force Hong Kong or Macau into using simplified characters. The PRC tends to print material intended for people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese in Traditional characters. For example, it prints versions of the People's Daily in Traditional characters and both the People's Daily and Xinhua websites have versions in Traditional characters using Big5 encoding. Mainland companies selling products in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan use Traditional characters on their displays and packaging to communicate with consumers (the reverse is true as well). Dictionaries published in mainland China generally show both simplified and their Traditional counterparts. In digital media, many cultural phenomena imported from Hong Kong and Taiwan into mainland China, such as music videos, karaoke videos, subtitled movies, and subtitled dramas, use Traditional Chinese characters. =Hong Kong= Textbooks, official statements, newspapers, including the PRC-funded media, show no signs of moving to simplified Chinese characters. However, some students may opt to use the simplified form when taking notes or doing test papers to write faster. It is common for Hong Kong people to learn traditional Chinese characters in school, and some simplified Chinese in passing (either through reading mainland-published books or other media). For use on computers, however, people tend to type Chinese characters using a traditional character set such as Big5. In Hong Kong, as well as elsewhere, it is common for people who use both sets to do so because it is much easier to convert from the traditional character set to the simplified character set because of the usage of the aforementioned methods 8 and 9 of simplification. =Taiwan= Simplified Chinese characters are not officially used in governmental and civil publications in Taiwan. However, it is legal to import simplified character publications and distribute them. Certain simplified characters that have long existed in informal writing for centuries also have popular usage, while those characters simplified originally by the Taiwanese government are much less common in daily appearance. In all areas, most handwritten text will include informal simplifications (alternative script) which are not the same as the simplifications officially promulgated by the PRC and are often instead influenced by the shinjitai used in Japan. The informal simplification of the first character of \\"Taiwan\\" from to rivals its orthodox form in commonality, even in print and in answers to school exams. This character is also used in the names of Taipei in Taiwan and Sendai in Japan, even though their respective governments do not official use simplified characters. This is because the adoption of simplified characters has been gradual and predates the Chinese Civil War by several decades and some are used beyond mainland China to some extent . =Singapore and Malaysia= In Singapore, where Mandarin Chinese is one of the official languages, simplified characters are the official standard and are generally used in all official publications as well as the government-controlled press. While simplified characters are taught exclusively in schools and are generally used in all official publications, the government does not officially discourage the use of traditional characters and still allow parents to choose whether to have their child's Chinese name registered in simplified or traditional characters. Furthermore, traditional characters are widely used by older generations and are widespread on signboards, stall menus, decorations, etc. In Malaysia, Chinese is not an official language, but over 90% of ethnic-Chinese students are educated in Chinese schools, which have taught simplified characters since 1981. Likewise, traditional characters are also widely used by older generations and are widespread on signboards, etc., albeit more common than in Singapore. Most of Malaysia's Chinese newspapers compromise by retaining traditional characters in article headlines but using simplified characters for content. As there is no restriction of the use of traditional characters in the mass media, television programmes, books, magazines and music CD's that have been imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan are widely available, and these almost always use traditional characters. Most karaoke discs, being imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan, have song lyrics in traditional characters as well. Many shop signs continue to be written in traditional characters.Êñ∞Âä†Âù°Ê±âÂ≠óËßÑËåÉÁöÑÂõûÈ°æ‰∏éÂâçÁûªÔºåË∞¢‰∏ñÊ∂ØÔºåËèØË™ûÊ©ã Menus in hawker centres and coffee shops are also commonly seen in traditional characters. Education In general, schools in Mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore use simplified characters exclusively, while schools in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan use traditional characters exclusively. Today, simplified Chinese characters predominate among college and university programs teaching Chinese as a foreign language outside of China, such as those in the United States. =Mainland China= In December 2004, Ministry of education authorities rejected a proposal from a Beijing CPPCC political conference member that called for elementary schools to teach traditional Chinese characters in addition to the simplified ones. The conference member pointed out that many, especially young people, have difficulties with traditional Chinese characters; this is especially important in dealing with non-mainland communities such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. The educational authorities did not approve the recommendation, saying that it did not fit in with the \\"requirements as set out by the law\\" and it could potentially complicate the curricula. A similar proposal was delivered to the 1st Plenary Session of the 11th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March 2008. =Hong Kong= Most, if not all, Chinese language text books in Hong Kong are written in traditional characters. Before 1997, the use of simplified characters was generally discouraged by educators. After 1997, while students are still expected to be proficient and utilize traditional characters in formal settings, they may sometimes adopt a hybrid written form in informal settings to speed up writing. With the exception of open examinations, simplified Chinese characters are considered acceptable by the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority for their speed. =Singapore and Malaysia= Chinese textbooks in Singapore and Malaysia are written exclusively in simplified characters, and only simplified characters are taught in school. Traditional characters are usually only taught to those taking up calligraphy as a co-curricular activity or Cantonese as an elective course at school. =Chinese as a foreign language= As the source of many Mandarin Chinese textbooks is mainland China, the majority of textbooks teaching Chinese are now based on simplified characters and Hanyu Pinyin ‚Äì although there are textbooks originating in China which have a traditional version. For practical reasons, universities and schools prepare students who will be able to communicate with mainland China, so their obvious choice is to use simplified characters. In places where a particular set is not locally entrenched, e.g., Europe and the United States, instruction is now mostly simplified, as the economic importance of mainland China increases, and also because of the availability of textbooks printed in mainland China. Teachers of international students often recommend learning both systems. Europe In the United Kingdom, universities mainly teach Mandarin Chinese at the undergraduate level using the simplified characters coupled with pinyin. However, they will require the students to learn or be able to recognise the traditional forms if they are studying in Taiwan or Hong Kong (such as taking Cantonese courses). In Australia and New Zealand, schools, universities and TAFEs use predominantly simplified characters. Russia and most East European nations are traditionally oriented on the education of the PRC's system for teaching Chinese, which uses simplified characters but exposes the learners to both systems. East Asia In South Korea, universities have used predominantly simplified characters since 1990s. In high school, Chinese is one of the selective subjects. By the regulation of the national curricula standards, MPS I and traditional characters had been originally used before (since the 1940s), but by the change of regulation, pinyin and simplified characters have been used to pupils who enter the school in 1996 or later. Therefore, MPS I and traditional characters disappeared after 1998 in South Korean high school Chinese curriculum. In Japan there are two types of schools. Simplified Chinese is taught instead of traditional Chinese in pro-mainland China schools. They also teach Pinyin, a romanization system for standard Chinese, while the Taiwan-oriented schools teach Zhuyin, which uses phonetic symbols. However, the Taiwan-oriented schools are starting to teach simplified Chinese and Pinyin to offer a more well-rounded education. Southeast Asia In the Philippines, the use of simplified characters is getting more and more popular. Before the 1970s, Chinese schools in the Philippines were under the supervision of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China. Hence, most books were using the Traditional Characters. Traditional Characters remained prevalent until the early 2000s. However, institutions like the Confucius Institute, being the cultural arm of the People's Republic of China, are strong proponents of the use of Simplified Characters. Also, many new schools are now importing their Mandarin textbooks from Singapore instead of Taiwan. Public universities such as the Linguistics and Asian Languages Department of the University of the Philippines use Simplified Characters in their teaching materials. On the other hand, private schools such as Chiang Kai Shek College and Saint Jude Catholic School remain major proponents of the usage of Traditional Characters. However, some private universities, such as the Ateneo de Manila University, now use Simplified Characters. Computer encoding and fonts In computer text applications, the GB encoding scheme most often renders simplified Chinese characters, while Big5 most often renders traditional characters. Although neither encoding has an explicit connection with a specific character set, the lack of a one-to-one mapping between the simplified and traditional sets established a de facto linkage. Since simplified Chinese conflated many characters into one and since the initial version of the GB encoding scheme, known as GB2312-80, contained only one code point for each character, it is impossible to use GB2312 to map to the bigger set of traditional characters. It is theoretically possible to use Big5 code to map to the smaller set of simplified character glyphs, although there is little market for such a product. Newer and alternative forms of GB have support for traditional characters. In particular, mainland authorities have now established GB 18030 as the official encoding standard for use in all mainland software publications. The encoding contains all East Asian characters included in Unicode 3.0. As such, GB 18030 encoding contains both simplified and traditional characters found in Big-5 and GB, as well as all characters found in Japanese and Korean encodings. Unicode deals with the issue of simplified and traditional characters as part of the project of Han unification by including code points for each. This was rendered necessary by the fact that the linkage between simplified characters and traditional characters is not one-to-one. While this means that a Unicode system can display both simplified and traditional characters, it also means that different localization files are needed for each type. The Chinese characters used in modern Japanese (called Kanji characters) have also undergone simplification, but generally to a lesser extent than with simplified Chinese. It is worth mentioning that Japan's writing system utilizes a reduced number of Chinese characters in daily use, resulting partly from the Japanese language reforms; thus, a number of complex characters are written phonetically. Reconciling these different character sets in Unicode became part of the controversial process of Han unification. Not surprisingly, some of the Chinese characters used in Japan are neither 'traditional' nor 'simplified'. In this case, these characters cannot be found in traditional/simplified Chinese dictionaries. In font filenames and descriptions the acronym SC is used to signify the use of Simplified Chinese characters to differentiate fonts that use TC for traditional Chinese characters. Web pages The World Wide Web Consortium's Internationalization working group recommends the use of the language tag as a language attribute value and Content-Language value to specify web-page content in simplified Chinese characters.Richard Ishida (editor): Best Practice 13: Using Hans and Hant codes in Internationalization Best Practices: Specifying Language in XHTML & HTML Content ‚Äì W3C Working Group Note 12 April 2007. Criticism There are ongoing disputes among users of Chinese characters related to the introduction of simplified Chinese characters. Author Liu Shahe was an outspoken critic of the simplification of Chinese characters. He wrote a dedicated column entitled \\"Simplified Characters are Unreasonable\\" (ÁÆÄÂåñÂ≠ó‰∏çËÆ≤ÁêÜ) in the Chinese edition of the Financial Times.

Located near the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip, it is owned by Westgate Resorts and operated by Paragon Gaming. It opened in 1969 as the International Hotel, and was known for many years as the Las Vegas Hilton, then briefly as the LVH ‚Äì Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, until taking its current name in 2014. From 1981 to 1990, it was the largest hotel in the world. Facilities The Westgate is located on a site on the east side of Paradise Road, approximately east of Las Vegas Boulevard. It is adjacent to the Las Vegas Convention Center to the south and Las Vegas Country Club to the east. The hotel has 2,956 rooms. The hotel tower is tall, with 30 floors. The top floor consists of three \\"Sky Villas\\" geared towards \\"high roller\\" customers, each with a private swimming pool and at least of space. The casino has of gaming space as of 2017, with 576 slot machines, 38 table games, 10 poker tables, and a race and sports book. The casino's sportsbook, the SuperBook, is billed as the largest in the world. The Westgate has various eateries, including fine dining restaurants, a buffet, and a food court. Benihana Village, opened in 1974, is a Japanese-themed area with streams and gardens, with several restaurants centered around its namesake teppanyaki grill. The Westgate's convention center has of event space, including the Paradise Event Center (formerly the Hilton Center) and the Pavilion (formerly the Hilton Pavilion). Recreation amenities at the Westgate include a pool deck, a fitness center, a spa, and six tennis courts. The hotel also has several retail shops, a wedding chapel, and a business center. The Westgate station of the Las Vegas Monorail is located at the front of the property. History =International Hotel (1969‚Äì1971)= A photo postcard of the International Hotel. Newspaper advertisement for the 1969 grand opening of the hotel. The hotel site was previously part of the grounds of Las Vegas Park, a defunct racetrack. In 1965, the track site was purchased by National Equities, a real estate development firm chaired by Marvin Kratter. Kratter announced development plans for the site to include a 40-floor, 1,500-room hotel, as well as a golf course and private homes. Meanwhile, Kirk Kerkorian, the chairman of Trans International Airlines and landlord of Caesars Palace, began formulating plans to build a 1,000-room casino hotel in Las Vegas. After considering several potential locations, he selected the racetrack site, reasoning that it was natural to put a hotel next to the Convention Center. Kratter had decided not to build a hotel himself, and in 1967, National Equities sold a portion of the site to Kerkorian for $5 million. Kerkorian announced that he would build a 30-story hotel with 1,510 rooms, at a cost of $50 million. Some believed it was very risky to build such a property away from the Strip, but Kerkorian believed that it would spark the development of a \\"second Strip\\" along Paradise Road. Kerkorian's hotel would be named the International Hotel, matching the name of Kratter's International Country Club (now the Las Vegas Country Club). He hired airline executive Fred Benninger to oversee the development, and Martin Stern, Jr., who had designed several noted Las Vegas high-rises, as the hotel's architect. The general contractor selected to build the hotel was Taylor Construction Co. Construction began with an elaborate groundbreaking ceremony in February 1968. With planning for the hotel underway, Kerkorian purchased the Flamingo casino, to serve as a training ground for the International's staff. (Part 2 of article) Later, during the International's construction, Kerkorian formed the publicly traded company International Leisure to own the two casinos. Howard Hughes, the eccentric billionaire who had purchased several Las Vegas casinos, saw Kerkorian as a rival and the International as unwelcome competition. He attempted to deter Kerkorian from building the project, first by making a sham announcement of a major planned expansion of his Sands Hotel, and then by conveying false claims to Kerkorian about damage to buildings from nearby nuclear tests. When these ruses failed, Hughes schemed to buy the project from Kerkorian and halt its construction, but this plan came to nothing. Ultimately, Hughes decided to compete head-on with the International by purchasing the unfinished Landmark Hotel and Casino, located across the street. Hughes completed construction of the Landmark and opened it one day before Kerkorian's hotel. The International Hotel opened on July 2, 1969. At the time, it was Nevada's tallest building and largest hotel. Entertainment director Bill Miller signed Barbra Streisand to open in the showroom, along with Peggy Lee performing in the hotel's lounge. In keeping with the hotel's name, rooms were furnished with different international decors, with each floor featuring either a Spanish, Italian, or French theme. There was also a complex of international restaurants, offering Bavarian, Italian, Japanese and Mexican cuisines. Employees were outfitted in costumes from different cultures, such as Scottish kilts, Slavic shirts, and French gendarme uniforms. On July 31, 1969, immediately following Streisand's engagement, Elvis Presley performed the first show of what would become a seven-year run at the hotel, encompassing 636 consecutive sold-out shows. Presley's appearances became a major part of the hotel's identity, and an iconic chapter in the history of Las Vegas entertainment. Late in 1969, Kerkorian made plans to raise $29 million through a secondary offering of International Leisure stock. He needed the money to help pay off loans that he had taken out to purchase major stakes in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Western Airlines. The offering was rejected, however, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, because the company was unable to provide five years of financial history for the Flamingo. Short on cash, Kerkorian was forced to put International Leisure up for sale. =Las Vegas Hilton (1971‚Äì2012)= The Las Vegas Hilton in the early 1970s In 1970 and 1971, Kerkorian sold his shares of International Leisure to Hilton Hotels. The International was renamed in July 1971 as the Las Vegas Hilton. Hilton took complete ownership in 1972, acquiring all outstanding shares of International Leisure. The hotel had performed unevenly in its early years as the International, but as the Hilton, it soon came to be regarded as the most successful hotel in Las Vegas. An east tower extension with 620 rooms was completed in 1975 at a cost of $20 million. In 1977, the hotel opened the Hilton Pavilion, a $7.5-million venue for sports and entertainment events, with a seating capacity of up to 5,000 people. A $23-million expansion added another 644 rooms to the north tower. The general contractor selected to build the expansion was Del E. Webb Corporation. Ground was broken in 1977 and it was completed in 1979. 1981 fire On the night of February 10, 1981, a major fire occurred at the Hilton. Philip Bruce Cline, a hotel busboy who was under the influence of drugs, set fire to a curtain in an elevator lobby on the eighth floor of the east tower. The fire spread to the exterior of the tower and then traveled up to the top of the building within 25 minutes. Eight people were killed, and approximately 350 were injured, including 48 firefighters. Among the victims treated for smoke inhalation was singer Natalie Cole. The casino and hotel reopened nine days after the fire with 1,000 available rooms. The rest of the rooms were repaired over the following three months, at an estimated cost of $10 million. Cline was convicted in 1982 of arson and murder, and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Hilton and other companies involved in the hotel paid a $23 million settlement to victims. The tragedy, in combination with the MGM Grand fire that had occurred months earlier, inspired major changes to Nevada's fire safety regulations. 1981‚Äì2012 Hotel with former Hilton logo and branding. Around the end of 1981, another extension to the north tower was completed, adding 391 rooms at a cost of $21 million. This made the Las Vegas Hilton the largest hotel in the world, with a total of 3,174 rooms. (The Rossiya Hotel in Moscow had more rooms, but was not deemed to be a larger hotel by the Guinness Book of World Records because many of its rooms were used as dormitories.) It held this title until 1990, when it was surpassed by the Flamingo. In 1984, the hotel completed construction of the $10-million Hilton Center, a convention and event space at the southwest corner of the property, west of the Hilton Pavilion. In 1986, amid growing popularity of sports betting in Nevada, the Hilton opened its race and sports book, the Superbook, at a cost of $17 million. In 1991, the Hilton was at the center of the Tailhook scandal, in which numerous United States Navy officers were accused of acts of sexual assault during a convention at the hotel. One of the victims, Paula Coughlin, sued the Hilton for providing inadequate security for the convention, and eventually was paid a $5.2 million judgment. The lawsuit led Hilton to successfully lobby for the so-called \\"Tailhook bill\\", a state law shielding hotels from liability for injuries to patrons caused by third parties. The Las Vegas Hilton sign, at , is the tallest free-standing advertising sign in the world The hotel completed a new , $4-million marquee sign in 1994. Later that year, however, it was partially destroyed by a windstorm. The sign was reconstructed in 1997 for $9 million with a reduced height of , making it the world's tallest free-standing advertising sign. In 1994, the hotel entered an arrangement with the Sahara Country Club, which was renamed as the Las Vegas Hilton Country Club. This lasted until 1997, when the course became the Las Vegas National Golf Club. Hilton attempted to buy the neighboring Las Vegas Country Club the following year, but its $60-million offer was rejected. In 1995, the Hilton completed a $40-million renovation of its penthouse floor to construct the Sky Villas. The hotel also spent $12 million on a new room for baccarat, a favorite game of Asian high rollers. The Hilton at the time was one of only four Las Vegas casinos able to compete for the business of the \\"whales\\", the top tier of high rollers. In 1998, Hilton spun off its casino properties, including the Las Vegas Hilton, as Park Place Entertainment. Hilton's timeshare arm, Hilton Grand Vacations, began construction of a complex at the northeast corner of the property in 1998. It opened in 1999 with 230 suites. Around 1999, Park Place began seeking a buyer for the Las Vegas Hilton, because the company hoped to concentrate on its properties on the Las Vegas Strip, especially the newly acquired Caesars Palace. In 2000, Park Place agreed to sell the Hilton to Edward Roski Jr. for $365 million. Roski planned to transform the Hilton to shift its focus away from high rollers and toward convention attendees. The deal fell through, however, and the property was locked up in litigation between Park Place and Roski until 2003, when they settled their claims against each other. The Las Vegas Monorail opened in 2004, with one of its stations located at the Hilton. The system had been under construction since 2001. Hilton had led the group of hotels that had promulgated the proposal for the monorail as early as 1996. In June 2004, Caesars Entertainment (formerly Park Place) sold the Las Vegas Hilton to Colony Capital for $280 million. Colony partnered in the purchase with Goldman Sachs, which also lent $200 million of the purchase price. In 2005, the Hilton was placed under the banner of Colony's newly formed casino affiliate, Resorts International Holdings, which was headquartered at the property. The Hilton prospered in its first few years under Colony's management, but began losing money in the face of the Great Recession and an oversupply of hotel rooms in Las Vegas. In June 2011, the Hilton began defaulting on payments to Goldman Sachs on the loan. The same month, Hilton Worldwide opted to terminate its franchise agreement with the property, effective at the end of the year, because the facilities had fallen below the standards of the Hilton brand. Goldman Sachs issued a foreclosure notice in September 2011. At Goldman's request, a court appointed a receiver to take control of the property. =LVH (2012‚Äì2014)= On January 3, 2012, the Las Vegas Hilton became the LVH ‚Äì Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, as the contract to use the Hilton brand ended. Colony Capital initially tried to fight against foreclosure of the property, but ultimately concluded that its equity in the LVH was worthless, and agreed to let the foreclosure proceed. Goldman Sachs formed a joint venture with Gramercy Capital to acquire the property. They bought the property at its foreclosure auction in October 2012, where they were the only bidder. The Navegante Group was retained to manage the LVH on their behalf. In 2013, the LVH affiliated with the Leo Hotel Collection, a network of independent hotels newly created by Red Lion Hotels. =Westgate Las Vegas (2014‚Äìpresent)= On June 30, 2014, timeshare developer Westgate Resorts bought the LVH from Goldman and Gramercy for a price between $150 and $170 million. Westgate CEO David Siegel was hoisted to the top of the hotel's sign the following day to begin removing the letters \\"LVH\\" to make way for the property's new name, Westgate Las Vegas. Siegel stated that the company would spend at least $160 million on renovations, and that it would begin converting hotel rooms into timeshare units. According to Siegel, the timeshare conversion would take 15 to 20 years, and, even after its completion, at least 30 percent of the units would remain available as hotel rooms at any given time. Westgate retained Paragon Gaming to replace Navegante as the property's manager in 2015. Architecture Martin Stern designed the hotel in the International Style of architecture. Architect Stefan Al described the building's aesthetics as a milestone in the corporatization of Las Vegas: \\"Characterized by its rectilinear forms and bare surfaces, stripped of ornamentation, this elite form of architecture stood miles away from the Mafia-tainted neon of existing casinos.\\" Architecture critic Alan Hess also noted the simplicity of the International (and the nearby Landmark Hotel) in comparison to older casinos: \\"As singular, self-contained forms, they showed none of the complexity of the different pieces and sequential additions that made the original Strip visually and urbanistically richer.\\" The UNESCO Headquarters building, which inspired the Y-shaped plan for the hotel tower The Y-shaped plan for the hotel tower was inspired by the UNESCO Headquarters building; it was chosen to maximize the number of rooms that could be fit into a square plot while allowing each room to have a satisfactory view. This design was imitated by later Las Vegas hotels such as the Mirage, Mandalay Bay, and Venetian. The International has been cited as the first Las Vegas \\"megaresort\\" (though that distinction is often instead credited to the Mirage, opened in 1989). It was the first to house all of the hotel's functions in a single large structure, whereas earlier casinos had housed them in separate buildings. The design of the property, along with the next Kerkorian/Stern project, the original MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, had a major influence on the development of the modern casino resort. As gaming historian David G. Schwartz describes it: Entertainment =International Theater= Las Vegas Hilton marquee in 1993 The property's main entertainment venue is the 1,607-seat International Theater. Since 2018, the theater hosts Barry Manilow's residency show, The Hits Come Home. From the opening of the hotel in 1969, the main showroom was a \\"star policy\\" venue, meaning that popular musical artists and comedians were booked to perform for two to four weeks at a time. The typical schedule comprised two shows per night: a dinner show at 8pm and a cocktail show at midnight. One of the most famous engagements at the hotel was that of singer and pianist Liberace. A longtime mainstay of Las Vegas showrooms, Liberace debuted at the Hilton in 1972, and began appearing regularly in 1973. He performed in the showroom for as many as 17 weeks out of the year, earning as much as $175,000 per week. Liberace's shows were known for his flamboyant costumes and for his being driven onstage in a Rolls Royce limousine. He appeared at the Hilton as late as 1982. Hilton chairman Barron Hilton remembered Liberace as \\"one of the most popular entertainers ever to grace the stage of the Las Vegas Hilton showroom.\\" In 1982, the production show Bal du Moulin Rouge opened in the theater, featuring a cast of acrobats, dancers, and variety acts. The show centered around a 45-minute slot for a headline performer, which was filled at times by Suzanne Somers, Charo, and others. Shifting to a production show was intended to reduce the Hilton's entertainment costs by avoiding the need to book bigger stars, whose salaries had been spiraling ever higher. The show closed in 1986, and the theater returned to star policy. Singer Wayne Newton, another longtime Las Vegas star, headlined the Hilton showroom from 1987 to 1993. By the end of his run, he was performing there twenty weeks out of the year, and was described as the highest-paid entertainer on the Las Vegas Strip. Newton's shows were known for beginning with him descending onto the stage in a spaceship amid a laser show. He made over 950 performances in total. In 1993, the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Starlight Express opened in the main theater. The Hilton Showroom was renamed as the Hilton Theatre, and underwent a $12-million renovation to add bridges and embankments to accommodate the show, which features performers on roller skates. The opening of the show was cited as part of a trend in Las Vegas toward family-friendly attractions and away from individual headliner acts. The show was signed to a five-year contract, but closed early in 1997 amid lagging ticket sales. The hotel then adopted a \\"limited star policy\\" for the theater, booking headline acts for runs of less than a week at a time. In the early 2000s, the theater kept a rotating stable of headliners who each performed for ten weeks out of the year, including at times The Commodores, The Righteous Brothers, Sheena Easton, The Fab Four, Engelbert Humperdinck, and The Smothers Brothers. Manilow began an extended run at the Hilton in 2005. His engagement was an early example of the trend of major recording artists establishing residency shows in Las Vegas, which was begun by Celine Dion at Caesars Palace in 2003. His show began as Manilow: Music and Passion, and was then revamped in 2008 as Ultimate Manilow: The Hits. The show ended in 2009. During the summer of 2006, Reba McEntire performed her residency show, Reba: Key to the Heart, which ran for five non-consecutive weeks.http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/arts_life/story.html?id=062d95b3-b558-4378-8a21-36a8b3349ee7 canada'com The American TV Game Show Hall of Fame logoThe $250,000 Game Show Spectacular ran from October 2007 to April 2008. The show rotated through three hosts: creator Bob Eubanks, Chuck Woolery, and Jamie Farr. A temporary \\"American TV Game Show Hall of Fame\\" opened and closed on site in conjunction with the show, inducting Peter Marshall, Hugh Downs, Wink Martindale, and Monty Hall. The concept was originated by entertainment publicist Jerry Digney. The logo was designed by Dan Acree. Recent long-running shows in the theater include the classic rock tribute show Raiding the Rock Vault, from 2013 to 2014, and the Prince tribute show Purple Reign, from 2016 to 2017. =Westgate Cabaret= Smaller shows are hosted in the 400-seat Westgate Cabaret. This venue hosts the adult revue Sexxy, running since 2015, and, since 2018, comedian George Wallace and magician Jen Kramer. Starting in the 1990s, the venue was known as The NightClub. Combining elements of a dance club and a traditional Las Vegas lounge, it helped pave the way for dance clubs to open in many Las Vegas casinos. The NightClub was renamed as the Shimmer Cabaret in 2004 when the Hilton came under the ownership of Colony Capital. Long-running acts at the Shimmer Cabaret included comedian David Brenner (2004‚Äì05), musical comedies Menopause the Musical (2006‚Äì09) and Nunsense (2010‚Äì13), show band The Scintas (2007‚Äì09), singer Lani Misalucha (2009‚Äì10), topless revue Sin City Bad Girls (2009‚Äì10), impressionists Greg London (2011‚Äì12) and Rich Little (2012‚Äì13), a Rat Pack tribute show led by Sandy Hackett (2011‚Äì13), Purple Reign (2014‚Äì16), and the \\"Icons of Comedy\\" series (2011‚Äì12), featuring comedians such as Gilbert Gottfried and Hal Sparks. In 2015, after the hotel was purchased by Westgate, the room was given its current name. Previous headliners at the Westgate Cabaret include funk band Cameo and comedian Vinnie Favorito, both from 2016 to 2017. Sign outside of the Star Trek attraction =Star Trek: The Experience= In January 1998, Star Trek: The Experience opened, featuring a motion simulator ride, a museum, and Quark's Bar. A portion of the casino floor was transformed into the SpaceQuest Casino, a space-themed casino complete with high-tech table games, which served as the gateway to the Experience. In March 2004, a new Borg Invasion 4D ride was added. The attraction closed in September 2008, after the operator, Cedar Fair, could not agree on terms for a renewed lease with the Hilton. =Elvis performances and legacy= Elvis Presley was signed for a four-week engagement in 1969 as the second performer to appear in the International's showroom, following Barbra Streisand. It would be his first public stage appearance in eight years. Presley's first show proved so popular that the hotel immediately signed him to a five-year contract for two month- long engagements per year. He would go on to perform a total of 636 shows at the hotel from 1969 to 1976, with every show sold out. Presley's run of performances at the Hilton was cut short by his death in August 1977. During his engagements at the hotel, Presley famously resided in the Imperial Suite on the 30th floor. Years after his death, the suite was renamed as the Elvis Presley Suite. It was demolished in 1994 to make way for the Sky Villas. Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, lived at the Hilton for several years after Presley's death, and was a fixture at the hotel as an entertainment consultant for much of the remainder of his life. Advertisement for Always Elvis, a convention held in the Hilton Pavilion in 1978 for Presley's fans The hotel has recognized and capitalized on Presley's legacy in assorted ways through the years. A year after his death, a bronze statute of Presley was unveiled at the hotel; it has since occupied various spots around the property. Various festivals and conventions for Elvis fans and impersonators have been held at the hotel. Elvis: An American Musical, a multimedia production incorporating archival footage with live songs and re-enactments, premiered at the Hilton showroom in 1988, where it ran for two months before going on a national tour. Elvis impersonator Trent Carlini performed at the Hilton in various runs, both on the main stage and in the cabaret, from 2000 to 2004 and again from 2010 to 2015. \\"Elvis: The Exhibition\\" opened at the Westgate in April 2015 in the former Star Trek attraction space. The exhibit, developed in association with Elvis Presley Enterprises, featured of artifacts and memorabilia from the singer's life. In conjunction with the opening of the exhibit, the hotel's theater was renamed as the Elvis Presley International Showroom, and was set to feature rotating shows inspired by Presley, starting with The Elvis Experience. The show fared poorly in its two-month run, however, and the plans for further shows did not materialize. The exhibition closed suddenly in February 2016, leading to a protracted legal dispute. In 2016, the Westgate successfully petitioned to rename the street leading from the hotel to Las Vegas Boulevard as Elvis Presley Boulevard.

Sporting events =Boxing= The hotel has a history as a prominent professional boxing venue. In 1969, the showroom hosted the first major boxing match held at a Las Vegas hotel, Sonny Liston vs. Leotis Martin (previous fights had been held at the Convention Center). The Hilton Pavilion was the site in 1978 of Leon Spinks's victory over Muhammad Ali for the world heavyweight championship, which is remembered as one of the biggest upsets in the sport's history. The hotel then took a seven-year hiatus from hosting boxing matches. In 1985, Donald Curry defeated Milton McCrory at the Hilton Center to unify and become the undisputed welterweight champion. The success of the Curry‚ÄìMcCrory fight led the Hilton to begin pursuing more major matches, to challenge Caesars Palace as the premier boxing venue in Las Vegas. The hotel struck a deal to host several fights in the heavyweight unification series, a tournament to establish an undisputed heavyweight champion. A 14,600-seat outdoor arena was temporarily erected in the Hilton's parking lot for some of the fights. The series culminated in Mike Tyson's defeat of Tony Tucker at the Hilton Center in 1987 to unify and become the undisputed champion. By 1995, the Hilton had reportedly backed away from seeking to host the biggest fights, because of escalating costs. The hotel hosted no boxing matches between 2002 and 2008; since then, it has occasionally hosted minor fights. =Other sports= The Hilton Pavilion hosted two nationally televised tennis events in 1978: the WCT Tournament of Champions and the World Team Tennis All-Star Match. The hotel was the venue for Evo 2014, a major competitive video gaming tournament.

Height controversy Tugela falls as it flows off the escarpment showing the first drop and cascade There is an argument that Tugela Falls is the tallest waterfall in the world, rather than the more commonly cited Angel Falls. This argument is based on two likely inaccuracies regarding the presumed heights of the respective falls. Firstly, many now believe Angel Falls is not as tall as was initially surveyed by American journalist Ruth Robertson in 1949. The quoted figure of corresponds almost precisely with the difference in altitude between the top of the falls and the confluence of the Rio Gauja and the Rio Churun, which is roughly away from the base of the Auyan Tepui escarpment and downstream from the last segment of the Rio Gauja that could possibly be considered a ‚Äòwaterfall‚Äô. The starting altitude of Angel Falls is often given as , from which the falls plunge a vertical , then proceed to cascade for approximately with relatively little altitude loss, before a final drop of below the Talus Rapids, near the famous viewpoint known as Mirador Laime. After this the Rio Gauja flows with very little altitude loss, with nothing approaching a waterfall or even cascade before it empties into the Rio Churun. However, the altitude of Mirador Laime is usually given as approximately , which would suggest that Angel Falls is only about 800 meters in total height (roughly the height of the first drop).http://www.sailblogs.com/member/voyageurc/?xjMsgID=110144http://www.sailblogs.com/member/voyageurc/?xjMsgID=105050 Angel Falls, however, is almost universally regarded as having the tallest single uninterrupted drop of any waterfall in the world (the total height of Tugela Falls, even though possibly the tallest on Earth, is divided into five smaller tiers, and its tallest individual tier is ).http://www.worldwaterfalldatabase.com/ Even this measurement invites some debate, however, as some botanical sources list the height of Angel Falls' tallest drop as , rather than the usually cited . Access At the right time of year, the falls are easily visible from the main road into the park, especially after a heavy rain. There is an undeveloped camp site and mountain hut immediately above the falls. There are two trails to Tugela Falls. The most spectacular trail is to the top of Mont-Aux-Sources, which starts at \\"The Sentinel\\" car park (through Phuthaditjhaba on the R57, approximately two hours drive from Royal Natal National Park via the R74, 90 minutes from Harrismith via the R712, or 80 minutes from Golden Gate Highlands National Park). From here it is a relatively easy climb to the top of the Amphitheatre, however it does take about 4.5 to 8 hours round-trip depending on fitness level. Access to the summit is via two chain ladders. This is the only day hiking trail which leads to the top of the Drakensberg escarpment. Another trail to the foot of the Tugela Falls starts at Royal Natal National Park. The easy gradient up the Tugela Gorge winds through indigenous forests. The last part of the hike to Tugela Falls is a boulder hop. A little chain ladder leads over the final stretch for a view of the falls rushing down the amphitheater in a series of five cascades.Tugela Falls, Drakensberg Tourism. Archived.

It was originally designed in the early 1980s at Bell Labs by Rob Pike with the help of Ken Thompson and other Unix developers for the Blit windowing terminal running on Unix; it was later ported to other systems. Sam follows a classical modular Unix aesthetic. It is internally simple, its power leveraged by the composability of a small command language and extensibility through shell integration. Design and features Sam is designed as two synchronous programs: a command interpreter and a mouse-oriented bitmap windowing interface. The interpreter's command set is modeled after the UNIX editor ed and may be used to operate the editor from a standard text terminal. By default, however, Sam presents its own graphical user interface (GUI) window, samterm, which additionally allows point-and-click operations through pop-up context menus. This two-process structure allowed sam to access files on networked host systems through remote execution of the file-access process while running the windowing interface locally, thereby bypassing latency over slow connections. Samterm presents windows to files being edited and to a persistent command window which accepts input as sam commands. Most common editing operations are quickly and naturally accomplished with the point-and- click interface, which also functions inside the command window. This latter fact allows commands to be edited (and resubmitted) just as any other text, a function inherited from the DMD 5620 terminal interface. =Command syntax= Sam's command syntax is formally similar to ed's or ex's, containing (structural-) regular expression based conditional and loop functions and scope addressing, even sharing some of ed's syntax for such functions. But while ed's commands are line-oriented, sam's are selection-oriented. Selections are contiguous strings of text (which may span multiple lines), and are specified either with the mouse (by sweeping it over a region of text) or by a pattern match. Sam's commands take such selections as basic‚Äîmore or less as other Unix tools treat lines; thus, multi-line and sub-line patterns are as naturally handled by Sam as whole-line patterns are by ed, vi, AWK, Perl, etc. This is implemented through a model called structural regular expressions, which can recursively apply regular-expression matching to obtain other (sub)selections within a given selection. In this way, sam's command set can be applied to substrings that are identified by arbitrarily complex context. Sam extends its basic text-editing command set to handling of multiple files, providing similar pattern-based conditional and loop commands for filename specification. Any sequence of text-editing commands may be applied as a unit to each such specification. =Infinite undos= Sam was one of the first text editors to support \\"infinite\\" undo to revert any number of editing errors. This feature, combined with Sam's facility to easily edit its own commands and, fundamentally, its small, orthogonal command set (containing only 33 commands), represent the program's bias toward a low learning threshold over other more expressive \\"power editors.\\" Endorsers Sam is the preferred text editor of several eminent programmers. It was the first full screen editor Ken Thompson liked.Interview:Rob Pike Responds, Posted by Roblimo on Monday October 18, 2004, Slashdot Sam is the text editor used by Bjarne Stroustrup, Brian Kernighan, Douglas McIlroy and Tom Duff.

It is well known for making its window management transparent to the application. This allows running rio inside of another window manager. History rio is the latest in a long series of graphical user interfaces developed at Bell Labs, mostly developed by Rob Pike, the concurrent window system, and the Blit (which predated X). rio was a complete rewrite of 8¬Ω in Alef. Its main change was that it stopped parsing and rewriting graphical commands and let the client write pixels directly. This was done mainly for efficiency. As Alef disappeared due to being too difficult to maintain given the number of people working on Plan 9 at the time, rio was rewritten in C. This was done using the Plan 9 thread library which was inspired by Alef and had most of its features, such as blocking channels for interthread and interprocess communication. Another important change, due more to the environment than to rio per se, is that rio supports full colour, using alpha compositing, whereas 8¬Ω uses bitblt operations. Design concepts Many of its features embody key Plan 9 design concepts: * Each window runs in its own private namespace. * It exports a file system interface to running applications. This interface is the same rio receives from the operating system, so rio can run inside a rio window without any special arrangements. Because the interface uses 9P, rio is network transparent even if it doesn't include any network-aware code. * Windows are treated as completely editable text.

The fracture of a solid usually occurs due to the development of certain displacement discontinuity surfaces within the solid. If a displacement develops perpendicular to the surface of displacement, it is called a normal tensile crack or simply a crack; if a displacement develops tangentially to the surface of displacement, it is called a shear crack, slip band, or dislocation. Brittle fractures occur with no apparent deformation before fracture; ductile fractures occur when visible deformation does occur before separation. Fracture strength or breaking strength is the stress when a specimen fails or fractures. A detailed understanding of how fracture occurs in materials may be assisted by the study of fracture mechanics. Strength thumbStress vs. strain curve typical of aluminum 1\\\\. Ultimate tensile strength 2\\\\. Yield strength 3\\\\. Proportional limit stress 4\\\\. Fracture 5\\\\. Offset strain (typically 0.2%) Fracture strength, also known as breaking strength, is the stress at which a specimen fails via fracture. This is usually determined for a given specimen by a tensile test, which charts the stress‚Äìstrain curve (see image). The final recorded point is the fracture strength. Ductile materials have a fracture strength lower than the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), whereas in brittle materials the fracture strength is equivalent to the UTS. If a ductile material reaches its ultimate tensile strength in a load-controlled situation, it will continue to deform, with no additional load application, until it ruptures. However, if the loading is displacement-controlled, the deformation of the material may relieve the load, preventing rupture. Types There are two types of fractures : =Brittle fracture= Brittle fracture in glass Fracture of an aluminum crank arm of a bicycle, where Bright= brittle fracture, Dark= fatigue fracture. In brittle fracture, no apparent plastic deformation takes place before fracture. Brittle fracture typically involves little energy absorption and occurs at high speeds‚Äîup to 2133.6 m/s (7000 ft/s) in steel. In most cases brittle fracture will continue even when loading is discontinued. In brittle crystalline materials, fracture can occur by cleavage as the result of tensile stress acting normal to crystallographic planes with low bonding (cleavage planes). In amorphous solids, by contrast, the lack of a crystalline structure results in a conchoidal fracture, with cracks proceeding normal to the applied tension. The theoretical strength of a crystalline material is (roughly) :\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{theoretical}= \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{E \\\\gamma}{r_o} } where: ‚Äì :Brittle cleavage fracture surface from a scanning electron microscopeE is the Young's modulus of the material, :\\\\gamma is the surface energy, and :r_o is the equilibrium distance between atomic centers. On the other hand, a crack introduces a stress concentration modeled by :\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{elliptical\\\\ crack}= \\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{applied}\\\\left(1 + 2 \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{a}{\\\\rho}}\\\\right)= 2 \\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{applied} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{a}{\\\\rho}} (For sharp cracks) where: ‚Äì :\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{applied} is the loading stress, :a is half the length of the crack, and :\\\\rho is the radius of curvature at the crack tip. Putting these two equations together, we get :\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{fracture}= \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{E \\\\gamma \\\\rho}{4 a r_o}}. Looking closely, we can see that sharp cracks (small \\\\rho) and large defects (large a) both lower the fracture strength of the material. Recently, scientists have discovered supersonic fracture, the phenomenon of crack propagation faster than the speed of sound in a material. This phenomenon was recently also verified by experiment of fracture in rubber-like materials. The basic sequence in a typical brittle fracture is: introduction of a flaw either before or after the material is put in service, slow and stable crack propagation under recurring loading, and sudden rapid failure when the crack reaches critical crack length based on the conditions defined by fracture mechanics. Brittle fracture may be avoided by controlling three primary factors: material fracture toughness (Kc), nominal stress level (œÉ), and introduced flaw size (a). Residual stresses, temperature, loading rate, and stress concentrations also contribute to brittle fracture by influencing the three primary factors. Under certain conditions, ductile materials can exhibit brittle behavior. Rapid loading, low temperature, and triaxial stress constraint conditions may cause ductile materials to fail without prior deformation. =Ductile fracture= Ductile failure of a specimen strained axially Schematic representation of the steps in ductile fracture (in pure tension) In ductile fracture, extensive plastic deformation (necking) takes place before fracture. The terms rupture or ductile rupture describe the ultimate failure of ductile materials loaded in tension. The extensive plasticity causes the crack to propagate slowly due to the absorption of a large amount of energy before fracture. Ductile fracture surface of 6061-T6 aluminum Because ductile rupture involves a high degree of plastic deformation, the fracture behavior of a propagating crack as modelled above changes fundamentally. Some of the energy from stress concentrations at the crack tips is dissipated by plastic deformation ahead of the crack as it propagates. The basic steps in ductile fracture are void formation, void coalescence (also known as crack formation), crack propagation, and failure, often resulting in a cup-and-cone shaped failure surface. Voids typically coalesce around precipitates, secondary phases, inclusions, and at grain boundaries in the material. Ductile fracture is typically transgranular and deformation due to dislocation slip can cause the shear lip characteristic of cup and cone fracture.  Fracture modes and characteristics  There are three standard conventions for defining relative displacements in elastic materials in order to analyze crack propagation as proposed by Irwin. In addition fracture can involve uniform strain or a combination of these modes. Fracture crack separation modes *Mode I crack ‚Äì Opening mode (a tensile stress normal to the plane of the crack) *Mode II crack ‚Äì Sliding mode (a shear stress acting parallel to the plane of the crack and perpendicular to the crack front) *Mode III crack ‚Äì Tearing mode (a shear stress acting parallel to the plane of the crack and parallel to the crack front) The manner in which a crack propagates through a material gives insight into the mode of fracture. With ductile fracture a crack moves slowly and is accompanied by a large amount of plastic deformation around the crack tip. A ductile crack will usually not propagate unless an increased stress is applied and generally cease propagating when loading is removed. In a ductile material, a crack may progress to a section of the material where stresses are slightly lower and stop due to the blunting effect of plastic deformations at the crack tip. On the other hand, with brittle fracture, cracks spread very rapidly with little or no plastic deformation. The cracks that propagate in a brittle material will continue to grow once initiated. Crack propagation is also categorized by the crack characteristics at the microscopic level. A crack that passes through the grains within the material is undergoing transgranular fracture. A crack that propagates along the grain boundaries is termed an intergranular fracture. Typically, the bonds between material grains are stronger at room temperature than the material itself, so transgranular fracture is more likely to occur. When temperatures increase enough to weaken the grain bonds, intergranular fracture is the more common fracture mode. Fracture testing Fracture in materials is studied and quantified in multiple ways. Fracture is largely determined by the fracture toughness (\\\\mathrm{K}_\\\\mathrm{c}), so fracture testing is often done to determine this. The two most widely used techniques for determining fracture toughness are the Three-point flexural test and the compact tension test. By performing the compact tension and three-point flexural tests, one is able to determine the fracture toughness through the following equation: :\\\\mathrm{K_{c}} = \\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{F}\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi \\\\mathrm{c}}\\\\mathrm{f \\\\ (c/a)} Where:- :\\\\mathrm{f \\\\ (c/a)} is an empirically- derived equation to capture the test sample geometry :\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{F} is the fracture stress, and :\\\\mathrm{c} is the crack length. To accurately attain \\\\mathrm{K}_\\\\mathrm{c}, the value of \\\\mathrm{c} must be precisely measured. This is done by taking the test piece with its fabricated notch of length \\\\mathrm{c\\\\prime} and sharpening this notch to better emulate a crack tip found in real-world materials.EFM - Stress concentration at notches a closer look Cyclical prestressing the sample can then induce a fatigue crack which extends the crack from the fabricated notch length of \\\\mathrm{c\\\\prime} to \\\\mathrm{c}. This value \\\\mathrm{c} is used in the above equations for determining \\\\mathrm{K}_\\\\mathrm{c}. Following this test, the sample can then be reoriented such that further loading of a load (F) will extend this crack and thus a load versus sample deflection curve can be obtained. With this curve, the slope of the linear portion, which is the inverse of the compliance of the material, can be obtained. This is then used to derive f(c/a) as defined above in the equation. With the knowledge of all these variables, \\\\mathrm{K}_\\\\mathrm{c} can then be calculated. Brittle fracture of ceramics and inorganic glasses Ceramics and inorganic glasses have fracturing behavior that differ those of metallic materials. Ceramics have high strengths and perform well in high temperatures due to the material strength being independent of temperature. Ceramics have low toughness as determined by testing under a tensile load; often, ceramics have \\\\mathrm{K}_\\\\mathrm{c} values that are ~5% of that found in metals. However, ceramics are usually loaded in compression in everyday use, so the compressive strength is often referred to as the strength; this strength can often exceed that of most metals. However, ceramics are brittle and thus most work done revolves around preventing brittle fracture. Due to how ceramics are manufactured and processed, there are often preexisting defects in the material introduce a high degree of variability in the Mode I brittle fracture. Thus, there is a probabilistic nature to be accounted for in the design of ceramics. The Weibull distribution predicts the survival probability of a fraction of samples with a certain volume that survive a tensile stress sigma, and is often used to better assess the success of a ceramic in avoiding fracture. Notable fracture failures Failures caused by brittle fracture have not been limited to any particular category of engineered structure. Though brittle fracture is less common than other types of failure, the impacts to life and property can be more severe. The following notable historic failures were attributed to brittle fracture: *Pressure vessels: Great Molasses Flood in 1919, New Jersey molasses tank failure in 1973 *Bridges: King Street Bridge span collapse in 1962, Silver Bridge collapse in 1967, partial failure of the Hoan Bridge in 2000 *Ships: Titanic in 1912, Liberty ships during World War II, SS Schenectady in 1943 See also * Environmental stress fracture * Fatigue (material) * Forensic engineering * Forensic materials engineering * Fractography * Fracture (geology) * Fracture (mineralogy) * Gilbert tessellation * Microvoid coalescence * Notch Notes References Further reading * Alireza Bagher Shemirani, Haeri, H., Sarfarazi,V., Hedayat, A., A review paper about experimental investigations on failure behaviour of non-persistent joint.Geomechanics and Engineering, Vol. 13, No. 4, (2017), 535‚Äì570, * Dieter, G.

One common application of mouse chording, called rocker navigation, is found in Opera and in mouse gesture extensions for Mozilla Firefox. Rocker navigation typically involves the following two mouse chords: * Hold the left button and click the right button to move forward in the browser's history. * Hold the right button and click the left button to move backward in the browser's history. The operating systems Plan 9 and Oberon and the acme development environment make heavy use of mouse chording. OS/2 Presentation Manager can also use chording to copy and paste text using two buttons however Common User Access key combinations are more frequently used. Limitations Like mouse gestures, chorded actions may lack feedback and affordance and would therefore offer no way for users to discover possible chords without reference. A similar feature such as a context menu would require less training. When Project Athena used equipment from both IBM and DEC, DEC mice had three buttons and IBM mice had two. Athena simulated the third (middle) button on IBM mice by chording the two buttons together. This does not enable chords which involve the middle click.

(House Rule X, Senate Rule XXV.) Because they have legislative jurisdiction, standing committees consider bills and issues and recommend measures for consideration by their respective chambers.\\"Types of Committees\\" They also have oversight responsibility to monitor agencies, programs, and activities within their jurisdictions, and in some cases in areas that cut across committee jurisdictions. Due to their permanent nature, these committees exist beyond the adjournment of each two-year meeting of Congress. Most standing committees recommend funding levels‚Äîauthorizations‚Äîfor government operations and for new and existing programs. A few have other functions. For example, the Appropriations Committees recommend legislation to provide budget authority for federal agencies and programs. The Budget Committees establish aggregate levels for total spending and revenue that serve as guidelines for the work of the authorizing and appropriating panels. Committees also provide oversight of federal agencies and programs. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 greatly reduced the number of committees. The membership of each committee is adopted at the beginning of each Congress, usually by adoption of a formal resolution. Each committee is assigned its own staff to assist with its legislative, investigative, and research functions. Several committees divide their work into sub units called subcommittees. Committee sizes range from 6 to 50 members per committee. In the House, one person may not serve on more than two standing committees and four subcommittees at one time, though waivers can be granted to serve on additional committees. Also in the House, the House Republican Steering Committee assigns Republican representatives to their committee(s), while the Steering and Policy Committee is in charge of assigning Democratic representatives to committees. The Senate follows similar procedures, with senators being limited to no more than three full committees and five sub- committees.

It is the world's highest uninterrupted waterfall, with a height of and a plunge of . The waterfall drops over the edge of the Auy√°n-tepui mountain in the Canaima National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Canaima), a UNESCO World Heritage site in the Gran Sabana region of Bol√≠var State. The height figure, , mostly consists of the main plunge but also includes about of sloped cascade and rapids below the drop and a high plunge downstream of the talus rapids. The falls are along a fork of the Rio Kerepacupai Meru which flows into the Churun River, a tributary of the Carrao River, itself a tributary of the Orinoco River. History =Etymology= The waterfall has been known as the Angel Falls since the mid-20th century; they are named after Jimmie Angel, a US aviator, who was the first person to fly over the falls. Angel's ashes were scattered over the falls on 2 July 1960. The common Spanish name Salto √Ångel derives from his surname. In 2009, President Hugo Ch√°vez announced his intention to change the name to the purported original indigenous Pemon term (\\"Kerepakupai Ven√°\\", meaning \\"waterfall of the deepest place\\"), on the grounds that the nation's most famous landmark should bear an indigenous name. Explaining the name change, Ch√°vez was reported to have said, \\"This is ours, long before Angel ever arrived there ... this is indigenous land.\\" However, he later said that he would not decree the change of name, but only was defending the use of Kerepakupai Ven√°. =Exploration= Sir Walter Raleigh in his expedition to find the fabled city of El Dorado described what was possibly a tepui (table top mountain), and he is said to have been the first European to view Angel Falls, although these claims are considered far-fetched. Some historians state that the first European to visit the waterfall was Fernando de Berr√≠o, a Spanish explorer and governor from the 16th and 17th centuries. Other sources state that the first westerner to see the waterfall was the Spanish explorer F√®lix Cardona in 1927. They were not known to the outside world until American aviator Jimmie Angel, following directions given by Cardona, flew over them on 16 November 1933 on a flight while he was searching for a valuable ore bed. Returning on 9 October 1937, Angel tried to land his Flamingo monoplane El R√≠o Caron√≠ atop Auy√°n-tepui, but the plane was damaged when the wheels sank into the marshy ground. Angel and his three companions, including his wife Marie, were forced to descend the tepui on foot. It took them 11 days to make their way back to civilization by the gradually sloping back side, but news of their adventure spread and the waterfall was named Angel Falls in his honor. The name of the waterfall‚Äî\\"Salto del √Ångel\\"‚Äîwas first published on a Venezuelan government map in December 1939. Angel's plane remained on top of the tepui for 33 years before being lifted out by helicopter. It was restored at the Aviation Museum in Maracay and now sits outdoors on the front of the airport at Ciudad Bol√≠var. The first recorded European to reach the base of the falls was the Latvian explorer Aleksandrs Laime, also known as Alejandro Laime to the native Pemon tribe. He reached the falls alone in 1946. He was the first to reach the upper side of falls in the late 1950s, by climbing on the back side where the slope is not vertical. He also reached Angel's plane 18 years after the crash landing. On 18 November 1955, Latvian independence day, he announced to the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional that this stream without any known local name should be called after a Latvian river, Gauja. The same year, this name was registered in the National Cartographic Institution of Venezuela. There is no convincing proof that the indigenous Pemon people had named the local streams, as Auy√°n-tepui was considered to be a dangerous place and was not visited by the indigenous people. However, lately the Pemon name Kerep is used as well. Laime was also the first to clear a trail that leads from the Churun River to the base of the falls. On the way is a viewpoint commonly used to capture the falls in photographs. It is named Mirador Laime (\\"Laime's Viewpoint\\" in Spanish) in his honor. This trail is used now mostly for tourists, to lead them from the Isla Rat√≥n camp to the small clearing. The official height of the falls was determined by a survey carried out by an expedition organized and financed by American journalist Ruth Robertson on 13 May 1949. Robertson's expedition, which began on April 23, 1949, was also the first to reach the foot of the falls. The first known attempt to climb the face of the cliff was made in 1968 during the wet season. It failed because of slippery rock. In 1969, a second attempt was made during the dry season. This attempt was thwarted by lack of water and an overhang from the top. The first climb to the top of the cliff was completed on 13 January 1971. The climbers required nine and a half days to ascend and one and a half days to rappel down.David Nott, Angels Four, Prentice-Hall Inc. 1972 chronicles the first successful climb up the face of Auyantepui to the top of the falls. Tourism Angel Falls is one of Venezuela's top tourist attractions, though a trip to the falls is a complicated affair. The falls are located in an isolated jungle. A flight from Puerto Ordaz or Ciudad Bol√≠var is required to reach Canaima camp, the starting point for river trips to the base of the falls. River trips generally take place from June to December, when the rivers are deep enough for use by the Pemon guides. During the dry season (December to March), there is less water seen than in the other months.

His divorce from his first wife Mary Alice Prentice, birth sister of his Uncle Collis' adopted daughter, in 1910 and marriage to Arabella in 1913 after Mary Alice's death shocked San Francisco society.http://dgmweb.net/FGS/H/HuntingtonHenryEdwards-MAPrentice- ADYarrington.html He had four children with Mary Alice (Howard Edward, Clara Leonora, Elizabeth Vincent, and Marian Prentice), but none with Arabella. Arabella's son Archer, from her prior marriage from which she was widowed, had earlier been adopted by Collis Huntington. Henry expected to assume control of the Central and Southern Pacific, but was blocked by bondholder James Speyer, forcing him to sell his interests to E. H. Harriman. In 1898, in friendly competition with his uncle's Southern Pacific, Huntington bought the narrow gauge city-oriented Los Angeles Railway (LARy), known as the 'Yellow Car' system. In 1901, Huntington formed the sprawling interurban, standard gauge Pacific Electric Railway (the PE), known as the 'Red Car' system, centered at 6th and Main Streets in Los Angeles. Huntington succeeded in this competition by providing passenger friendly streetcars on 24/7 schedules, which the railroads could not match. This was facilitated by the boom in Southern California land development, where housing was built in places such as Orange County's Huntington Beach, a Huntington-sponsored development, and streetcars served passenger needs that the railroads had not considered. Connectivity to Downtown Los Angeles made such suburbs feasible. By 1910, the Huntington trolley systems spanned approximately of southern California.Friedricks. At its greatest extent, the system contained over 20 streetcar lines and 1,250 trolleys, most running through the core of Los Angeles and serving such nearby neighborhoods as the Crenshaw district, West Adams, Echo Park, Westlake, Hancock Park, Exposition Park, Vernon, Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights. The system integrated the 1902 acquisition, the Mount Lowe Scenic Railway above Altadena, California in the San Gabriel Mountains.Henry E. Huntington, The Electronic Railway Historical Association of Southern California. Retrieved 2010-05-30. In 1905 Huntington, A. Kingsley Macomber, and William R. Staats developed the Oak Knoll subdivision, located to the west of his San Marino estate in the oak-covered hilly terrain near Pasadena. The Huntington Mansion, 1915; now the centerpiece of the Huntington Library. In 1906, Huntington, along with Frank Miller, owner of the Mission Inn, and Charles M. Loring, formed the Huntington Park Association, with the intent to purchase Mount Rubidoux in Riverside, build a road to the summit, and develop the hill as a park to benefit the city of Riverside.Gale, pages 155-156. The road was completed in February 1907.Hutchings, page 11 (unnumbered). The property was later donated to the city of Riverside by the heirs of Frank Miller, and today the hill is a city park. Huntington was a Life Member of the Sons of the Revolution in the State of California.Breithaupt, page 369. Huntington retired from business in 1916. In 1927 Henry E. Huntington died in Philadelphia while undergoing surgery. He and Arabella are buried, with a large monument, in the Gardens of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.The Mausoleum, The Huntington =Hotel= The Huntington Hotel was originally named Hotel Wentworth when it opened on February 1, 1907. Financial problems and a disappointing first season forced it to close indefinitely. Henry Huntington purchased the Wentworth in 1911, renaming it the Huntington Hotel. It reopened in 1914, transformed into a winter resort. The 1920s were prosperous for the hotel, as Midwestern and Eastern entrepreneurs discovered California's warm winter climate. The hotel's reputation for fine service began with long-time general manager and later owner Stephen W. Royce. By 1926, the hotel's success prompted Royce to open the property year-round. The \\"golden years\\" ended with the stock market crash and the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s. By the end of the 1930s the hotel was vibrant again. When World War II began, all reservations were cancelled and the hotel was rented to the Army for $3,000 a month. Following the war, the Huntington's fortunes improved again. In 1954 Stephen Royce sold the hotel to the Sheraton Corporation, serving as general manager until his retirement in 1969. The hotel operated until 1985, when it closed because of its inability to meet seismic standards. The structure was built of in-reinforced concrete in 1906. After a -year major renovation, the hotel reopened in March 1991 as the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel and Spa. The hotel completed a $19 million renovation in January 2006; it changed hands in early 2007 and became Langham Brand International, Huntington Hotel & SPA. Legacy Huntington left a prominent legacy with the Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens on his former estate in San Marino near Pasadena. Other legacies in California include the cities of Huntington Beach and Huntington Park, as well as Huntington Lake. Also in greater Los Angeles are the Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, Henry E. Huntington Middle School in San Marino, and the grand boulevard, Huntington Drive, running eastbound from downtown Los Angeles. Its landscaped central parkway was previously the right-of-way for the Northern Division of the Pacific Electric. Postcard of sightseers, circa 1910, driving up Mount Rubidoux in Riverside, California via Huntington Drive. Riverside's city park on Mount Rubidoux was originally named Huntington Park, and the road to the top was named Huntington Drive.Brown, page 478. After Frank Miller's heirs donated the property to the city, the city renamed the park the Frank A. Miller Rubidoux Memorial Park, and the road has become known as Mount Rubidoux Drive. A plaque that was dedicated to Huntington in 1907, in recognition of his contributions to the development of Mount Rubidoux, remains on a large boulder known as Huntington Rock.Hutchings, page 12 (unnumbered). After Huntington's death a second tablet was placed on the north side of the hill at a place named the Huntington Shrine.Wenzel, Anecdotes ..., page 130. His legacy on the East Coast includes the Huntington Memorial Library in Oneonta, New York, opened July 9, 1920 in his childhood home. As well as a portrait by Oswald Birley at the Huntington Library, portraits of Huntington were also painted by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury who built a studio less than a mile from Huntington's estate in San Marino in 1924-1925: a full- length, based on a photograph, is at the Collis Potter & Howard Edwards Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, and two seated versions, a small one of which was acquired by Huntington's son-in-law John Metcalf, and a larger one (which is presumed lost) which was engraved by an artist called Witherspoon in 1928. The artist also painted Huntington's granddaughter Mary Brockway Metcalf (this is on long-term loan to the offices of the Director of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery).

Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency. Kanban is one method to achieve JIT. The system takes its name from the cards that track production within a factory. For many in the automotive sector, kanban is known as the \\"Toyota nameplate system\\". Kanban became an effective tool to support running a production system as a whole, and an excellent way to promote improvement. Problem areas are highlighted by measuring lead time and cycle time of the full process and process steps. One of the main benefits of kanban is to establish an upper limit to work in process inventory to avoid overcapacity. Other systems with similar effect exist, for example CONWIP. A systematic study of various configurations of kanban systems, of which CONWIP is an important special case, can be found in Tayur (1993), among other papers. A goal of the kanban system is to limit the buildup of excess inventory at any point in production. Limits on the number of items waiting at supply points are established and then reduced as inefficiencies are identified and removed. Whenever a limit is exceeded, this points to an inefficiency that should be addressed. Origins The system originates from the simplest visual stock replenishment signaling system, an empty box. This was first developed in the UK factories producing Spitfires during the Second World War, and was known as the ‚Äútwo bin system.‚Äù In the late 1940s, Toyota started studying supermarkets with the idea of applying shelf-stocking techniques to the factory floor. In a supermarket, customers generally retrieve what they need at the required time‚Äîno more, no less. Furthermore, the supermarket stocks only what it expects to sell in a given time, and customers take only what they need, because future supply is assured. This observation led Toyota to view a process as being a customer of one or more preceding processes and to view the preceding processes as a kind of store. Kanban aligns inventory levels with actual consumption. A signal tells a supplier to produce and deliver a new shipment when a material is consumed. This signal is tracked through the replenishment cycle, bringing visibility to the supplier, consumer, and buyer. Kanban uses the rate of demand to control the rate of production, passing demand from the end customer up through the chain of customer-store processes. In 1953, Toyota applied this logic in their main plant machine shop. Operation A key indicator of the success of production scheduling based on demand, pushing, is the ability of the demand-forecast to create such a push. Kanban, by contrast, is part of an approach where the pull comes from demand and products are made to order. Re- supply or production is determined according to customer orders. In contexts where supply time is lengthy and demand is difficult to forecast, often the best one can do is to respond quickly to observed demand. This situation is exactly what a kanban system accomplishes, in that it is used as a demand signal that immediately travels through the supply chain. This ensures that intermediate stock held in the supply chain are better managed, and are usually smaller. Where the supply response is not quick enough to meet actual demand fluctuations, thereby causing potential lost sales, a stock building may be deemed more appropriate and is achieved by placing more kanban in the system. Taiichi Ohno stated that to be effective, kanban must follow strict rules of use. Toyota, for example, has six simple rules, and close monitoring of these rules is a never-ending task, thereby ensuring that the kanban does what is required. =Toyota's Six Rules= Toyota has formulated six rules for the application of kanban: # Each process issues requests (kanban) to its suppliers when it consumes its supplies. # Each process produces according to the quantity and sequence of incoming requests. # No items are made or transported without a request. # The request associated with an item is always attached to it. # Processes must not send out defective items, to ensure that the finished products will be defect-free. # Limiting the number of pending requests makes the process more sensitive and reveals inefficiencies. =Kanban (cards)= A Kanban card together with the bag of bolts that it refers to Kanban cards are a key component of kanban and they signal the need to move materials within a production facility or to move materials from an outside supplier into the production facility. The kanban card is, in effect, a message that signals a depletion of product, parts, or inventory. When received, the kanban triggers replenishment of that product, part, or inventory. Consumption, therefore, drives demand for more production, and the kanban card signals demand for more product‚Äîso kanban cards help create a demand-driven system. It is widely held by proponents of lean production and manufacturing that demand-driven systems lead to faster turnarounds in production and lower inventory levels, helping companies implementing such systems be more competitive. In the last few years, systems sending kanban signals electronically have become more widespread. While this trend is leading to a reduction in the use of kanban cards in aggregate, it is still common in modern lean production facilities to find the use of kanban cards. In various software systems, kanban is used for signalling demand to suppliers through email notifications. When stock of a particular component is depleted by the quantity assigned on kanban card, a \\"kanban trigger\\" is created (which may be manual or automatic), a purchase order is released with predefined quantity for the supplier defined on the card, and the supplier is expected to dispatch material within a specified lead-time. Kanban cards, in keeping with the principles of kanban, simply convey the need for more materials. A red card lying in an empty parts cart conveys that more parts are needed. =Three-bin system= An example of a simple kanban system implementation is a \\"three-bin system\\" for the supplied parts, where there is no in-house manufacturing. One bin is on the factory floor (the initial demand point), one bin is in the factory store (the inventory control point), and one bin is at the supplier. The bins usually have a removable card containing the product details and other relevant information, the classic kanban card. When the bin on the factory floor is empty (because the parts in it were used up in a manufacturing process), the empty bin and its kanban card are returned to the factory store (the inventory control point). The factory store replaces the empty bin on the factory floor with the full bin from the factory store, which also contains a kanban card. The factory store sends the empty bin with its kanban card to the supplier. The supplier's full product bin, with its kanban card, is delivered to the factory store; the supplier keeps the empty bin. This is the final step in the process. Thus, the process never runs out of product‚Äîand could be described as a closed loop, in that it provides the exact amount required, with only one spare bin so there is never oversupply. This 'spare' bin allows for uncertainties in supply, use, and transport in the inventory system. A good kanban system calculates just enough kanban cards for each product. Most factories that use kanban use the colored board system (heijunka box). Electronic kanban Virtual Kanban e-kanban system Many manufacturers have implemented electronic kanban (sometimes referred to as e-kanban) systems. These help to eliminate common problems such as manual entry errors and lost cards. E-kanban systems can be integrated into enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, enabling real-time demand signaling across the supply chain and improved visibility. Data pulled from E-kanban systems can be used to optimize inventory levels by better tracking supplier lead and replenishment times. E-kanban is a signaling system that uses a mix of technology to trigger the movement of materials within a manufacturing or production facility. Electronic Kanban differs from traditional kanban in using technology to replace traditional elements like kanban cards with barcodes and electronic messages like email or Electronic data interchange. A typical electronic kanban system marks inventory with barcodes, which workers scan at various stages of the manufacturing process to signal usage. The scans relay messages to internal/external stores to ensure the restocking of products. Electronic kanban often uses the internet as a method of routing messages to external suppliers and as a means to allow a real-time view of inventory, via a portal, throughout the supply chain. Organizations like the Ford Motor Company and Bombardier Aerospace have used electronic kanban systems to improve processes. Systems are now widespread from single solutions or bolt on modules to ERP systems. Types of kanban systems In a kanban system, adjacent upstream and downstream workstations communicate with each other through their cards, where each container has a kanban associated with it. Economic Order Quantity is important. The two most important types of kanbans are: * Production (P) Kanban: A P-kanban, when received, authorizes the workstation to produce a fixed amount of products. The P-kanban is carried on the containers that are associated with it. * Transportation (T) Kanban: A T-kanban authorizes the transportation of the full container to the downstream workstation. The T-kanban is also carried on the containers that are associated with the transportation to move through the loop again. The Kanban philosophy and Task Boards are also used in Agile project management to coordinate tasks in project teams., Kanban and Scrum - Making the Most of Both An online demonstration can be seen in an Agile Simulator., Kanban simulator on web Implementation of Kanban can be described in the following manner: * The workflow consists of logical steps. * There are two steps to a workflow viz. queue and work in progress/process. * The team in charge decides on the maximum amount of work each step of the workflow can hold. * Work is pushed into the queue step and pulled in the in a process step. * If need be, work is halted in two successive stages to clear bottleneck.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 8 Oct 2012 . The territory is the center of a region known as Occitania.  Counts of Toulouse  Under the Carolingians, counts and dukes were appointed by the royal court. Later, this office became hereditary. The counts of Toulouse ruled the city of Toulouse and its surrounding county from the late 9th century until 1271. At times, the counts of Toulouse or family members were also counts of Quercy, Rouergue, Albi, N√Æmes, Provence and marquesses of Gothia. Carolingian period The Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis fell to the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century. Septimania, the Visigothic province roughly corresponding to the later county of Toulouse, fell briefly to the Emirate of C√≥rdoba in the 750s before it was conquered into the Kingdom of the Franks by Pippin the Short in 759 following the Siege of Narbonne. Septimania within the Frankish realm would become known as Gothia or Marca Gothica by the end of the 9th century. Pippin died in 768 and was followed by his sons Charlemagne and Carloman. Because of this event, Hunald II, son of the late Duke Waifer, raised an insurrection against Frankish power in Aquitaine. Charlemagne soon intervened and defeated him. In 771, Carloman died and Charlemagne was left as the only ruler of the Frankish realm. In 778, Charlemagne led his army into Spain against the Arabs. On his way back the famous event of Roncesvalles (Roncevaux in French) occurred: Charlemagne's rear-guard was attacked in the pass of the same name by some Basque warriors. This led him to realize that Frankish power in Gascony and Aquitaine was still feeble, and that the local populations were not entirely loyal to the Franks. Consequently, that same year, he completely reorganized the administration of the region: direct Frankish administration was imposed, and Frankish counts were established in key cities, such as Toulouse. In 781, Charlemagne set up the Kingdom of Aquitaine, comprising the whole of Aquitaine (including Gascony) plus the Mediterranean coast from Narbonne to N√Æmes (an area then known as Gothia), and gave the crown of Aquitaine to his three-year-old son Louis. Other such sub-kingdoms were created inside the wider Carolingian empire in places such as Bavaria or Lombardy. They were meant to ensure the loyalty of local populations in territories freshly conquered and with strong local idiosyncrasies. Crowns were given to the sons of Charlemagne. General supervision of this Basque frontier seems to have been placed in the hands of Chorson, count or duke of Toulouse. These politics displeased the Basques, and in 787 or 789 Chorson was captured by Odalric \\"the Basque\\", probably son of Duke Lupus, who forced Chorson into an agreement which Charlemagne considered so shameful that he replaced him by the Count William in 790. Toulouse was a major Carolingian military stronghold close to Muslim Spain. Military campaigns against the Muslims were launched from Toulouse almost every year during Charlemagne's reign. Barcelona was conquered in 801, as well as a large part of Catalonia. Together with the northern areas of Aragon and Navarre along the Pyrenees, the region became the southern march (the Spanish March) of the Frankish empire. In 814, Charlemagne died, and his only surviving son was Louis, king of Aquitaine, who became Emperor Louis the Pious (Louis le Pieux). The Kingdom of Aquitaine was transmitted to Pippin, the second son of Louis the Pious. Gothia was detached from the Kingdom of Aquitaine and administered directly by the emperor, thus recreating the limits of the former duchy of Aquitaine. Problems soon arose. Louis the Pious had three sons, and in 817 he arranged an early allocation of the shares in the future inheritance of the empire: Pippin was confirmed king in Aquitaine (Pippin I of Aquitaine), Louis the German was made king in Bavaria, while the eldest son Lothair was made co-emperor with future authority over his brothers. In 823, Charles the Bald (Charles le Chauve) was born from the second wife of Louis the Pious. Soon enough, she wished to place her son in the line of succession. Louis the Pious was rather weak, and a fight started between the three sons on one side, and their father and his new wife on the other side, which eventually would lead to the total collapse of the Frankish empire. Louis the Pious was toppled from power, then re-installed, then toppled, then re-installed again. In 838 Pippin I of Aquitaine died, and Louis the Pious and his wife managed to install Charles the Bald as the new king of Aquitaine. At the Assembly of Worms in 839 the empire was re-divided: Charles the Bald was given the western part of the empire, Lothar the central and eastern part, while Louis the German was keeping only Bavaria. Pippin II of Aquitaine, the son of Pippin I, was not going to accept such a decision. He was hailed king by the Aquitanians (but not by the Basques, who by then had seceded and detached Vasconia from Aquitaine), and he resisted his grandfather. Louis the German in Bavaria also opposed his father's decision. Eventually Louis the Pious died in 840. Lothar, the eldest son, claimed the whole empire and a general war broke out. First allied with his nephew Pippin II, Louis the German soon allied with his half- brother Charles the Bald and they jointly defeated Lothar. Then in August 843, they signed probably the most important treaty in European history, the Treaty of Verdun. The empire was divided in three: Charles the Bald was given the western part, Francia Occidentalis (Western Frankland, soon to be called France), Louis the German was given the eastern part, Francia Orientalis (Eastern Frankland, soon to become the German Holy Roman Empire), while Lothar was given the central part, soon to be conquered and divided by his two brothers. Following the Treaty of Verdun, Charles the Bald moved south to defeat Pippin II and add Aquitaine to his territory. First he conquered Gothia over its rebelled count (who had taken advantage of the Carolingian feud) and had him executed. In 844, he moved west and was besieging Toulouse, the capital of King Pippin II of Aquitaine. However, he had to withdraw without being able to capture the city. That same year, the Vikings entered the mouth of the Garonne River, took Bordeaux, and sailed up as far as Toulouse, plundering and killing all along the Garonne River valley. They moved back when they reached Toulouse, without attacking the city. It is still a matter of debate among historians whether they were called by Pippin II in his fight against Charles the Bald (as Charles' propaganda later claimed), helped defeat Charles the Bald, and left with due payment from Pippin II of Aquitaine, or whether they just took advantage of the war to invade unchecked but moved back at the sight of the strong garrison of Toulouse who had just resisted successfully Charles the Bald. In 845, following these events, Charles the Bald signed a treaty recognizing Pippin II as king of Aquitaine in exchange for him relinquishing the northern part of Aquitaine (the county of Poitiers) to Charles the Bald. However, the Aquitanians grew very unhappy with their king Pippin II, perhaps for his friendliness towards the Vikings who inflicted terrible damage on the population, and so in 848 they called Charles the Bald to topple Pippin II. In 849 Charles the Bald moved south again and was presented the capital of Aquitaine, Toulouse, by Fr√©delon, the count of Toulouse recently appointed by Pippin II. Charles the Bald then officially confirmed Fr√©delon as count of Toulouse. Soon the whole of Aquitaine was submitting to Charles the Bald. In 852, Pippin II was taken prisoner by the Basques and handed over to his uncle Charles the Bald who put him in a monastery. In 852, Count Fr√©delon of Toulouse died and Charles the Bald appointed Fr√©delon's brother Raymond (Raimond) as the new count. This was a special favor, normally counts were only administrative agents not chosen in the same family. However, it would prove to be the start of the dynasty of the counts of Toulouse, who were all descendants of Count Raymond I of Toulouse (Raimond I). In 855, following the example of his grandfather Charlemagne, Charles the Bald recreated the kingdom of Aquitaine (without Gothia), and he gave the crown to his son Charles the Child (Charles l'Enfant). Meanwhile, Pippin II of Aquitaine had escaped from his monastery in 854, and he was raising an insurrection in Aquitaine. It did not prove very popular among Aquitanians though, and he was unsuccessful. He then resorted to calling the Vikings for help. In 864, at the head of a Viking army, Pippin II of Aquitaine besieged Toulouse where the count of Toulouse resisted fiercely. The siege failed, and the Vikings left to plunder other areas of Aquitaine. Pippin II, abandoned by all, saw the ruins of his ambitions. He was captured and again put in a monastery by his uncle, where he died soon after. In 866, Charles the Child died. Charles the Bald then made his other son, Louis the Stammerer (Louis le B√®gue), the new king of Aquitaine. By then, the central state in the kingdom of France was rapidly losing authority. Charles the Bald was rather unsuccessful at containing the Vikings, local populations had to rely on their local counts to resist the Vikings, and the counts soon became the main source of authority, challenging the central authority of Charles the Bald in Paris. As they grew in power, they started to be succeeded in the same family and establish local dynasties. Wars between the central power and the counts arose, as well as wars between the competing counts, which further debilitated the defenses against the Vikings. Western Europe, and France in particular, was again entering a new Dark Age, which would prove even more disastrous than those of the 6th and 7th centuries. In 877, Charles the Bald had to give in: he signed the Capitulary of Quierzy, which allowed counts to be succeeded by their sons when they died. This was the founding stone of feudalism in western Europe. Charles the Bald died four months later. The new king of France was his son Louis the Stammerer, formally king of Aquitaine. Louis the Stammerer did not choose any of his sons to become the new king of Aquitaine, thus in effect putting an end to the kingdom of Aquitaine, which would never be revived again. Louis the Stammerer died shortly after in 879 and was succeeded by his two sons, Louis III and Carloman. Louis III inherited northwest France, while Carloman inherited Burgundy and Aquitaine. However, in practice, during the years 870‚Äì890 the central power was so weakened that the counts in southern France achieved complete autonomy. The dynasties they established ruled independently. The central state in Paris would not be able to reassert its authority over the south of France for the next four centuries. Independence Map of the County of Toulouse in 1154 Political map of Languedoc on the eve of the Albigensian Crusade, under the rule of the House of Toulouse By the end of the 9th century, Toulouse had become the capital of an independent county, the county of Toulouse, ruled by the dynasty founded by Fr√©delon, who in theory was under the sovereignty of the king of France, but in practice was totally independent. The counts of Toulouse had to fight to maintain their position at first. They were mostly challenged by the dynasty of the counts of Auvergne, ruling over the northeastern part of the former Aquitaine, who claimed the county of Toulouse as their own, and even temporarily ousted the counts of Toulouse from the city of Toulouse. However, during these Dark Ages, the counts of Toulouse managed to preserve their own and, unlike many local dynasties that disappeared, they achieved survival. Their county was just a small fraction of the former Aquitaine, the southeastern part of it in fact. However, on the death of Count William the Pious of Auvergne (Guillaume le Pieux) in 918 they came into the possession of Gothia which had been in the family of the counts of Auvergne for two generations. Thus, they more than doubled their territory, once again reuniting Toulouse with the Mediterranean coast from Narbonne to N√Æmes. The county of Toulouse took its definite shape, from Toulouse in the west to the Rhone River in the east, a unity that would survive until the French Revolution as the province of Languedoc. Toulouse would never again be part of the Aquitaine polity, whose capital in later times would become Poitiers, then Bordeaux. At first though, the memories of Aquitaine lived strong in Toulouse. Count William the Pious of Auvergne was the first to recreate the title of Duke of Aquitaine for himself in the 890s. Then the count of Poitiers inherited the title in 927. In 932 the king of France Raoul was fighting against the count of Poitiers, and he transferred the title of Duke of Aquitaine to his new ally Count Raymond III Pons of Toulouse (Raimond III). However, the title did not mean much. The various counts of the former Aquitaine were all independents, and did not recognize a superior authority. Various factions were competing for the throne of France, but since all central authority had disappeared, the position of King of France had become an almost empty title. After Raoul's death, another faction succeeded in establishing an English bred Carolingian prince to the throne, Louis IV from Overseas (Louis IV d'Outremer). Raymond III Pons was from the opposite faction and so when he died in 950 Louis IV awarded the title of Duke of Aquitaine to Count William III Towhead of Poitiers (Guillaume III T√™te d'√âtoupe) who was an ally of Louis IV. From then on the title of Duke of Aquitaine would be used in the family of the counts of Poitiers, whose power base of Poitou was in the northwestern part of the former Aquitaine. The counts of Toulouse would soon forget any dreams about Aquitaine. Eventually, on the death of the Carolingian king of France Louis V in 987, the Robertian faction succeeded in having its chief, Hugh Capet (Hugues Capet) elected to the French throne. This time, the Carolingian dynasty effectively ended. Hugh Capet was the founder the Capetian dynasty, which would rule in France for the next eight centuries. However, from this point forward, the history of France is irrelevant to Toulouse, at least until the 13th century. The counts of Toulouse had extended their rule to the Mediterranean coast, but they would not long enjoy the large domain they had succeeded in carving out for themselves. The 10th century was perhaps the worst century for western Europe in the last two millennia. Four centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, civilization had declined, arts and education were in a very poor state. There had been a momentary rebirth of culture and order in the time of Charlemagne, but soon with the return of invasions (especially the Vikings), western Europe was falling again. This conjugated with dramatic civil wars as explained above, as well as bad weather, plagues, and population loss. Entire areas of western Europe returned to wilderness. Cities were completely depopulated. Churches were abandoned or plundered; the Church was experiencing a sharp decline in morals. It seemed as if the legacy of the Roman Empire would completely disappear. Culture from the Antiquity only survived in a few scattered monasteries. This was in sharp contrast with the then flourishing emirate of C√≥rdoba in Spain or the Byzantine Empire. Another phenomenon of these times was the complete disappearance of central authority. Power fragmented, falling first into the hands of counts, then viscounts, then in the hands of thousands of local feudal lords. By the end of the 10th century, France was ruled by thousands of local rulers who controlled only one town, or one castle and the few villages around. Toulouse and its county was exactly reflecting this situation. Between 900 and 980 the counts of Toulouse gradually lost control over the county, with the emergence of local dynastic rulers in every part of it. By the end of the 10th century the counts of Toulouse only had authority over a few estates scattered around the county. Even the city of Toulouse was ruled by a viscount independent from the counts of Toulouse. Abd al-Rahman III of C√≥rdoba managed to reunite Muslim Spain, and carried the emirate of C√≥rdoba to its zenith, transforming it into the prestigious caliphate of C√≥rdoba in 929. In the 920s he launched a general offensive against the Christian kingdoms in the north of Spain. In 920 (and possibly also in 929) one of his armies crossed the Pyrenees and went as far north as Toulouse, without capturing the city. In 924, the Magyars (ancestors of the Hungarians) launched an expedition toward the west and went as far as Toulouse, but they were defeated by Count Raymond III Pons of Toulouse. At the end of the 10th century all the Carolingian wars and subsequent invasions had left the county of Toulouse in disarray. Large expanses of lands were left uncultivated as many farms had been abandoned. Toulouse was perhaps faring a little better than northern France in the sense that its proximity to Muslim Spain meant there was a strong flow of knowledge and culture coming from the schools and printing houses of C√≥rdoba. Toulouse had also retained Roman Law unlike northern France, and had in general kept more of the Roman legacy, even in these troubled times. The ground was there for a recovery of civilization. At the beginning of the second millennium, the drifting attitude of the clergy and the confiscation of the Church by the Toulouse administration initiated a degradation of the worship. The Saint- Sernin church, the Daurade basilica, and the Saint-√âtienne cathedral were not maintained properly. New religious currents appeared, like the Cluniac reform. Bishop Isarn, helped by Pope Gregory VII, tried to put everything back in order. He gave the Daurade Basilica to the Cluniac abbots in 1077. In Saint- Sernin, he met a strong opposition in the person of Raimond Gayrard, a provost who had just built a hospital for the poor and was proposing to build a basilica. Supported by count Guilhem IV, Saint Raymond finally gained permission from Pope Urban II to dedicate the building in 1096. The religious quarrels had just awoken the faith of Toulouse. This rebirth was accompanied by a new demographic progression, supported by technically more efficient agriculture. The suburbs of Saint-Michel and Saint Cyprien were built during this period. The Daurade bridge connected in 1181 the Saint-Cyprien suburb to the gates of the city. The suburbs of Saint-Sernin and Saint-Pierre des Cuisines also had a remarkable expansion. The end of the 11th century marked the departure of count Raymond IV to the crusades. Various succession wars followed, besieging Toulouse several times. In 1119, the population of Toulouse proclaimed Alphonse Jourdain count. Alphonse Jourdain, willing to be grateful to his people, reduced the taxes immediately, for example on salt and wine. From the middle years of the 12th century, the people of Toulouse seem to have begun to free themselves from the most oppressive feudal dues. With the death of the count, an administration of eight \\"capitulaires\\" was created. Under the direction of the count, they had the responsibility of regulating the exchanges and making sure the laws were applied. These were the Capitouls, whose first acts were dated in 1152. In 1152 we have traces of a commune consilium Tolosae making police ordinances in its own name \\"with the advice of Lord Raymond, count of Toulouse, duke of Narbonne, and marquis of Provence\\". This act was witnessed by six capitularii, four duly appointed judges (judices constiluti), and two advocates. Twenty-three years later there were twelve capitularii or consuls, six for the city and six for its suburbs, all of them elected and sworn to do justice in whatever municipal matters were brought before them. In 1176, the \\"chapitre\\" already had twelve members, each of them representing a district of Toulouse, or a suburb. The consuls quickly opposed count Raimond V. The population of Toulouse was divided on the subject and in 1189, after ten years of fighting, the town council finally obtained the submission of the count. In 1190 the construction of the future Capitole, the common house, the town council headquarters began. With twenty-four members, probably elected, the Capitouls granted themselves the rights of police, trade, imposition and started some conflicts with the closest cities. Toulouse was usually victorious, extending the domination of the patria tolosana. Despite the intervention of the king, the administration of the Capitouls gave a relative independence to the city, for nearly 600 years, until the French Revolution. In 1222 the number of capitularii was increased to twenty-four; but they were forbidden to touch the city property, which was to remain in the charge of certain communarii chosen by themselves.  Women's rights  As a successor state for the Visigothic Kingdom and the Kingdom of Aquitaine, Toulouse, along with Aquitania and Languedoc (but not Gascony), inherited the Visigothic Law and Roman Law which had combined to allow women more rights than their contemporaries would enjoy until the 20th century. Particularly with the Liber Judiciorum as codified in 642/643 and expanded on in the Code of Recceswinth in 653, women could inherit land and title and manage it independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, and women could represent themselves and bear witness in court by age 14 and arrange for their own marriages by age 20.Klapisch-Zuber, Christine; A History of Women; Book II: Silences of the Middle Ages, Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1992; Chapter 6, \\"Women in the Fifth to the Tenth Century\\" by Suzanne Fonay Wemple, p. 74. According to Wemple, Visigothic women of Spain and the Aquitaine could inherit land and title and manage it independently of their husbands, and dispose of it as they saw fit if they had no heirs, and represent themselves in court, appear as witnesses (by the age of 14), and arrange their own marriages by the age of twenty. As a consequence, male- preference primogeniture was the practiced succession law for the nobility. Albigensian Crusade Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse Les Jacobins in Toulouse Catharism is a doctrine professing the separation of the material and the spiritual existences, one of its possible inspiration may be Bogomilism of Bulgaria. It conflicts with the orthodox confession. Called \\"heretics\\", the Cathars found a strong audience in the south of France, and during the 12th century. Simon de Montfort tried to exterminate them. Toulouse was reached by the Cathar doctrine too. The orthodox White Brotherhood pursued the heretical Blacks in the streets of the city. The abbot of Foulques took advantage of this because the heretics were his creditors, and encouraged this inquisition. Some people joined the white fighters, others chose to assist the besieged population. The consuls did not wish to encourage the division of Toulouse, and defied the pontifical authority, refusing to identify the heretics. Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse, a Catholic, who was excommunicated for his dispute with the pope, later sympathised with the heretics because he saw the crusade take an unholy path with the extermination at B√©zier. In 1211, the first siege of Toulouse by Simon de Montfort was unsuccessful but two years later, he successfully defeated the Toulouse army. Under the threat of killing many hostages, he entered the city in 1216, and appointed himself as a count. Simon de Montfort was killed by a stone at the Siege of Toulouse in 1218. Until the last siege, the \\"whites\\" were fought against by the Toulouse populace. Louis VII finally decided to give up in 1219. Raymond VI recognized the support he had received from the population, helping him to preserve his interests, gave up his last prerogatives to the Capitouls. Within the Kingdom of France The 13th century went in a political direction opposite to the path drawn by the past centuries. In the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance. Also in 1229, the University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr√®res pr√™cheurs, were started. They found a home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the walls of Toulouse. The fear of repression obliged the notabilities to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital. Count Raimond VII was convicted of heresy and died in 1249 without an heir. The Toulouse county was given to the king of France, who imposed his laws through appointed seneschals. The power of the Capitouls was reduced. In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was established in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours. Toulouse became the center of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years; the Consistori was last active in 1484. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. Accompanying the inquisition, many threats affected the city. Plague, fire and flood devastated the districts. The Hundred Years' War decimated Toulouse. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. Toulouse only had 22,000 people in 1405.

The term monochrome comes from the . A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black- and-white. However, scientifically speaking, monochromatic light refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (see spectral color). Application Of an image, the term monochrome is usually taken to mean the same as black and white or, more likely, grayscale, but may also be used to refer to other combinations containing only tones of a single color, such as green-and-white or green-and-red. It may also refer to sepia displaying tones from light tan to dark brown or cyanotype (\\"blueprint\\") images, and early photographic methods such as daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and tintypes, each of which may be used to produce a monochromatic image. In computing, monochrome has two meanings: *it may mean having only one color which is either on or off (also known as a binary image), *allowing shades of that color. A monochrome computer display is able to display only a single color, often green, amber, red or white, and often also shades of that color. In film photography, monochrome is typically the use of black-and-white film. Originally, all photography was done in monochrome. Although color photography was possible even in the late 19th century, easily used color films, such as Kodachrome, were not available until the mid-1930s. In digital photography, monochrome is the capture of only shades of black by the sensor, or by post-processing a color image to present only the perceived brightness by combining the values of multiple channels (usually red, blue, and green). The weighting of individual channels may be selected to achieve a desired artistic effect; if only the red channel is selected by the weighting then the effect will be similar to that of using a red filter on panchromatic film. If the red channel is eliminated and the green and blue combined then the effect will be similar to that of orthochromatic film or the use of a cyan filter on panchromatic film. The selection of weighting thus allows a wide range of artistic expression in the final monochromatic image. For production of an anaglyph image the original color stereogram source may first be reduced to monochrome in order to simplify the rendering of the image. This is sometimes required in cases where a color image would render in a confusing manner given the colors and patterns present in the source image and the selection filters used (typically red and its complement, cyan). In physics In physics, monochromatic light is electromagnetic radiation of a single frequency. In the context of physics, no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic, since that would require a wave of infinite duration as a consequence of the Fourier transform's localization property (cf. spectral coherence). Even very controlled sources such as lasers operate in a range of frequencies (known as the spectral linewidth). In practice, filtered light, diffraction grating separated light and laser light are all routinely referred to as monochromatic. Often light sources can be compared and one be labeled as ‚Äúmore monochromatic‚Äù (in a similar usage as monodispersity). A device which isolates a narrow band of frequencies from a broader-bandwidth source is called a monochromator, even though the bandwidth is often explicitly specified, and thus a collection of frequencies is understood.

Sepharvaim (a word which is grammatically dual) is commonly, but not certainly, identified with the twin cities of Sippar Yahrurum and Sippar Amnanum on the banks of the Euphrates, north of Babylon. The name probably translates to \\"Magnificent king.\\" (An unrelated person with the name of Adrammelech is described in Hebrew writings as a son and murderer of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, in and Isaiah 37:38. He was known in the Akkadian language as Arda-Mulissu, and was the rebellious son of Sennacherib.) Historical background =Biblical account= reports: \\"The Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim\\" (NIV). The Sepharvites are given as a people deported by the Assyrians to Samaria. Adrammelech and the god Anammelech (about whom likewise little is known) are again seemingly alluded to in : \\"Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?\\" (NIV). has an almost identical passage. =Interpretation= According to A. R. Millard, Saul Olyan, and others, Adrammelech likely represents an original  æAdd√Ær-mele·∏µ, \\"majestic king\\" or \\"the majestic one is king\\". Cognate  æAdd√Ær-milk, along with similar Milk- æadd√Ær (with the morphemes inverted) and Ba øal- æadd√Ær (\\"majestic master\\" or \\"majestic Baal\\"), is recorded in ancient Semitic sources as an epithet of Baal, or a baal. Adrammelech is commonly understood as a companion of Anammelech, due to their association in 2 Kings 17, the similarity of their names, and the similarity of their worship through child sacrifice. Before the identification with epigraphic  æAdd√Ær-milk, various attempts (since generally rejected) were made to interpret the origin of the name Adrammelech. The reconstructed form *Adar-malik (or the variant *Adru-malku) was once almost universally accepted as the original Akkadian form of the name.  * For example, Eberhard Schrader wrote in 1885: Peter Jensen proposed in the late nineteenth century that ( æA·∏èrammele·∏µ, \\"Adrammelech\\") was a manuscript error for (* æƒÇ·∏èa·∏èmele·∏µ, \\"*Adadmelech\\"), due to the typographical similarity of (r) and (d), which Jensen thought was a variant of unrecorded (*·∏§ƒÉ·∏èa·∏èmele·∏µ, \\"King Hadad\\" or \\"Hadad is king\\"), thus identifying Adrammelech with the Canaanite god Hadad.Jensen, Peter (1890). Kosmologie, p. 757 (footnote). Adad is in fact recorded as a variant of Hadad; on Blue Letter Bible: \\"Probably an orthographical variation for .\\" but Millard writes: \\"If the Sepharvites were of Aramean or Phoenician origin, it is very unlikely that the name of their god would have lost its initial h, unless the Hebrew authors of Kings copied the information from a cuneiform text in Babylonian, which would not express it.\\" At the turn of the century, William Muss-Arnolt suggested that  æA·∏èrammele·∏µ could represent his own reconstructed Akkadian *Atra-malik, comparing the form to the names Atra-·∏´asis and *(A)tar-ilu, writing, \\"Atra- malik would probably yield .\\" In the Talmud From the Jewish Encyclopedia: Demonology thumb Like many pagan gods, Adrammelech is considered a demon in some Judeo-Christian traditions. So he appears in Milton's Paradise Lost, where he is a fallen angel who, along with Asmodeus, is vanquished by Uriel and Raphael. According to Collin de Plancy's book on demonology, Infernal Dictionary, Adrammelech became the President of the Senate of the demons. He is also the Chancellor of Hell and supervisor of Satan's wardrobe. He is generally depicted with a human torso, a mule's head, a peacock tail, and the limbs of a mule or peacock. In fiction A poet's description of Adrammelech (spelled Adramelech as in Greek) can be found in Robert Silverberg's short story \\"Basileus\\".

In demonology, Belphegor (or Beelphegor, Be øl-pe øor - Lord of the Gap) is a demon, and one of the seven princes of Hell, who helps people make discoveries. He seduces people by suggesting to them ingenious inventions that will make them rich. Bishop and witch-hunter Peter Binsfeld believed that Belphegor tempts by means of laziness. Also, according to Peter Binsfeld's Binsfeld's Classification of Demons, Belphegor is the chief demon of the deadly sin known as Sloth in Christian tradition. History Belphegor originated as Baal-Peor, the Moabite, the father of the god to whom the Israelites became attached in Shittim (Numbers 25:3), which was associated with licentiousness and orgies. It was worshipped in the form of a phallus. As a demon, he is described in Kabbalistic writings as the \\"disputer\\", the counterpart of the sixth Sephiroth \\"beauty\\". When summoned, he can grant riches, the power of discovery and ingenious invention. His role as a demon was to sow discord among men and seduce them to evil through the apportionment of wealth. The palindromic prime number 1000000000000066600000000000001 is known as Belphegor's prime, due to the significance of containing the number 666, on both sides enclosed by thirteen zeroes and a one.

The secretariat is mainly responsible for carrying out routine operations of the Politburo and the coordination of organizations and stakeholders to achieve tasks as set out by the Politburo. It is empowered by the Politburo to make routine day-to-day decisions on issues of concern in accordance to the decisions of the Politburo, but it must consult the Politburo on substantive matters. The secretariat was set up in January 1934. It is nominally headed by General Secretary, though the position of \\"General Secretary\\" was not always one and the same as the top party leader. Secretaries of the secretariat (Shujichu Shuji) are considered some of the most important political positions in the Communist Party and in contemporary China more generally. By protocol, its members are ranked above the vice chairmen of the National People's Congress as well as State Councilors. The General Secretary presides over the work of the secretariat.  History  The Secretariat of the Central Committee was formed in January 1934 at the 5th Plenary Session of the 6th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which was held in Shanghai. On March 20, 1943, the Politburo, in a joint decision, decreed that the secretariat will be responsible for carrying out the work of the Politburo according to the general policy framework determined by the Politburo, and that it is vested with the power to make decisions within this general framework. In 1956, the party created the position of the \\"General Secretary\\" to head its secretariat. The position is not that of the foremost leader in the party, which at the time was the \\"Chairman of the Central Committee\\". Rather, the general secretary was in charge of carrying out the day-to-day work of the Communist Party's Politburo. Its inaugural general secretary was Deng Xiaoping, with prominent political figures such as Peng Zhen and Tan Zhenlin being secretaries. During the Cultural Revolution, the post of general secretary as well as the secretariat itself completely ceased to function. Beginning at the 9th Party Congress, party documents made no mention of the secretariat. The body was restored after the Cultural Revolution in February 1980, with Hu Yaobang occupying the position of first-ranked secretary, which is analogous to the position formerly called the \\"General Secretary\\". Since its reinstatement, the composition of the secretariat has varied between 6 and 12 members. Wan Li, Hu Qili, Hu Jintao, Zeng Qinghong, Xi Jinping, and Liu Yunshan have all successively held the position of the first-ranked Secretary of the secretariat.

He was among the first to publish against the persecution of witches. His most influential work is De Praestigiis Daemonum et Incantationibus ac Venificiis (On the Illusions of the Demons and on Spells and Poisons, 1563). Biography Weyer was born in Grave, a small town in the Duchy of Brabant in the Habsburg Netherlands. He attended the Latin schools in 's-Hertogenbosch and Leuven and when he was about 14 years of age, he became a live-in student of Agrippa, in Antwerp. Agrippa had to leave Antwerp in 1532 and he and Weyer settled in Bonn, under the protection of prince-bishop Hermann von Wied. (Agrippa completed a work on demons in 1533 and perished two years later while on a trip to France). From 1534, Weyer studied medicine in Paris and later in Orl√©ans, but it appears unlikely that he obtained the title of Doctor through these studies. Eventually, he practiced as a physician in his native Grave. Weyer was appointed town physician of Arnhem in 1545. In this capacity, he was asked for advice on witchcraft in a 1548 court case involving a fortune teller. In spite of a subsidy from emperor Charles V, the town of Arnhem was no longer able to pay Weyer's salary. Weyer moved to Cleves in 1550, where he became court doctor to duke William the Rich, through mediation by humanist Konrad Heresbach.Witchcraft and Medicine, Jaroslav Nemec, National Institutes of Health, DHEW Pub. No. (NIH) 76-636 Weyer published his major works on demons, magic, and witchcraft, in which he applied a skeptical medical view to reported wonders and supposed examples of magic or witchcraft. He retired from his post in 1578 and was succeeded by his son, Galenus Wier (1547-1619). After retirement he completed a medical work on a subject unrelated to witchcraft. He died on 24 February 1588 at the age of 73 in Tecklenburg, while visiting an individual who had fallen ill. He was buried in the local churchyard, which no longer exists. Work and critical reception Weyer's works include medical and moral works as well as his more famous critiques of magic and witchcraft: * De Praestigiis Daemonum et Incantationibus ac Venificiis (On the Illusions of the Demons and on Spells and Poisons), 1563. * Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (The False Kingdom of the Demons), an appendix to De Praestigiis Daemonum, 1577. * Medicarum Observationum rararum liber, 1567, (a book of medical observations on rare, hitherto undescribed diseases), translated into German as: * Artzney-Buch von etlichen bi√ü anher unbekandten unnd unbeschriebenen Kranckheiten, 1580 * De lamiis liber item de commentitiis jejuniis 1577, (A book on witches together with a treatise on false fasting), translated into German as: * De Lamiis, Das ist: Von Teuffelsgespenst Zauberern und Gifftbereytern, kurtzer doch gr√ºndtlicher Bericht... 1586 * De ira morbo 1577.

Two volume set. \\"About 40 people at Casale in Western Lombardy smeared the bolts of the town gates with an ointment to spread the plague. Those who touched the gates where infected and many died. The heirs of the dead and diseased had actually paid people at Casale to smear the gates in order to obtain their inheritances more quickly.\\" -From The Deceptions of Demons, 1583 Weyer criticised the Malleus Maleficarum and the witch hunting by the Christian and Civil authorities; he is said to have been the first person that used the term \\"mentally ill\\" or melancholy to designate those women accused of practicing witchcraft.\\"Four Hundred Years Later: An Appreciation of Johann Weyer\\" John Martin, Maryland, Books at Iowa 59 (November 1993); (c)The University of Iowa In a time when witch trials and executions were just beginning to be common, he sought to derogate the law concerning witchcraft prosecution. He claimed that not only were examples of magic largely incredible but that the crime of witchcraft was literally impossible, so that anyone who confessed to the crime was likely to be suffering some mental disturbance (mainly \\"melancholy,\\" which was at that time a very flexible category with many different symptoms). Some scholars have said that Weyer intended to mock the concept of the hellish hierarchy that previous grimoires had established by writing those two books and entitling his catalogue of demons Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (The False Kingdom of the Demons). Nevertheless, while he defended the idea that the Devil's power was not as strong as claimed by the orthodox Christian churches in De Praestigiis Daemonum, he defended also the idea that demons did have power and could appear before people who called upon them, creating illusions; but he commonly referred to magicians and not to witches when speaking about people who could create illusions, saying they were heretics who were using the Devil's power to do it, and when speaking on witches, he used the term mentally ill.\\"Will the Real Johann Weyer Please Stand Up?\\" Thomas J. Schoeneman, 2002 Moreover, Weyer did not only write the catalogue of demons Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, but also gave their description and the conjurations to invoke them in the appropriate hour and in the name of God and the Trinity, not to create illusions but to oblige them to do the conjurer's will, as well as advice on how to avoid certain perils and tricks if the demon was reluctant to do what he was commanded or a liar. In addition, he wanted to abolish the prosecution of witches, and when speaking on those who invoke demons (which he called spirits) he carefully used the word exorcist. Weyer never denied the existence of the Devil and a huge number of other demons of high and low order. His work was an inspiration for other occultists and demonologists, including an anonymous author who wrote the Lemegeton (The Lesser Key of Solomon). There were many editions of his books (written in Latin), especially Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, and several adaptations in English, including Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584). Weyer's appeal for clemency for those accused of the crime of witchcraft was opposed later in the sixteenth century by the Swiss physician Thomas Erastus, the French legal theorist Jean Bodin and King James VI of Scotland.  Tributes  The Wier tower in Tecklenburg The church of Tecklenburg displays a plaque in memory of Weyer and in 1884 the town erected a tower in his honor, the Wierturm. The Dutch human rights organization for health workers is named the Johannes Wier Foundation after him. Alongside his tutor, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, he appears as a character in the video game Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Kurt Baschwitz, a pioneer in communication studies and mass psychology, dedicated most of the content of his first (Dutch) monography on witchcraft and witch trials De strijd tegen den duivel - de heksenprocessen in het licht der massapsychologie (1948) to the merits of Weyer. Later he extended this work to his German magnum opus, Hexen und Hexenprozesse: Geschichte eines Massenwahns und seiner Bekaempfung which discussed methods of fighting attempts at mass delusion (1963). Family Johan was the son of Agnes Rhordam and Theodorus (Dirk) Wier, a merchant of hops, coal and slate, who was a schepen of Grave in the 1520s. Dirk and Agnes Wier came from Zeeland and were closely acquainted with Maximiliaan van Egmond and Fran√ßoise de Lannoy, the future in-laws of William the Silent. Johan had two known siblings, Arnold Wier and the mystic Mathijs Wier (c.1520‚Äìc.1560). In Arnhem, he married Judith Wintgens, with whom he had at least five children.Genealogy of Johannes Wier After Judith's death he married Henriette Holst. Johan's oldest son, Diederik Wier, became a jurist and diplomat, who in 1566-7, while employed by Willem IV van den Bergh, was involved in the \\"petitions of grievances about the suppression of heresy\\" by the Dutch nobility to Philip II of Spain, the rejection of which led to the Eighty Years' War.Martinus Hageman, Het kwade exempel van Gelre , Doctoral dissertation, Nijmegen 2005 Name Weyer signed all his correspondence with \\"Johannes Wier\\" or occasionally with \\"Piscinarius\\".Rien Wols, Een weldenkend en humaan mens: Johannes Wier (1515-1588), at the Brabantsen Historical Information Center website, 2 November 2009. His parents and children carried the name \\"Wier\\" as well, and in 1884 his memorial in Germany was still named \\"Wierturm\\" rather than \\"Weyerturm\\". Nevertheless, since the 20th century the name \\"Johann Weyer\\" has become standard in German and English-language scholarship. The use of \\"Weyer\\" may stem from Carl Binz's 1896 monograph \\"Doctor Johann Weyer, ein rheinischer Arzt, der erste Bek√§mpfer des Hexenwahns\\", who in 1885 had already given a lecture \\"Wier oder Weyer?\\", in which he, apparently unaware of the Zeeland origin, claimed that Weyer zur deutchen Nation z√§hlte and \\"Wier\\" merely a Niederrheinische dialectical pronunciation is of Weyer.Carl Binz, Wier oder Weyer?: Nachtr√§gliches √ºber den ersten Bek√§mpfer des Hexenwahns in Deutschland, Harvard University Press, 1885.

James Hackett built her in Portsmouth New Hampshire and she was launched on 15 August 1799. She was one of the original six frigates whose construction the Naval Act of 1794 had authorized. The name \\"Congress\\" was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed.Pickering, Timothy (14 March 1795). Letter to George Washington. Founders Online, National Archives. Retrieved 25 September 2019Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy's capital ships, and so Congress and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than the standard frigates of the period. Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War. During the War of 1812 she made several extended length cruises in company with her sister ship and captured, or assisted in the capture of twenty British merchant ships. At the end of 1813, due to a lack of materials to repair her, she was placed in ordinary for the remainder of the war. In 1815 she returned to service for the Second Barbary War and made patrols through 1816. In the 1820s she helped suppress piracy in the West Indies, made several voyages to South America, and was the first U.S. warship to visit China. Congress spent her last ten years of service as a receiving ship until ordered broken up in 1834. Construction In 1785 Barbary pirates, most notably from Algiers, began to seize American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean. In 1793 alone, eleven American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the Naval Act of 1794.Allen (1909), pp. 41‚Äì42.Beach (1986), pp. 26‚Äì27. The act provided funds to construct six frigates, but included a clause that if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers, the construction of the ships would be halted.Beach (1986), p. 29. Joshua Humphreys' design was unusual for the time, being deep, long on keel and narrow of beam (width) and mounting very heavy guns. The design called for a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states in the size of their navies. This being so, the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates with the ability to escape from a ship of the line.Toll (2006), pp. 49‚Äì53.Beach (1986), pp. 29‚Äì30, 33.Allen (1909), pp. 42‚Äì45. Congress was given her name by President George Washington after a principle of the United States Constitution.Toll (2006), p. 61. Her keel was reportedly laid down late in 1795Allen (1909), p. 47. at a shipyard in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. James Hackett was charged with her construction and Captain James Sever served as a superintendent. Her construction proceeded slowly and was completely suspended when in March 1796, a peace treaty was signed with Algiers.An Act to provide a Naval Armament. (1794). Library of Congress. Retrieved 17 December 2010. Congress remained at the shipyard, incomplete, until relations with France deteriorated in 1798 with the start of the Quasi-War. At the request of then President John Adams, funds were approved on 16 July to complete her construction.Allen (1909), p. 56. =Armament= Building plan of Congress and Constellation The Naval Act of 1794 had specified 36-gun frigates. However, Congress and her sister-ship were re-rated to 38s because of their large dimensions, being in length and in width.Chapelle (1949), p. 128.Beach (1986), p. 32. The \\"ratings\\" by number of guns were meant only as an approximation, and Congress often carried up to 48 guns.Roosevelt (1883), p. 53. Ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns such as modern Navy ships carry. The guns and cannons were designed to be completely portable and often were exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer outfitted armaments to their liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, the armaments on ships would change often during their careers, and records of the changes were not generally kept.Jennings (1966), pp. 17‚Äì19. During her first cruise in the Quasi-War against France, Congress was noted to be armed with a battery of forty guns consisting of twenty-eight and twelve . For her patrols during the War of 1812, she was armed with a battery of forty-four guns consisting of twenty- four 18 pounders and twenty . Quasi-War Congress launched on 15 August 1799 under the command of Captain Sever. After fitting-out in Rhode Island, she set off on her maiden voyage 6 January 1800 sailing in company with Essex to escort merchant ships to the East Indies.Toll (2006), p. 136. Six days later she lost all of her masts during a gale. Because her rigging had been set and tightened in a cold climate, it had slackened once she reached warmer temperatures.Cooper (1856), p. 133. Without the full support of the rigging, all the masts fell during a four-hour period, killing one crew member trying to repair the main mast.Allen (1909), pp. 151‚Äì152.Maclay and Smith (1898) Volume 1, p. 191. The crew rigged an emergency sail and limped back to the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs.Allen (1909), p. 153. While there, some of Sever's junior officers announced that they had no confidence in his ability as a commanding officer. A hearing was held, and Captain Sever was cleared of any wrongdoing and remained in command of Congress, though many of his crew soon transferred out to .Toll (2006), p. 139. Remaining in port for six months while her masts and rigging were repaired, she finally sailed again on 26 July for the West Indies.Morris (1880), p. 120. Congress made routine patrols escorting American merchant ships and seeking out French ships to capture. On two occasions she almost ran aground; first while pursuing a French privateer, she ran into shallow water where large rocks were seen near the surface. Although their exact depth was not determined, Sever immediately abandoned pursuit of the privateer and changed course towards deeper waters.Morris (1880), p. 121. Her second close call occurred off the coast of the Caicos Islands, when during the night she drifted close to the reefs. At daybreak her predicament was discovered by the lookouts.Morris (1880), pp. 121‚Äì122. A peace treaty with France was ratified on 3 February 1801 and Congress returned to Boston in April.Allen (1909), p. 221. In accordance with an act of Congress passed on 3 March and signed by President John Adams, thirteen frigates then currently in service were to be retained. Seven of those frigates, including Congress, were to be placed in ordinary.Allen (1909), p. 255. En route to the Washington Navy Yard, she passed Mount Vernon on her way up the Potomac and Captain Sever ordered her sails lowered, flag at half mast, and a 13-gun salute fired to honor the recently deceased George Washington.Allen (1909), p. 258. Congress decommissioned at Washington along with and . First Barbary War Mediterranean Sea area of operation During the United States' preoccupation with France during the Quasi-War, troubles with the Barbary States were suppressed by the payment of tribute to ensure that American merchant ships were not harassed and seized.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 215‚Äì216. In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute he was receiving in comparison to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000.Allen (1905), pp. 88‚Äì90. In response, Thomas Jefferson sent a squadron of frigates to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and pursue peace with the Barbary States.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 228.Allen (1905), p. 92. The first squadron, under the command of Richard Dale in , was instructed to escort merchant ships through the Mediterranean and negotiate with leaders of the Barbary States. A second squadron was assembled under the command of Richard Valentine Morris in however, the performance of Morris's squadron was so poor that he was recalled and subsequently dismissed from the Navy in 1803.Toll (2006), p. 173. A third squadron was assembled under the command of Edward Preble in and by mid-1804 they had successfully fought the Battle of Tripoli Harbor.Allen (1905), p. 199. President Jefferson reinforced Preble's squadron in April and ordered four frigates to sail as soon as possible. President, Congress, Constellation and Essex were placed under the direction of Commodore Samuel Barron. Congress was captained by John Rodgers and two months were spent preparing the squadron for the voyage. They departed in late JuneToll (2006), pp. 224‚Äì227. and arrived at Gibraltar on 12 August. Congress and Essex were immediately sent to patrol off the coast of Tangier and when they returned to Gibraltar two weeks later, Congress continued on to Tripoli.Toll (2006), p. 252.Allen (1905), pp. 219‚Äì220. Congress, accompanied by Constellation, assumed blockade duties of Tripoli and captured one xebec before sailing for Malta on 25 October for repairs. On 6 November Rodgers assumed command of Constitution and in his place, Stephen Decatur assumed command of Congress.Allen (1905), p. 220. The next recorded activity of Congress is in early July 1805 when she was sent in company with to blockade Tunisia. They were joined on the 23rd by additional U.S. Navy vessels.Allen (1905), p. 268. In early September, Congress carried the Tunisian ambassador back to Washington DC.Cooper (1856), pp. 221‚Äì222.Allen (1905), p. 269. Afterward, placed in ordinary at the Washington Navy Yard, she served as a classroom for midshipmen training through 1807.Toll (2006), p. 282. War of 1812 John Rodgers ca. 1813 Congress at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard attending the launch of the USS Washington, on October 1, 1814 In 1811 Congress required extensive repairs before recommissioning with Captain John Rogers in command. She performed routine patrols early in 1812 before war was declared on 18 June. Captain John Smith assumed the command of her on 11 July 1812 and took her to join the squadron of Commodore Rodgers, where she sailed in company with , , President and .Roosevelt (1883), pp. 72‚Äì73.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 322. Almost immediately Rogers was informed by a passing American merchant ship of a fleet of British merchantmen en route to Britain from Jamaica. Congress sailed along in pursuit, but was interrupted when President began pursuing HMS Belvidera on 23 June.Cooper (1856), pp. 244‚Äì245.Roosevelt (1883), pp. 73‚Äì74. Congress trailed behind President during the chase and fired her bowchasers at the escaping Belvidera.Roosevelt (1883), pp. 74, 76. Unable to capture Belvidera, the squadron returned to the pursuit of the Jamaican fleet. On 1 July they began to follow a trail of coconut shells and orange peels the Jamaican fleet had left behind them.Roosevelt (1883), p. 77.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 325. Sailing to within one day's journey of the English Channel, the squadron never sighted the convoy and Rodgers called off the pursuit on the 13th. During their return trip to Boston, Congress assisted in the capture of seven merchant ships, including the recapture of an American vessel.Roosevelt (1883), p. 78.Cooper (1856), p. 247. Making her second cruise against the British with President, Congress sailed from Boston on 8 October. On the 31st of that month, both ships began to pursue , which was escorting two merchant ships. Galatea and her charges were chased for about three hours, during which Congress captured the merchant ship Argo. In the meantime, President kept after Galatea but lost sight of her as darkness fell. Congress and President remained together during November but they did not find a single ship to capture. On their return to the United States they passed north of Bermuda, proceeded towards the Virginia capes, and arrived back in Boston on 31 December. During their entire time at sea, the two frigates captured nine prizes.Roosevelt (1883), pp. 106‚Äì107. Congress and President were blockaded in Boston by the Royal Navy until they slipped through the blockade on 30 April 1813 and put to sea for their third cruise of the war. On 2 May they pursued but she outran them both and escaped. Congress parted company with President on the 8th and patrolled off the Cape Verde Islands and the coast of Brazil. She only captured four small British merchant ships during this period and returned to the Portsmouth Navy Yard for repairs in late 1813. By this time of the war, materials and personnel were being diverted to the Great Lakes, which created a shortage of resources necessary to repair her. Due to the amount of repairs she needed, it was decided instead to place her in ordinary, where she stayed for the remainder of the war.Toll (2006), pp. 419‚Äì420.Roosevelt (1883), pp. 174‚Äì175.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 521.

Second Barbary War Soon after the United States declared war against Britain in 1812, Algiers took advantage of the United States' preoccupation with Britain and began intercepting American merchant ships in the Mediterranean.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 2, pp. 4‚Äì5. On 2 March 1815, at the request of President James Madison, Congress declared war on Algiers. Work preparing two American squadrons promptly began‚Äîone at Boston under Commodore William Bainbridge, and one at New York under Commodore Steven Decatur.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 2, p. 6.Allen (1905), p. 281. Captain Charles Morris assumed command of Congress and assigned to the squadron under Bainbridge. After repairs and refitting, she transported the Minister to Holland William Eustis to his new post. Congress departed in June and after a few weeks at Holland, sailed for the Mediterranean and arrived at Cartagena, Spain in early August joining Bainbridge's squadron.Morris (1880), p. 181.Allen (1905), pp. 292‚Äì293. By the time of Congresss arrival, however, Commodore Decatur had already secured a peace treaty with Algiers.Allen (1905), p. 293.Morris (1880), p. 182. Congress, , and sailed in company with Bainbridge's flagship ‚Äîthe first commissioned ship of the line of the U.S. Navy‚Äîas a show of force off Algiers. The squadron subsequently made appearances off Tripoli and Tunis and arrived at Gibraltar in early October.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 2, p. 20. From there, Congress and many other ships were ordered back to the United States. She arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, remained there shortly, and proceeded to Boston where she decommissioned in December and assigned to ordinary.Allen (1905), p. 294.Morris (1880), pp. 182‚Äì183. Later career In June 1816 Charles Morris again commanded Congress and began preparations for a cruise to the Pacific Coast of the United States. His objective was taking possession of Fort Astoria from the British and conducting inquiries at various ports along the coast to further improve commercial trade.Cooper (1856), p. 446.Morris (1880), pp. 183‚Äì184.Scholefield and Howay (1914), p. 432. These plans were canceled, however, when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a Spanish Navy vessel in the Gulf of Mexico. Consequently, Morris commanded a squadron of ships in the Gulf to ensure that American merchant commerce in the area would continue unmolested.Morris (1880), p. 184. Congress arrived in the Gulf of Mexico in December 1816 and made patrols through July 1817 performing duties that Morris described as \\"tedious and uninteresting\\". From there she sailed for Haiti where Morris and an agent of the United States negotiated a settlement with Henri Christophe over the case of a captured vessel. Afterward, Congress sailed for Venezuela to observe and gather information regarding the ongoing Venezuelan War of Independence. She arrived about 21 August and visited the Venezuelan city of Barcelona soon after.Morris (1880), pp. 185‚Äì190. Upon return to the Norfolk Navy Yard later the same year, Morris requested relief as commander due to failing health and Arthur Sinclair assumed command.Morris (1880), pp. 190‚Äì191. Sinclair began preparing for a return voyage to South America carrying a diplomatic contingent to assure various South American countries of the United States' intention to remain neutral in their conflicts with Spain for independence.Brackenridge (1820), pp. 77‚Äì78. The diplomats included Caesar A. Rodney, John Graham, Theodorick Bland, Henry Brackenridge, William Reed, and Thomas Rodney.Brackenridge (1820), p. 78. Congress departed on 4 December and returned to Norfolk in July 1818.Brackenridge (1820), p. 79.Read (1870), pp. 238, 241. Early in 1819 Congress made a voyage under the command of Captain John D. Henley to China, becoming the first U.S. warship to visit that country. She returned to the United States in May 1821.Raymond (1851), p. 47. Shortly afterward, pirates in the West Indies began seizing American merchant ships and in early 1822, she served as the flagship of Commodore James Biddle. She is recorded as collecting prisoners from the captured pirate ship Bandara D'Sangare on 24 July of that year.Cooper (1856), p. 448.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 2, p. 28. Her next recorded activity is returning to Norfolk in April 1823 where Biddle immediately prepared for a voyage to Spain and Argentina to deliver the newly appointed Ministers, Hugh Nelson and Caesar A. Rodney respectively.Wainwright (1951), p. 171.Read (1870), p. 241. Extensive modifications were required to the berth deck of Congress in order to accommodate Rodney's wife and eleven children.Wainwright (1951), p. 180. Additionally, Rodney's household goods and furniture, described by Biddle as \\"enough to fill a large merchant ship,\\" were loaded into her hold that required much of the ships stores to be relocated.Wainwright (1951), pp. 179‚Äì180. She departed from Wilmington, Delaware on 8 June and arrived at Gibraltar where Hugh Nelson disembarked for Spain. On 18 September Congress arrived at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where Rodney hired his own merchant ship to carry his family the rest of the distance to Buenos Aires.Wainwright (1951), p. 182. Congress subsequently returned to Norfolk on 17 December.Wainwright (1951), p. 183. After her return, Congress served as a receiving ship; being moved between the Norfolk and Washington Navy Yards under tow as needed. She remained on this duty for the next ten years until a survey of her condition was performed in 1834, and found unfit for repair, she was broken up the same year.Toll (2006), p. 474.

Burns, p.x, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 or 1603)Compendium Maleficarum, vol 2, By Francesco Maria Guazzo, p. 86, Kessinger Publishing, 2003 was a German bishop and theologian. Peter, a son of a farmer and craftsman, was born in the village of Binsfeld in the rural Eifel region, located in the modern state of Rhineland-Palatinate; he died in Trier as a victim of the bubonic plague. Binsfeld grew up in the predominantly Catholic environment of the Eifel region. Education and career Considered by a local abbot as a very gifted boy, Peter Binsfeld was sent to Rome for study. After his studies, Binsfeld returned to his home region and became an important personality in the anti-Protestant Catholic activities of the late 16th century. He was elected Auxiliary bishop of Trier and became a well-known writer on theology, who achieved notoriety as one of the most prominent witch- hunters of his time. Binsfeld was one of the main drivers of the Trier witch trials that ravaged the area under the dominion of Archbishop Johann von Sch√∂nenberg between 1581-93. Binsfeld wrote the influential treatise De confessionibus maleficorum et sagarum ('Of the Confessions of Warlocks and Witches'),Witch hunts in Europe and America: an encyclopedia By William E. Burns, p. xxx, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 translated into several languages (Trier, 1589). This work discussed the confessions of alleged witches, and claimed that even if such confessions were produced by torture, they should still be believed. He also encouraged denouncements. He thought that girls under age twelve and boys under age fourteen could not be considered guilty of practising witchcraft, but due to the precocity of some children the law should not be completely strict. This point of view can be considered as moderate, taking into account that some tribunals had condemned children between two and five years of age to be burnt at the stake. Contrary to other authors of the time, Binsfeld doubted the ability of shapeshifting and the validity of the diabolical mark. In 1589 Binsfield published an influential list of demons and their associated sins, including the demons associated with the Seven Deadly Sins: Lucifer (pride), Mammon (greed), Asmodeus (lust), Leviathan (envy), Beelzebub (gluttony), Satan (wrath) and Belphegor (sloth).Encyclopedia of Demons and Demonology, By Rosemary Guiley, p. 28-29, Facts on File, 2009.Witch hunts in Europe and America: an encyclopedia By William E.

It is the only species in the genus Steatornis and the family Steatornithidae. Nesting in colonies in caves, oilbirds are nocturnal feeders on the fruits of the oil palm and tropical laurels. They are the only nocturnal flying fruit-eating birds in the world (the kakapo is flightless). They forage at night, with specially adapted eyesight. However they navigate by echolocation in the same way as bats, one of the few birds to do so. They produce a high-pitched clicking sound of around 2 kHz that is audible to humans.Snow (2008), pp. 137‚Äì143. Taxonomy and etymology Oilbirds are related to the nightjars and usually placed with these in the order Caprimulgiformes. However, the nightjars and their relatives are insectivores while the oilbird is a specialist fructivore, and it is sufficiently distinctive to be placed in a family (Steatornithidae) and suborder (Steatornithes) of its own. Some research indicates that it should even be considered a distinct order (Steatornithiformes). The caripensis of the binomial name means \\"of Caripe\\", and Steatornis means \\"fat bird\\", in reference to the fatness of the chicks. The oilbird is called a gu√°charo or tayo in Spanish, both terms being of indigenous origin. In Trinidad it was sometimes called diablotin (French for \\"little devil\\"), presumably referring to its loud cries, which have been likened to those of tortured men. The common name \\"oilbird\\" comes from the fact that in the past chicks were captured and boiled down in order to make oil. The fossil record of the family suggests that they were once more widely distributed around the globe. The first fossil oilbird was described by Storrs Olson in 1987 from a fossil found in the Green River Formation in Wyoming. The species, Prefica nivea was probably not adapted to hovering flight or living in caves, unlike the oilbird. Some of the same families and genera of plants the present day oilbird feeds on have been found in the Green River Formation, suggesting that prehistoric species may have eaten the same fruit and spread the same seeds. Another species from the Upper Eocene has been discovered in France.Thomas, B.T. (2017). Oilbird (Steatornithidae). In: del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A., Sargatal, J., Christie, D.A. & de Juana, E. (eds.). Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. (retrieved from http://www.hbw.com/node/52261 on 25 February 2017). Description This is a large, slim bird at , with a wing span of . It has a flattened, powerfully hooked, bill surrounded by deep chestnut rictal bristles up to long. The adult weighs but the chicks can weigh considerably more, at up to , when their parents feed them a good deal of fruit before they fly.Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), The feathers of the oilbird are soft like those of many nightbirds, but not as soft as those of owls or nightjars, as they do not need to be silent like predatory species. The oilbird is mainly reddish-brown with white spots on the nape and wings. Lower parts are cinnamon-buff with white diamond- shaped spots edged in black, these spots start small towards the throat and get larger towards the back. The stiff tail feathers are a rich brown spotted with white on either side. The feet are small and almost useless, other than for clinging to vertical surfaces. The long wings have evolved to make it capable of hovering and twisting flight, which enables it to navigate through restricted areas of its caves. For example, the wings have deep wingtip slotting, like New World vultures, to reduce the stalling speed, and the wings have a low aspect ratio and low wing-loading, all to make the oilbird capable of flying at low speeds. The eyes of oilbirds are highly adapted to nocturnal foraging. The eyes are small, but the pupils are relatively large, allowing the highest light-gathering capacity of any bird (f-number of 1.07). The retina is dominated by rod cells, 1,000,000 rods per mm2, the highest density of any vertebrate eye, which are organised in layers, an arrangement unique among birds but shared by deep-sea fish. They have low numbers of cone cells, and the whole arrangement would allow them to capture more light in low light conditions but probably have poor vision in daylight. Although they have specially adapted vision to forage by sight, they are among the few birds known to supplement sight by echolocation in sufficiently poor light conditions, using a series of sharp audible clicks for this purpose. The only other birds known to do this are some species of swift. In addition to clicks used for echolocation oilbirds also produce a variety of harsh screams while in their caves. Entering a cave with a light especially provokes these raucous calls; they also may be heard as the birds prepare to emerge from a cave at dusk. Distribution and habitat Oilbirds roosting on a more open ledge in Ecuador The oilbird ranges from Guyana and the island of Trinidad to Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. Carre√±o, R., J. Nolla & J. Astort (December 2002). Cavidades del Wei-Assipu-tepui, Macizo del Roraima, Brasil. Bolet√≠n de la Sociedad Venezolana de Espeleolog√≠a 36: 36‚Äì45. They range from sea-level to . The species has highly specific habitat requirements, needing both caves to breed in and roost in frequently, and forest containing fruiting trees. Where suitable caves are absent, oilbirds will roost and breed in narrow gorges and grottos with suitable rock shelves. One such colony in Ecuador held a population of a hundred birds in a canyon with ledges protected by vegetation. Some smaller caves and gorges are used only for roosting. While it was once thought that oildbirds always or nearly always roosted in caves, canyons or gullies, researchers placing GPS trackers on non-breeding birds found that they regularly roost in trees in the forest as well as in caves. It is a seasonal migrant across some of its range, moving from its breeding caves in search of fruit trees. It has occurred as a rare vagrant to Costa Rica, Panama and Aruba. The Gu√°charo Cave (Oilbird Cave), in the mountainous Caripe district of northern Monagas, Venezuela, is where Alexander von Humboldt first studied the species. Behaviour The widespread habit of roosting in trees was only recently discovered by scientists Oilbirds are nocturnal. During the day the birds rest on cave ledges and leave at night to find fruit outside the cave. It was once thought that oilbirds only roosted in caves, and indeed never saw daylight, but studies using GPS/acceleration loggers found that non-breeding birds only roosted in caves or other rock shelters one night in three, the other nights roosting in trees. The scientists responsible for the discovery also found that birds roosting in caves were highly active through the night, whereas birds roosting in the forest were far less active. They hypothesised that each environment carried costs; birds roosting in the forest were more vulnerable to predators and birds roosting in caves expended considerable energy competing with rivals and defending nesting and roosting ledges. =Breeding= Oilbird on a ledge in a cave Oilbirds are colonial cave nesters. The nest is a heap of droppings, usually above water‚Äîeither a stream or the sea‚Äîon which 2‚Äì4 glossy white eggs are laid which soon become stained brown. These are rounded but with a distinctly pointed smaller end and average by . The squabs become very fat before fledging, weighing around a third more than the adult birds. Status and conservation The Gu√°charo Cave was Venezuela's first national monument, and is the centerpiece of a national park; according to some estimates there may be 15,000 or more birds living there. Colombia also has a national park named after its \\"Cueva de los Gu√°charos\\", near the southern border with Ecuador. Oilbirds have been reported in various other places along the Andean mountain chain, including near Ecuador's Cueva de los Tayos and in Brazil: they are known to dwell as far south as the Carrasco National Park in Bolivia. Dunston Cave, at the Asa Wright Nature Centre in Trinidad, is home to about 200 nesting pairs. Classified as 'Least Concern' by the IUCN red list as of October 2016, despite a decreasing population .

The word is a portmanteau of spam and forgery, coined by German software developer, and critic of Scientology, Tilman Hausherr.Attack of the Robotic Poets, ZDNet, by Kevin Poulsen, May 06, 1999 Sporgery resembles crapflooding, which is also intended to disrupt a forum. However, sporgery is not merely disruptive but also deceptive or libellous‚Äîit involves falsifying objectionable posts so they appear to come from newsgroup regulars. The purpose is not merely to jam the forum, but also to sully the reputations of its regular users by falsely signing their names to offensive posts. Origins in alt.religion.scientology The word sporgery was coined in the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology, an Internet newsgroup where people discuss the controversial belief system of Scientology. One of the various actions of the \\"war\\" between Scientology and the Internet involved various individuals who had posted more than a million forged newsgroup articles to the newsgroup, using the message headers (valid names and e-mail addresses) of articles written by Scientology critics and other legitimate posters, and appending to those headers the bodies of other articles harvested from racist newsgroups. The result was to flood the newsgroup with over one million forged articles that made the other posters appear to be hateful \\"racist bigots\\". (Critics accused Scientology of planning and conducting the spam flood, but the organization denied this.) The apparent intent of this attack was to render the newsgroup useless for discussion and criticism of Scientology. Another purpose may have been to lower the reputation of the posters so that people would not take their criticisms of Scientology seriously. At the peak of this attack, the attackers had six computers posting sporgeries into the newsgroup, dumping into USENET an average of 170 megabytes in 44,075 articles every month. From October 1998 to September 1999, 1,462,390,911 sporgery bytes were detected: that figure does not include the sporgery which was canceled (deleted from USENET) before it could propagate. Just before the sporgery attack ended, the sporgery resulted in more than 90% of the newsgroup's traffic. To accomplish the sporgery attack, the spammers used several methods to acquire Internet access. Open NNTP servers were used when available, to such an extent that a great many had to be closed by their owners. When open NNTP servers eventually became scarce, open proxies were used. These proxies allowed Scientology partisans to use someone else's computer hardware to sporge. Because default security policies in many proxy server products at the time (late 1990s) were lax, many such proxies were available for abuse. Since that time, open proxies have become the most popular resource for other spammers to abuse, eclipsing open relays and other insecure hosts. The third method used to acquire newsgroup posting access, and the method used the most, was to use volunteers to go out and buy Internet dialup access from an Internet service provider using a false name and address, and using cash or a money order. They were given a large amount of cash and air fare to fly to a city specifically to acquire Internet access for later use in sporging. One such volunteer, Tory Bezazian, later left Scientology and confessed to performing this task, giving the names of the Scientology staff members who were allegedly in charge of the sporgery project. The sporgery attack against alt.religion.scientology ended a few months after the name and address of one of the perpetrators was acquired by one of the victims, at which time the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation got involved. No indictments were made, nor were there any arrests. Other sporgery attacks Since the emergence of this technique of disrupting a newsgroup, a few other groups have been targeted this way. One, news.admin.net-abuse.email, is used for discussion of spamming and other email abuse problems. A person or persons using the pseudonym \\"Hipcrime\\" have attacked this and other groups with sporgeries, usually nonsense or Dissociated Press text posted under random names of legitimate posters. Sporgery is also common in warez newsgroups. See also  * References External links * The Attack Against ALT.RELIGION.SCIENTOLOGY Via Forged Article Flood (David M.

They are sometimes called poor-me-ones, after their haunting calls. There are seven species in one genus, Nyctibius, in tropical Central and South America. These are nocturnal insectivores which lack the bristles around the mouth found in the true nightjars. They hunt from a perch like a shrike or flycatcher. During the day they perch upright on tree stumps, camouflaged to look like part of the stump. The single spotted egg is laid directly on the top of a stump. Evolution and taxonomy Paraprefica major fossil The potoos are today an exclusively New World family, but they apparently had a much more widespread distribution in the past. Fossil remains of potoos dating from the Oligocene and Eocene have been found in France and Germany. A complete skeleton of the genus Paraprefica has been found in Messel, Germany. It had skull and leg features similar to those of modern potoos, suggesting that it may be an early close relative of the modern potoos. Because the only fossils other than these ancient ones that have been found are recent ones of extinct species, it is unknown if the family once had a global distribution which has contracted, or if the distribution of the family was originally restricted to the Old World and has shifted to the New World. A 1996 study of the mitochondrial DNA of the potoos supported the monophyly of the family although it did not support the previous assumption that it was closely related to the oilbirds. The study also found a great deal of genetic divergence between the species, suggesting that these species are themselves very old. The level of divergence is the highest of any genus of birds, being more typical of the divergence between genera or even families. This raises the possibility that there are several cryptic species to be discovered. For example, the northern potoo was for a long time considered to be the same species as the common potoo, but the two species have now been separated on the basis of their calls. In spite of this there is no morphological way to separate the two species. Morphology The potoos are a highly conservative family in appearance, with all the species closely resembling one another; species accounts in ornithological literature remark on their unusual appearance.Cohn-Haft, M (1999) \\"Family Nyctibiidae (Potoos)\\". in del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Sargatal, J. (eds). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 5: Barn-Owls to Hummingbirds. Lynx Editions. pp. 288‚Äì297 Potoos range from 21‚Äì58 cm in length. They resemble upright sitting nightjars, a closely related family (Caprimulgidae). They also resemble the frogmouths of Australasia, that are stockier and have much heavier bills. They have proportionally large heads for their body size and long wings and tails. The large head is dominated by a massive broad bill and enormous eyes. In the treatment of the family in the Handbook of the Birds of the World, Cohn-Haft describes the potoos as \\"little more than a flying mouth and eyes\\". The bill, while large and broad, is also short, barely projecting past the face. It is delicate, but has a unique \\"tooth\\" on the cutting edge of the upper mandible that may assist in foraging. Unlike the closely related nightjars, the potoos lack rictal bristles around the mouth. The legs and feet are weak and used only for perching. The eyes are large, even larger than those of nightjars. As in many species of nocturnal birds, they reflect the light of flashlights. Their eyes, which could be conspicuous to potential predators during the day, have unusual slits in the lids, which allow potoos to sense movement even when their eyes are closed. Their plumage is cryptic, helping them blend into the branches on which they spend their days. Habitat and distribution The potoos have a Neotropical distribution. They range from Mexico to Argentina, with the greatest diversity occurring in the Amazon Basin, which holds five species. They are found in every Central and South American country. They also occur on three Caribbean islands: Jamaica, Hispaniola and Tobago. The potoos are generally highly sedentary, although there are occasional reports of vagrants, particularly species that have travelled on ships. All species occur in humid forests, although a few species also occur in drier forests. Behavior Common potoo camouflaged on a stump The potoos are highly nocturnal and generally do not fly during the day. They spend the day perched on branches with the eyes half closed. With their cryptic plumage they resemble stumps, and should they detect potential danger they adopt a \\"freeze\\" position which even more closely resembles a broken branch.Attenborough, D. 1998 The Life of Birds. BBC The transition between perching and the freeze position is gradual and hardly perceptible to the observer. The English zoologist Hugh Cott, describing Nyctibius griseus as \\"this wonderful bird\\", writes that it \\"habitually selects the top of an upright stump as a receptacle for its egg, which usually occupies a small hollow just, and only just, large enough to contain it ... the stump selected had thrown up a new leader just below the point of fracture ... and the birds sat facing this in such a way that when viewed from behind they came into line and blended with the grey stem.\\"Cott, Hugh. 1940. Adaptive Coloration in Animals. Oxford University Press. pp. 352‚Äì353. See Hugh Cott for his drawing of a 'Poor-me-one'. =Diet and feeding= Potoos feed at dusk and at night on flying insects. Their typical foraging technique is to perch on a branch and occasionally fly out in the manner of a flycatcher in order to snatch a passing insect. They occasionally fly to vegetation to glean an insect off it before returning to their perch, but they do not attempt to obtain prey from the ground. Beetles form a large part of their diet, but they also take moths, grasshoppers and termites. One northern potoo was found with a small bird in its stomach as well. Having caught an insect, potoos swallow it whole without beating or crushing it. =Breeding= Potoos are monogamous breeders and both parents share responsibilities for incubating the egg and raising the chick. The family does not construct a nest of any kind, instead laying the single egg on a depression in a branch or at the top of a rotten stump. The egg is white with purple-brown spots. One parent, often the male, incubates the egg during the day, then the duties are shared during the night. Changeovers to relieve incubating parents and feed chicks are infrequent to minimise attention to the nest, as potoos are entirely reliant on camouflage to protect themselves and their nesting site from predators. The chick hatches about one month after laying and the nestling phase is two months, a considerable length of time for a landbird. The plumage of nestling potoos is white and once they are too large to hide under their parents they adopt the same freeze position as their parents, resembling clumps of fungus. =Defense= Mobbing behavior has also been observed among common potoos (Nyctibius griseus). Avian mobbing is a widespread behavior in which an individual or a group of birds deliberately confronts a potential predator. Mobbing birds crowd around the predator, approaching and retreating, sometimes even chasing and attacking the predator. They also emit loud repeated calls, which generally attract additional birds of other species to join the mobbing. The behaviors described above, suggest that common potoos adopt different defensive strategies depending upon circumstances. For a lone potoo, or brooding adult with an active predator close to the nest, the best course to avoid detection is to remain motionless and rely on camouflage. In the case of more distant, localized threat, however, the risks resulting from very gradual movement by an adult are exceeded by the less cryptic nesting. Nocturnal predators rely less on vision for locating prey therefore a different strategy may be required at night.

They are found from the Indian Subcontinent across Southeast Asia to Australia. Biology They are named for their large flattened hooked bill and huge frog-like gape, which they use to capture insects. Their flight is weak. They rest horizontally on branches during the day, camouflaged by their cryptic plumage. Up to three white eggs are laid in the fork of a branch, and are incubated by the female at night and the male in the day. The three Podargus species are large frogmouths restricted to Australia and New Guinea, that have massive flat broad bills. They are known to take larger prey such as small vertebrates (frogs, mice, etc.), which are sometimes beaten against a stone before swallowing. The ten Batrachostomus frogmouths are found in tropical Asia. They have smaller, more rounded bills and are predominantly insectivorous. Both Podargus and Batrachostomus have bristles around the base of the bill, and Batrachostomus has other, longer bristles which may exist to protect the eyes from insect prey. In April 2007, a new species of frogmouth was described from the Solomon Islands and placed in a newly established genus, Rigidipenna. Taxonomy DNA-DNA hybridisation studies have suggested that the two frogmouth groups may not be as closely related as previously thought, and that the Asian species may be separable as a new family, the Batrachostomidae. Although frogmouths are traditionally included in the order Caprimulgiformes, another study has cast doubt on their placement within that order, and they may be distinct enough to warrant an order of their own, Podargiformes, as Gregory Mathews proposed in 1918. =Species= A pair of tawny frogmouths resting in a tree fork during the day * Genus Podargus :* Tawny frogmouth, Podargus strigoides :* Marbled frogmouth, Podargus ocellatus :* Papuan frogmouth, Podargus papuensis * Genus Batrachostomus :* Large frogmouth, Batrachostomus auritus :* Dulit frogmouth, Batrachostomus harterti :* Philippine frogmouth, Batrachostomus septimus :* Gould's frogmouth, Batrachostomus stellatus :* Sri Lanka frogmouth, Batrachostomus moniliger :* Hodgson's frogmouth, Batrachostomus hodgsoni :* Short-tailed frogmouth, Batrachostomus poliolophus :* Javan frogmouth, Batrachostomus javensis :* Blyth's frogmouth, Batrachostomus affinis :* Sunda frogmouth, Batrachostomus cornutus * Genus Rigidipenna :* Solomons frogmouth, Rigidipenna inexpectata References External links *Frogmouth videos on the Internet Bird Collection *Video: Finding the Sri-Lanka Frogmouth, Southern India *Scientists discover new genus of frogmouth bird in Solomon Islands * * ","title":"Frogmouth"},{"id":"262039","text":"Mammography (also called mastography) is the process of using low-energy X-rays (usually around 30 kVp) to examine the human breast for diagnosis and screening. The goal of mammography is the early detection of breast cancer, typically through detection of characteristic masses or microcalcifications. As with all X-rays, mammograms use doses of ionizing radiation to create images. These images are then analyzed for abnormal findings. It is usual to employ lower-energy X-rays, typically Mo (K-shell x-ray energies of 17.5 and 19.6 keV) and Rh (20.2 and 22.7 keV) than those used for radiography of bones. Ultrasound, ductography, positron emission mammography (PEM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are adjuncts to mammography. Ultrasound is typically used for further evaluation of masses found on mammography or palpable masses not seen on mammograms. Ductograms are still used in some institutions for evaluation of bloody nipple discharge when the mammogram is non-diagnostic. MRI can be useful for further evaluation of questionable findings, as well as for screening pre-surgical evaluation in patients with known breast cancer, in order to detect additional lesions that might change the surgical approach, for example, from breast-conserving lumpectomy to mastectomy. Other procedures being investigated include tomosynthesis. For the average woman, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends (2016) mammography every two years between the ages of 50 and 74, concluding that \\"the benefit of screening mammography outweighs the harms by at least a moderate amount from age 50 to 74 years and is greatest for women in their 60s\\". The American College of Radiology and American Cancer Society recommend yearly screening mammography starting at age 40. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (2012) and the European Cancer Observatory (2011) recommend mammography every 2 to 3 years between ages 50 and 69.http://eu-cancer.iarc.fr/cancer-13-breast- screening.html,en These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation. Additionally, mammograms should not be performed with increased frequency in patients undergoing breast surgery, including breast enlargement, mastopexy, and breast reduction. The Cochrane Collaboration (2013) concluded after ten years that trials with adequate randomization did not find an effect of mammography screening on total cancer mortality, including breast cancer. The authors of this Cochrane review write: \\"If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and over-treatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2,000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings.\\" The authors conclude that the time has come to re- assess whether universal mammography screening should be recommended for any age group. They state that universal screening may not be reasonable. The Nordic Cochrane Collection updated research in 2012 and stated that advances in diagnosis and treatment make mammography screening less effective today, rendering it ‚Äúno longer effective.‚Äù They conclude that ‚Äúit therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend‚Äù for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet. On the contrary, a report in the New England Journal of Medicine attributes the poor effectiveness of national mammography screening programs at reducing breast cancer mortality to radiation-induced cancers. Mammography has a false-negative (missed cancer) rate of at least ten percent. This is partly due to dense tissue obscuring the cancer and the appearance of cancer on mammograms having a large overlap with the appearance of normal tissue. A meta-analysis review of programs in countries with organized screening found a 52% over-diagnosis rate. History As a medical procedure that induces ionizing radiation, the origin of mammography can be traced to the discovery of x-rays by Wilhelm R√∂ntgen in 1895. In 1913, German surgeon Albert Salomon performed a mammography study on 3,000 mastectomies, comparing X-rays of the breasts to the actual removed tissue, observing specifically microcalcifications. By doing so, he was able to establish the difference as seen on an X-ray image between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors in the breast. Salomon's mammographs provided substantial information about the spread of tumors and their borders. In 1930, American physician and radiologist Stafford L. Warren published \\"A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast\\", a study where he produced stereoscopic X-rays images to track changes in breast tissue as a result of pregnancy and mastitis. In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery, he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases. In the early 1950s, Uruguayan radiologist Raul Leborgne developed the breast compression technique to produce better quality images, and described the differences between benign and malign microcalcifications. In the late 1950s, Robert Egan at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center combined a technique of low kVp with high mA and single emulsion films to devise a method of screening mammography for the first time. He published these results in 1959 in a paper, and subsequently in a 1964 book called Mammography.Medich DC, Martel C. Medical Health Physics. Health Physics Society 2006 Summer School. Medical Physics Publishing. pp.25 The \\"Egan technique\\", as it became known, enabled physicians to detect calcification in breast tissue; of the 245 breast cancers that were confirmed by biopsy among 1,000 patients, Egan and his colleagues at M.D. Anderson were able to identify 238 cases by using his method, 19 of which were in patients whose physical examinations had revealed no breast pathology. Use of mammography as a screening technique spread clinically after a 1966 study demonstrating the impact of mammograms on mortality and treatment led by Philip Strax. This study, based in New York, was the first large-scale randomized controlled trial of mammography screening.  Procedure  Illustration of a mammogram A mobile mammography unit in New Zealand During the procedure, the breast is compressed using a dedicated mammography unit. Parallel-plate compression evens out the thickness of breast tissue to increase image quality by reducing the thickness of tissue that x-rays must penetrate, decreasing the amount of scattered radiation (scatter degrades image quality), reducing the required radiation dose, and holding the breast still (preventing motion blur). In screening mammography, both head-to-foot (craniocaudal, CC) view and angled side-view (mediolateral oblique, MLO) images of the breast are taken. Diagnostic mammography may include these and other views, including geometrically magnified and spot-compressed views of the particular area of concern. Deodorant, talcum powder or lotion may show up on the X-ray as calcium spots, so women are discouraged from applying them on the day of their exam. There are two types of mammogram studies: screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms. Screening mammograms, consisting of four standard X-ray images, are performed yearly on patients who presents with no symptoms. Diagnostic mammograms are reserved for patients with breast symptoms, changes, or abnormal findings seen on their screening mammograms. Diagnostic mammograms are also performed on patients with breast implants, breast reductions, and patients with personal and/or family histories of breast cancer. Until some years ago, mammography was typically performed with screen-film cassettes. Today, mammography is undergoing transition to digital detectors, known as digital mammography or Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM). The first FFDM system was approved by the FDA in the U.S. in 2000. This progress is occurring some years later than in general radiology. This is due to several factors: # The higher spatial resolution demands of mammography # Significantly increased expense of the equipment # Concern by the FDA that digital mammography equipment demonstrate that it is at least as good as screen-film mammography at detecting breast cancers without increasing dose or the number of women recalled for further evaluation. As of March 1, 2010, 62% of facilities in the United States and its territories have at least one FFDM unit.Mammography Quality Scorecard , from the Food and Drug Administration. Updated March 1, 2010. Accessed March 31, 2010. (The FDA includes computed radiography units in this figure.Mammography Frequently Asked Questions , from the American College of Radiology. Revised January 8, 2007; accessed April 9, 2007.) Mammograms are either looked at by one (single reading) or two (double reading) trained professionals: these film readers are generally radiologists, but may also be radiographers, radiotherapists, or breast clinicians (non-radiologist physicians specializing in breast disease). Double reading, which is standard practice in the UK, but less common in the US, significantly improves the sensitivity and specificity of the procedure. Clinical decision support systems may be used with digital mammography (or digitized images from analogue mammography), but studies suggest these approaches do not significantly improve performance or provide only a small improvement. =Digital= Digital mammography is a specialized form of mammography that uses digital receptors and computers instead of x-ray film to help examine breast tissue for breast cancer. The electrical signals can be read on computer screens, permitting more manipulation of images to allow radiologists to view the results more clearly . Digital mammography may be \\"spot view\\", for breast biopsy, or \\"full field\\" (FFDM) for screening. Digital mammography is also utilized in stereotactic biopsy. Breast biopsy may also be performed using a different modality, such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While radiologists had hoped for more marked improvement, the effectiveness of digital mammography was found comparable to traditional x-ray methods in 2004, though there may be reduced radiation with the technique and it may lead to fewer retests. Specifically, it performs no better than film for post-menopausal women, who represent more than three-quarters of women with breast cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against digital mammography. Digital mammography is a NASA spin-off, utilizing technology developed for the Hubble Space Telescope. As of 2007, about 8% of American screening centers used digital mammography. Around the globe, systems by Fujifilm Corporation are the most widely used. In the United States, GE's digital imaging units typically cost US$300,000 to $500,000, far more than film-based imaging systems. Costs may decline as GE begins to compete with the less expensive Fuji systems. = 3D Mammography = Three-dimensional mammography, also known as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), tomosynthesis, and 3D breast imaging, is a mammogram technology that creates a 3D image of the breast using X-rays. When used in addition to usual mammography, it results in more positive tests. Cost effectiveness is unclear as of 2016. Another concerns is that it more than doubles the radiation exposure. = Photon counting = Photon-counting mammography was introduced commercially in 2003 and was shown to reduce the x-ray dose to the patient by approximately 40% compared to conventional methods while maintaining image quality at an equal or higher level. The technology was subsequently developed to enable spectral imaging with the possibility to further improve image quality, to distinguish between different tissue types, and to measure breast density. = Galactography = A galactography (or breast ductography) is a type of mammography used to visualize the milk ducts. Prior to the mamography itself, a radiopaque substance is injected into the duct system. This test is indicated when nipple discharge exists. Scoring Mammogram results are often expressed in terms of the BI-RADS Assessment Category, often called a \\"BI-RADS score.\\" The categories range from 0 (Incomplete) to 6 (Known biopsy ‚Äì proven malignancy). In the UK mammograms are scored on a scale from 1-5 (1 = normal, 2 = benign, 3 = indeterminate, 4 = suspicious of malignancy, 5 = malignant). Evidence suggests that accounting for genetic risk factors improve breast cancer risk prediction. \\"Work-up\\" process In the past several years, the \\"work-up\\" process has become highly formalized. It generally consists of screening mammography, diagnostic mammography, and biopsy when necessary, often performed via stereotactic core biopsy or ultrasound-guided core biopsy. After a screening mammogram, some women may have areas of concern which cannot be resolved with only the information available from the screening mammogram. They would then be called back for a \\"diagnostic mammogram\\". This phrase essentially means a problem-solving mammogram. During this session, the radiologist will be monitoring each of the additional films as they are taken by a radiographer. Depending on the nature of the finding, ultrasound may often be used as well. Generally, the cause of the unusual appearance is found to be benign. If the cause cannot be determined to be benign with sufficient certainty, a biopsy will be recommended. The biopsy procedure will be used to obtain actual tissue from the site for the pathologist to examine microscopically to determine the precise cause of the abnormality. In the past, biopsies were most frequently done in surgery, under local or general anesthesia. The majority are now done with needles in conjunction with either ultrasound or mammographic guidance to be sure that the area of concern is the area that is biopsied. These core biopsies require only local anesthesia, similar to what would be given during a minor dental procedure.  Risks  Normal (left) versus cancerous (right) mammography image. The use of mammography as a screening tool for the detection of early breast cancer in otherwise healthy women without symptoms is controversial. Keen and Keen indicated that repeated mammography starting at age fifty saves about 1.8 lives over 15 years for every 1,000 women screened. This result has to be seen against the adverse effects of errors in diagnosis, over-treatment, and radiation exposure. The Cochrane analysis of screening indicates that it is \\"not clear whether screening does more good than harm\\". According to their analysis, 1 in 2,000 women will have her life prolonged by 10 years of screening, while 10 healthy women will undergo unnecessary breast cancer treatment. Additionally, 200 women will suffer from significant psychological stress due to false positive results. Newman points out that screening mammography does not reduce death overall, but causes significant harm by inflicting cancer scare and unnecessary surgical interventions. The Nordic Cochrane Collection notes that advances in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer may make breast cancer screening no longer effective in decreasing death from breast cancer, and therefore no longer recommend routine screening for healthy women as the risks might outweigh the benefits. Often women are quite distressed to be called back for a diagnostic mammogram. Most of these recalls will be false positive results. Of every 1,000 U.S. women who are screened, about 7% will be called back for a diagnostic session (although some studies estimate the number to be closer to 10% to 15%). About 10 of these individuals will be referred for a biopsy; the remaining 60 cases are found to be of benign cause. Of the 10 referred for biopsy, about 3.5 will have cancer and 6.5 will not. Of the 3.5 who have cancer, about 2 will have an early stage cancer that will be cured after treatment. Mammography may also produce false negatives. Estimates of the numbers of cancers missed by mammography are usually around 20%.Mammograms , National Cancer Institute Reasons for not seeing the cancer include observer error, but more frequently it is because the cancer is hidden by other dense tissue in the breast, and even after retrospective review of the mammogram, the cancer cannot be seen. Furthermore, one form of breast cancer, lobular cancer, has a growth pattern that produces shadows on the mammogram that are indistinguishable from normal breast tissue. = Mortality = The Cochrane Collaboration states that the best quality evidence does not demonstrate a reduction in mortality or a reduction in mortality from all types of cancer from screening mammography. The Canadian Task Force found that for women ages 50 to 69, screening 720 women once every 2 to 3 years for 11 years would prevent 1 death from breast cancer. For women ages 40 to 49, 2,100 women would need to be screened at the same frequency and period to prevent a single death from breast cancer. Women whose breast cancer was detected by screening mammography before the appearance of a lump or other symptoms commonly assume that the mammogram \\"saved their lives\\". In practice, the vast majority of these women received no practical benefit from the mammogram. There are four categories of cancers found by mammography: # Cancers that are so easily treated that a later detection would have produced the same rate of cure (women would have lived even without mammography). # Cancers so aggressive that even early detection is too late to benefit the patient (women who die despite detection by mammography). # Cancers that would have receded on their own or are so slow-growing that the woman would die of other causes before the cancer produced symptoms (mammography results in over- diagnosis and over-treatment of this class). # A small number of breast cancers that are detected by screening mammography and whose treatment outcome improves as a result of earlier detection. Only 3% to 13% of breast cancers detected by screening mammography will fall into this last category. Clinical trial data suggests that 1 woman per 1,000 healthy women screened over 10 years falls into this category.Parker-Pope, Tara. \\"Mammogram's Role as Savior Is Tested.\\" New York Times (blog). 24 Oct. 2011. Web. 8 Nov. 2011.<>. Screening mammography produces no benefit to any of the remaining 87% to 97% of women. The probability of a woman falling into any of the above four categories varies with age. A 2016 review for the United States Preventive Services Task Force found that mammography was associated with an 8%-33% decrease in breast cancer mortality in different age groups, but that this decrease was not statistically significant at the age groups of 39-49 and 70-74. The same review found that mammography significantly decreased the risk of advanced cancer among women aged 50 and older by 38%, but among those aged 39 to 49 the risk reduction was a non significant 2%. = False positives = The goal of any screening procedure is to examine a large population of patients and find the small number most likely to have a serious condition. These patients are then referred for further, usually more invasive, testing. Thus a screening exam is not intended to be definitive; rather it is intended to have sufficient sensitivity to detect a useful proportion of cancers. The cost of higher sensitivity is a larger number of results that would be regarded as suspicious in patients without disease. This is true of mammography. The patients without disease who are called back for further testing from a screening session (about 7%) are sometimes referred to as \\"false positives\\". There is a trade-off between the number of patients with disease found and the much larger number of patients without disease that must be re-screened. Research shows that false-positive mammograms may affect women's well-being and behavior. Some women who receive false-positive results may be more likely to return for routine screening or perform breast self- examinations more frequently. However, some women who receive false-positive results become anxious, worried, and distressed about the possibility of having breast cancer, feelings that can last for many years. False positives also mean greater expense, both for the individual and for the screening program. Since follow-up screening is typically much more expensive than initial screening, more false positives (that must receive follow-up) means that fewer women may be screened for a given amount of money. Thus as sensitivity increases, a screening program will cost more or be confined to screening a smaller number of women. = Overdiagnosis = The central harm of mammographic breast cancer screening is overdiagnosis: the detection of abnormalities that meet the pathologic definition of cancer but will never progress to cause symptoms or death. Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a researcher at Dartmouth College, states that \\"screen-detected breast and prostate cancer survivors are more likely to have been over-diagnosed than actually helped by the test.\\" Estimates of overdiagnosis associated with mammography have ranged from 1% to 54%. In 2009, Peter C. Gotzsche and Karsten Juhl J√∏rgensen reviewed the literature and found that 1 in 3 cases of breast cancer detected in a population offered mammographic screening is over-diagnosed. In contrast, a 2012 panel convened by the national cancer director for England and Cancer Research UK concluded that 1 in 5 cases of breast cancer diagnosed among women who have undergone breast cancer screening are over-diagnosed. This means an over-diagnosis rate of 129 women per 10,000 invited to screening. = False negatives = Mammograms also have a rate of missed tumors, or \\"false negatives.\\" Accurate data regarding the number of false negatives are very difficult to obtain because mastectomies cannot be performed on every woman who has had a mammogram to determine the false negative rate. Estimates of the false negative rate depend on close follow-up of a large number of patients for many years. This is difficult in practice because many women do not return for regular mammography making it impossible to know if they ever developed a cancer. In his book The Politics of Cancer, Dr. Samuel S. Epstein claims that in women ages 40 to 49, 1 in 4 of cancer is missed at each mammography. Researchers have found that breast tissue is denser among younger women, making it difficult to detect tumors. For this reason, false negatives are twice as likely to occur in pre-menopausal mammograms (Prate). This is why the screening program in the UK does not start calling women for screening mammograms until age 50. The importance of these missed cancers is not clear, particularly if the woman is getting yearly mammograms. Research on a closely related situation has shown that small cancers that are not acted upon immediately, but are observed over periods of several years, will have good outcomes. A group of 3,184 women had mammograms that were formally classified as \\"probably benign.\\" This classification is for patients who are not clearly normal but have some area of minor concern. This results not in the patient being biopsied, but rather in having early follow up mammography every 6 months for 3 years to determine whether there has been any change in status. Of these 3,184 women, 17 (0.5%) did have cancers. Most importantly, when the diagnosis was finally made, they were all still stage 0 or 1, the earliest stages. Five years after treatment, none of these 17 women had evidence of re- occurrence. Thus, small early cancers, even though not acted on immediately, were still reliably curable. = Other risks = The radiation exposure associated with mammography is a potential risk of screening, which appears to be greater in younger women. The largest study of radiation risk from mammography concluded that for women 40 years of age and older, the risk of radiation-induced breast cancer was minuscule, particularly compared with the potential benefit of mammographic screening, with a benefit-to-risk ratio of 48.5 lives saved for each life lost due to radiation exposure. In contrast epidemiologic studies show a high incidence of breast cancer following mammography screening. Organizations such as the National Cancer Institute and United States Preventive Task Force do not take such risks into account when formulating screening guidelines. The majority of health experts agree that the risk of breast cancer for asymptomatic women under 35 is not high enough to warrant the risk of radiation exposure. For this reason, and because the radiation sensitivity of the breast in women under 35 is possibly greater than in older women, most radiologists will not perform screening mammography on women under 40. However, if there is a significant risk of cancer in a particular patient (BRCA positive, positive family history, palpable mass), mammography may still be important. Often, the radiologist will try to avoid mammography by using ultrasound or MRI imaging. While screening between ages 40 and 50 is still controversial, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that there is some small benefit in terms of early detection. Currently, the American Cancer Society, the American College of Radiology, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists encourage annual mammograms beginning at age 40. Retrieved 2013-09-11. Retrieved 2013-09-11 The National Cancer Institute encourages mammograms one to two years for women ages 40 to 49.Screening Mammograms: Questions and Answers , from the National Cancer Institute. Released May 2006; accessed April 9, 2007. In contrast, the American College of Physicians, a large internal medicine group, has recently encouraged individualized screening plans as opposed to wholesale biannual screening of women aged 40 to 49. In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that screening of women ages 40 to 49 be based on individual risk factors, and that screening should not be routine in this age group. Their report says that the benefits of screenings before the age of 50 do not outweigh the risks. =Pain= The mammography procedure can be painful. Reported pain rates range from 6-76%, with 23-95% experiencing pain or discomfort. Experiencing pain is a significant predictor in women not re- attending screening. There are few proven interventions to reduce pain in mammography, but evidence suggests that giving women information about the mammography procedure prior to it taking place may reduce the pain and discomfort experienced. Furthermore, research has found that standardised compression levels can help to reduce patients' pain while still allowing for optimal diagnostic images to be produced. Regulation Mammography facilities in the United States and its territories (including military bases) are subject to the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA). The act requires annual inspections and accreditation every 3 years through an FDA-approved body. Facilities found deficient during the inspection or accreditation process can be barred from performing mammograms until corrective action has been verified or, in extreme cases, can be required to notify past patients that their exams were sub-standard and should not be relied upon. At this time, MQSA applies only to traditional mammography and not to related scans, such as breast ultrasound, stereotactic breast biopsy, or breast MRI. Many states in the US require a notification to be given to women with dense breasts to inform them that mammography is less accurate if breast tissue density is high. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration proposed a rule that would require doctors inform these women that they may need other imaging tests in addition to mammograms.

Such a state is usually achieved at high homologous temperature. Examples of superplastic materials are some fine- grained metals and ceramics. Other non-crystalline materials (amorphous) such as silica glass (\\"molten glass\\") and polymers also deform similarly, but are not called superplastic, because they are not crystalline; rather, their deformation is often described as Newtonian fluid. Superplastically deformed material gets thinner in a very uniform manner, rather than forming a \\"neck\\" (a local narrowing) that leads to fracture.G. E. Dieter, Mechanical Metallurgy, Third Edition, McGraw-Hill Inc., 1986, p. 299‚Äì301 and 452‚Äì453, . Also, the formation of microvoids, which is another cause of early fracture, is inhibited. In metals and ceramics, requirements for it being superplastic include a fine grain size (less than approximately 20 micrometres) and a fine dispersion of thermally stable particles, which act to pin the grain boundaries and maintain the fine grain structure at the high temperatures and existence of two phases required for superplastic deformation. Those materials that meet these parameters must still have a strain rate sensitivity (a measurement of the way the stress on a material reacts to changes in strain rate) of >0.3 to be considered superplastic. The mechanisms of superplasticity in metals are still under debate‚Äîmany believe it relies on atomic diffusion and the sliding of grains past each other. Also, when metals are cycled around their phase transformation, internal stresses are produced and superplastic- like behaviour develops. Recently, high-temperature superplastic behaviour has also been observed in iron aluminides with coarse grain structures. It is claimed that this is due to recovery and dynamic recrystallization.  Advantages of superplastic forming  The process offers a range of important benefits, from both the design and production aspects. To begin with there is the ability to form components with double curvature and smooth contours from single sheet in one operation, with exceptional dimensional accuracy and surface finish, and none of the \\"spring back\\" associated with cold forming techniques. Because only single surface tools are employed, lead times are short and prototyping is both rapid and easy, because a range of sheet alloy thicknesses can be tested on the same tool.  Forming techniques  There are three forming techniques currently in use to exploit these advantages. The method chosen depends upon design and performance criteria such as size, shape, and alloy characteristics. = Cavity forming = A graphite-coated blank is put into a heated hydraulic press. Air pressure is then used to force the sheet into close contact with the mould. At the beginning, the blank is brought into contact with the die cavity, hindering the forming process by the blank/die interface friction. Thus, the contact areas divide the single bulge into a number of bulges, which are undergoing a free bulging process. The procedure allows the production of parts with relatively exact outer contours. This forming process is suitable for the manufacturing of parts with smooth, convex surfaces. = Bubble forming = A graphite coated blank is clamped over a 'tray' containing a heated male mould. Air pressure forces the metal into close contact with the mould. The difference between this and the female forming process is that the mould is, as stated, male and the metal is forced over the protruding form. For the female forming the mould is female and the metal is forced into the cavity. The tooling consists of two pressure Chambers and a counter punch, which is linearly displaceable. Similar to the cavity forming technology, at the process beginning, the firmly clamped blank is bulged by gas pressure. The second phase of the process involves the material being formed over the punch surface by applying a pressure against the previous forming direction. Due to a better material use, which is caused by process conditions, blanks with a smaller initial thickness compared to cavity forming can be used. Thus, the bubble forming technology is particularly suitable for parts with high forming depths. = Diaphragm forming = A graphite coated blank is placed into a heated press. Air pressure is used to force the metal into a bubble shape before the male mold is pushed into the underside of the bubble to make an initial impression. Air pressure is then used from the other direction to final form the metal around the male mould. This process has long cycle times because the superplastic strain rates are low. Product also suffers from poor creep performance due to the small grain sizes and there can be cavitation porosity in some alloys. Surface texture is generally good however. With dedicated tooling, dies and machines are costly. The main advantage of the process is that it can be used to produce large complex components in one operation. This can be useful for keeping the mass down and avoiding the need for assembly work, a particular advantage for aerospace products. For example, the diaphragm-forming method (DFM) can be used to reduce the tensile flow stress generated in a specific alloy matrix composite during deformation.  Aluminium and aluminium based alloys  Superplastically formed (SPF) aluminium alloys have the ability to be stretched to several times their original size without failure when heated to between 470 and 520 ¬∞C. These dilute alloys containing zirconium, later known by the trade name SUPRAL, were heavily cold worked to sheet and dynamically crystallized to a fine stable grain size, typically 4‚Äì5 Œºm, during the initial stages of hot deformation. Also superplastic forming is a net-shape processing technology that dramatically decreases fabrication and assembly costs by reducing the number of parts and the assembly requirements. Using SPF technology, it was anticipated that a 50% manufacturing cost reduction can be achieved for many aircraft assemblies, such as the nose cone and nose barrel assemblies. Other spin-offs include weight reduction, elimination of thousands of fasteners, elimination of complex featuring and a significant reduction in the number of parts. The breakthrough for superplastic Al-Cu alloys was made by Stowell, Watts and Grimes in 1969 when the first of several dilute aluminium alloys (Al-6% Cu-0.5%Zr) was rendered superplastic with the introduction of relatively high levels of zirconium in solution using specialized casting techniques and subsequent electrical treatment to create extremely fine ZrAl3 precipitates. = Commercial alloys = Some commercial alloys have been thermo-mechanically processed to develop superplasticity. The main effort has been on the Al 7000 series alloys, Al-Li alloys, Al-based metal-matrix composites, and mechanically alloyed materials. = Aluminium alloy composites = Aluminium alloy and its composites have wide applications in automotive industries. At room temperature, composites usually have higher strength compared to its component alloy. At high temperature, aluminium alloy reinforced by particles or whiskers such as SiO2, Si3N4, and SiC can have tensile elongation more than 700%. The composites are often fabricated by powder metallurgy to ensure fine grain sizes and the good dispersion of reinforcements. The grain size that allows the optimal superplastic deformation to happen is usually 0.5~1 Œºm, less than the requirement of conventional superplasticity. Just like other superplastic materials, the strain rate sensitivity m is larger than 0.3, indicating good resistance against local necking phenomenon. A few aluminium alloy composites such as 6061 series and 2024 series have shown high strain rate superplasticity, which happens in a much higher strain rate regime than other superplastic materials. This property makes aluminium alloy composites potentially suitable for superplastic forming because the whole process can be done in a short time, saving time and energy.  Deformation mechanism for aluminium alloy composites  The most common deformation mechanism in aluminium alloy composites is grain boundary sliding (GBS), which is often accompanied by atom/dislocation diffusion to accommodate deformation. The GBS mechanism model predicts a strain rate sensitivity of 0.3, which agrees with most of the superplastic aluminium alloy composites. Grain boundary sliding requires the rotation or migration of very fine grains at relatively high temperature. Therefore, the refinement of grain size and the prevention of grain growth at high temperature is of importance. The very high temperature (close to melting point) is also said to be related to another mechanism, interfacial sliding. Because at high temperatures, partial liquids appear in the matrix. The viscosity of the liquid plays the main role to accommodate the sliding of adjacent grain boundaries. The cavitation and stress concentration caused by the addition of second phase reinforcements are inhibited by the flow of liquid phase. However, too much liquid leads to voids thus deteriorating the stability of the materials. So temperature close to but not exceeding too much the initial melting point is often the optimal temperature. The partial melting could lead to the formation of filaments at the fracture surface, which can be observed under scanning electron microscope. The morphology and chemistry of reinforcements also have influence on the superplasticity of some composites. But no single criterion has yet been proposed to predict their influences.  Methods to improve superplasticity  A few ways have been suggested to optimize the superplastic deformation of aluminium alloy composites, which are also indicative for other materials: # Good dispersion of reinforcements. This is also important for room-temperature performance. # Refine the grain size of the matrix. The refinement creates more grains that can slide over each other at high temperature, facilitating the grain boundary sliding mechanism. This also implies a higher optimal strain rate. The trend of increase in strain rate has been observed in materials of finer grain sizes. Severe plastic deformation like equal‚Äêchannel angular pressing has been reported to be able to achieve ultra-fine grained materials. # Appropriately choosing the temperature and the strain rate. Some composites have to be heated close to melting, which might have opposite effects on other composites.  Titanium and titanium based alloys  In the aerospace industry, Titanium alloys such as Ti‚Äì6Al‚Äì4V find extensive use in aerospace applications, not only because of their specific high temperature strength, but also because a large number of these alloys exhibit superplastic behavior. Superplastic sheet thermoforming has been identified as a standard processing route for the production of complex shapes, especially and are amenable to superplastic forming (SPF). However, in these alloys the additions of vanadium make them considerably expensive and so, there is a need for developing superplastic titanium alloys with cheaper alloying additions. The Ti-Al-Mn alloy could be such a candidate material. This alloy shows significant post- uniform deformation at ambient and near-ambient temperatures. = Ti-Al-Mn (OT4-1) alloy = Ti-Al-Mn (OT4-1) alloy is currently being used for aero engine components as well as other aerospace applications by forming through a conventional route that is typically cost, labour and equipment intensive. The Ti-Al-Mn alloy is a candidate material for aerospace applications. However, there is virtually little or no information available on its superplastic forming behaviour. In this study, the high temperature superplastic bulge forming of the alloy was studied and the superplastic forming capabilities are demonstrated. = The bulging process = The gas pressure bulging of metal sheets has become an important forming method. As the bulging process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. Many studies were made to obtain the dome height with respect to the forming time useful to the process designer for the selection of initial blank thickness as well as non-uniform thinning in the dome after forming. = Case study = The Ti-Al-Mn (OT4-1) alloy was available in the form of a 1 mm thick cold-rolled sheet. The chemical composition of the alloy. A 35-ton hydraulic press was used for the superplastic bulge forming of a hemisphere. A die set-up was fabricated and assembled with the piping system enabling not only the inert gas flushing of the die- assembly prior to forming, but also for the forming of components under reverse pressure, if needed. The schematic diagram of the superplastic forming set-up used for bulge forming with all necessary attachments and the photograph of the top (left) and bottom (right) die for SPF. A circular sheet (blank) of 118 mm diameter was cut from the alloy sheet and the cut surfaces polished to remove burrs. The blank was placed on the die and the top chamber brought in contact. The furnace was switched on to the set temperature. Once the set temperature was reached the top chamber was brought down further to effect the required blank holder pressure. About 10 minutes were allowed for thermal equilibration. The argon gas cylinder was opened to the set pressure gradually. Simultaneously, the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), fitted at the bottom of the die, was set for recording the sheet bulge. Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of bottom die), gas pressure was stopped and the furnace switched off. The formed components were taken out when the temperature of the die set had dropped to 600 ¬∞C. Easy removal of the component was possible at this stage. Superplastic bulge forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K (825, 850, 875, 900, 925 and 950 ¬∞C) at forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.87 MPa. As the bulge forming process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. An ultrasonic technique was used to measure the thickness distribution on the profile of the formed component. The components were analyzed in terms of the thickness distribution, thickness strain and thinning factor. Post deformation micro- structural studies were conducted on the formed components in order to analyze the microstructure in terms of grain growth, grain elongation, cavitations, etc.  Results and discussions  The microstructure of the as-received material with a two-dimensional grain size of 14 ¬µm is shown in Fig. 8. The grain size was determined using the linear intercept method in both the longitudinal and transverse directions of the rolled sheet. Successful superplastic forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K and argon gas forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 MPa. A maximum time limit of 250 minutes was given for the complete forming of the hemispheres. This cut-off time of 250 minutes was given for practical reasons. Fig. 9 shows a photo-graph of the blank (specimen) and a bulge formed component (temperature of 1123 K and a forming gas pressure of 0.6 MPa). The forming times of successfully formed components at different forming temperatures and pressures. From the travel of the LVDT fitted at the bottom of the die (which measured the bulge height/depth) an estimate of the rate of forming was obtained. It was seen that the rate of forming was rapid initially and decreased gradually for all the temperature and pressure ranges as reported in Table 2. At a particular temperature, the forming time reduced as the forming pressure was increased. Similarly at a given forming pressure, forming time decreased with an increase in temperature. The thickness of the bulge profile was measured at 7 points including the periphery (base) and pole. These points were selected by taking the line between centre of the hemisphere and base point as reference and offsetting by 15¬∞ until the pole point was reached. Hence the points 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 subtend an angle of 15¬∞, 30¬∞, 45¬∞, 60¬∞ and 75¬∞ respectively with the base of the hemisphere as shown in Fig. 10. The thickness was measured at each of these points on the bulge profile by using an ultrasonic technique. The thickness values for each of the successfully formed hemispherical components. Fig. 11 shows the pole thickness of fully formed hemispheres as a function of forming pressure at different temperatures. At a particular temperature the pole thickness reduced as the forming pressure was increased. For all the cases studied the pole thickness lay in the range of about 0.3 to 0.4 mm from the original blank thickness of 1 mm. The thickness strain, ln(S/S0), where S is the local thickness and S0 is the initial thickness, was calculated at different locations for all the successfully formed components. For a particular pressure the thickness strain reduced as the forming temperature was increased. Fig. 12 shows the thickness strain, ln(S/S0) as a function of position along the dome cross section in case of a component formed at 1123 K at a forming pressure of 0.6 MPa. The post-formed microstructure revealed that there was no significant change in grain size. Fig. 13 shows the microstructure of the bulge formed component at the base and the pole for a component formed at a temperature of 1148 K and forming pressure of 0.6 MPa. These microstructures show no significant change in grain size.  Conclusion  The high temperature deformation behaviour and superplastic forming capability of a Ti-Al-Mn alloy was studied. Successful forming of 90 mm diameter hemispheres using the superplastic route were carried out at the temperature range of 1098 to 1223 K and forming pressure range of 0.2 to 0.8 MPa. The following conclusions could be drawn: # The forming time decreased steeply when the gas pressure or temperature was increased. The rate of forming was initially high, but reduced progressively with time. # At a particular temperature the pole thickness reduced as the forming pressure was increased. For all the cases studied the pole thickness lay in the range of about 0.3 to 0.4 mm from the original blank thickness of 1.0 mm. # The thinning factor and thickness strain increased as one moved from the periphery to the pole. The post-formed microstructures show no significant change in grain size.  Iron and steel  Mostly on non-qualified materials, such as austenitic steel of the Fe‚ÄêMn‚ÄêAl alloy, which has some of the specific material parameters closely related to microstructural mechanisms. These parameters are used as indicators of material superplastic potentiality. The material was submitted to hot tensile testing, within a temperature range from 600 ¬∞C to 1000 ¬∞C and strain‚Äêrates varying from 10‚àí6 to 1 s‚àí1. The strain rate sensitivity parameter (m) and observed maximum elongation until rupture (Œµr) could be determined and also obtained from the hot tensile test. = Fe with Mn and Al alloys = The experiments stated a possibility of superplastic behaviour in a Fe‚ÄêMn‚ÄêAl alloy within a temperature range from 700 ¬∞C to 900 ¬∞C with grain size around 3 Œºm (ASTM grain size 12) and average strain rate sensitivity of m ‚àº 0.54, as well as a maximum elongation at rupture around 600%. = Fe with Al and Ti alloys = The superplastic behaviour of Fe-28Al, Fe-28Al-2Ti and Fe-28Al-4Ti alloys has been investigated by tensile testing, optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Tensile tests were performed at 700‚Äì900 ¬∞C under a strain rate range of about 10‚àí5 to 10‚àí2/s. The maximum strain rate sensitivity index m was found to be 0.5 and the largest elongation reached 620%. In Fe3Al and Fe Al alloys with grain sizes of 100 to 600Œºm exhibit all deformation characteristics of conventional fine grain size superplastic alloys. However, superplastic behaviour was found in large- grained iron aluminides without the usual requisites for superplasticity of a fine grain size and grain boundary sliding. Metallographic examinations have shown that the average grain size of large-grained iron aluminides decreased during superplastic deformation.  Ceramics  = The properties of ceramics = The properties of ceramic materials, like all materials, are dictated by the types of atoms present, the types of bonding between the atoms, and the way the atoms are packed together. This is known as the atomic scale structure. Most ceramics are made up of two or more elements. This is called a compound. For example, alumina (Al2O3), is a compound made up of aluminium atoms and oxygen atoms. The atoms in ceramic materials are held together by a chemical bond. The two most common chemical bonds for ceramic materials are covalent and ionic. For metals, the chemical bond is called the metallic bond. The bonding of atoms together is much stronger in covalent and ionic bonding than in metallic. That is why, generally speaking, metals are ductile and ceramics are brittle. Due to ceramic materials wide range of properties, they are used for a multitude of applications. In general, most ceramics are: * hard * wear-resistant * brittle * refractory * thermal insulators * electrical insulator * nonmagnetic * oxidation resistant * prone to thermal shock * good chemical stability High-strain-rate superplasticity has been observed in aluminium-based and magnesium-based alloys. But for ceramic materials, superplastic deformation has been restricted to low strain rates for most oxides, and nitrides with the presence of cavities leading to premature failure. Here we show that a composite ceramic material consisting of tetragonal zirconium oxide, magnesium aluminates spinal and alpha-alumina phase exhibit superplasticity at strain rates up to 1.0 s‚àí1. The composite also exhibits a large tensile elongation, exceeding 1050% or a strain rate of 0.4 s‚àí1. Superplastic metals and ceramics have the ability to deform over 100% without fracturing, permitting net-shape forming at high temperatures. These intriguing materials deform primarily by grain boundary sliding, a process accelerated with a fine grain size. However, most ceramics that start with a fine grain size experience rapid grain growth during high temperature deformation, rendering them unsuitable for extended superplastic forming. One can limit grain growth using a minor second phase (Zener pinning) or by making a ceramic with three phases, where grain to grain contact of the same phase is minimized. A research on fine grain three phase alumina- mullite(3Al2O3‚Ä¢2SiO2)-zirconia, with approximately equal volume fractions of the three phases, demonstrates that superplastic strain rates as high as 10‚àí2/sec at 1500 ¬∞C can be reached. These high strain rates put ceramic superplastic forming into the realm of commercial feasibility. = Cavitations = Superplastic forming will only work if cavitations don't occur during grain boundary sliding, those cavitations leaving either diffusion accommodation or dislocation generation as mechanisms for accommodating grain boundary sliding. The applied stresses during ceramic superplastic forming are moderate, usually 20‚Äì50 MPa, usually not high enough to generate dislocations in single crystals, so that should rule out dislocation accommodation. Some unusual and unique features of these three phase superplastic ceramics will be revealed, however, indicating that superplastic ceramics may have a lot more in common with metals than previously thought. = Yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline = Yttrium oxide is used as the stabilizer. This material is predominantly tetragonal in structure. Y-TZP has the highest flexural strength of all the zirconia based materials. The fine grain size of Y-TZP lends itself to be used in cutting tools where a very sharp edge can be achieved and maintained due to its high wear resistance. It is considered to be the first true polycrystalline ceramic shown to be superplastic with a 3-mol % Y-TZP (3Y-TZP), which is now considered to be the model ceramic system. The fine grade size leads to a very dense, non-porous ceramic with excellent mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, impact toughness, thermal shock resistance and very low thermal conductivity. Due to its characteristics Y-TZP is used in wear parts, cutting tools and thermal barrier coatings. = Grain size = Superplastic properties of 3Y-TZP is greatly affected by grain size as displaced in Fig. 3, elongation to failure decreases and flow strength increases while grain size increases. A study was made on the dependence of flow stress on grain size, the result ‚Äìin summary- shows that the flow stress approximately depends on the grain size squared: :\\\\sigma \\\\propto d^2\\\\, Where: :\\\\sigma\\\\, is the flow stress. :d is the instantaneous grain size.  Alumina (Al2O3)  Alumina is probably one of the most widely used structural ceramics, but superplasticity is difficult to obtain in alumina, as a result of rapid anisotropic grain growth during high- temperature deformation. Regardless of which, several studies have been performed on superplasticity in doped, fine-grain Al2O3 .Demonstrated that the grain size of Al2O3 containing 500-ppm MgO can be further refined by adding various dopants, such as Cr2O3, Y2O3, and TiO2. A grain size of about 0.66 ¬µm was obtained in a 500-ppm Y23-doped Al2O3. As a result of this fine grain size, the Al2O3 exhibits a rupture elongation of 65% at 1450 ¬∞C under an applied stress of 20 MPa.

Khaosai defended his WBA world title 19 times in seven years (1984‚Äì1991), winning 16 of his title fights by knockouts. He is listed #19 on Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time and named him the 43rd greatest fighter of the past 80 years in 2002. Muay Thai career Khaosai was born as Sura Saenkham () in Phetchabun Province, Northern Thailand. He was a Muay Thai fighter in the early 1980s, and took the professional name Galaxy from a restaurant and nightclub owned by his manager's friend. Khaosai had tremendous punching power, particularly in his soon-to-be legendary left hand. On the advice of his manager and trainer, he switched to Marquis of Queensbury style and began training as a western style boxer. In Muay Thai his ring names are Daoden Muangsithep () and Khaosai Wangchomphu. () Boxing style Lacking the amateur boxing experience common to most Western professional boxers, Khaosai's skills originally were limited, and he relied on toughness and his fearsome punching power to win. His southpaw style was based on closing his opponent and firing his left hand whenever he saw an opening. His right hand was used mainly to judge the distance for his left. All of his knockouts came by his left, which is arguably the hardest single punch in the history of the lower weight classes. As he gained experience, Khaosai began to develop into a more refined boxer, learning combination punching to complement his deadly left. His favorite punch, a straight left to the midsection, translates roughly as \\"the left hand that drills intestines.\\" Incredibly strong, he was never out-muscled, while opponents who tried the traditional stick-and-move techniques found he had quick feet and was able to block their movements. Boxing career Khaosai began his international style boxing career in December 1980. He won all of his first six fights, which earned him a shot at the Thailand bantamweight (118-pound) title on July 29, 1981 against Sakda Saksuree. He lost on a points decision. It was to be the last fight he would ever lose in the ring. Khaosai won his next three fights and claimed the Thai bantamweight title in 1982. He won 15 consecutive fights by knockout and climbed in the world rankings to become super flyweight (115-pound) WBA world champion Jiro Watanabe's mandatory challenger by the summer of 1984. When Watanabe failed to defend his title against Khaosai, the WBA stripped him and matched Khaosai against undefeated Eusebio Espinal for the vacant championship on November 21, 1984. Khaosai knocked out Espinal in the sixth round, beginning the longest title reign in his division's history. Khaosai defended his WBA title 19 times over the next seven years, winning 16 of his title fights by knockouts. In the mid-1980s, when world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was in his prime and scoring knockouts over everyone, boxing fans nicknamed Khaosai The Thai Tyson for knockout wins. Khaosai fought only once outside of Asia, when he defended his title in 1986 against unbeaten (and future WBA bantamweight titleholder) Israel Contreras in Cura√ßao. He had two title fights in K≈çbe, Japan, one in South Korea and one at Bung Karno Stadium, Indonesia. The rest were in Thailand, where he often fought for purses in excess of $100,000 in front of huge crowds. That, plus the fact that few top fighters anywhere were willing to challenge Khaosai, made him relatively unknown in the West. In 1988, his twin elder brother, fighting under the name Kaokor Galaxy, captured the WBA bantamweight title, making the Saenkham brothers the first twins to ever be world boxing champions. Khaosai Galaxy in 2007 Retirement He fought for the last time on December 21, 1991 in Bangkok, beating Armando Castro over 12 rounds. A few weeks later, he announced his retirement with a record of 50 wins against only one defeat, and never attempted a comeback. Life after boxing Not long after his retirement to the boxing profession, Khaosai chose to take part in the Thai entertainment industry. He first took a shot at the music industry, releasing a single, \\"Khob Khun Krub\\", meaning \\"Thank You\\", then began taking part in TV series and movies, particularly comedies. His first role as an actor occurred during the TV series Poot Mae Nam Khong (1992 version), which was then followed by Monrak luk thung (1995 version), The Legend of Suriyothai (2001), and The Bodyguard (2004) etc. In 2005, while he was taking part in a film, he was punched in the face by a drunken fan, who wished to obtain Khaosai's shirt for collection but was denied. The incident made frontline news, which displayed a photo of Khaosai, with a bandage on his face but smiling and standing next to the drunk man. In 2006, he starred in a music video for a song by fellow boxers Somluck Kamsing and Samart Payakaroon. In the video, Khaosai portrayed a shy man being approached by a young woman. After retirement, he married the Japanese Yumiko Ota, whom he had met during a trip for his second fight with Kenji Matsumura in K≈çbe, Japan in 1989. The couple lived together for only one year, and later divorced. He later married a Buriram woman, Sureerat \\"Fah\\" Saenkham (n√©e Niwesram). They had no children together, but Khaosai chose to take his wife's nephew as a stepchild. In March 2013, he made news again when he unexpectedly was married again, this time to Wannapa \\"Nung\\" Kamboonsri, before obtaining a legal divorce from his previous wife. In 2013, he finally became a father at the age of 54, when his wife safely delivered a daughter. In 2016, his wife delivered a second daughter by the end of the year. Currently, he owns two Muay Thai gyms in Bangkok and Phuket, and was a trainer for Denkaosan Kaovichit in the fight against Takefumi Sakata which took place by the end of 2008 in Yokohama, Japan. (Denkaosan knocked his opponent out by the second round, becoming the next WBA flyweight champion). Besides boxing and entertainment, Khaosai has also flirted with politics. During the 2007 Thai general election, he was a candidate in the party-list of the Puea Pandin Party, but lost. Additionally, during the 2011 Thai general election, he became a candidate on behalf of the Chartthaipattana Party for his native Phetchabun 2nd district, but lost with only 8,485 votes. Honors He was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1999 and remains a well known Boxer throughout Thailand. He is the first Thai boxer to mark the beginning of the ceremony, offering gold necklaces and other prizes to Thai boxers before the every bout. It started with his retained the ninth title against the Korean contender Tae-Il Chang at Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo, Samut Prakan in early 1989. And every time he fought, there was a saying that traffic in Bangkok was good, because everyone rushed home to see him on TV.

History Stolin grew up at the heart of the Polesia region on the Haryn River, at the crossroads of two important routes, one leading northwards to Pinsk, two others eastwards to Davyd-Haradok and Tura≈≠, that are now in Belarus, southwards to Sarny and Kyiv, that are now in Ukraine. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area which Stolin now occupies, was settled as far back as the 12th century AD. The first mention of Stolin dates to 1555. There are three stories regarding the origins of the name \\"Stolin\\". The first refers to a group of local fisherman who cast their fishing nets into a lake a pulled out 100 fish or Sto [100 in Russian] \\"Leeni\\" [a type of local fish]. The second story refers to a ferry-boat which sunk in the river and required 100 men with 100 ropes to drag it out [100 lines in Russian]. The third refers to twelve brothers who ruled over seven nearby cities and chose what became Stolin as their meeting place and capital city, hence the name may be a derivation of stol (table)> Stolny Gorod (capital city). website of Stolin in Russian about its history Stolin was occupied by the Germans from July 1941 to 1944. In August 1941, many Jewish refugees ‚Äì especially women and children ‚Äì from the nearby town of David-Gorodok came to Stolin. A ghetto was created in May 1942, surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. About 7,000 Jews lived in this small and unhealthy area, along the Bank River. The liquidation of the ghetto was conducted on September 11, 1942 by a squadron of German cavalry, the local police and the SD. The shooting took place near the airfield, in a large ditch.http://yahadmap.org/#village/stolin- brest-belarus.468 International relations =Twin towns ‚Äì Sister cities= Stolin is twinned with: * Homberg, Germany The memorial in the central square commemorates the first record about Stolin dated 1555.

He is first seen as the reincarnation of the evil Piccolo Daima≈ç in chapter #161 , published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on February 9, 1988, and is positioned as the demonic archrival of the protagonist Son Goku. However, it is later revealed that he is in fact a member of an extraterrestrial humanoid species called Namekians, those able to create the series' eponymous wish-granting Dragon Balls. After losing to Goku, Piccolo decides to team up with him and his friends in order to defeat newer, more dangerous threats, such as Vegeta, Frieza, Cell and Majin Buu. He also trains Goku's first child Gohan in martial arts, with the two forming a strong bond. Creation and development Piccolo, more specifically his parent Piccolo Daima≈ç, was created by Toriyama as he wanted to have a villain who would be a true \\"bad guy.\\" Prior to his creation, nearly all the previous villains in the series were considered too likable. His editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, stated he introduced Toriyama to evil historical figures for inspiration. Piccolo Daima≈ç was created after he told the author how Roman Emperor Nero enjoyed watching people suffer. However, the Shenlong Times issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide guidebook, says that the character was modeled after Torishima himself. After creating Piccolo Daima≈ç, Toriyama noted that it was one of the most interesting parts of the series and that he became one of his favorite characters. Although Piccolo's transformation from a villain to a hero was considered by Toriyama to be clich√©, he still felt excited when drawing him, noting that despite having a scary face, he still looks appealing. Piccolo is initially assumed to, like his parent, be a member of the , however, midway through the series it is learned that they are actually members of the alien race called . Toriyama stated that he never thought of making Piccolo an alien until Kami was introduced. But afterwards he did try to make it consistent, such as drawing the Namekian architecture similar to the throne Piccolo Daima≈ç had. =Voice actors= In the original Japanese version of the anime and all other media, Piccolo is voiced by Toshio Furukawa, with the only exception being his initial newborn child form which was voiced by Hiromi Tsuru. Furukawa, who up to that point had mostly played happy lighter-voiced characters, said he got the role because he stated in interviews at the time that he wanted to play a villain. He said it was difficult to constantly perform with a low voice because his normal lighter voice would break through if he broke concentration. When asked if Takeshi Aono's work as Piccolo Daima≈ç influenced his portrayal of Piccolo, Furukawa replied that because Piccolo Daima≈ç was impulsive, he initially played his own role as an energetic person around eighteen-years-old and later imagined him as close to thirty-years old in Dragon Ball Z. Furukawa, as well as Gohan's voice actress Masako Nozawa, said the episodes where Piccolo trains Gohan left an impression on them. He said the fans really enjoyed those episodes as well. Furukawa also cited Piccolo making a pun for Kai≈ç-sama as memorable because it was so out of character for him. By the time he reprised the voice in Dragon Ball Super, Piccolo had become Furukawa's favorite character of all his roles.Dragon Ball Super Cast Comments In English, several different voice actors have voiced Piccolo, including Scott McNeil in episodes 1-53 (1-67 unedited) in Funimation Entertainment's initial dub of Dragon Ball Z in association with Saban Entertainment and Ocean Productions as well as Geneon's dub of the first three Dragon Ball Z films,Dragon Ball Z Geneon dub's credits and episodes 108-291 of Westwood Media's dub of the franchise (in association with Ocean Productions);Dragon Ball Z Westwood dub's credits by Ethan Cole in Chinook Animation's dub of Dragon Ball GT (produced in association with Blue Water Studios);Dragon Ball GT Chinook dub's credits by Dan Woren in Bandai's English release of the video game Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout;Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout credits by British-born French actor Paul Bandey in the infamous English dubs of the movies released exclusively in the UK and the Netherlands by AB Groupe (wherein the character was referred to as \\"Big Green\\"), by David Gasman (who also voiced Goku in this dub) in the European dub of Dead Zone (there called In Pursuit of Garlic), vocal grunts by Ed Marcus in The History of Trunks (or Gohan and Trunks) and consistently by Christopher Sabat in Funimation's in-house dub of all Dragon Ball media.Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, and Dragon Ball Z Kai Funimation dub's credits Ray Chase voices Piccolo in the Toonami Asia broadcast of Dragon Ball Super produced by Bang Zoom!

He also possesses an attack called the , which is fired with one hand being supported by the other. One of Piccolo's most powerful attacks is the an attack that is expelled from Piccolo's index and middle fingers.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 7Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 8 Unlike most energy-based attacks in Dragon Ball, the potent Makank≈çsapp≈ç pierces its targets like a drill rather than enveloping them or exploding on contact. Another attack of Piccolo's is the , which involves firing off many orbs of energy that float around the opponent. Piccolo then squeezes his hand to make all the orbs converge onto the opponent, exploding on contact. The is another of his signature attacks, being one that he teaches to his pupil Gohan. Another move Piccolo is seen to have is the which is conjured by putting his hands on his chest, gathering energy and then releasing it outwards. One of Piccolo's less frequently used techniques is the ability to fire energy rays from his eyes, which he first uses against Kuririn's energy attack during their match in the 23rd Tenka'ichi Bud≈çkai, then later against Goku in the finals, and again when he trains Gohan. Piccolo can also perform a type of fusion which he does with Nail on planet Namek to confront Freeza and with Kami to confront the Androids, each time greatly increasing his power; the first time enough to clash toe-and-toe with Freeza's second form, and the latter he became much more powerful than an unmastered Super Saiyan. Appearances = In Dragon Ball= Introduced as the offspring and reincarnate of the demon Piccolo Daima≈ç, Piccolo Jr. plans to continue his parent's mission of world domination, and avenge his death at the hands of Goku. Piccolo enters the 23rd Tenka'ichi Bud≈çkai under the alias . Piccolo defeats both Kuririn, who gives up,Dragon Ball manga, volume 15, chapter 173 and Kami disguised as Hero, sealing Kami in the container of the Evil Containment Wave after Kami attacks him with the move and Piccolo sends it back in his direction.Dragon Ball manga, volume 16, chapter 181 He then fights Goku in the final round, who tricks Piccolo into enlarging himself so he can retrieve Kami,Dragon Ball manga, volume 16, chapter 187 from there causing many of Piccolo's techniques to backfire on him.

Piccolo remains amazed with the powers from Gohan and trains him in preparation to fight against the two Saiyans who will invade Earth.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 12Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 10 Early in their training, Piccolo destroys the moon to prevent Gohan from transforming into an Oozaru and removes his tail. As the year goes by, Piccolo starts to change as he spends time training Gohan, slowly beginning to bond with him. Kami himself comes to notice Piccolo's change of heart as well. When the Saiyans arrive a year later, Piccolo discovers his heritage from them. Piccolo tries to capitalize on Gohan's increased strength but cannot due to the child's fear, convincing him to withdraw Gohan from the battle and is knocked unconscious by Nappa after trying to weaken him. Piccolo saves Kuririn from being finished off by one of Nappa's attacks. Vegeta senses that Goku is close by, stronger and could pose a challenge with the others involved and thereby orders their speedy execution. Nappa then unleashes another one of his attacks, this time aiming for Gohan. Piccolo, having come to care for the boy dearly, sacrifices himself to protect Gohan from the attack, resulting in the deaths of both himself and Kami, which results in the Dragon Balls ceasing to exist.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 3, chapter 28 Vegeta is initially unable to activate the Oozaru transformation during his fight with Goku thanks to Piccolo's earlier deed. After the Saiyans are defeated, Gohan and the survivors travel to Piccolo's homeworld, Namek, to revive those who died against the Saiyans with the Namekian Dragon Balls. In the meantime, Piccolo trains in the afterlife with Kai≈ç-sama. Piccolo is resurrected on planet Namek to help Goku and others defeat the evil Freeza. He takes this time to merge with the beaten Namekian called , giving Piccolo a power increase.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 101 Despite his massive power increase and going head to head with Freeza's second transformation,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 106 Freeza transforms and Piccolo is defeated. After Freeza reaches his final form and immediately kills Dende afterward to prevent him from healing the group, Piccolo, Gohan and Kuririn attack him to no avail. In Freeza's following fight with Goku, who tries charging a Genki-dama to defeat him, Piccolo is given the remaining energy of both Gohan and Kuririn, allowing him to stall for a short time. Once Freeza emerges from the impact of the Genki-dama unscathed, Piccolo is severely injured by Freeza with a shot to the chest, leaving Goku to defeat Freeza alone. Piccolo is taken from the battlefield by Gohan at the warning of Goku, as his death would render the Dragon Balls ineffective once more. Piccolo is later teleported off the planet to safety on Earth and after regaining consciousness, declines to return to a new version of Namek as he wishes to protect Gohan and become stronger while remaining on Earth. After Freeza's death, Piccolo trains with Goku and Gohan for three years to prepare for a battle against two powerful Androids created by the Red Ribbon Army's Dr. Gero to kill Goku. Piccolo tries to intervene during Goku's battle with Android 19, but is shot down by Dr. Gero, revealed to have faked being injured to lower the guard of the Androids. Though he manages to best Dr. Gero in battle, he is unable to prevent him from activating the other Androids. After being defeated by Android 17 and Android 18, Piccolo seeks to unite with Kami, and gain another massive increase in power. After uniting with Kami, Piccolo becomes aware of a more dangerous threat named Cell, who volunteers information on himself when believing he has bested Piccolo (oblivious to Piccolo's regenerative abilities) when in reality the latter was pretending to be defeated in order to find out Cell's origin. Before his second encounter with Cell, Piccolo once again battles the Androids, except this time he battles #17 one on one.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 15, chapter 173 After a somewhat even match, Cell arrives on the battle scene; Cell needs to absorb the Androids to complete his power.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 15, chapter 174 While trying to prevent this, Piccolo is nearly killed by Cell,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 15, chapter 176 surviving the encounter thanks to his regenerative abilities and following some training in the Room of Spirit and Time, he is forced to participate in a tournament created by Cell called the Cell Games, where he fights one of the seven Cell Juniors that are created by Cell,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 213 who are later destroyed by Gohan.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 214 Piccolo laments that he cannot assist Gohan in his battle against Cell due to his lack of power, lauding Vegeta for helping Gohan after Cell's death and making the lookout his permanent residence.*Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 19, chapter 223 * Seven years later, Piccolo is poised to fight Kai≈ç-shin at the 25th Tenkaichi Bud≈çkai, forfeiting the match after finding himself reluctant to fightDragon Ball Z manga, volume 21, chapter 246 and journeying with him to confront Babidi, being turned into stone by Dabura.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 22, chapter 253 After being freed upon Dabura's death,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 23, chapter 270 he attempts to kill Babidi. Piccolo discovers Babidi survived the attempt on his life when he goes to pay respects to the now deceased Vegeta, and Babidi later demands Piccolo be brought forward or humans will die in the meantime. Piccolo plans on giving himself up until Goku talks him out of it, citing his need of his teachings. Piccolo then acts as a trainer to Goten and Trunks and their fused form Gotenks. Piccolo trains the boys in fighting the evil creature Majin Buu, who finds them and the other heroes. Piccolo tries negotiating with Buu to give the group more time to conjure a fighter strong enough to combat him, Buu agreeing to an hour, which Piccolo uses to give Goten and Trunks half a month in the Room of Spirit and Time. During Gotenks' fight with Buu, Piccolo seals them within the Room of Spirit and Time when he destroys the entrance after Gotenks lies that he has no moves left. Gotenks uses his Super Saiyan 3 form's shouting to create an exit for Piccolo and himself, allowing them to return to Earth. After more unsuccessful attempts to kill Buu, he is later absorbed by Buu along with Gotenks and Gohan and incorporated into his being. He is later freed by Goku and Vegeta,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 26, chapter 313 and he later gives his energy to Goku's Genki-Dama attack, which Goku uses to defeat Buu once and for all.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 26, chapter 322 = In Toriyama's films and Dragon Ball Super = Piccolo appears in eleven Dragon Ball Z films; in the first movie, Piccolo aids in stopping Garlic Jr.'s plot after having been attacked by his minions, wanting revenge;Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone in the second, Piccolo is brainwashed by Dr. Wheelo and made to combat the others until Gohan frees him by destroying the machinery associated with his brainwashing;Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest in the third, Piccolo comes to save Gohan from Turles and succeeds by taking a blast for him;Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might in the fourth, Piccolo combats Lord Slug and discovers that Namekians are weak to whistling, allowing for his defeat;Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug in the fifth, Piccolo is able to defeat most of Cooler's squadron, only to be defeated by Cooler himself;Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge in the sixth, Piccolo fights Cooler's minions on Namek and saves the others after they are captured;Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler in the seventh, Piccolo saves Gohan from being attacked by Android 13 and battles the android in both his forms;Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13 in the eighth, Piccolo travels to New Planet Vegeta and fights Broly, giving his energy to Goku which leads to the foe's defeat;Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan in the ninth, Piccolo comes to help the others fight Bojack and his crew;Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound in the fourteenth, Piccolo combats Beerus alongside Android 18 and Tenshinhan, only to be bested;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and, lastly, in the fifteenth, Piccolo narrowly escapes death once Freeza destroys the Earth.Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' After the events of the latter two films, Piccolo is resurrected after being killed by Freeza in the Dragon Ball Super retelling of Resurrection 'F' and agrees to train Gohan again.

Reception Piccolo is a popular character in the series, he placed fifth in both the 1993 and 1995 Dragon Ball character popularity polls voted on by Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump readers. In 2004, fans of the series voted him the fifth most popular character for a poll in the book Dragon Ball Forever. Piccolo has appeared in various Anime Grand Prix polls, taking high places in the category \\"best male character\\" in 1990, 1991 and 1992 polls. Piccolo's character has received praise and criticism by publications for various media. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment praised Piccolo's growth in Dragon Ball Z as one of the most important parts of the series, noting how he decides to train Gohan to fight Vegeta. Although Katherine Luther from About.com noted Piccolo to be one of the strongest warriors from his planet, she mentioned he has several weaknesses that make him weaker than other characters from the series, with his most notable one being his affection for Gohan. During a review of the Dragon Ball anime, Beveridge noted Piccolo to be able to perform a large number of abilities in contrast to other characters such as Goku, making the fight between both of them unbalanced. However, he found the said battle to be very entertaining despite it lasting several episodes. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found Piccolo's differences from Dragon Ball to Dragon Ball Z as one of the reasons the former show is recommendable to viewers over the later anime. While reviewing the fourth Dragon Ball Z film, Anime News Network writer Allen Drivers found Piccolo's initial scenes peacefully enough to entertain viewers. In a later film, John Sinnott from DVD Talk criticized Piccolo's involvement saying he appears \\"from out of no where\\" in order to fight alongside his friends giving the film little reasoning. Chris Homer from The Fandom Post believed Piccolo's sacrifice in Dragon Ball GT \\"was a genuine touching moment\\" for fans of Dragon Ball Z, but also viewed the death as relying \\"too much on previous ideas\\" in order for it to get sorted. Sam Leach from Anime News Network noted that some fans of the series tend to joke Piccolo is a better paternal figure to Gohan than his actual father, Goku, and felt that Dragon Ball Super emphasized it more when Piccolo started training him again. =Cultural Impact= The character has influenced Naruto manga author Masashi Kishimoto; in order to give Sasuke Uchiha a central role in the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Kishimoto made him the teacher of the protagonist Boruto Uzumaki as his father, Naruto Uzumaki, was busy. This was inspired by how Piccolo starts training Gohan when Goku dies in Dragon Ball. Piccolo's attack Special Beam Cannon / Makank≈çsapp≈ç became an Internet meme which started with Japanese schoolgirls photographing themselves apparently using, and being affected by, this attack in 2013. According to gaming blog Kotaku, the trend took off after photos were posted on Japan's largest bulletin board 2channel,, with photographs typically showing one person striking the ground or making a mystical gesture while others around them are photographically captured in mid-air.

His most important work is the Dictionary of the Scottish Language. Life He was born in Glasgow in March 1759 the son of Rev John Jamieson, minister of the Associate Congregation on Duke Street. He was educated at Glasgow Grammar School. He was educated at the University of Glasgow 1768 to 1771, and subsequently attended classes at the University of Edinburgh, 1775-6.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf After six years' theological study, Jamieson was licensed to preach in 1781 and became pastor of an Anti-burgher congregation in Forfar, Angus. In 1797 he was called to the Anti-burgher church in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh. The union of the Burgher and Anti-burgher sections of the Secession Church in 1820 was largely due to his exertions. He retired from the ministry in 1830, spending the rest of his life in Edinburgh. In the 1830s he is listed as living at 4 George Square on the south side of the city. Jamieson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1803. His proposers were James Bonar, Alexander Fraser Tytler, and William Moodie. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory He died at home, 4 George SquareEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1835-36 in Edinburgh on 12 July 1838 and is buried in St Cuthbert's churchyard.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 He was buried with his son Robert (who pre-deceased him) in a large and elaborate grave in the southern section. His inscription is on the rear of the monument. Works Jamieson's major work, the Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language appeared in 2 vols. in 1808. A meeting the Danish scholar Grim Thorkelin had suggested this work, and, working with Thomas Ruddiman's glossary to Gavin Douglas's version of the Aeneid, Jamieson completed the work almost alone. He prepared an abridgment in 1818 (reissued in 1846 with a memoir by John Johnstone), and aided by numerous others, he added two supplementary volumes in 1825. The work drew on folklore and provincialisms. The introductory antiquarian dissertation supported a theory on the Pictish influence on the Scots language. A revised edition by John Longmuir and David Donaldson was issued in 1879‚Äì87. These volumes remained the standard reference work for the Scots language until the publication of the Scottish National Dictionary in 1931. Jamieson's other works included: * Socinianism Unmasked, 1786. * The Sorrows of Slavery, 1789. * Sermons on the Heart, 2 vols., 1791. Around the same time he authored a pamphlet on the African slave trade entitled, The Sorrows of Slavery. * Congal and Fenella, a Metrical Tale, 1791. * Vindication of the Doctrine of Scripture, in reply to Joseph Priestley's History of Early Opinions, 2 vols., 1795. * A Poem on Eternity, 1798. * Remarks on Rowland Hill's Journal, 1799. * The Use of Sacred History, 1802. * Important Trial in the Court of Conscience, 1806. * Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language, 2 vols 1808. * A Treatise on the Ancient Culdees of Iona also retitled A History of the Culdees, 1811, published, through Walter Scott's support, by Ballantyne. * Hermes Scythicus, 1814, expounding affinities between the Gothic and the classical tongues. * Supplement to the Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language, 2 vols 1825. * Views of the Royal Palaces of Scotland (1828) published posthumously Jamieson wrote on other themes: rhetoric, cremation, and the royal palaces of Scotland, besides publishing occasional sermons. In 1820 he issued edited versions of John Barbour's Bruce and Blind Harry's Wallace. Posthumous was Dissertations on the Reality of the Spirit's Influence (1844). Family In 1781, Jamieson married Charlotte Watson (died 1837), daughter of Robert Watson, Esq., of Easter Rhind, Perthshire, and had seventeen children, of whom only two daughters and one son survived.

He is chiefly remembered for a series of autobiographical or semi-autobiographical verse collections, including Churchyardes Chippes (1575); Churchyard's Choise (1579); Churchyardes Charge (1580); The Worthines of Wales (1587); Churchyard's Challenge (1593); and Churchyards Charitie (1595). Early life Thomas Churchyard was born at Shrewsbury in c. 1523, the son of a farmer. He received a good education, and, having speedily dissipated at court the money with which his father provided him, he entered the household of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. There he remained for twenty years, learning something of the art of poetry from his patron; some of the poems he contributed later (1555) to Nicholas Grimald's and Richard Tottel's collection, Songes and Sonettes (known more often as Tottel's Miscellany), may well date from this early period. Career In 1541 Churchyard began his career as a soldier of fortune, being, he said, \\"pressed into the service\\". He fought his way through nearly every campaign in Scotland and the Low Countries for thirty years. He served under the emperor Charles V in Flanders in 1542, returning to England after the Peace of Cr√©py (1544). In the Scottish campaign of 1547 he was present at the barren victory of Pinkie, and in the next year was taken prisoner at Saint Monance, but aided by his persuasive tongue he escaped to the English garrison at Lauder, where he was once more besieged, only returning to England on the conclusion of peace in 1550. In the same year he went to Ireland to serve the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir Anthony St Leger, who had been sent to pacify the country. Here Churchyard enriched himself, at the expense of the Irish; but in 1552 he was in England again, trying vainly to secure a fortune by marriage with a rich widow. After this failure he departed once more to the wars to the Siege of Metz (1552), and \\"trailed a pike\\" in the emperor's army, until he joined the forces under William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton, with whom he says he served eight years. Grey was in charge of the fortress of Gu√Ænes, which was besieged by the duke of Guise in 1558. Churchyard arranged the terms of surrender, and was sent with his chief to Paris as a prisoner. He was not released at the Peace of Cateau Cambr√©sis for lack of money to pay his ransom, but he was finally set free on giving his bond for the amount, an engagement which he repudiated as soon as he was safely in England. He is not to be identified with the \\"T.C.\\" who wrote for the Mirror for Magistrates (ed. 1559), \\"How the Lord Mowbray ... was banished ... and after died miserablie in exile\\", which is the work of Thomas Chaloner; but \\"Shore's Wife\\", his most popular poem, appeared in the 1563 edition of the same work, and to that of 1587 he contributed the \\"Tragedie of Thomas Wolsey\\". These are plain compositions in the seven-lined Chaucerian stanza. Repeated petitions to the Queen for assistance produced at first fair words, and then no answer at all. He therefore returned to active service under Lord Grey, who was in command of an English army sent in 1560 to help the Scottish rebels at the Siege of Leith, and in 1564 he served in Ireland under Sir Henry Sidney. The religious disturbances in the Netherlands attracted him to Antwerp, where, as the agent of William of Orange, he allowed the insurgents to place him at their head, and was able to save much property from destruction. This action made him so hated by the mob that he had to fly for his life in the disguise of a priest. In the next year he was sent by the earl of Oxford to serve definitely under the prince of Orange. After a year's service he obtained leave to return to England, and after many adventures and narrow escapes in a journey through hostile territory he embarked for Guernsey, and thence for England. His patron, Lord Oxford, disowned him, and the poet, whose health was failing, retired to Bath. He appears to have made a very unhappy marriage at this time, and returned to the Low Countries. Falling into the hands of the Spaniards he was recognized as having had a hand in the Antwerp disturbance, and was under sentence to be executed as a spy when he was saved by the intervention of a noble lady. This experience did not deter him from joining in the defence of Zutphen in 1572, but this was his last campaign, and the troubles of the remaining years of his life were chiefly domestic. Later life Churchyard was employed to devise a pageant for the Queen's reception at Bristol in 1574, and again at Norwich in 1578. He had published in 1575 The Firste parte of Churchyarde's Chippes, the modest title which he gives to his works. No second part appeared, but there was a much enlarged edition in 1578. A passage in Churchyarde's Choise (1579) gave offence to Elizabeth, and the author fled to Scotland, where he remained for three years. He was only restored to favour about 1584, and in 1593 he received a small pension from the Queen. On Good Friday, 8 April 1580, Churchyard (then aged nearly 60) published a short account of the earthquake which had struck London and much of England only two days earlier. The pamphlet, A Warning to the Wyse, a Feare to the Fond, a Bridle to the Lewde, and a Glasse to the Good; written of the late Earthquake chanced in London and other places, 6 April 1580, for the Glory of God and benefit of men, that warely can walk, and wisely judge. Set forth in verse and prose, by Thomas Churchyard, gentleman provides the earliest accounts of the 1580 Dover Straits earthquake.Churchyard's A Warning to the Wyse is dealt with in Peter C. Mancall, Hakluyt's Promise: An Elizabethan's Obsession for an English America (Yale University Press: 2007) pp. 64‚Äì67. Dispute with Thomas Camel In Churchyards Challenge (1593) the author refers to his broadside ballad, Davie Dicars dreame (c. 1551‚Äì1552), which he says was written against by one Thomas Camel whom Churchyard then \\"openly confuted\\". Their argument came to involve not only Churchyard and Camel but also William Waterman, Geoffrey Chappell, and Richard Beard. All their various contributions were collected and reprinted in in 1560. A short and seemingly alliterative poem in the manner of Piers Plowman, Davie Dicar brought Churchyard into trouble with the privy council, but he was supported by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and dismissed with a reprimand. Carried out in broadside ballads, the Churchyard-Camel debate was concerned with the relative merit of the plain style in native English literary tradition and the proper literary use of the English language itself. In a verse dedication to John Stow's Pithy Pleasaunt and Profitable Workes (1568), Churchyard defended the native tradition, grounding it in \\"Peers plowman . . . full plaine\\" and Chaucer. Churchyard mocked Camel's classical, Latinate sophistication, and Camel attacked Churchyard's churlish words and \\"uncouth speeche\\". This public controversy resembled the old medieval practice of flyting‚Äîa staged, collaborative battle of the wits that was also, in this case, an occasion for the public discussion of moral issues, education, religion, and politics. It was also a means of commercial self-promotion on the part of writers and printers. Perhaps inspired by Robert Crowley's 1550 publication of Piers Plowman, Davy Dycar (i.e., Davy the ditcher or digger) is a character drawn from a line at the end of Passus 6 in the B-text and the end of Passus 9 in the C-text where it is prophesied that \\"Dawe the dyker\\" will die of starvation because of the corruption of landlords and clergy. (\\"Dawe\\", written or printed as \\"Davve\\", could be read as \\"Davy\\" or \\"Davie\\".) This is the concluding event in a list of disasters caused by corrupt elites, a part of Piers Plowman that was appreciated by some English Protestants in the mid- sixteenth century. (Notably, the Davy Digger lines were copied into a manuscript of political prophecies compiled around 1553‚Äì1554.) Churchyard turns Davy into a Piers-like truth-teller and prophet of a millennial kingdom of justice: William Waterman added to the debate with his Westerne Wyll, calling explicit attention to Davy's roots: Reputation The affectionate esteem with which Churchyard was regarded by the younger Elizabethan writers is expressed by Thomas Nashe, who says (Foure Letters Confuted) that Churchyard's aged muse might well be \\"grandmother to our grandiloquentest poets at this present\\". Francis Meres (Palladis Tamia, 1598) mentions him in conjunction with many great names among \\"the most passionate, among us, to bewail and bemoan the perplexities of love\\". Spenser, in \\"Colin Clout's Come Home Again\\", calls him with a spice of raillery \\"old Palaemon\\" who \\"sung so long until quite hoarse he grew\\". His writings, with the exception of his contributions to the Mirror for Magistrates, are chiefly autobiographical in character or deal with the wars in which he had a share. They are very rare and have never been completely reprinted. Churchyard lived right through Elizabeth's reign, and was buried in St. Margaret's, Westminster, on 4 April 1604. It was said he was taken ill in the presence of Anne of Denmark's ladies in waiting and carried away in a faint a fortnight before his death.I. H.

His 1598 commonplace book includes the first critical account of poems and plays by Shakespeare. Career Francis Meres was born at Kirton Meres in the parish of Kirton, in the Holland division of Lincolnshire in 1565. He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he received a B.A. in 1587 and an M.A. in 1591. Two years later he was incorporated an M.A. of Oxford. His relative, John Meres, was high sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1596, and apparently helped him in the early part of his career. In 1602 he became rector of Wing, Rutland, where he also ran a school. Both his son, Francis, and his grandson, Edward, received their B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge and became rectors. Meres is especially well known for his Palladis Tamia, Wits Treasury (1598), a commonplace book that is important as a source on the Elizabethan poets, and more particularly as the first critical account of the poems and early plays of William Shakespeare. Its list of Shakespeare's plays is an important source for establishing their chronology. A sermon entitled Gods Arithmeticke (1597), and two translations from the Spanish of Lu√≠s de Granada entitled Granada's Devotion and the Sinners' Guide (1598) complete Meres's list of works. Marriage and issue Meres had a wife, Mary (1576/1577‚Äì1631), whose maiden name is unknown. They had a son, Francis, born in 1607. In Shakespeare's Sonnets (1904), Charlotte Stopes stated that Meres was the brother-in-law of John Florio; but investigation by George Greenwood suggests Stopes was in error. Meres died in 1647 and was buried in the parish church of St Peter and St Paul in Wing, Rutland. Notes References *Don C.

Like a lute, a theorbo has a curved-back sound box (a hollow box) with a wooden top, typically with a sound hole, and a neck extending out from the soundbox. As with the lute, the player plucks or strums the strings with one hand while \\"fretting\\" (pressing down) the strings with the other hand; pressing the strings in different places on the neck produces different pitches (notes), thus enabling the performer to play chords, basslines and melodies. It is related to the liuto attiorbato, the French ', the archlute, the German baroque lute, and the ang√©lique or angelica. A theorbo differs from a regular lute in that the theorbo has a much longer neck which extends beyond the regular fingerboard/neck and a second pegbox at the end of the extended neck. Low-register bass strings are added on the extended neck. This gives a theorbo a much wider range of pitches (notes) than a regular lute. The theorbo was used during the Baroque music era (1600‚Äì1750) to play basso continuo accompaniment parts (as part of the basso continuo group, which often included harpsichord, pipe organ and bass instruments), and also as a solo instrument. Origin and development The girl is playing a type of theorbo that combined two ranges of strings with separate peg boxes; the bass strings (longer) went to the straight pegbox that peeks from behind the girl's head. The other lute strings went to the bent pegbox. A similar theorbo is in the Wagner Museum, Lucerne, Switzerland. Theorbos were developed during the late sixteenth century in Italy, inspired by the demand for extended bass range instruments for use in the then-newly developed musical style of opera developed by the Florentine Camerata and new musical works utilising basso continuo, such as Giulio Caccini's two collections, Le nuove musiche (1602 and 1614). For his 1607 opera L'Orfeo, Claudio Monteverdi lists duoi (two) chitaroni among the instruments required for performing the work. Musicians originally used large bass lutes (c. 80+ cm string length) and a higher re-entrant tuning; but soon created neck extensions with secondary pegboxes to accommodate extra open (i.e. unfretted) longer bass strings, called diapasons or bourdons, for improvements in tonal clarity and an increased range of available notes. Although the words chitarrone and tiorba were both used to describe the instrument, they have different organological and etymological origins; chitarrone being in Italian an augmentation of (and literally meaning large) chitarra ‚Äì Italian for guitar. The round-backed chitarra was still in use, often referred to as chitarra Italiana to distinguish it from chitarra alla spagnola in its new flat-backed Spanish incarnation. The etymology of tiorba is still obscure; it is hypothesized the origin may be in Slavic or Turkish torba, meaning 'bag' or 'turban'. According to Athanasius Kircher, tiorba was a nickname in Neapolitan language for a grinding board used by perfumers for grinding essences and herbs.Athanasius Kircher, Musurgia Universalis, Rome 1650, p. 476 It is possible the appearance of this new large instrument (particularly in a crowded ensemble) resulted in jokes and a humour induced reference with popular local knowledge becoming lost over time and place. Robert Spencer has noted the confusion the two names were already leading to in 1600: Chitarone, √≤ Tiorba che si dica (chitarrone, or theorbo as it is called). By the mid-17th century it would appear that tiorba had taken preference ‚Äì reflected in modern practice, helping to distinguish the theorbo now from very different instruments like the chitarrone moderno or guitarr√≥n. Similar adaptations to smaller lutes (c. 55+ cm string length) also produced the arciliuto (archlute), liuto attiorbato, and tiorbino, which were differently tuned instruments to accommodate a new repertoire of small ensemble or solo works. In the performance of basso continuo, theorboes were often paired with a small pipe organ. The most prominent early composers and players in Italy were Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger and Alessandro Piccinini. Giuliano Paratico was another early Italian chitarrone player. Little solo music survives from England, but William Lawes and others used theorbos in chamber ensembles and opera orchestras. In France, theorbos were appreciated and used in orchestral or chamber music until the second half of the 18th century (Nicolas Hotman, Robert de Vis√©e). Court orchestras at Vienna, Bayreuth and Berlin still employed theorbo players after 1750 (Ernst Gottlieb Baron, Francesco Conti). Solo music for the theorbo is notated in tablature, a form of music notation in which the frets and strings which a player must press down are printed on a series of parallel lines which represent the strings on the fretboard. Tuning and strings The tuning of large theorboes is characterized by the octave displacement, or \\"re-entrant tuning\\", of the two uppermost strings. Piccinini and Michael Praetorius mention the occasional use of metal strings (brass and steel, as opposed to gut strings). The Testudo Theorbata that appears in Syntagma Musicum by Praetorius, has doubled strings (courses) passing over the bridge and attached to the base of the instrument ‚Äì different to his ' (opposite in the same illustration which seems to have single strings). The ' also appears to have single strings attached to the bridge. The string \\"courses\\", unlike those of a Renaissance lute or archlute, were often single, although double stringing was also used. Typically, theorboes have 14 courses, though some used 15 or even 19 courses (Kapsberger). 15-course Theorbo tuning chart This is theorbo tuning in A. Modern theorbo players usually play 14-course (string) instruments (lowest course is G). Some players have used a theorbo tuned a whole step lower in G. Most of the solo repertoire is in the A tuning. The \\"re-entrant tuning\\" created new possibilities for voice leading and inspired a new right hand technique with just thumb, index and middle fingers to arpeggiate chords, which Piccinini likened to the sound of a harp. The bass tessitura (range) and re-entrant stringing mean that in order to keep the figured bass \\"realisation\\" (the improvised playing of chords) above the bass instruments when accompanying basso continuo, the bassline must sometimes be played an octave lower (Kapsberger). In the French treatises, chords in which a lower note sounds after the bass were also used when the bass goes high. The English theorbo had just the first string at the lower octave (Thomas Mace).  Regional differences  = Italy = The theorbo was developed in Italy, and so has a rich legacy in Italian music as both a solo and continuo instrument. Caccini comments in Le nouve musiche (1602) that the theorbo is perfectly suited for accompanying the voice as it can give a very full support without being obscured by the vocalist, indicating the beginning of an Italian tradition of monodic songs accompanied by theorbo. Italians called the theorbo's diapasons its ‚Äúspecial excellence‚Äù. Italians viewed the theorbo as an easier alternative to the lute since the general attractiveness of its sound quality can cover over indifferent playing and lazy voice leading. = England = A 1670 painting of an English theorbo player. The Italian theorbo first came to England at the beginning of the seventeenth century, but an alternate design based on the English two-headed lute, designed by Jaques Gaultier, soon became more popular. English theorbos were generally tuned in G and double strung throughout, with only the first course in reentrant tuning. Theorbos tuned in G were much better suited to flat keys, and so many English songs or consort pieces that involved theorbo were written in flat keys that would be very difficult to play on a theorbo in A. By the eighteenth century, the theorbo had fallen out of fashion in England due to its large size and low pitch. It was replaced by the archlute. = France = The first mention of a theorbo in France was in 1637, and by the 1660s it had replaced the 10-course lute as the most popular accompanying instrument. The theorbo was a very important continuo instrument in the French court and multiple French theorbo continuo tutors (method books) were published by Delair (1690), Campion (1716 and 1730), Bartolotti (1669), Fleury (1660), and Grenerin (1670). French theorbos had up to eight stopped strings and were often somewhat smaller and quieter than Italian theorbos. They were a standard scale length of 76 cm, which made them smaller than Italian instruments, that ranged from 85‚Äì95 cm. = Germany = German theorbos would also today be called swan-necked Baroque lutes; seventeenth-century German theorbists played single-strung instruments in the Italian tuning transposed down a whole step, but eighteenth-century players switched to double-strung instruments in the ‚Äúd-minor‚Äù tuning used in French and German Baroque lute music so as to not have to rethink their chord shapes when playing theorbo. These instruments came to be referred to as theorbo- lutes. Baron remarks that ‚Äúthe lute, because of its delicacy, serves well in trios or other chamber music with few participants. The theorbo, because of its power, serves best in groups of thirty to forty musicians, as in churches and operas.‚Äù Theorbo-lutes would likely have been used alongside Italian theorbos and archlutes in continuo settings due to the presence of Italian musicians in German courts and also for the purpose of using instruments that were appropriate for whatever key the music was in. = Ukraine, Poland and Russia = The theorbo came to Ukraine ca. 1700 and it was upgraded with treble strings (known as prystrunky). This instrument was called a torban.N.Prokopenko \\"Kobza & Bandura\\" Kiev, 1977 The Torban was manufactured and used mainly in Ukraine, but also occasionally encountered in neighbouring Poland and Russia.Piotr Kowalcze, \\"Sympozjum: Teorban w polskich zbiorah muzealnych\\" Warsaw 2008  Technique  The theorbo is played much like the lute, with the left hand pressing down on the fingerboard to vary the resonating length of the strings (thus playing different notes and making chords, basslines and melodies playable) while the right fingertips pluck the strings. The most significant differences between theorbo and lute technique are that theorbo is played with the right thumb outside the hand, as opposed to Renaissance lute which is played with the thumb under the hand. Additionally, the right hand thumb is entirely responsible for playing the bass diapasons and rarely comes up onto the top courses. Most theorbists play with the flesh of their fingers on the right hand, although there is some historical precedent from Piccinini, Mace, and Weiss to use nails. Fingernails can be more effective on a theorbo than on a lute due to its single-strung courses, and the use of nails is most often suggested in the context of ensemble playing where tone quality becomes subservient to volume.  Solo repertoire  The theorbo's solo Baroque repertoire comes almost exclusively from Italy and France, with the exception of some English music written for the English theorbo. The most effective and idiomatic music for the theorbo takes advantage of its two most unique qualities: the diapasons and the reentrant tuning. Campanella passages that allow scale passages to ring across multiple strings in a harp-like fashion are particularly common and are a highly effective tool for the skilled theorbist/composer. Italy: Kapsberger, Piccinini, Castaldi * Toccatas - free, rhapsodic, harmonically adventurous. Piccinini's are more harmonically tight while Kapsberger often breaks voice- leading rules in order to achieve a desired effect * Dances - Correntes, Gagliardas, continuing in the tradition of Italian lute dances dating back to Dalza * Variations - highly sophisticated and challenging variations on often very simple themes France: de Visee, Bartolotti, Hurel, le Moyne * Dance suites - the vast majority of French theorbo music consists of dance suites in the order of unmeasured prelude, allemande, courante, saraband, gigue (with variations) * Transcriptions - French theorbists often transcribed pieces from opera composers such as Lully or keyboard composers such as Couperin to perform as solo pieces A few modern composers have begun to write new music for the theorbo; significant works have been composed by Roman Turovsky, David Loeb, Bruno Helstroffer, Thomas Bocklenberg, and Stephen Goss, who has written the only concerto for theorbo.  Continuo  The theorbo's primary use was as a continuo instrument. However, due to its layout as a plucked instrument and its reentrant tuning, following strict voice leading parameters could sometimes be difficult or even impossible. Thus, a style of continuo unique to the theorbo was developed that incorporated these factors: * Breaking voice leading rules to capitalize on voicings that better express the instrument's natural sonority. The integrity of the true bass line is maintained through the use of creative arpeggiation that masks improper inversions. * Frequent transposition of the bass line down an octave in order to play on the diapasons. * Use of thinner textures; due to the theorbo's strong projection and rich resonance, a three or even two voice accompaniment will often be just as effective as a standard four-voice accompaniment on a harpsichord. Additionally, playing more than a two-voice realization can become impossible with quick-moving bass lines. * Frequent restriking of chords to make up for the instrument's quick decay. Thus, the preservation of the bass line and the sound of the instrument are of the highest priority when used as a continuo instrument. Breaking voice leading rules becomes necessary in order to preserve the bass line and bring out the unique tones of the theorbo. The theorbo is labelled by Praetorius as both a fundamental and an ornamental continuo instrument, meaning it is capable of supporting an ensemble as a primary bass instrument while also fleshing out the harmony and adding color to the ensemble by means of chord realizations.

Mason College, now Birmingham University Background and professional work Arber was born in London. From 1854 he 1878 he worked as a clerk in the Admiralty, and began evening classes at King's College London in 1858. From 1878 to 1881 he studied English literature, under Henry Morley, at University College London; and from 1881 to 1894 he was professor of English at Mason College (which later became Birmingham University). From 1894 he lived in London as emeritus professor, being also a fellow of King's College London. In 1905 he received the honorary degree of D. Litt. from the University of Oxford. He married in 1869, and had two sons, one of whom, E. A. N. Arber, became demonstrator in palaeobotany at the University of Cambridge. Scholarly edits As a scholarly editor, Arber made notable contributions to English literature. His name is associated particularly with the series of \\"English Reprints\\" (1868‚Äì1871), by which an accurate text of the works of many English authors, formerly only accessible in more expensive editions, was placed within reach of the general public. Among the thirty volumes of the series were Stephen Gosson's School of Abuse, Roger Ascham's Toxophilus, Tottel's Miscellany, and Robert Naunton's Fragmenta Regalia. It was followed by the \\"English Scholar's Library\\" (16 volumes) which included the Works (1884) of Captain John Smith, governor of Virginia, and the Poems (1882) of Richard Barnfield. Other publications In his English Garner (8 vols, 1877‚Äì1890) he collected rare old tracts and poems; in 1899‚Äì1901 he issued British Anthologies; and in 1907 he began a series called A Christian Library. He was the sole editor of two vast English bibliographies: A Transcript of the Registers of the Stationers' Company, 1553‚Äì1640 (1875‚Äì1894), and The Term Catalogues, 1668‚Äì1709/11.The Term Catalogues, 1668‚Äì1709, With a Number for Easter Term, 1711 A.D.

It tends to be dialect-heavy and invokes local and regional lifestyles and traditions, particularly those of the Alpine farmers and peasants. Originally transmitted by oral tradition, the oldest historical records like the Appenzell Kuhreihen by Georg Rhau (1488‚Äì1548) date back to the 16th century. Volksmusik is characterized by improvisation and variation, uncomplicated major key melodies and simple harmonies. Typical instruments range from alpenhorns to hackbretts, zithers and acoustic guitars, and even violas and harmonicas. Harmonized singing is frequent, but other pieces may require yodeling, while instrumental arrangements are particularly frequent for fast dances or brass pieces. Volksmusik continues to be performed by many local ensembles and bands throughout the European Alps and should not be confused with Volkst√ºmliche Musik, which is largely to be found in broadcasting media and on ancillary merchandise. Since the 1970s, artists of a Neue Volksmusik genre, such as Werner Pirchner or Bierm√∂sl Blosn, attempt to combine traditional styles with jazz, folk, hip hop, rock et al. as a kind of world music. Popular proponents include Hubert von Goisern, Attwenger and Christine Lauterburg.

Measuring 70‚Äì80 cm long and weighing 0.8-1.5 kg, it was the signature blade of the Landsknecht. Overview The is a side-arm, often used by pikemen, archers, and crossbowmen as a last resort if the enemy were to draw too close for bows or pikes to be effective. Mostly a cutting sword, the rounded tips on many examples are ill-suited to thrusting, while the flat, broad blades are specialized for cutting. As with other similar cutting-centric arming swords, it can still be used for thrusting, though it is only likely to do damage to unarmored targets. As with many sword varieties, variations exist within the type and katzbalger-style hilts can be found paired with slimmer and more thrust-oriented blades. The large, characteristic guard helps to block and parry other cutting attacks. However, its openings leave the hands vulnerable to thrusting attacks. Terminology There are several different explanations about the origin of the name : one is that it comes from the custom of carrying a sword without a scabbard, held only by a cat's skin (German word ' means \\"cat\\", while ' means the skin (fur) of an animal. ' means a piece made of a cat‚Äôs skin). Another theory is that the word derives from ' (brawling), and refers to intense, close-quarter combat like fights between feral cats.

Minors obtained by removing just one row and one column from square matrices (first minors) are required for calculating matrix cofactors, which in turn are useful for computing both the determinant and inverse of square matrices. Definition and illustration =First minors= If A is a square matrix, then the minor of the entry in the ith row and jth column (also called the (i, j) minor, or a first minorBurnside, William Snow & Panton, Arthur William (1886) Theory of Equations: with an Introduction to the Theory of Binary Algebraic Form.) is the determinant of the submatrix formed by deleting the ith row and jth column. This number is often denoted Mi,j. The (i, j) cofactor is obtained by multiplying the minor by (-1)^{i+j}. To illustrate these definitions, consider the following 3 by 3 matrix, :\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,1 & 4 & 7 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,3 & 0 & 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 9 & \\\\\\\\!11 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} To compute the minor M2,3 and the cofactor C2,3, we find the determinant of the above matrix with row 2 and column 3 removed. : M_{2,3} = \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\,\\\\,1 & 4 & \\\\Box\\\\, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\,\\\\Box & \\\\Box & \\\\Box\\\\, \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 9 & \\\\Box\\\\, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}= \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,1 & 4\\\\, \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 9\\\\, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = (9-(-4)) = 13 So the cofactor of the (2,3) entry is :\\\\ C_{2,3} = (-1)^{2+3}(M_{2,3}) = -13. =General definition= Let A be an m √ó n matrix and k an integer with 0 < k ‚â§ m, and k ‚â§ n. A k √ó k minor of A, also called minor determinant of order k of A or, if m = n, (n‚àík)th minor determinant of A (the word \\"determinant\\" is often omitted, and the word \\"degree\\" is sometimes used instead of \\"order\\") is the determinant of a k √ó k matrix obtained from A by deleting m‚àík rows and n‚àík columns. Sometimes the term is used to refer to the k √ó k matrix obtained from A as above (by deleting m‚àík rows and n‚àík columns), but this matrix should be referred to as a (square) submatrix of A, leaving the term \\"minor\\" to refer to the determinant of this matrix. For a matrix A as above, there are a total of {m \\\\choose k} \\\\cdot {n \\\\choose k} minors of size k √ó k. The minor of order zero is often defined to be 1. For a square matrix, the zeroth minor is just the determinant of the matrix.Elementary Matrix Algebra (Third edition), Franz E.

Also, there are two types of denotations in use in literature: by the minor associated to ordered sequences of indexes I and J, some authorsLinear Algebra and Geometry, Igor R. Shafarevich, Alexey O. Remizov, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2013, mean the determinant of the matrix that is formed as above, by taking the elements of the original matrix from the rows whose indexes are in I and columns whose indexes are in J, whereas some other authors mean by a minor associated to I and J the determinant of the matrix formed from the original matrix by deleting the rows in I and columns in J. Which notation is used should always be checked from the source in question. In this article, we use the inclusive definition of choosing the elements from rows of I and columns of J. The exceptional case is the case of the first minor or the (i, j)-minor described above; in that case, the exclusive notation M_{i,j} = \\\\det \\\\left( \\\\left( A_{p,q} \\\\right)_{p eq i, q eq j} \\\\right) is standard everywhere in the literature and is used in this article also. =Complement= The complement, Bijk...,pqr..., of a minor, Mijk...,pqr..., of a square matrix, A, is formed by the determinant of the matrix A from which all the rows (ijk...) and columns (pqr...) associated with Mijk...,pqr... have been removed.

Applications of minors and cofactors =Cofactor expansion of the determinant= The cofactors feature prominently in Laplace's formula for the expansion of determinants, which is a method of computing larger determinants in terms of smaller ones. Given an matrix A = (a_{ij}), the determinant of A, denoted det(A), can be written as the sum of the cofactors of any row or column of the matrix multiplied by the entries that generated them. In other words, defining C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij} then the cofactor expansion along the jth column gives: :\\\\ \\\\det(\\\\mathbf A) = a_{1j}C_{1j} + a_{2j}C_{2j} + a_{3j}C_{3j} + \\\\cdots + a_{nj}C_{nj} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij} C_{ij} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij}(-1)^{i+j} M_{ij} The cofactor expansion along the ith row gives: :\\\\ \\\\det(\\\\mathbf A) = a_{i1}C_{i1} + a_{i2}C_{i2} + a_{i3}C_{i3} + \\\\cdots + a_{in}C_{in} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} C_{ij} =\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij} =Inverse of a matrix= One can write down the inverse of an invertible matrix by computing its cofactors by using Cramer's rule, as follows. The matrix formed by all of the cofactors of a square matrix A is called the cofactor matrix (also called the matrix of cofactors or comatrix): :\\\\mathbf C=\\\\begin{bmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & \\\\cdots & C_{1n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{21} & C_{22} & \\\\cdots & C_{2n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{n1} & C_{n2} & \\\\cdots & C_{nn} \\\\end{bmatrix} Then the inverse of A is the transpose of the cofactor matrix times the reciprocal of the determinant of A: :\\\\mathbf A^{-1} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\operatorname{det}(\\\\mathbf A)} \\\\mathbf C^\\\\mathsf{T}. The transpose of the cofactor matrix is called the adjugate matrix (also called the classical adjoint) of A. The above formula can be generalized as follows: Let 1 \\\\le i_1 < i_2 < \\\\ldots < i_k \\\\le n and 1 \\\\le j_1 < j_2 < \\\\ldots < j_k \\\\le n be ordered sequences (in natural order) of indexes (here A is an n √ó n matrix). Then :[\\\\mathbf A^{-1}]_{I,J} = \\\\pm\\\\frac{[\\\\mathbf A]_{J',I'}}{\\\\det \\\\mathbf A}, where I‚Ä≤, J‚Ä≤ denote the ordered sequences of indices (the indices are in natural order of magnitude, as above) complementary to I, J, so that every index 1, ..., n appears exactly once in either I or I‚Ä≤, but not in both (similarly for the J and J‚Ä≤) and [\\\\mathbf A]_{I,J} denotes the determinant of the submatrix of A formed by choosing the rows of the index set I and columns of index set J. Also, [\\\\mathbf A]_{I,J} = \\\\det \\\\left( (A_{i_p, j_q})_{p,q = 1, \\\\ldots, k} \\\\right). A simple proof can be given using wedge product. Indeed, :[\\\\mathbf A^{-1}]_{I,J}(e_1\\\\wedge\\\\ldots \\\\wedge e_n) = \\\\pm(\\\\mathbf A^{-1}e_{j_1})\\\\wedge \\\\ldots \\\\wedge(\\\\mathbf A^{-1}e_{j_k})\\\\wedge e_{i'_1}\\\\wedge\\\\ldots \\\\wedge e_{i'_{n-k}}, where e_1, \\\\ldots, e_n are the basis vectors. Acting by A on both sides, one gets :[\\\\mathbf A^{-1}]_{I,J}\\\\det \\\\mathbf A (e_1\\\\wedge\\\\ldots \\\\wedge e_n) = \\\\pm (e_{j_1})\\\\wedge \\\\ldots \\\\wedge(e_{j_k})\\\\wedge (\\\\mathbf A e_{i'_1})\\\\wedge\\\\ldots \\\\wedge (\\\\mathbf A e_{i'_{n-k}})=\\\\pm [\\\\mathbf A]_{J',I'}(e_1\\\\wedge\\\\ldots \\\\wedge e_n). The sign can be worked out to be (-1)^{ \\\\sum_{s=1}^{k} i_s - \\\\sum_{s=1}^{k} j_s}, so the sign is determined by the sums of elements in I and J. =Other applications= Given an m √ó n matrix with real entries (or entries from any other field) and rank r, then there exists at least one non-zero r √ó r minor, while all larger minors are zero. We will use the following notation for minors: if A is an m √ó n matrix, I is a subset of {1,...,m} with k elements, and J is a subset of {1,...,n} with k elements, then we write [A]I,J for the minor of A that corresponds to the rows with index in I and the columns with index in J. * If I = J, then [A]I,J is called a principal minor. * If the matrix that corresponds to a principal minor is a quadratic upper-left part of the larger matrix (i.e., it consists of matrix elements in rows and columns from 1 to k), then the principal minor is called a leading principal minor (of order k) or corner (principal) minor (of order k). For an n √ó n square matrix, there are n leading principal minors. * A basic minor of a matrix is the determinant of a square submatrix that is of maximal size with nonzero determinant. * For Hermitian matrices, the leading principal minors can be used to test for positive definiteness and the principal minors can be used to test for positive semidefiniteness. See Sylvester's criterion for more details. Both the formula for ordinary matrix multiplication and the Cauchy‚ÄìBinet formula for the determinant of the product of two matrices are special cases of the following general statement about the minors of a product of two matrices. Suppose that A is an m √ó n matrix, B is an n √ó p matrix, I is a subset of {1,...,m} with k elements and J is a subset of {1,...,p} with k elements. Then :[\\\\mathbf{AB}]_{I,J} = \\\\sum_{K} [\\\\mathbf{A}]_{I,K} [\\\\mathbf{B}]_{K,J}\\\\, where the sum extends over all subsets K of {1,...,n} with k elements. This formula is a straightforward extension of the Cauchy‚ÄìBinet formula. Multilinear algebra approach A more systematic, algebraic treatment of minors is given in multilinear algebra, using the wedge product: the k-minors of a matrix are the entries in the kth exterior power map. If the columns of a matrix are wedged together k at a time, the k √ó k minors appear as the components of the resulting k-vectors. For example, the 2 √ó 2 minors of the matrix :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} are ‚àí13 (from the first two rows), ‚àí7 (from the first and last row), and 5 (from the last two rows). Now consider the wedge product :(\\\\mathbf{e}_1 + 3\\\\mathbf{e}_2 +2\\\\mathbf{e}_3)\\\\wedge(4\\\\mathbf{e}_1-\\\\mathbf{e}_2+\\\\mathbf{e}_3) where the two expressions correspond to the two columns of our matrix. Using the properties of the wedge product, namely that it is bilinear and alternating, :\\\\mathbf{e}_i\\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{e}_i = 0, and antisymmetric, :\\\\mathbf{e}_i\\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{e}_j = - \\\\mathbf{e}_j\\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{e}_i, we can simplify this expression to : -13 \\\\mathbf{e}_1\\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{e}_2 -7 \\\\mathbf{e}_1\\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{e}_3 +5 \\\\mathbf{e}_2\\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{e}_3 where the coefficients agree with the minors computed earlier. A remark about different notation In some books, instead of cofactor the term adjunct is used.Felix Gantmacher, Theory of matrices (1st ed., original language is Russian), Moscow: State Publishing House of technical and theoretical literature, 1953, p.491, Moreover, it is denoted as Aij and defined in the same way as cofactor: ::\\\\mathbf{A}_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} \\\\mathbf{M}_{ij} Using this notation the inverse matrix is written this way: :\\\\mathbf{M}^{-1} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\det(M)}\\\\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} & A_{21} & \\\\cdots & A_{n1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{12} & A_{22} & \\\\cdots & A_{n2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{1n} & A_{2n} & \\\\cdots & A_{nn} \\\\end{bmatrix} Keep in mind that adjunct is not adjugate or adjoint. In modern terminology, the \\"adjoint\\" of a matrix most often refers to the corresponding adjoint operator.

The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and, unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods for use. Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world. Both the wood and the oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has been highly valued for centuries. Consequently, some species of these slow-growing trees have suffered over-harvesting in the past. Nomenclature The nomenclature and the taxonomy of the genus are derived from this species' historical and widespread use. Etymologically it is ultimately derived from Sanskrit ‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§®‡§Ç Chanda am (ƒçandana-m), the sandalwood tree, meaning \\"wood for burning incense\\" and related to candrah, \\"shining, glowing\\" and the Latin candere, to shine or glow. It arrived in English via Late Greek, Medieval Latin and Old French in the 14th or 15th century. True sandalwoods A closeup of sandal saplings Santalum album Sandalwoods are medium-sized hemiparasitic trees, and part of the same botanical family as European mistletoe. Notable members of this group are Indian sandalwood (Santalum album) and Australian sandalwood (Santalum spicatum); others in the genus also have fragrant wood. These are found in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, Indonesia, Hawaii, and other Pacific Islands. * S. album is a threatened species indigenous to South India, and grows in the Western Ghats and a few other mountain ranges such as the Kalrayan and Shevaroy Hills. Although sandalwood trees in India, Pakistan, and Nepal are government-owned and their harvest is controlled, many trees are illegally cut down. Sandalwood oil prices have risen to $2,000 per kg recently. Red sanders is endemic to Seshachalam, Veliganda, Lankamala, and Palakonda hill ranges, distributed in districts of Kadapa, Chittoor, and Kurnool in Rayalaseema region and parts of Nellore and Prakasam in Andhra Pradesh, Mysore region of Karnataka (formerly Mysore State), and marayoor forest in Kerala, southern India, is high in quality. New plantations were created with international aid in Tamil Nadu for economic exploitation. In Kununurra in Western Australia, Indian sandalwood is grown on a large scale. This species is the primary source of sandalwood used in commercial oil production and should not be confused with West Indian Sandalwood, Amyris balsamifera. * S. ellipticum, S. freycinetianum, and S. paniculatum, the Hawaiian sandalwood (iliahi), were also used and considered high quality. These three species were exploited between 1790 and 1825 before the supply of trees ran out (a fourth species, S. haleakalae, occurs only in subalpine areas and was never exported). Although S. freycinetianum and S. paniculatum are relatively common today, they have not regained their former abundance or size, and S. ellipticum remains rare.Wagner, W. L., D. R. Herbst, and S. H. Sohmer (1990). Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press.Rock, J. F. (1913). The Indigenous Trees of the Hawaiian Islands. Honolulu. * S. spicatum is used by aromatherapists and perfumers. The oil concentration differs considerably from other Santalum species. In the 1840s, sandalwood was Western Australia‚Äôs biggest export earner. Oil was distilled for the first time in 1875, and by the turn of the 20th century, production of Australian sandalwood oil was intermittent. However, in the late 1990s, Western Australian sandalwood oil enjoyed a revival and by 2009 had peaked at more than per year ‚Äì much of which went to the fragrance industries in Europe. Although overall production has decreased, by 2011, a significant percentage of its production was heading to the chewing tobacco industry in India alongside Indian sandalwood ‚Äì the chewing tobacco market being the largest market for both oils in 2012. * Other species: Commercially, various other species, not belonging to Santalum species, are also used as sandalwood. =Unrelated plants= Various unrelated plants with scented wood and also referred to as sandalwood, but not in the true sandalwood genus: *Adenanthera pavonina - sandalwood tree, red or false red sandalwood *Baphia nitida - camwood, also known as African sandalwood *Eremophila mitchellii - sandalwood; false sandalwood (also sandalbox) *Myoporum platycarpum - sandalwood; false sandalwood *Myoporum sandwicense - bastard sandalwood, false sandalwood *Osyris lanceolata - African sandalwood *Osyris tenuifolia - east African sandalwood Production Sandalwood leaf Producing commercially valuable sandalwood with high levels of fragrance oils requires Indian sandalwood (S. album) trees to be a minimum of 15 years old ‚Äì the yield, quality and volume are still to be clearly understood. Yield of oil tends to vary depending on the age and location of the tree; usually, the older trees yield the highest oil content and quality. Australia is the largest producer of S. album, with the majority grown around Kununurra, in the far north of the state by Quintis (formerly Tropical Forestry Services), which in 2017 controlled around 80 per cent of the world's supply of Indian sandalwood, and Santanol. India used to be the world's biggest producer, but it has been overtaken by Australia in the 21st century. Over-exploitation is partly to blame for the decline.Asian Regional Workshop (1998). Santalum album. 2006. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. IUCN 2006. www.iucnredlist.org. Retrieved on 2007-02-08. Australian sandalwood (S. spicatum) is grown in commercial plantations throughout the wheatbelt of Western Australia, where it has been an important part of the economy since colonial times. WA has the largest plantation resource in the world. Sandalwood is expensive compared to other types of woods, so to maximize profit, sandalwood is harvested by removing the entire tree instead of sawing it down at the trunk close to ground level. This way wood from the stump and root, which possesses high levels of sandalwood oil, can also be processed and sold. Australian sandalwood is mostly harvested and sold in log form, graded for heartwood content. The species is unique in that the white sapwood does not require removal before distilling the oil. The logs are either processed to distill the essential oil, or made into powders for making incense. Indian Sandalwood, used mainly for oil extraction, does require removal of the sapwood prior to distillation. , Australian Sandalwood oil sells for around per , while Indian Sandalwood oil, due to its higher alpha santalol content, is priced at about per kg. Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world, along with African blackwood, pink ivory, Agarwood and ebony.  Uses  =Fragrance= Sandalwood (S. album) essential oil Sandalwood oil has a distinctive soft, warm, smooth, creamy, and milky precious-wood scent. It imparts a long-lasting, woody base to perfumes from the oriental, woody, foug√®re, and chypre families, as well as a fixative to floral and citrus fragrances. When used in smaller proportions in a perfume, it acts as a fixative, enhancing the longevity of other, more volatile, materials in the composite. Sandalwood is also a key ingredient in the \\"floriental\\" (floral-ambery) fragrance family ‚Äì when combined with white florals such as jasmine, ylang ylang, gardenia, plumeria, orange blossom, tuberose, etc. Sandalwood oil in India is widely used in the cosmetic industry. The main source of true sandalwood, S. album, is a protected species, and demand for it cannot be met. Many species of plants are traded as \\"sandalwood\\". The genus Santalum has more than 19 species. Traders often accept oil from closely related species, as well as from unrelated plants such as West Indian sandalwood (Amyris balsamifera) in the family Rutaceae or bastard sandalwood (Myoporum sandwicense, Myoporaceae). However, most woods from these alternative sources lose their aroma within a few months or years. Isobornyl cyclohexanol is a synthetic fragrance chemical produced as an alternative to the natural product. Sandalwood's main components are the two isomers of santalol (about 75%). It is used in aromatherapy and to prepare soaps. = Technology = Due to its low fluorescence and optimal refractive index, sandalwood oil is often employed as an immersion oil within ultraviolet and fluorescence microscopy. = Food = Aboriginal Australians eat the seed kernels, nuts, and fruit of local sandalwoods, such as the quandong (S. acuminatum). Early Europeans in Australia used quandong in cooking damper by infusing it with its leaves, and in making jams, pies, and chutneys from the fruit. In Scandinavia, pulverised bark from red sandalwood (Pterocarpus soyauxii) is used - with other tropical spices - when marinating anchovies and some types of pickled herring such as matjes, sprat, and certain types of traditional spegesild, inducing a reddish colour and slightly perfumed flavour.Jan Selling (2008): S√• l√§nge skutan kan g√•, p.120 Cookbook. Present- day chefs have begun experimenting in using the nut as a substitute for macadamia nuts or a bush food substitute for almonds, hazelnuts, and others in Southeast Asian-styled cuisine. The oil is also used as a flavour component in different food items, including candy, ice cream, baked food, puddings, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and gelatin. The flavouring is used at levels below 10 ppm, the highest possible level for use in food products being 90 ppm.  Distillation  Sandalwood must be distilled so that the oil can be extracted from within. Many different methods are used, including steam distillation, water distillation, CO2 extraction, and solvent extractions. Steam distillation is the most common method used by sandalwood companies. It occurs in a four-step process, incorporating boiling, steaming, condensation, and separation. Water is heated to high temperatures (140-212 ¬∞F) and is then passed through the wood. The oil is very tightly bound within the cellular structure of the wood, so the high heat of the steam causes the oil to be released. The mixture of steam and oil is then cooled and separated so that the essential oil can be collected. This process is much longer than any other essential oil's distillation, taking 14 to 36 hours to complete, but generally produces much higher quality oil. Water, or hydro, distillation is the more traditional method of sandalwood extraction which involves soaking the wood in water and then boiling it until the oil is released. This method is not used as much anymore because of the high costs and time associated with heating large quantities of water.  Religion  =Hinduism= Sandalwood carved statue of lord Ganesha Indian sandalwood is very sacred in the Hindu Ayurveda and is known in Sanskrit as chandana. The wood is used for worshipping the god Shiva, and it is believed that goddess Lakshmi lives in the sandalwood tree. The wood of the tree is made into a paste using sandalwood powder, and this paste is integral to rituals and ceremonies, to make religious utensils, to decorate the icons of the deities, and to calm the mind during meditation and prayer. It is also distributed to devotees, who apply it to their foreheads or necks and chests. Preparation of the paste is a duty fit only for the pure, so is entrusted only to priests when used in temples and during ceremonies. The paste is prepared by grinding wood by hand with granite slabs shaped for this purpose. With the gradual addition of water, a thick paste forms (called kalabham \\"‡¥ï‡¥≥‡¥≠‡¥Ç\\" in Malayalam language and gandha ‡≤ó‡≤Ç‡≤ß in Kannada) and is mixed with saffron or other such pigments to make chandanam. Chandanam, further mixed with herbs, perfumes, pigments, and some other compounds, results in javadhu. Kalabham, chandanam, and javadhu are dried and used as kalabham powder, chandanam powder, and javadhu powder, respectively. Chandanam powder is very popular in India and is also used in Nepal. In Tirupati after religious tonsure, sandalwood paste is applied to protect the skin. In Hinduism and Ayurveda, sandalwood is thought to bring one closer to the divine. Thus, it is one of the most used holy elements in Hindu and Vedic societies. =Jainism= Mahamastakabhisheka at Shravanabelagola Sandalwood use is integral part of daily practices of Jainism. Sandalwood paste mixed with saffron is used to worship tirthankar Jain deities. Sandalwood powder is showered as blessings by Jain monks and nuns (sadhus and sadhvis) to their disciples and followers. Sandalwood garlands are used to dress the body during Jain cremation ceremonies. During the festival of Mahamastakabhisheka that is held once in every 12 years, the statue of Gommateshwara is then bathed and anointed with libations such as milk, sugarcane juice, and saffron paste, and sprinkled with powders of sandalwood, turmeric, and vermilion. =Buddhism= Sandalwood is mentioned in various suttas of the PƒÅli Canon. In some Buddhist traditions, sandalwood is considered to be of the padma (lotus) group and attributed to Amitabha Buddha. Sandalwood scent is believed by some to transform one's desires and maintain a person's alertness while in meditation. It is also one of the most popular scents used when offering incense to the Buddha and the guru. =Sufism= In sufi tradition, sandalwood paste is applied on the sufi‚Äôs grave by the disciples as a mark of devotion. It is practiced particularly among the Indian Subcontinent disciples. In the Tamil culture irrespective of religious identity, sandalwood paste or powder is applied to the graves of sufis as a mark of devotion and respect. * * =East Asian religions= In East Asia, sandalwood (Ê™ÄÊú®), along with agarwood (Ê≤âÈ¶ôÊú®), is the most commonly used incense material by the Chinese, Korean and Japanese in worship and various ceremonies. However, some sects of Taoists, following the Ming Dynasty Taoist Manual, do not use sandalwood (as well as benzoin resin, frankincense, foreign produced) incense and instead either use agarwood, or better still Acronychia pedunculata, in worship.The Ming Dynasty Taoist manual „ÄäÂ§©ÁöáËá≥ÈÅìÂ§™Ê∏ÖÁéâÂÜä„Äã states: „ÄåÈôçÁúüÈ¶ôÔºå‰πÉÁ•ÄÂ§©Â∏ù‰πãÈùàÈ¶ô‰πü„ÄÇÈô§Ê≠§‰πãÂ§ñÔºåÊ≤âÈÄüÊ¨°‰πã„ÄÇ‰ø°ÈùàÈ¶ôÂèØ‰ª•ÈÅîÂ§©Â∏ù‰πãÈùà„ÄÇÊâÄÂøåËÄÖÔºåÂÆâÊÅØÈ¶ô„ÄÅ‰π≥È¶ô„ÄÅÊ™ÄÈ¶ôÔºåÂ§ñÂ§∑ÊâÄÂêàÊàê‰πãÈ¶ôÔºåÂ§©ÂæãÊúâÁ¶ÅÔºåÂàáÂÆúÊÖé‰πã„ÄÇ„Äç [\\"Acronychia pedunculata is the spiritual incense of offering to the Heavenly Emperor. Apart from this type, agarwood/aloeswood (Aquilaria malaccensis) then Aquilaria sinensis are the next best. It is believed that this spiritual incense can ascend to reach the spirit of the Heavenly Emperor. Those that are to be avoided are benzoin resin, frankincense, sandalwood, foreign produced incense that violate the Heavenly Law and so one must be careful to observe this.\\"] In Korean Shamanism, sandalwood is considered the Tree of Life. =Zoroastrianism= Zoroastrians offer sandalwood twigs to the afarganyu, the urn in which the fire is kept at the fire temple (called agiyari in Gujarati and dar-e mehr in Persian), to keep the fire burning during religious ceremonies. After the firekeeping priests complete the ceremony, attendees are allowed to come up to the afarganyu and place their own pieces of sandalwood into the fire. Fire has been a sacred symbol in the Zoroastrian religion since ancient times and it is considered very important to keep the fires in the temples constantly burning. Because of its high sensitivity to fire, sandalwood works very well for this. Also, the wood has been accepted by the Yasna and Yashts as an appropriate fuel for the fire. It is offered to all of the three grades of fire in the fire temple, including the Atash Dadgahs. Sandalwood is not offered to the divo, a smaller lamp that is kept in the homes of Zoroastrians. Often, money is offered to the mobad (for religious expenditures) along with the sandalwood. Sandalwood is called sukhad in the Zoroastrian community. The sandalwood in the fire temple is often more expensive to buy than at a Zoroastrian store. It is often a source of income for the fire temple.

Simmondsia chinensis is the sole species of the family Simmondsiaceae, placed in the order Caryophyllales. Jojoba is grown commercially to produce jojoba oil, a liquid wax ester extracted from its seed. Distribution The plant is a native shrub of the Sonoran Desert, Colorado Desert, Baja California Desert, and California chaparral and woodlands habitats in the Peninsular Ranges and San Jacinto Mountains. It is found in southern California, Arizona, and Utah (U.S.), and Baja California state (Mexico). Jojoba is endemic to North America, and occupies an area of approximately between latitudes 25¬∞ and 31¬∞ North and between longitudes 109¬∞ and 117¬∞ West. Description Simmondsia chinensis, or jojoba, typically grows to tall, with a broad, dense crown, but there have been reports of plants as tall as . The leaves are opposite, oval in shape, long and broad, thick, waxy, and glaucous gray-green in color. The flowers are small and greenish-yellow, with 5‚Äì6 sepals and no petals. The plant typically blooms from March to May. =Reproduction= Each plant is dioecious, with hermaphrodites being extremely rare. The fruit is an acorn-shaped ovoid, three-angled capsule long, partly enclosed at the base by the sepals. The mature seed is a hard oval that is dark brown and contains an oil (liquid wax) content of approximately 54%. An average-sized bush produces of pollen, to which few humans are allergic. The female plants produce seed from flowers pollinated by the male plants. Jojoba leaves have an aerodynamic shape, creating a spiral effect, which brings wind-born pollen from the male flower to the female flower. In the Northern Hemisphere, pollination occurs during February and March. In the Southern Hemisphere, pollination occurs during August and September. Somatic cells of jojoba are tetraploid; the number of chromosomes is 2n = 4x = 52. File:Jojoba-weibliche-bl√ºte.JPGFemale flower Image:Simmondsia chinensis male flower.jpgClose-up of male Simmondsia chinensis flowers File:Jojoba.jpgJojoba fruits Image:Jojoba.seed.jpgJojoba seed = Genetics = The jojoba genome was sequenced in 2020 and reported to be 887-Mb, consisting of 26 chromosomes (2n = 26), and is predicted to have 23,490 protein-coding genes. Lost Dutchman State Park (Arizona) =Taxonomy= Despite its scientific name Simmondsia chinensis, the plant is not native to China. The botanist Johann Link originally named the species Buxus chinensis, after misreading a collection label \\"Calif\\", referring to California, as \\"China\\". Jojoba was collected again in 1836 by Thomas Nuttall who described it as a new genus and species in 1844, naming it Simmondsia californica, but priority rules require that the original specific epithet be used. The common name \\"jojoba\\" originated from O'odham name Hohowi. The common name should not be confused with the similarly written jujube (Ziziphus zizyphus), an unrelated plant species, which is commonly grown in China. Uses Jojoba oil in a clear glass vial Jojoba foliage provides year-round food for many animals, including deer, javelina, bighorn sheep, and livestock. Its nuts are eaten by squirrels, rabbits, other rodents, and larger birds. Only Bailey's pocket mouse, however, is known to be able to digest the wax found inside the jojoba nut. In large quantities, jojoba seed meal is toxic to many mammals, later this effect was found to be due to simmondsin, which inhibits hunger. The indigestible wax acts as a laxative in humans. =Native American uses= Native Americans first made use of jojoba. During the early 18th century Jesuit missionaries on the Baja California Peninsula observed indigenous peoples heating jojoba seeds to soften them. They then used a mortar and pestle to create a salve or buttery substance. The latter was applied to the skin and hair to heal and condition. The O'odham people of the Sonoran Desert treated burns with an antioxidant salve made from a paste of the jojoba nut. Native Americans also used the salve to soften and preserve animal hides. Pregnant women ate jojoba seeds, believing they assisted during childbirth. Hunters and raiders ate jojoba on the trail to keep hunger at bay. The Seri, who utilize nearly every edible plant in their domain, do not regard the beans as real food and in the past ate it only in emergencies. =Contemporary uses= Wild jojoba seed market on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona Jojoba is grown for the liquid wax, commonly called jojoba oil, in its seeds. This oil is rare in that it is an extremely long (C36‚ÄìC46) straight-chain wax ester and not a triglyceride, making jojoba and its derivative jojoba esters more similar to whale oil than to traditional vegetable oils. Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters (HJE's) are created via a saponification reaction which liberates more than 12 natural long chain fatty alcohols making them available for anti-viral purposes. Natural HJE's have been shown to be 50 times stronger in in-vitro testing than synthetic docosanol (C22:0) in combating the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1). Jojoba oil has also been discussed as a possible biodiesel fuel. Jojoba cannot be cultivated on a scale to compete with traditional fossil fuels, and its use is relegated to personal care products.. =Cultivation= Plantations of jojoba have been established in a number of desert and semi-desert areas, predominantly in Argentina, Australia, Israel, Mexico, Peru and the United States. It is currently the Sonoran Desert's second most economically valuable native plant (overshadowed only by Washingtonia filifera‚ÄîCalifornia fan palms, used as ornamental trees). Jojoba prefers light, coarsely textured soils. Good drainage and water penetration is necessary. It tolerates salinity and nutrient-poor soils. Soil pH should be between 5 and 8. High temperatures are tolerated by jojoba, but frost can damage or kill plants. Requirements are minimal, so jojoba plants do not need intensive cultivation. Weed problems only occur during the first two years after planting and there is little damage by insects. Supplemental irrigation could maximize production where rainfall is less than 400 mm. There is no need for high fertilisation, but, especially in the first year, nitrogen increases growth. Jojoba is normally harvested by hand because seeds do not all mature in the same time. Yield is around 3.5 t/ha depending on the age of the plantation. Selective breeding is developing plants that produce more beans with higher wax content, as well as other characteristics that will facilitate harvesting.

The operation was executed at roughly the midpoint of the five-month long Battle of Stalingrad, and was aimed at destroying German forces in and around Stalingrad. Planning for Operation Uranus had commenced in September 1942, and was developed simultaneously with plans to envelop and destroy German Army Group Center (Operation Mars) and German forces in the Caucasus. The Red Army took advantage of the German army's poor preparation for winter, and the fact that its forces in the southern Soviet Union were overstretched near Stalingrad, using weaker Romanian troops to guard their flanks; the offensives' starting points were established along the section of the front directly opposite Romanian forces. These Axis armies lacked heavy equipment to deal with Soviet armor. Due to the length of the front created by the German summer offensive, aimed at taking the Caucasus oil fields and the city of Stalingrad, German and other Axis forces were forced to guard sectors beyond the length they were meant to occupy. The situation was exacerbated by the German decision to relocate several mechanized divisions from the Soviet Union to Western Europe. Furthermore, units in the area were depleted after months of fighting, especially those which took part in the fighting in Stalingrad. The Germans could only count on the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, which had the strength of a single panzer division, and the 29th Panzergrenadier Division as reserves to bolster their Romanian allies on the German Sixth Army's flanks. In comparison, the Red Army deployed over one million personnel for the purpose of beginning the offensive in and around Stalingrad. Soviet troop movements were not without problems, due to the difficulties of concealing their build-up, and to Soviet units commonly arriving late due to logistical issues. Operation Uranus was first postponed from 8 to 17 November, then to 19 November. At 07:20 Moscow time on 19 November, Soviet forces on the northern flank of the Axis forces at Stalingrad began their offensive; forces in the south began on 20 November. Although Romanian units were able to repel the first attacks, by the end of 20 November the Third and Fourth Romanian armies were in headlong retreat, as the Red Army bypassed several German infantry divisions. German mobile reserves were not strong enough to parry the Soviet mechanized spearheads, while the Sixth Army did not react quickly enough nor decisively enough to disengage German armored forces in Stalingrad and reorient them to defeat the impending threat. By late 22 November Soviet forces linked up at the town of Kalach, encircling some 290,000 men east of the Don River. Instead of attempting to break out of the encirclement, German leader Adolf Hitler decided to keep Axis forces in Stalingrad and resupply them by air. In the meantime, Soviet and German commanders began to plan their next movements. Background On 28 June 1942, the Wehrmacht began its offensive against Soviet forces opposite of Army Group South, codenamed Case Blue. After breaking through Red Army forces by 13 July, German forces encircled and captured the city of Rostov. Following the fall of Rostov, Hitler split German forces operating in the southern extremity of the southern Russian SFSR in an effort to simultaneously capture the city of Stalingrad and the Caucasus oil fields. The responsibility to take Stalingrad was given to the Sixth Army, which immediately turned towards the Volga River and began its advance with heavy air support from the Luftwaffe's Luftflotte 4. On 7 August, two German panzer corps were able to flank and encircle a Soviet force of 50,000 personnel and approximately 1,000 tanks, and on 22 August German forces began to cross the Don River to complete the advance towards the Volga. The following day, the Battle of Stalingrad began when vanguards of the Sixth Army penetrated the suburbs of the city. German troops advancing in the Soviet Union, June 1942 By November the Sixth Army had occupied most of Stalingrad, pushing the defending Red Army to the banks of the Volga River. By this stage, there were indications of an impending Soviet offensive which would target Wehrmacht forces around the city, including increased Soviet activity opposite the Sixth Army's flanks, and information gained through the interrogation of Soviet prisoners. The German command remained focused upon finalizing its capture of Stalingrad and were unsure of where or when the counterattack would take place. Actions were taken to provide a reserve behind the Italian and Romanian armies, with 6th Panzer Division and two additional infantry divisions ordered to Russia from France. However, this move would only be completed by December. Head of Army General Staff General Franz Halder had been dismissed in September after his efforts to warn about the danger which was developing along the over-extended flanks of the Sixth Army and the Fourth Panzer Army. As early as September the Soviet Stavka (high command) began planning a series of counteroffensives to encompass the destruction of German forces in the south, fighting in Stalingrad and in the Caucasus, and against Army Group Center. Ultimately, command of Soviet efforts to relieve Stalingrad was put under the leadership of General Aleksandr Vasilevsky. The Stavka developed two major operations to be conducted against Axis forces near Stalingrad, Uranus and Saturn, and also planned for Operation Mars, designed to engage German Army Group Center in an effort to distract reinforcements and to inflict as much damage as possible. Operation Uranus involved the use of large Soviet mechanized and infantry forces to encircle German and other Axis forces directly around Stalingrad. As preparations for the offensive commenced, the attack's starting points were positioned on stretches of front to the rear of the German Sixth Army, largely preventing the Germans from reinforcing those sectors quickly where Axis units were too overstretched to occupy effectively. The offensive was a double envelopment; Soviet mechanized forces would penetrate deep into the German rear, while another attack would be made closer to the German Sixth Army in an effort to attack German units there directly in the rear. While the Red Army prepared, the German high commanders‚Äîinfluenced by their belief that the Red Army, building up opposite Germany Army Group Center to the north, was incapable of mounting a simultaneous offensive in the south‚Äîcontinued to deny the possibility of an impending Soviet offensive. Comparison of forces =Axis= Case Blue involved German and other Axis forces sprawled out across a front over wide and several hundred kilometers deep, while the decision to conquer Stalingrad had stretched Axis forces even more thinly by drawing away personnel eastwards. For example, in early July the Sixth Army was defending a line, while also committing to an offensive which involved a distance of around . Army Group B, which was split from Army Group South (the forces operating around the Caucasus were named Army Group A), seemed strong on paper: it included the Second and Sixth German, Fourth Panzer, Fourth and Third Romanian, Eighth Italian, and Second Hungarian Armies. Army Group B had the 48th Panzer Corps, which had the strength of a weakened panzer division, and a single infantry division as reserves. For the most part the German flanks were held by arriving non-German Axis armies, while German forces were used to spearhead continued operations in Stalingrad and in the Caucasus. General Friedrich Paulus, commander of the German Sixth Army While Adolf Hitler expressed confidence in the ability of non-German Axis units to protect German flanks, in reality these units relied on largely obsolete equipment and horse-drawn artillery, while in many cases the harsh treatment of enlisted personnel by officers caused poor morale. In regard to mechanization, the First Romanian Armored Division was equipped with around 100 Czech-built Panzer 35(t) tanks, armed with a gun ineffective against the armor of Soviet T-34 tanks. Similarly, their PaK anti-tank guns were also antiquated and they were largely short of ammunition. Only after repeated requests did the Germans send the Romanian units PaK guns; six per division. These units were extended over very large sections of front; for example, the Third Romanian Army occupied a line long, while the Fourth Romanian Army protected a line no less than long. The Italians and Hungarians were positioned at the Don west of the Third Romanian Army, but the German commanders did not hold in high regard the capability of those units to fight. Generally, German forces were in no better shape; they were weakened by months of fighting the Red Army, and, while Stavka raised new armies, the German high command attempted to maintain its existing mechanized units. Furthermore, during the course of the German offensive between May and November 1942, two motorized divisions, the elite Leibstandarte and the Gro√üdeutschland, were redeployed from Army Group A to the West, to provide a mechanized reserve in case of an Allied landing in France. The Sixth Army had also suffered many casualties during the fighting in the city of Stalingrad proper. In some cases, such as that of the 22nd Panzer Division, their equipment was no better than that of the First Romanian Armored Division. German formations were also overextended along large stretches of front; the XI Army Corps, for example, had to defend a front around long. =Soviet= The Red Army allocated an estimated 1,100,000 personnel, 804 tanks, 13,400 artillery pieces and over 1,000 aircraft for the upcoming offensive. Across the Third Romanian Army, the Soviets placed the redeployed 5th Tank Army, as well as the 21st and 65th Armies, in order to penetrate and overrun the German flanks. The German southern flank was targeted by the Stalingrad Front's 51st and 57th Armies, led by the 13th and 4th Mechanized Corps; these would punch through the Fourth Romanian Army, in order to link up with the 5th Tank Army near the town of Kalach. In total, the Soviets had amassed 11 armies and various independent tank brigades and corps. Preparations for the offensive were, however, far from perfect; on 8 November, Stavka issued orders to postpone the launch date of the operation, because transportation delays had prevented many units from being able to move into place. In the meantime, units at the front went through a number of war games to practice repelling an enemy counterattack and exploiting a breakthrough with mechanized forces. These movements were masked through a deception campaign by the Soviets, including the decrease of radio traffic, camouflage, operational security, using couriers for communication instead of radio, and active deception, such as increasing troop movements around Moscow. Troops were ordered to build defensive fortifications, to offer false impressions to the Germans, while fake bridges were put up to divert attention from the real bridges being built across the Don River. The Red Army also stepped up attacks against Army Group Center and set up dummy formations to maintain the idea of a main offensive against German forces in the center. The Soviet Stalingrad Front forces were subject to heavy bombardment, making mobilization more difficult. The 38 engineer battalions allocated to the front were responsible for ferrying ammunition, personnel and tanks across the Volga River while carrying out minor reconnaissance along sections of the front which were to be the breakthrough points of the impending offensive. In three weeks the Red Army transported around 111,000 soldiers, 420 tanks and 556 artillery pieces across the Volga. On 17 November Vasilevsky was recalled to Moscow, where he was shown a letter written to Stalin by General Volsky, commander of the 4th Mechanized Corps, who urged calling off the offensive. Volsky believed the offensive as planned was doomed to failure due to the state of the forces earmarked for the operation; he suggested postponing the offensive and redesigning it entirely. Many Soviet soldiers had not been issued with winter garments, and many died of frostbite, \\"due to the irresponsible attitude of commanders\\". Although Soviet intelligence made honest efforts to collect as much information as possible on the disposition of the Axis forces arrayed in front of them, there was not much information on the state of the German Sixth Army. Vasilevsky wanted to call off the offensive. The Soviet commanders, overruling Vasilevsky, agreed the offensive would not be called off, and Stalin personally rang Volsky, who reiterated his intention to carry out the operation if ordered to do so. Soviet offensive Operation Uranus, postponed until 17 November, was again postponed for two days when Soviet General Georgy Zhukov was told the air units allotted to the operation were not ready; it was finally launched on 19 November. Shortly after 5 a.m. Lieutenant Gerhard St√∂ck, posted with the Romanian IV Army Corps on the Kletskaya sector called Sixth Army headquarters housed in Golubinsky, offering intelligence on a pending attack which would occur after 05:00 that morning; however, because his call had come in after five and false alarms were common during this time, the duty officer on the other end of the line was not keen on waking the Army Chief of Staff, General Arthur Schmidt. Although Soviet commanders suggested postponing the bombardment due to poor visibility from thick fog, front headquarters decided to proceed. At 07:20 Moscow time (05:20 German time) Soviet artillery commanders received the codeword \\"Siren\\", prompting an 80-minute artillery bombardment directed almost entirely against the non-German Axis units protecting the German flanks. At 7:30, the Katyusha rocket-launchers fired the first salvos and were soon joined in by the 3,500 guns and mortars stretching along the few breakthrough sectors in front of the Third Romanian Army and the northern shoulder of the German Sixth Army's flank. Although thick fog prevented the Soviet artillery from correcting their aim, their weeks of preparation and ranging allowed them to lay down accurate fire on enemy positions along the front. The effect was devastating, as communication lines were breached, ammunition dumps destroyed and forward observation points shattered. Many Romanian personnel who survived the bombardment began to flee to the rear. Soviet heavy artillery aimed at Romanian artillery positions and second-echelon formations also caught the retreating Romanian soldiers. Unit locations of Axis and Soviet Armies on 18 Nov 1942. =Against the Third Romanian Army: 19 November= The offensive against the Third Romanian Army began at 08:50, led by the 21st and 65th Soviet Armies and the 5th Tank Army. The first two assaults were repulsed by the Romanian defenders, and the effects of the heavy artillery bombardment had actually made it more difficult for Soviet armor to navigate through the minefields and terrain. However, the lack of heavy anti-tank artillery caused the Romanian defense to collapse; a breakthrough by the 4th Tank Corps and 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps was established by noon. Soon after, the 5th Tank Army was able to gain a breakthrough against the Second Romanian Corps, followed by the Eighth Cavalry Corps. As Soviet armor navigated through the thick fog by compass, overrunning Romanian and German artillery positions, three Romanian infantry divisions began to fall back in disarray; the Third Romanian Army had been outflanked to the West and East. After receiving the news of the Soviet attack, Sixth Army headquarters failed to order the 16th and 24th Panzer Divisions, hitherto engaged in Stalingrad, to reorient themselves to bolster the Romanian defenses; instead the task was given to the seriously understrength and poorly equipped 48th Panzer Corps. The 48th Panzer Corps had fewer than 100 serviceable modern tanks to combat Soviet armor. Furthermore, they lacked fuel, and the shortage of tanks forced commanders to organize tank crews into infantry companies; the 22nd Panzer Division, which formed part of the corps, was almost completely destroyed in the fighting that ensued. The 22nd had entered the fighting with fewer than thirty working tanks, and left with a company of tanks. The Romanian 1st Armored Division, attached to the 48th Panzer Corps, engaged the Soviet 26th Tank Corps after having lost communications with their German corps commanders, and were defeated by 20 November. As the Soviets continued to advance southwards, many Soviet tank crews began to suffer from the worsening blizzard, which affected men and equipment, and blocked gunsights. It was not uncommon for tanks to lose traction on the ground, and for a crew member to have an arm broken as he was thrown around inside the hull. However, the blizzard also neutralized the German corps' coordination. The rout of the Third Romanian Army began by the end of 19 November. The Soviet 21st Army and 5th Tank Army were able to capture some 27,000 Romanian prisoners‚Äîthe bulk of three divisions‚Äîand then continue their advance southwards. Soviet cavalry was used to exploit the breakthrough, sever communications between the Romanians and the Italian 8th Army, and to block any possible counterattack against the Soviet flank. While the Red Air Force strafed retreating Romanian soldiers, the Luftwaffe provided only negligible opposition. The withdrawal of the 1st Romanian Cavalry Division, originally positioned on the German 376th Infantry Division's flank, allowed the 65th Army to bypass German defenses. As German forces began to react late on 19 November, another attack developed on the Sixth Army's flank to the south. =Against the German southern flank: 20 November= Panzer III in the southern Soviet Union, December 1942 In the early morning of 20 November Stavka telephoned Stalingrad Front commander Andrei Yeremenko asking if he would begin his portion of the offensive on schedule, at 08:00. He responded he would do so only if the fog lifted; although the 51st Army opened its artillery barrage on time because front headquarters could not contact the division, the rest of the forces prepared for the operation received orders to postpone the attack until 10:00. The 51st Army engaged the Romanian 6th Corps, taking many prisoners. As the 57th Army joined the attack at 10:00, the situation developed in such a way that the Stalingrad Front could throw its armored corps into battle. The German 297th Infantry Division watched as its Romanian support failed to put up resistance against the Red Army. However, confusion and lack of control caused the Soviet 4th and 13th Mechanized Corps to stumble as they began to exploit the breakthroughs achieved by the opening offensive. The Germans responded quickly by redeploying their only reserve in the area, the 29th Panzergrenadier Division. Despite initial victories against Soviet armored forces, the Romanian collapse forced the division to again redeploy in an attempt to shore up defenses to the south. The 29th Panzergrenadier Division's counterattack had cost the Red Army around fifty tanks, and caused Soviet commanders to worry about the safety of their left flank. However, the German division's redeployment meant that by the end of the day only the 6th Romanian Cavalry Regiment was positioned between advancing Soviet forces and the Don River. right =Continued operations: 20‚Äì23 November= While the Stalingrad Front launched its offensive on 20 November, the 65th Soviet Army continued to apply pressure to the German 11th Corps along the northern shoulder of the Sixth Army's flank. The Red Army's 4th Tank Corps advanced beyond the German 11th Corps, while the 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps crashed into the German unit's rear. The German 376th Infantry Division and the Austrian 44th Infantry Division began to redeploy to face the enemy on their flanks, but were hindered by shortage of fuel. The 14th Panzer Division's remaining panzer regiment destroyed a flanking regiment of the Soviet 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps, but its anti-tank artillery suffered heavy casualties when it was overrun by Soviet forces. By the end of the day the Soviet 1st Tank Corps was chasing the retreating 48th Panzer Corps, while the Soviet 26th Tank Corps had captured the town of Perelazovsky, almost to the northwest of Stalingrad. The Red Army's offensive continued on 21 November, with forces of the Stalingrad Front achieving penetrations of up to . By this time remaining Romanian units in the north were being destroyed in isolated battles, while the Red Army began to engage flanking portions of the German Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies. The German 22nd Panzer Division, despite attempting a short counterattack, was reduced to little more than a tank company and forced to withdraw to the southwest. The Soviet 26th Tank Corps, having destroyed a large portion of the Romanian 1st Armored Division, continued its advance to the southeast, avoiding engaging enemy left behind, although remnants of the Romanian 5th Corps were able to reorganize and put up a hastily constructed defense in the hope that it would be aided by the German 48th Panzer Corps. Surrounded by 5th Tank Army on one side and 21st Army on the other, the bulk of 3rd Romanian Army was isolated in the region of Raspopinskaya where General LascƒÉr took control of the remnants of 4th and 5th Corps, whereas the neighboring 1st Armored Division was still trying to break free and link with 22nd Panzer Division. That day German General Friedrich Paulus, commander of the Sixth Army, received reports that the Soviets were less than from his headquarters; furthermore, there were no remaining units which could contest the Soviet advance. In the south, after a brief halt, the Soviet 4th Mechanized Corps continued its advance north, removing German defenders from several towns in the area, towards Stalingrad. As German forces in and around Stalingrad were at risk, Hitler ordered German forces in the area to establish an \\"all-around defensive position\\" and designated forces between the Don and Volga rivers as \\"Fortress Stalingrad\\", rather than allow the Sixth Army to attempt to break out. The Sixth Army, other Axis units, and most of the Fourth Panzer Army's German units were caught inside the growing Soviet encirclement. Only the 16th Panzergrenadier Division began to fight its way out. Lack of coordination between Soviet tanks and infantry as the Red Army's tank corps attempted to exploit the breakthrough along the Germans' southern flank allowed much of the Fourth Romanian Army to escape destruction. On 22 November Soviet forces began to cross the Don River and continued their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, were not aware of the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even then did not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to approach it and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps. The encirclement of 6th Army was effective on 23 November. Around 16:00, near the village of Sovetsky, the forward detachments of 36th Mechanized Brigade from the Stalingrad Front's 4th Mechanized Corps sighted the approaching tanks of 45th Brigade from the Southwestern Front's 4th Tank Corps. At first they mistook them for Germans because they did not fire green flares as was agreed for a reconnaissance signal and several tanks were damaged in a short exchange of fire. After clarification the linkup was achieved. It was reenacted later for the newsreels. The junction between the armored troops of 21st and 51st Armies from Vatutin's and Eremenko's fronts completed the surrounding of Paulus's group of forces: two German armies among the most powerful in the Wehrmacht, 22 divisions and 150 separate regiments or battalions, and an enormous amount of materiel. Never before in the war were so many troops of the mighty Germany caught together. Such a feat was so unusual that the Stavka's own initial estimation of the encircled enemy force was only a quarter of its actual strength, because besides the fighting troops there was a huge number of extra personnel from various professions, engineer sections, Luftwaffe ground staff and others. Fighting continued on 23 November as the Germans attempted in vain to mount local counterattacks to break the encirclement. By this time Axis personnel inside the encirclement moved east towards Stalingrad to avoid Soviet tanks, while those that managed to escape the encirclement moved west toward German and other Axis forces. Aftermath Operation Uranus trapped between 250,000 and 300,000 Axis soldiers within an area stretching from east to west and north to south. The pocket contained four infantry corps, a panzer corps belonging to the Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies, and surviving elements of two Romanian divisions, a Croat infantry regiment and other specialist units. Trapped equipment included around 100 tanks, 2,000 artillery pieces and mortars and 10,000 trucks. The withdrawal to Stalingrad left lines of retreat littered with helmets, weapons and other equipment, and heavy equipment which had been destroyed was left on the side of the road. Bridges spanning the Don River were jammed with traffic, as surviving Axis soldiers hastily made their way eastwards in the cold weather, attempting to escape Soviet armor and infantry threatening to cut them off from Stalingrad. Many wounded Axis personnel were trampled, and many of those who attempted to cross the river on foot on the ice fell through and drowned. Hungry soldiers filled Russian villages scouring for supplies, while supply dumps were often looted in search of cans of food. The last stragglers crossed the Don River by 24 November, and demolished the bridges to seal off the Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies from the Soviets in Stalingrad. The Sixth Army, in the midst of chaos, began to build defensive lines, hampered by the lack of fuel, ammunition and rations, and further burdened by the advancing Russian winter. It was also tasked with plugging gaps in the line caused by the disintegrating Romanian forces. On 23 November, some German units destroyed or burned everything not necessary for a breakout operation and began to pull back towards the northern end of Stalingrad. However, after the Germans had abandoned their winter bunkers, the Soviet 62nd Army was able to destroy the German 94th Infantry Division on the open ground; survivors of the German division were attached to the 16th and 24th Panzer Divisions. Although German military commanders were of the opinion that Wehrmacht forces caught in the encirclement should break out, between 23 and 24 November Hitler decided instead to hold the position and attempt to resupply the Sixth Army by air. The personnel trapped in Stalingrad would require at least of supplies per day, a task which the depleted Luftwaffe was in no condition to carry out. Furthermore, the revived Red Air Force was a threat to German aircraft attempting to fly over the encirclement. Although by December the Luftwaffe had assembled a fleet of around 500 aircraft, this was still insufficient to supply the Sixth Army and elements of the Fourth Panzer Army with the required supplies. During the first half of December the Sixth Army received less than 20% of their daily requirements. In the meantime, the Red Army strengthened its outer encirclement with the intention of destroying the encircled German units. Soviet armies would attack German units to the east and the south, aiming to split German units into smaller groups. These orders became effective on 24 November, and were to be executed without a major regrouping or movement of reserves. The outer encirclement ran for an estimated , although only three-quarters of that distance was actually covered by Soviet troops; the distance between the outer and inner encirclements was around . The Soviet high command also began planning for Operation Saturn, which was aimed at destroying the Italian Eighth Army and cutting off German forces in the Caucasus. The Soviet Stavka planned Saturn to start on about 10 December. German forces in the area had been further split up, as German general Erich von Manstein was given command of the newly created Army Group Don, comprising the German Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies, and the Third and Fourth Romanian Armies. Although the situation looked bleak for the Germans, a moment of relative calm had settled after the end of Operation Uranus; German and Soviet forces were planning their next movements.

After German troops captured the city of Kharkov in October 1941, the German High Command planned an offensive to destroy the Soviet forces toward the southern sector of the Eastern Front. To divert the attention of the Soviets from the thrust that would lead to the Battle of Stalingrad, on May 29, 1942, the High Command ordered \\"the earliest possible resumption of the attack on Moscow\\" by Army Group Centre. The factor that made Operation Kremlin plausible to the Soviet High Command, the Stavka, was that it coincided with Soviet thinking, which the Germans had not known. The Soviets had already believed that the Germans would make a second attempt to take Moscow in a larger summer offensive in 1942. The directive given to Army Group Centre, which assigned two panzer divisions the identical missions that they had received in the previous autumn, could have been taken for the real thing, even by the German officers who were in the know. Most of them were kept in the dark about the deception, which made it all the more believable. As part of Operation Kremlin, the Luftwaffe increased reconnaissance flights over and around Moscow, officers in charge of prisoner-of-war interrogations were given lists of questions to ask regarding Moscow's defenses and sealed packets of Moscow maps were distributed down to regimental level. A readiness date of August 1 was planned. Although postwar Soviet accounts insisted that Operation Kremlin had failed, the Soviet High Command and the General Staff were in fact misled by the deception. Joseph Stalin and top Soviet generals had no doubt that the Germans would launch another offensive on Moscow in mid-1942. On June 28, Operation Blau began. References Ziemke, Earl F. and Magna E.

Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 617. was an English scholar and didactic writer, famous for his prose style, his promotion of the vernacular, and his theories of education. He served in the administrations of Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I, having earlier acted as Elizabeth's tutor in Greek and Latin between 1548 and 1550. Early life Ascham was born at Kirby Wiske, a village in the North Riding of Yorkshire, near Northallerton, the third son of John Ascham, steward to Baron Scrope of Bolton. The name Ascham is derived from Askham near York\\"Ascham, Roger\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. 1st edn. 2004. Print. His mother, Margaret, is said to have come from the Conyers family, but this is speculation. Thomas and John were Roger's two older brothers, while Anthony Ascham was the youngest son of the Ascham family. The authority for this statement, as for most here concerning Ascham's early life, is his close friend Edward Grant (1540s‚Äì1601), headmaster of the venerable and still extant Royal College of St. Peter at Westminster‚Äîbetter known as Westminster School‚Äîwho collected and edited his letters and delivered a panegyrical oration on his life in 1576. Education Ascham was educated at the house of Sir Humphrey Wingfield, a barrister, Ascham tells us, in the Toxophilus under a tutor named R. Bond. His preferred sport was archery, and Sir Humphrey \\"would at term times bring down from London both bows and shafts and go with them himself to see them shoot\\". Hence Ascham's earliest English work, the Toxophilus, the importance which he attributed to archery in educational establishments, and probably the reason for archery in the statutes of St Albans, Harrow and other Elizabethan schools. Through Toxophilus, Ascham sought to teach the art of shooting and present a literary piece with proper English vocabulary. He criticized other English authors for sprinkling foreign terms into their works. Prior to Toxophilus publication, the bow had been forgotten by the English people with firearms evolving as the prevailing weapons of choice. The book sparked renewed interest in the practice of archery and Ascham was able to present it as an \\"innocent, salutary, useful, and liberal division.\\"Carlisle, James H., Samuel Johnson, and Arthur P. Stanley. Two Great Teachers: Johnson's Memoir of Roger Ascham ; and Selections from Stanley's Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold, of Rugby. Syracuse, N.Y: C. W. Bardeen, 1893. 18. Print. Many recognize the use of the bow as a disciplined skill, requiring more practice than any other instrument of offence.Carlisle, James H., Samuel Johnson, and Arthur P. Stanley. Two Great Teachers: Johnson's Memoir of Roger Ascham; and Selections from Stanley's Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold, of Rugby. Syracuse, N.Y: C. W. Bardeen, 1893. 18‚Äì19. Print. From this private tuition Ascham was sent \\"about 1530\\", at the age, it is said, of fifteen, to St John's College, Cambridge, then the largest and most learned college in either university, where he devoted himself specially to the study of Greek, then newly revived. Equipped with a small knowledge of the Greek language, Ascham went on to read lectures and teach fellow St. John students the language. He believed that the best way to learn a language was by teaching it. Ascham was applauded for his encouragement of Greek learning in the University. In particular, Robert Pember, a fellow student, praised Ascham's lectures and his method of teaching a language in order to learn it. In a letter to Ascham, Pember stated that \\"he would gain more knowledge by explaining one of Aesop‚Äôs Fables to a boy, than by hearing one of Homer‚Äôs poems explained by another.\\"Carlisle, James H., Samuel Johnson, and Arthur P. Stanley. Two Great Teachers: Johnson's Memoir of Roger Ascham; and Selections from Stanley's Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold, of Rugby. Syracuse, N.Y: C. W. Bardeen, 1893. 16. Print. Ascham was then appointed by the University to read Greek at open schools and received payment through honorary stipends. This was monumental for Ascham because at the time, there was no established lecturer of Greek at the University.Carlisle, James H., Samuel Johnson, and Arthur P. Stanley. Two Great Teachers: Johnson's Memoir of Roger Ascham ; and Selections from Stanley's Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold, of Rugby. Syracuse, N.Y: C. W. Bardeen, 1893. 16‚Äì17. Print. Here he fell under the influence of Sir John Cheke, who was admitted a fellow in Ascham's first year, and Sir Thomas Smith. Cheke in turn was friendly with Anthony Denny, who was brother-in-law to Kat Ashley, governess to the Lady Elizabeth. His guide and friend was Robert Pember, \\"a man of the greatest learning and with an admirable ability in the Greek tongue\\". He became B.A. in 1533‚Äì34, and was nominated to a fellowship at St John's. Dr Nicholas Metcalfe was then master of the college, \\"a papist, indeed, and if any young man given to the new learning as they termed or went beyond his fellows\\", he \\"lacked neither open praise, nor private exhibition.\\" He procured Ascham's election to a fellowship, \\"though being a new bachelor of arts, I chanced among my companions to speak against the Pope ... after serious rebuke and some punishment, open warning was given to all the fellows, none to be so hardy, as to give me his voice at election.\\" The day of election Ascham regarded as his birthday\\", and \\"the whole foundation of the poor learning I have and of all the furtherance that hitherto elsewhere I have been tamed.\\" He took his M.A. degree on 3 July 1537. He stayed for some time at Cambridge taking pupils, among whom was William Grindal, who in 1544 became tutor to Princess Elizabeth. Tutor to Elizabeth I In January 1548, Grindal, the tutor of princess Elizabeth, died. Ascham, one of the ablest Greek scholars in England, as well as public orator of the university, had already been in correspondence with the princess. In one of Ascham's letters to Katherine Ashley, he enclosed a new pen, as well a pen which he himself mended specifically for princess Elizabeth.Ryan, Lawrence V. Roger Ascham. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1963. 104. Print. Through Cecil, and at the fourteen-year-old princess's own wish, he was selected as her tutor against another candidate, also named Grindal, who was pressed by Admiral Seymour and Queen Catherine.Ryan, Lawrence V. Roger Ascham. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1963. 102. Print In 1548, Ascham began teaching Elizabeth, future queen of England, in Greek and Latin chiefly at Cheshunt, a job he held until 1550. On the subject of his experience with Elizabeth's education, Ascham later wrote: \\"Yea, I believe, that beside her perfect readiness in Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish, she readeth here now at Windsor more Greek every day than some prebendary of this church doth read Latin in a whole week.\\"Schoolmaster Ascham's influence on Elizabeth is suggested by the fact that, for the remainder of her life, she remained an occasional writer of poems, such as \\"On Monsieur's Departure\\". In a letter to Johannes Sturm, the Strassburg schoolmaster, Ascham praised Elizabeth's growth as a student: \\"She talks French and Italian as well as English: she has often talked to me readily and well in Latin and moderately so in Greek. When she writes Greek and Latin nothing is more beautiful than her handwriting . . . she read with me almost all Cicero and great part of Titus Livius: for she drew all her knowledge of Latin from those two authors. She used to give the morning to the Greek Testament and afterwards read select orations of Isocrates and the tragedies of Sophocles. To these I added St. Cyprian and Melanchthon's Commonplaces.\\" Secretary to Richard Morrison In 1550, Ascham had an unspecified quarrel with the court, which he ambiguously described as \\"a storm of recent violence and injury.\\"Ryan, Lawrence V. Roger Ascham. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1963. 112. Print. As a result, Ascham returned to Cambridge. Whilst there, Cheke informed Ascham that he had been appointed secretary to Sir Richard Morrison (Moryson), appointed ambassador to Charles V.Ryan, Lawrence V. Roger Ascham. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1963. 119. Print. It was on his way to join Morrison that he paid visit to Lady Jane Grey at Bradgate, where he found her reading Plato's Phaedo while every one else was out hunting. This final meeting between the two has been a cause of inspiration among many painters and writers as a grandiose romantic moment.Ryan, Lawrence V. Roger Ascham. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1963. 120. Print. Ascham served in this position for several years, traveling widely on the European continent. The embassy went to Louvain, where he found the university very inferior to Cambridge, then to Innsbruck and Venice. Ascham read Greek with the ambassador Morrison four or five days a week. His letters during the embassy in 1553, which was recalled on Mary's accession, were later published as the Report and Discourse on Germany. The work, which was possibly a history of political turmoil in Germany in the 1550s, is incomplete. Common theories are that the work was either lost, damaged, or left unfinished.Ryan, Lawrence V. Roger Ascham. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1963. 157. Print. Latin Secretary to Mary I Ascham's next job was an appointment as Latin Secretary to Mary I. Throughout the first few months he held the position, Ascham was bombarded with a torrent of work, which included countless letters. Through the efforts of Bishop Gardiner on his return to England, this office he likewise discharged to Queen Mary with a pension of ¬£20 a year, and then to Elizabeth‚Äîa testimony to his tact and caution in those changeful times. On 1 June 1554, he married Margaret Harleston, of South Ockendon, Essex, the daughter of Sir Clement Harleston. By her he had at least four sons and three daughters. Ascham was not a rich man, and when marrying Margaret, Ascham had to resign both his College Greek Readership and his University Public Oratorship. Margaret herself brought very little dowry, leaving Ascham to seek help from the connections he had made throughout the years. His relationship with Reginald Cardinal Pole led to Ascham securing from the queen the reversion of a lease of the manor of Salisbury Hall in Walthamstow, Essex, a manor once owned by Pole's family. Death Roger Ascham became fatally ill on 23 December 1568, having just finished a poem of thanks for the blessings Queen Elizabeth I had bestowed on England through her reign. Ascham made his last confession to the parish priest of St. Sepulchre-without-Newgate, William Gravet, simply saying ‚ÄúI want to die and be with Christ‚Äù, according to Edward Grant. He died on 30 December 1568, most likely from malaria. Ascham was then buried on 4 January 1569 in St. Sepulchre-without-Newgate, in London. Ascham School is located in Sydney, Australia, and was named after Roger Ascham.http://www.ascham.nsw.edu.au/ Publications Ascham obtained from Edward Lee, then Archbishop of York, a pension of ¬£2 a year, in return for which he translated Oecumenius' Commentaries on the Pauline Epistles. But the archbishop, scenting heresy in some passage relating to the marriage of the clergy, sent it back to him. =Toxophilus= Ascham's first published work, Toxophilus (\\"Lover of the Bow\\") in 1545, was dedicated to Henry VIII. The objects of the book were twofold, to commend the practice of shooting with the long bow, and to set the example of a higher style of composition than had yet been attempted in English. Ascham presented the book to Henry VIII at Greenwich soon after his return from the capture of Boulogne, and received a grant of a pension of ¬£10 a year. Toxophilus was the first book on archery in English. The work is a Platonic dialogue between Toxophilus and Philologus. Editions were published in 1571, 1589 and 1788, and by Edward Arber in 1868 and 1902. =The School master= In 1563 Ascham began the work The Scholemaster, published posthumously in 1570, which ensured his later reputation. Richard Sackville, he states in the book's preface, told him that \\"a fond schoolmaster\\" had, by his brutality, made him hate learning, much to his loss, and as he had now a young son, whom he wished to be learned, he offered, if Ascham would name a tutor, to pay for the education of their respective sons under Ascham's orders, and invited Ascham to write a treatise on \\"the right order of teaching\\". The School master was the result. Not a general treatise on educational method, the book concentrates on the teaching of Latin; and it was not intended for schools, but \\"specially prepared for the private brynging up of youth in gentlemen and noblemens houses.‚Äù It advocated \\"the double translation of a model book\\", the book recommended being Sturmius's Select Letters of Cicero; the method itself was not new. The book's plea for gentleness and persuasion instead of coercion in schools, was contemporary: it was being practised and preached at that time by Christopher Jonson (ca. 1536‚Äì1597) at Winchester College; and had been repeatedly urged by Erasmus and others. Along with its suggestions for educational practice, Ascham's book includes a famous warning against the dangers of Italy, which he calls \\"inchantme[n]tes of Circes.\\" The School master was reprinted in 1571 and 1589. It was edited by James Upton in 1711 and in 1743, by John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor 1863, and by Edward Arber in 1870. =Correspondence= Ascham's letters were collected and published in 1576, and went through several editions, the last at Nuremberg in 1611. They were re-titled by William Elstob in 1703. =Other works= Report and Discourse of the Affairs and State of Germany 1553 was published by John Daye (1570). Ascham's English works were edited by James Bennett, with a life by Samuel Johnson in 1771, reprinted in 1815. John Allen Giles in 1864‚Äì1865 published in 4 vols. select letters from the Toxophilus and Scholemaster and the life by Edward Grant.

Boyce Thompson Arboretum is the largest and oldest botanical garden in the state of Arizona. It is one of the oldest botanical institutions west of the Mississippi. Founded in 1924 as a desert plant research facility and ‚Äúliving museum‚Äù, the Arboretum is located in the Sonoran Desert on 392 acres (158.6 ha) along Queen Creek and beneath the towering volcanic remnant, Picketpost Mountain. Boyce Thompson Arboretum is on U.S. Highway 60, an hour's drive east from Phoenix and 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Superior, Arizona. The Arboretum has a visitor center, gift shop, research offices, greenhouses, a demonstration garden, picnic area, and a looping 1.5-mile (2.4 km) primary trail that leads visitors through various exhibits and natural areas. The exhibits include a cactus garden, palm and eucalyptus groves, an Australian exhibit, South American exhibit, aloe garden and an herb garden. There are also side trails such as the Chihuahuan Trail, Curandero Trail, and High Trail. Over 2600 species of arid land plants from around the world grow at the Arboretum. Agaves, aloes, boojum trees, cork oaks, jujube trees, legume trees, and, in the Eucalyptus grove, one of the largest red gum Eucalyptus trees (\\"Mr. Big\\") in the United States. Cacti and succulents grow extensively throughout the Arboretum. Because the BTA is a riparian zone, the park attracts Sonoran Desert wildlife and migrating birds. Visitors have seen bobcats, javelinas, coatimundis, rattlesnakes, gila monsters, hawks, hummingbirds, and vultures. 270 bird species have been spotted in the park and the Audubon Society has designated the Arboretum as an Important Bird Area. Currently the Arboretum has 5,000 members and attracts over 75,000 people annually.BTA Newsletter, Annual Report-Oct. 2014 History William Boyce Thompson, circa 1928. The arboretum was founded by William Boyce Thompson (1869 - 1930), a mine engineer who created his fortune in the mining industry. He was the founder and first president of Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company at Globe-Miami, Arizona and Magma Copper Company in Superior, Arizona. In the early 1920s, Thompson, enamored with the landscape around Superior, built a winter home overlooking Queen Creek. Also in the 1920s, as his fortunes grew, he created and financed the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Yonkers, New York (now at Cornell University in Ithaca), and the Boyce Thompson Arboretum on the property of the Picket Post House, west of Superior, Arizona. Boyce Thompson wrote: ‚ÄúI have in mind far more than mere botanical propagation. I hope to benefit the State and the Southwest by the addition of new products. A plant collection will be assembled which will be of interest not only to the nature lover and the plant student, but which will stress the practical side, as well to see if we cannot make these mesas, hillsides, and canyons far more productive and of more benefit to mankind. We will bring together and study the plants of the desert countries, find out their uses, and make them available to the people. It is a big job, but we will build here the most beautiful, and at the same time the most useful garden of its kind in the world.‚ÄùBoyce Thompson Southwestern Arboretum, Inc.: Purpose, History, Dedication Pamphlet Superior, AZ. July 1930, pg. 10 The Boyce Thompson Southwestern Arboretum was established on April 1, 1924, by hiring its first two employees, Dr. Franklin Crider and Frederick Gibson, both from the University of Arizona. Their first project was the construction of two homes that still exist on site, the Crider House and the Gibson House. Propagation buildings were put up in 1925 and by 1926, the Smith Building (administration building) and two connecting greenhouses were built. Ayer Lake was created the same year to help irrigate the lower portion of the park. In 1927, the Boyce Thompson Southwest Arboretum was incorporated, becoming the first non-profit research organization in Arizona. The Arboretum opened to the public on April 6, 1929.azhals.org,Boyce Thompson Arboretum survey,pdf-pg.3 Arboretum Administration ‚Äì Board of Directors In 1927, the Board of Directors consisted of Colonel Thompson, Charles F. Ayer (a business associate of the Colonels) and Edward Rice, an attorney from Globe. In 1929, the Directors of Boyce Thompson Institute and the Arboretum were added. Since that time, the Colonel's family has served continuously on the Board and is currently represented by his great-great grandson Dr. Paul Hohenlohe. His business associates have been represented by the son of another associate, William T. Smith, his son, Richard A. Smith and his son-in-law Ian Thompson.Az. Corporation Commission Public Access System File # -0033183-5.Also any recent quarterly Boyce Thompson Arboretum Newsletter for Members Between the three of them, they held Chairmanship of the Board from 1963 to 2000 and 2010 to present. The President of the Boyce Thompson Institute has remained on the Board as well and is currently represented by Dr. David Stern. In 1976 with the signing of the Tri-Partite Agreement, two members from the University of Arizona and two members from Arizona State Parks also sit on the Board bringing the maximum number of Board members to 20. The Early Years ‚Äì 1924‚Äì1965 With the hiring of Dr. Franklin Crider and Frederick Gibson on April 1, 1924, from the University of Arizona, the Arboretum was on its way. With the passage of Arizona House Bill 121 on March 7, 1925, it became possible for the Arboretum to incorporate as Arizona's first non-profit research institution on October 5, 1927. Opening to the public in 1929, the future was indeed bright for the Arboretum. With the crash of 1929, subsequent depression, a drought, and the passing of the Colonel in 1930, the Arboretum began to struggle. Dr. Crider left as Managing Director in 1934 and was succeeded by Frederick Gibson. The Picket Post House was sold in 1946 to help cut costs and raise revenues for the Arboretum. Frederick Gibson stayed as Director until his death in 1953. The Colonel's nephew, Joe E. Thompson Jr., became the Managing Director until the agreement with the University of Arizona in 1965. The Desert Biology Station and University of Arizona Years ‚Äì 1965‚Äì1976 A cooperative agreement was made with the University of Arizona in 1965, and Dr. E. Lendell Cockrum became the 4th Managing Director of the Arboretum. The intent was to reinvigorate the research program at the Arboretum and it was renamed the Desert Biology Station. In addition, Drs. Frank and Carol Crosswhite were added to the staff as Curators of Botany and Zoology. Dr. Cockrum left the Arboretum in 1968 and was replaced by Dr. Vernon Grant. Dr. Grant was succeeded in 1970 by Dr. Robert T. McKittrick who served as the 6th Director until 1984. Dr. McKittrick and Drs. Frank and Carol Crosswhite who retired in 2002 became the bridge between this and the next phase of the Arboretum's development. The Tri-Partite Years and Arizona State Parks - 1976 to Present With the signing of the Tri-Partite Agreement on March 30, 1976, the Arboretum became not only a State Park, but remained a scientific research facility and a non-profit institution. In addition, the Arboretum was designated a National Historic Site the same year. Dr. McKittrick, who had brought stability to the Arboretum though two transitions, retired in 1984. His replacement, Dr. William Feldman, was to serve for 21 years, the 3rd longest serving Director after Frederick Gibson and Robert McKittrick. Under Dr. Feldman, the face of the Arboretum changed into what we know today. The Visitor Center, Demonstration Garden, and Legume Garden were completed under his tenure as was the planning for the Children's Garden. Exhibits became more geographically focused and the word ‚Äúconservation‚Äù was added to the mission statement. The Demonstration Garden is notable for the involvement of Dr. Warren Jones from the University of Arizona and Steve Carter from the Arboretum. The Children's Garden was left for Dr. Mark Bierner to realize during his tenure from 2005 to 2008. In addition, the Picket Post House was purchased by Arizona State Parks in 2008 making the Arboretum whole again. The Smith Building with greenhouses, circa 1926. An example of this Tri-Partite partnership is the University of Arizona/BTA's Desert Legume Program or DELEP. DELEP is one of three U.S. organizations to have its seed bank backed up at the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway and one of three private organizations backed up at the National Center for Plant Genetic Resources in Fort Collins, Colorado. Another example is the Arizona State Parks‚Äô Volunteer program which has allowed the Arboretum to expand its educational and recreational programming.

History GAP was developed at Lehrstuhl D f√ºr Mathematik (LDFM), Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Germany from 1986 to 1997. After the retirement of Joachim Neub√ºser from the chair of LDFM, the development and maintenance of GAP was coordinated by the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. In the summer of 2005 coordination was transferred to an equal partnership of four 'GAP Centres', located at the University of St Andrews, RWTH Aachen, Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig, and Colorado State University at Fort Collins; in April 2020, a fifth GAP Centre located at the TU Kaiserslautern was added Distribution GAP and its sources, including packages (sets of user contributed programs), data library (including a list of small groups) and the manual, are distributed freely, subject to \\"copyleft\\" conditions. GAP runs on any Unix system, under Windows, and on Macintosh systems. The standard distribution requires about 300 MB (about 400 MB if all the packages are loaded). To run GAP, 128 MB of RAM is sufficient. The user contributed packages are an important feature of the system, adding a great deal of functionality. GAP offers package authors the opportunity to submit these packages for a process of peer review, hopefully improving the quality of the final packages, and providing recognition akin to an academic publication for their authors. , there are 58 packages distributed with GAP, of which approximately 35 have been through this process.

Origins The origins of the term \\"Middle England\\" are not known. Writer Ian Hislop found evidence of the British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury's using the term in 1882, but it did not gain popularity at the time. Modern popular usage of the phrase has been attributed to Margaret Thatcher who, according to the historian David Cannadine, introduced the expression into political phraseology by adopting Richard Nixon's concept of \\"Middle America\\". Modern usage Euroscepticism, are considered highly influential The Women's Institute is strongly associated with the concept of Middle England The primary meaning of the term is now a political or sociological one (as is also the case for the term \\"Middle America\\" or \\"Middle Australia\\"). It principally indicates the middle classes or lower-middle classes of non-urban Britain, but also carries connotations of \\"Deep England\\". John Major‚Äôs 1993 speech to the Conservative Group for Europe is often cited, evoking romantic imagery of rural cricket matches, warm beer, suburban gardens, and ‚Äúold maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist‚Äù (itself based on a quote from George Orwell). Although Middle England does not refer to a geographical region, it may be understood to refer to the inhabitants of suburbs in the South of England and the Midlands, typified by the small towns that make up \\"Metro-Land\\", the suburban areas north-west of London that are served by London Underground's Metropolitan line. The BBC described the Kent town of Tunbridge Wells as the \\"spiritual home\\" of Middle England, with particular reference to the popular characterisation of \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\", the pseudonym of an imaginary, incensed letter-writer. Emphasising its lack of geographical location, the writer Nick Inman likened Middle England to J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth: \\"We know everything about it except where it is\\". The term is used by journalists to refer to the presumed views of mainstream English and to a lesser extent British people, as opposed to minorities of all types (the rich or the poor, ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians, the politically active, the intelligentsia, etc.). In particular, it is increasingly used to denote the more right-wing views of those who are not in such minorities. The phrase \\"Middle England\\" may be regarded by some as interchangeable with \\"Middle Britain\\", particularly with reference to political campaigns that seek to include middle-class voters in Scotland and Wales, but commentators such as Cannadine have assessed it as a designation specific to a segment of England, not Britain as a whole. John Major's 1993 speech has been noted for its culturally selective evocation of Britain, omitting inner cities, football, people who are unemployed, coal mines, Muslims, and the other Constituent Countries of the United Kingdom. People who belong to the Middle England grouping are typically said to be white, middle class or lower-middle class, heterosexual, with a strong work ethic and a highly developed sense of conscientiousness. They may typically read the Daily Mail, a popular British newspaper known for its conservative editorial bias, and are also sometimes referred to as the \\"silent majority\\" or \\"moral majority\\" in the British media. In politics In British politics, Middle England is considered as a grouping to be especially important because of its potential to swing the results of United Kingdom general elections; according to the polling company MORI, Middle England is said to make up 25% of the UK population, its members are not devoted to any particular party and may be swayed by successful political campaigning, and many live in marginal constituencies. Middle England was also considered to be a major force in the vote to leave the European Union during the 2016 European Union membership referendum.

He was a founding contributor, with Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), to the science of thermodynamics, particularly focusing on the first of the three thermodynamic laws. He developed the Rankine scale, an equivalent to the Kelvin scale of temperature, but in degrees Fahrenheit rather than Celsius. Rankine developed a complete theory of the steam engine and indeed of all heat engines. His manuals of engineering science and practice were used for many decades after their publication in the 1850s and 1860s. He published several hundred papers and notes on science and engineering topics, from 1840 onwards, and his interests were extremely varied, including, in his youth, botany, music theory and number theory, and, in his mature years, most major branches of science, mathematics and engineering. He was an enthusiastic amateur singer, pianist and cellist who composed his own humorous songs. Life Rankine was born in Edinburgh to Lt David Rankin (sic), a civil engineer from a military background, who later worked on the Edinburgh to Dalkeith Railway (locally known as the Innocent Railway). His mother was Barbara Grahame, of a prominent legal and banking family. His father moved around Scotland on various projects and the family moved with him. William was initially educated at home but he later attended Ayr Academy (1828‚Äì29) and then the High School of Glasgow (1830). Around 1830 the family moved to Edinburgh when the father got a post as Manager of the Edinburgh to Dalkeith Railway. The family then lived at 2 Arniston Place.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1831 In 1834 he was sent to the Scottish Naval and Military Academy on Lothian Road in EdinburghEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1830 with the mathematician George Lee. By that year William was already highly proficient in mathematics and received, as a gift from his uncle, Isaac Newton's Principia (1687) in the original Latin. In 1836, Rankine began to study a spectrum of scientific topics at the University of Edinburgh, including natural history under Robert Jameson and natural philosophy under James David Forbes. Under Forbes he was awarded prizes for essays on methods of physical inquiry and on the undulatory (or wave) theory of light. During vacations, he assisted his father who, from 1830, was manager and, later, effective treasurer and engineer of the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway which brought coal into the growing city. He left the University of Edinburgh in 1838 without a degree (which was not then unusual) and, perhaps because of straitened family finances, became an apprentice to Sir John Benjamin Macneill, who was at the time surveyor to the Irish Railway Commission. During his pupilage he developed a technique, later known as Rankine's method, for laying out railway curves, fully exploiting the theodolite and making a substantial improvement in accuracy and productivity over existing methods. In fact, the technique was simultaneously in use by other engineers ‚Äì and in the 1860s there was a minor dispute about Rankine's priority. The year 1842 also marked Rankine's first attempt to reduce the phenomena of heat to a mathematical form but he was frustrated by his lack of experimental data. At the time of Queen Victoria's visit to Scotland, later that year, he organised a large bonfire situated on Arthur's Seat, constructed with radiating air passages under the fuel. The bonfire served as a beacon to initiate a chain of other bonfires across Scotland. In 1850 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Prof James David Forbes. He won the Society's Keith Prize for the period 1851‚Äì53. He served as the Society's Vice President from 1871 to 1872. From 1855 he was Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics at Glasgow University. He died at 8 Albion Crescent (now called Dowanside Road), Dowanhill, Glasgow at 11:45pm on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1872, aged only 52.Deaths in the District of Partick, 1872, page 199, National Records of Scotland 646/3 597 He was unmarried and had no children. His death was registered by his uncle, Alex Grahame (his late mother's brother in law). Thermodynamics Undaunted, Rankine returned to his youthful fascination with the mechanics of the heat engine. Though his theory of circulating streams of elastic vortices whose volumes spontaneously adapted to their environment sounds fanciful to scientists formed on a modern account, by 1849, he had succeeded in finding the relationship between saturated vapour pressure and temperature. The following year, he used his theory to establish relationships between the temperature, pressure and density of gases, and expressions for the latent heat of evaporation of a liquid. He accurately predicted the surprising fact that the apparent specific heat of saturated steam would be negative. Emboldened by his success, in 1851 he set out to calculate the efficiency of heat engines and used his theory as a basis to deduce the principle, that the maximum efficiency possible for any heat engine is a function only of the two temperatures between which it operates. Though a similar result had already been derived by Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson, Rankine claimed that his result rested upon his hypothesis of molecular vortices alone, rather than upon Carnot's theory or some other additional assumption. The work marked the first step on Rankine's journey to develop a more complete theory of heat. Rankine later recast the results of his molecular theories in terms of a macroscopic account of energy and its transformations. He defined and distinguished between actual energy which was lost in dynamic processes and potential energy by which it was replaced. He assumed the sum of the two energies to be constant, an idea already, although surely not for very long, familiar in the law of conservation of energy. From 1854, he made wide use of his thermodynamic function which he later realised was identical to the entropy of Clausius. By 1855, Rankine had formulated a science of energetics which gave an account of dynamics in terms of energy and its transformations rather than force and motion. The theory was very influential in the 1890s. In 1859 he proposed the Rankine scale of temperature, an absolute or thermodynamic scale whose degree is equal to a Fahrenheit degree. Energetics offered Rankine an alternative, and rather more mainstream, approach, to his science and, from the mid-1850s, he made rather less use of his molecular vortices. Yet he still claimed that Maxwell's work on electromagnetics was effectively an extension of his model. And, in 1864, he contended that the microscopic theories of heat proposed by Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell, based on linear atomic motion, were inadequate. It was only in 1869 that Rankine admitted the success of these rival theories. By that time, his own model of the atom had become almost identical with that of Thomson. As was his constant aim, especially as a teacher of engineering, he used his own theories to develop a number of practical results and to elucidate their physical principles including: *The Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot equation for propagation of shock waves, governs the behaviour of shock waves normal to the oncoming flow. It is named after physicists Rankine and the French engineer Pierre Henri Hugoniot; *The Rankine cycle, an analysis of an ideal heat-engine with a condensor. Like other thermodynamic cycles, the maximum efficiency of the Rankine cycle is given by calculating the maximum efficiency of the Carnot cycle; *Properties of steam, gases and vapours. The history of rotordynamics is replete with the interplay of theory and practice. Rankine first performed an analysis of a spinning shaft in 1869, but his model was not adequate and he predicted that supercritical speeds could not be attained. Fatigue studies Drawing of a fatigue failure in an axle, 1843. Rankine was one of the first engineers to recognise that fatigue failures of railway axles was caused by the initiation and growth of brittle cracks. In the early 1840s he examined many broken axles, especially after the Versailles train crash of 1842 when a locomotive axle suddenly fractured and led to the death of over 50 passengers. He showed that the axles had failed by progressive growth of a brittle crack from a shoulder or other stress concentration source on the shaft, such as a keyway. He was supported by similar direct analysis of failed axles by Joseph Glynn, where the axles failed by slow growth of a brittle crack in a process now known as metal fatigue. It was likely that the front axle of one of the locomotives involved in the Versailles train crash failed in a similar way. Rankine presented his conclusions in a paper delivered to the Institution of Civil Engineers. His work was ignored however, by many engineers who persisted in believing that stress could cause \\"re- crystallisation\\" of the metal, a myth which has persisted even to recent times. The theory of recrystallisation was quite wrong, and inhibited worthwhile research until the work of William Fairbairn a few years later, which showed the weakening effect of repeated flexure on large beams. Nevertheless, fatigue remained a serious and poorly understood phenomenon, and was the root cause of many accidents on the railways and elsewhere. It is still a serious problem, but at least is much better understood today, and so can be prevented by careful design. Other work Rankine in the 1870s Rankine served as Regius Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Glasgow from November 1855 until his death in December 1872, pursuing engineering research along a number of lines in civil and mechanical engineering. Rankine was instrumental in the formation of the forerunner of Glasgow University Officer Training Corps, the 2nd Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps at Glasgow University in July 1859, becoming Major in 1860 after it was formed into the first company of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps; he served until 1864, when he resigned due to pressure of work ‚Äì much of it associated with Naval Architecture. =Civil engineering= The Rankine Lectures, organised by the British Geotechnical Association, are named in recognition of the significant contributions Rankine made to: *Forces in frame structures; *Soil mechanics; most notably in lateral earth pressure theory and the stabilization of retaining walls. The Rankine method of earth pressure analysis is named after him. =Naval architecture= Rankine worked closely with Clyde shipbuilders, especially his friend and lifelong collaborator James Robert Napier, to make naval architecture into an engineering science. He was a founding member, and first President of the Institution of Engineers & Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1857. He was an early member of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects (founded 1860) and attended many of its annual meetings. With William Thomson and others, Rankine was a member of the board of enquiry into the controversial sinking of HMS Captain.

In 2009, Andrews Air Force Base merged with Naval Air Facility Washington to form Joint Base Andrews. Andrews, located near Morningside, Maryland in suburban Washington, DC, is the home base of two Boeing VC-25A aircraft with the call sign Air Force One when the president is on board, that serve the President of the United States. The host unit at Andrews is the 316th Wing, assigned to the Air Force District of Washington. It is responsible for maintaining emergency reaction rotary-wing airlift and other National Capital Region contingency response capabilities critical to national security and for organizing, training, equipping and deploying combat-ready forces for Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEFs). The 316th Wing also provides installation security, services and airfield management to support the President, Vice President, other U.S. senior leaders and more than 50 tenant organizations and federal agencies. The 316th Wing provides security, personnel, contracting, finance and infrastructure support for 5 Wings, 3 Headquarters, more than 80 tenant organizations, 148 geographically separated units, 6,500 Airmen in the Pentagon, as well as 60,000 Airmen and families in the national capital region and around the world. The 316th Wing supports contingency operations in the capital of the United States with immediate response rotary-assets. It also provides security for the world's highest visibility flight line and is responsible for ceremonial support with the United States Air Force Band, Honor Guard and Air Force Arlington Chaplaincy. The Wing commander is Colonel Tyler R. Schaff. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Thomas C. Daniels. For statistical purposes the base is delineated as a census-designated place by the U.S. Census Bureau. As of the 2010 census, the resident population was 2,973. History Union American Civil War troops used a country church near Camp Springs, Maryland for sleeping quarters (now named Chapel Two) and on 25 August 1941, President Roosevelt directed use of the land for an airfield. =Camp Springs Air Base= Camp Springs Air Base was designated on 5 September 1942, and construction began on 16 September 1942. The Maryland World War II Army Airfield of the 1st Air Force was \\"designated a sub-base of Headquarters, Baltimore AAFld, late Nov 1942\\"‚Äîthe 901st Quartermaster Company (Construction) became the base operating unit on 14 December 1942. Camp Springs Army Air Base opened on 2 May 1943, and the airfield became operational 2 May 1943 when the first Republic P-47 Thunderbolts arrived. after the 367th Fighter Squadron was stationed at Camp Springs on 21 April 1943. On 6 June 1943 the Camp Springs headquarters gained command of 4 sub-bases: Baltimore AAFld, Dover Army Airfield, Millville Army Airfield, and Philadelphia Municipal Airport became sub-bases of Camp Springs AAB. The airfield had runways by 1944 when the 90th Fighter Control Squadron was formed (28 March 1944), and the last Camp Springs combat units (e.g., 535th Fighter Escort Squadron) departed for World War II combat on 10 April 1944.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office 1961 (republished 1983, Office of Air Force History, ). Camp Springs was expanded to become the initial headquarters of Continental Air Forces (CONAF) (activated 12 December 1944)‚Äîthe 161st AAF Base Unit (CONAF) became the \\"Andrews Field\\" operating unit on 16 April 1945. =Andrews Field= Andrews Field was named on 7 February 1945 in honor of Lt Gen. Frank Andrews and in 1946, Andrews was a sub-base of Bolling Field (3 January 1946 ‚Äì 20 November 1946). Strategic Air Command headquarters transferred from Bolling Field to Andrews . The command of CONAF's Radar Bomb Scoring detachments (e.g., at Dallas Love Field) transferred to Andrews on 17 March 1946 when the \\"263 AAF BU\\" was assigned (transferred 23 February 1948) to Carswell AFB). Andrews was transferred from the Army to the Air Force in 1947, and it was a Headquarters Command installation from 1947 through 1952 and again after 1957. Headquarters Military Air Transport Service controlled the base during the interim period. The year 1947 marked the arrival of the first permanently assigned jet-powered aircraft, the F-80 Shooting Star, at Andrews. The long-lived and versatile training version of the F-80, the T-33, still played an important role in proficiency flying programs at Andrews more than 30 years later. =Andrews Air Force Base= Andrews AFB and Joint Base Andrews are named for Lieutenant General Frank Maxwell Andrews (1884‚Äì1943), former Commanding General of United States Forces in the World War II European Theater of Operations. General Andrews organized and commanded the General Headquarters, Air Force (1935‚Äì1939), and at the time of his death on 3 May 1943 in the crash of a B-24 Liberator in Iceland, he was Commanding General, United States Forces, European Theater of Operations. Andrews Air Force Base was designated on 24 June 1948, and in June 1950, Andrews rapidly became involved in combat readiness training for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber crews. Combat readiness training and proficiency flying for military pilots assigned non-flying duties in the Washington area have remained two key elements in the local mission since the establishment of the base. HQ Air Research and Development Command (later, Air Force Systems Command) moved to Andrews from Baltimore, 24 June 1958. With the construction of new facilities beginning in 1959, Andrews had become by early 1962 the primary USAF flight installation serving the Washington, DC, area with the closing of the runway at Bolling AFB. Andrews' air defense role was strengthened in the 1950s with the latest in fighter-interceptor hardware appearing on the flight line. F-94 Starfires, F-102 Delta Daggers and finally, F-106 Delta Darts formed the backbone of the three fighter interceptor squadrons which operated from the base until 1963.Ravenstein, Charles A. Air Force Combat Wings Lineage and Honors Histories 1947‚Äì1977. Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama: Office of Air Force History 1984. . In the late 1950s Andrews began an annual open house and air show on base. This event later evolved into the Department of Defense Joint Services Open House, an annual event that now brings more than 700,000 visitors to the base every year. The open house is held every year over Armed Forces Day weekend. In the years since 1959, Andrews' flight operations and importance have increased greatly. In 1961, the last of the Military Air Transport Service's flying units at Washington National Airport transferred to Andrews. This was followed a year later by the transfer to Andrews of all fixed-wing flying activities from Bolling Air Force Base. Andrews has become firmly established as the main port of entry for foreign military and government officials en route to Washington and the United States. In July 1961, the official presidential aircraft was stationed here, known as \\"Air Force One\\" when the president is on board. Before 1961, the presidential airplane had been kept at Washington National Airport and Bolling AFB. In 1963, the Naval Air Facility (NAF), originally established at the former NAS Anacostia in 1919, moved to Andrews. The NAF handles Naval VIP flight operations. The Marine Corps detachment that flies the FA-18 Hornet is located here. In a major reorganization, Headquarters Command, U.S. Air Force, was disbanded 1 July 1976, restructured under the Military Airlift Command as the 76th Airlift Division and transferred its headquarters from Bolling AFB to Andrews. The 76th remained the parent unit of the Andrews host command, redesignated as the 1st Air Base Wing. In October 1977, the 76th Airlift Division became the 76th Military Airlift Wing. The 1st Air Base Wing was redesignated the 76th Air Base Group, and the 89th Military Airlift Wing became the 89th Military Airlift Group. The 76th MAW remained the parent unit at Andrews. On 15 December 1980, the 76th Airlift Division was reestablished, the 76th Air Base Group became the 1776th Air Base Wing and the 89th Military Airlift Group became the 89th Military Airlift Wing. On 1 October 1985, the 76th Airlift Division was inactivated as the result of activation of the Headquarters Air Force District of Washington at Bolling AFB. The 1776th Air Base Wing was designated the \\"host wing\\" for Andrews AFB and assumed base support responsibilities. During Operation Desert Storm, Andrews handled 16,540 patients in makeshift hospital facilities located in the base tennis center. A C-32, a specially configured version of the leftOn 12 July 1991, the 89th Military Airlift Wing was redesignated as the 89th Airlift Wing and assumed duties as the host wing at Andrews AFB. Support functions previously performed by the 1776th Air Base Wing now fall under the 89th and the 1776th was inactivated. With the consolidation of the two wings, the newly formed 89th Airlift Wing is one of the largest wings in Air Mobility Command with a work force approaching 9,000 people. Known as \\"The President's Wing,\\" the 89th Airlift Wing continues to contribute to Andrews' rich history as the elite Air Mobility Command wing for transporting VIPs around the world. Not only does Andrews provide service for America's senior officials, but also kings, queens, presidents, prime ministers, popes, and local and foreign military leaders make Andrews AFB their first stop in the United States. On 5 January 2005 the Air Force reactivated the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) as the single Air Force voice for planning and implementing Air Force and joint solutions within the National Capital Region (NCR). This event brought with it significant changes at Andrews. On 12 May 2006, the 89th Medical Group at Andrews and the 11th Medical Group, Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C. combined into the 79th Medical Wing where it established its headquarters at Andrews. In June 2006, the 316th Wing stood up under the command of AFDW as the new host unit for Andrews Air Force Base and its nearly 50 tenant units to include organizations from the U.S. Army, the Air Force Reserve Command, Air National Guard, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve and the Civil Air Patrol. The activation of the 316th prompted the transfer of the 1st Helicopter Squadron from the 89th Airlift Wing to the 316th Operations Group. In May 2007 the AFDW, as well as the 844th Communications Group, transferred from Bolling AFB to Andrews AFB. =Merger= F-16D Fighting Falcon of the District of Columbia Air National Guard. As part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) programme, it was recommended that Naval Air Facility Washington and Andrews Air Force Base, became a joint base known as Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington, or Joint Base Andrews for short. The merger was effective from 1 October 2009, when the joint base was established, with the US Air Force being the lead organization providing management and support services for both installations. Although sharing parallel runways, NAF Washington was originally considered a separate air installation and maintained a separate Navy/Marine Corps‚Äìunique FAA airfield identifier of NSF and an ICAO airfield identifier of KNSF. Prior to merging, these separate airfield identifiers were discontinued on 29 March 2009 and all flight operations in and out of NAF Washington now use the Andrews AFB airfield identifiers of ADW and KADW as appropriate.

See Joint Base Andrews for a list of units and aircraft now based at the installation. Geography Andrews Air Force Base is located at (38.803490, ‚àí76.871508), a few miles southeast of Washington, D.C. near the town of Morningside in Prince George's County, Maryland. It is delineated as a census-designated place by the United States Census Bureau. The CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.51%, is water. There are two runways on the base; the western runway is in length, and the eastern runway is in length. The minor third runway between them at the top of the picture (above the cross-base roadway) is now closed, and the small T-shaped runway at the bottom right of the opening picture was closed and demolished by 2008. Demographics Overview of Andrews flight line As of the census of 2000, there were 7,925 people, 1,932 households, and 1,864 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 1,158.9 people per square mile (447.3/km). There were 2,133 housing units at an average density of 311.9 sq mi (120.4/km). The racial makeup of the base was 65.3% White, 22.8% African American, 0.6% Native American, 3.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.7% from other races, and 4.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.7% of the population. There were 1,932 households, out of which 75.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 86.1% were married couples living together, 7.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 3.5% were non-families. 3.2% of all households were made up of individuals, none of whom was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.39 and the average family size was 3.44. In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 35.0% under the age of 18, 16.3% from 18 to 24, 44.9% from 25 to 44, 3.6% from 45 to 64, and 0.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 24 years. For every 100 females, there were 119.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 126.0 males. The median income for a household in the base was $44,310, and the median income for a family was $42,866. Males had a median income of $27,070 versus $27,308 for females. The per capita income for the base was $16,520. About 2.6% of families and 2.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including of the total population, 2.8% of those under the age of 18 and none of those 65 and older. Motor sport On 2 May 1954, sports car races were held at the base, using a 4.3-mile (6.9 km) circuit made up of runways and other access roads.

Early life Gardiner was born in Bury St Edmunds, but the date of his birth is uncertain. His father is believed to have been John Gardiner, but could have been Wyllyam Gardiner, a substantial cloth merchant of the town where he was born,see his will, printed in Proceedings of the Suffolk Archaeological Institute, i. 329 who took care to give him a good education. His mother was once thought to be Helen Tudor, an illegitimate daughter of Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford, but research from 2011 suggests that this lady was the mother of a different cleric, Thomas Gardiner.Douglas Richardson, Plantagenet Ancestry: A Study in Colonial And Medieval Families, Genealogical Publishing, 2011, p. 370. In 1511, Gardiner, aged 28, met Erasmus in Paris.Nichols's Epistles of Erasmus, ii. 12, 13 He had probably already begun his studies at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself in the classics, especially in Greek. He then devoted himself to canon and civil law, in which subjects he attained so great a proficiency that no one could dispute his pre-eminence. He received the degree of doctor of civil law in 1520, and of canon law in the following year. Diplomatic career Before long his abilities attracted the notice of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who made him his secretary,\\"Stephen Gardiner (1483 ‚Äì 1555), Bishop of Winchester\\", National Trust Collections and in this capacity he is said to have been with him at The More in Hertfordshire, when the conclusion of the celebrated Treaty of the More brought King Henry VIII and the French ambassadors there. This was probably the occasion on which he first came to the king's notice, but he does not appear to have been actively engaged in Henry's service till three years later. He undoubtedly acquired a knowledge of foreign politics in the service of Wolsey. In 1527 he and Sir Thomas More were named commissioners on the part of England, in arranging a treaty with the French ambassadors for the support of an army in Italy against Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. As a canon lawyer, he was sent to Orvieto in 1527 to secure a decretal commission from Pope Clement VII to allow the king's divorce case to be tried in England.Janelle, Pierre. Obedience in Church and State, Cambridge University Press, 2014 In 1535 he was also appointed ambassador to France,Bates, J. Barrington. \\"Stephen Gardiner's Explication and the Identity of the Church\\", Anglican and Episcopal History, Vol. 72, No. 1, March 2003 where he remained for three years.Collins, Brian M., \\"The Pomp of Two Bishops of Winchester when Travelling\\", Winchester Cathedral Role in the royal divorce That year he accompanied Wolsey on his important diplomatic mission to France, the splendour and magnificence of which have been graphically described by George Cavendish in his biography of Wolsey. Among the cardinal's retinue ‚Äì including several noblemen and privy councillors ‚Äì Gardiner alone seems to have understood the importance of this embassy. Henry was particularly anxious to cement his alliance with King Francis I of France, and gain support for his plans to divorce Catherine of Aragon. In the course of his progress through France, Wolsey received orders from Henry to send back his secretary, Gardiner, for fresh instructions. Wolsey was obliged to reply that he positively could not spare Gardiner as he was the only instrument he had in advancing the king's \\"Great Matter\\". The next year, Wolsey sent Gardiner and Edward Foxe, provost of King's College, Cambridge, to Italy to promote the same business with the pope. His dispatched messages have survived, and illustrate the competence with which Gardiner performed his duties. Gardiner's familiarity with canon law gave him a great advantage. He was instructed to procure a decretal commission from the pope, which was intended to construct principles of law by which Wolsey might render a decision on the validity of the king's marriage without appeal. Though supported by plausible pretexts, the demand was received as unusual and inadmissible. Pope Clement VII, who had been recently imprisoned in Castel Sant'Angelo by mutinous soldiers of the Holy Roman Empire, had managed to escape to Orvieto. Now fearful of offending Charles V, nephew of Queen Catherine, Clement refused to issue a definitive ruling concerning Henry's annulment.T.A.Morris, Europe and England in the Sixteenth Century, (Routledge 1998), p. 166 The matter was instead referred to his cardinals, with whom Gardiner held long debates. Gardiner's pleading was unsuccessful. Though the issue had not been specifically resolved, a general commission was granted, enabling Wolsey, along with Papal Legate, Cardinal Campeggio, to try the case in England. While grateful to the pope for the small concession, Wolsey viewed this as inadequate for the purpose in view. He urged Gardiner to press Clement VII further to deliver the desired decretal, even if it were only to be shown to the king and himself and then destroyed. Otherwise Wolsey feared he would lose his credit with Henry, who might be tempted to discard his allegiance to Rome. However, Clement VII made no further concessions at the time and Gardiner returned home. The two legates held their court under the guidelines of the general commission. King's secretary, conservative and absolutist Gardiner's seat, Winchester Cathedral. Gardiner was a conservative and an opponent of Anne Boleyn, Cranmer, Cromwell and of any innovation in the Church, although he acquiesced grudgingly in the steadily increasing influence of the Reformation on the royal counsels. A description of his character from George Cavendish declared him \\"a swarthy complexion, hooked nose, deep-set eyes, a permanent frown, huge hands and a vengeful wit. He was ambitious, sure of himself, irascible, astute, and worldly.\\"G. Cavendish, The Life of Wolsey (1557); Weir, p. 298 In early August 1529 he was appointed the king's secretary. He had already been archdeacon of Taunton for several years. The archdeaconries of Worcester and of Norfolk were also added to a list of pluralities before November 1529 and in March 1530 respectively; in April 1531 he resigned all three for that of Leicester. In 1530 the King demanded a precedent from Cambridge to procure the decision of the university as to the unlawfulness of marriage with a deceased brother's wife: in accordance with the new plan devised for settling the question without the pope's intervention. In this Gardiner succeeded. In November 1531 the king rewarded him with the bishopric of Winchester, vacant since Wolsey's death. The unexpected promotion was accompanied by expressions from the king which made it still more honourable, showing that if he had been subservient, it was not for the sake of his own advancement. Gardiner had, in fact, argued boldly with the king on some points, and Henry now reminded him of the fact. \\"I have often squared with you, Gardiner,\\" he said familiarly, \\"but I love you never the worse, as the bishopric I give will convince you.\\" In 1532, nevertheless, he displeased the king by taking part in the preparation of the \\"Answer of the Ordinaries\\" to the complaints brought against them in the House of Commons. On this subject he wrote to the king in his own defence. Thomas Cranmer became an enemy of Gardiner. Gardiner was not exactly, as is often said, one of Thomas Cranmer's assessors, but, according to Cranmer's own expression, \\"assistant\\" to him as counsel for the king, when the archbishop, in the absence of Queen Catherine, pronounced her marriage with Henry null and void on 23 May 1533. Immediately afterwards he was sent to Marseilles, where an interview between the pope and Francis I took place in September. Henry was deeply suspicious, as Francis, ostensibly his ally, had previously maintained the justice of his cause in the matter of the divorce. It was at this interview that Edmund Bonner intimated the appeal of Henry VIII to a general council in case the pope should venture to proceed to sentence against him. This appeal, and another on behalf of Cranmer presented with it, were drawn up by Gardiner. In 1535 he and other bishops were called upon to vindicate the king's new title of \\"Supreme Head of the Church of England.\\" The result was his celebrated treatise De vera obedientia, the ablest of all the vindications of royal supremacy. \\"Princes ought to be obeyed\\", wrote Gardiner, \\"by the commandment of God; yea, and to be obeyed without question\\". He certainly believed in the semi-divinity of kings, and the divine majesty's right to rule as if the King's law was God's law.De Vera Obedientia; John Scarisbrick, Henry VIII; Weir, Henry VIII, p. 19 In the same year he had a dispute with Cranmer about the visitation of his diocese. He was also employed to answer the pope's brief threatening to deprive Henry of his kingdom. During the next few years he took part in various embassies to France and Germany. He was often so abroad, having little influence on the king's councils; but in 1539 he took part in the enactment of the Six Articles, which led to the resignation of Bishops Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton and the persecution of the Protestant party. In 1540, on the execution of Thomas Cromwell he was elected chancellor of the University of Cambridge. A few years later he attempted, in concert with others, to fasten a charge of heresy upon Archbishop Cranmer in connection with the Six Articles and but for the personal intervention of the king he would probably have succeeded. Despite having supported royal supremacy, he was a thorough opponent of the Reformation from a doctrinal point of view, and is thought to have been a leader of the Prebendaries' Plot against Cranmer. He had not approved of Henry's general treatment of the church, especially during the ascendancy of Cromwell. In 1544 a relation of his, named German Gardiner, whom he employed as his secretary, was executed for treason in reference to the king's supremacy, and his enemies insinuated to the king that he himself was of his secretary's way of thinking. The king had need of him quite as much as he had of Cranmer; for it was Gardiner, who even under royal supremacy, was anxious to prove that England had not fallen away from the faith, while Cranmer's authority as primate was necessary to upholding that supremacy. Thus Gardiner and the archbishop maintained opposite sides of the king's church policy; and though Gardiner was encouraged by the king to put up articles against the archbishop for heresy, the archbishop could always rely on the king's protection in the end. Protestantism was gaining ground in high places, especially after the king's marriage to Catherine Parr; the Queen herself was nearly committed for it at one time, when Gardiner, with the king's approbation, censured some of her expressions in conversation. Just after her marriage, four men of the Court were condemned at Windsor and three of them were burned. The fourth, who was the theologian and composer John Merbecke, was pardoned by Gardiner's procurement, who said he was \\"but a musician\\". Edward VI's reign Bishop Gardiner's Conference with Lady Jane Grey, from the Victorian Pictorial Tower of London. Great as Gardiner's influence had been with Henry VIII, his name was omitted from the king's will, though Henry was believed to have intended making him one of his executors. Henry had made provision in his will for a 16 man Council to rule England during his son Edward's minority (Edward VI). Gardiner was excluded from this Council. Edward Seymour, a brother of Jane Seymour, seized power as Protector Somerset and he and his Council introduced radical protestant reforms. Gardiner completely opposed these reforms. Between the time of Henry VIII's death in January 1547 and the end of that year, Gardiner wrote at least 25 indignant letters arguing that the reforms were both theologically wrong and unconstitutional. Most of these letters were addressed to Somerset.The Letters of Stephen Gardiner, ed. Muller, James Arthur,Cambridge University Press 2013 He resisted the visitation of his Winchester diocese by the ecclesiastical authorities.The Letters of Stephen Gardiner, ed. Muller, James Arthur, Cambridge University Press 2013 p. 396 His remonstrances resulted in imprisonment in the Fleet, and the visitation of his diocese was held during his incarceration. Although soon released, he was summoned before the council, which demanded an explanation. Refusing to answer satisfactorily on some points, Gardiner was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Eventually he was given a lengthy appearance before the Privy Council, beginning in December 1550 and, in February 1551 he was deprived of his bishopric and returned to the Tower where he remained for the rest of the reign (a further two years). The Letters of Stephen Gardiner, op.cit. During this time he unsuccessfully requested his acknowledged right as one of the Lords Spiritual to appear before the House of Lords. His bishopric was given to John Ponet, a chaplain of Cranmer's, translated from the bishopric of Rochester. Mary I's reign Queen Mary, by Hans Eworth At the accession of Queen Mary I, the Duke of Norfolk and other state prisoners of high rank were in the Tower along with Gardiner; but the Queen, on her first entry into London, set them all free. Gardiner was restored to his Bishopric and appointed Lord Chancellor, and he placed the crown on the Queen's head at her coronation. He also opened her first parliament and for some time was her leading councillor. He was now also called upon, in old age, to undo not a little of the work in which he had been instrumental in his earlier years ‚Äì to demonstrate the legitimacy of the Queen's birth and the legality of her mother's marriage, to restore the old religion, and to recant his own words touching the royal supremacy. It is said that he wrote a formal Palinodia or retractation of his book De vera obedientia; but the reference is probably to his sermon at the start of Advent, 1554, after Cardinal (later Archbishop of Canterbury) Reginald Pole had absolved the kingdom from schism. As chancellor he had the onerous task of negotiating the Queen's marriage treaty with Philip II of Spain, for which he shared a general repugnance. In executing it, he took care to make the terms as advantageous for England as possible, with express provision that the Spaniards should in nowise be allowed to interfere in the government of the country. After the appointment of Cardinal Pole, and the reconciliation of the realm to the see of Rome, he still remained in high favour. How far he was responsible for the persecutions which afterwards arose is open to debate. He no doubt approved of the act, which passed the House of Lords while he presided there as chancellor, for the revival of the heresy laws. Gardiner's chantry tomb in Winchester Cathedral. There is no doubt that he sat in judgment on Bishop John Hooper, and on several other preachers whom he condemned to be degraded from the priesthood. The natural consequence of this was that when they declined, even as laymen, to be reconciled to the Roman Church, they were handed over to the secular power to be burned. In his diocese no victim of the persecution is known to have suffered until after his death; and, much as he was already maligned by opponents, there is much to show that his personality was generous and humane. In May 1555 he went to Calais as one of the English commissioners to promote peace with France; but their efforts were ineffectual. In October 1555 he again opened parliament as Lord Chancellor, but towards the end of the month he fell ill and grew rapidly worse until he died. Death Bishop Gardiner died at Westminster on 12 November 1555. He was temporarily buried in a vault at the church of St Mary Overie, and in February 1556 his body was conveyed to Winchester Cathedral, where, after a number of ceremonies, a final funeral service was conducted on 28 February 1556, at which time it was recorded that he had not been buried and that no ground was broken, in the expectation that in due course his executors would build a chapel within the cathedral for his incarceration.Heralds' Account of Gardiner's Obsequies, College of Arms, cited in The Letters of Stephen Gardiner, op.cit. pp.502-517 Some claim that his last words were Erravi cum Petro, sed non flevi cum Petro (Like Peter, I have erred, unlike Peter, I have not wept).Latham, Edward. Famous Sayings and their Authors, 2d ed. London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., 1906, p.240. Fictional portrayals Bishop Gardiner is a character in the Fifth Queen trilogy by Ford Madox Ford. Gardiner is a prominent character in Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall, Bring Up the Bodies and The Mirror and the Light, where he appears as an implacable opponent of Thomas Cromwell. In the Wolf Hall television series, Gardiner is portrayed by Mark Gatiss. Gardiner is the villain in Alison MacLeod's 1965 historical novel The Heretic, a biography of the Protestant martyr Anne Askew, in whose execution Gardiner was the main instigator. Gardiner is played by Terence Rigby in the 1998 film Elizabeth, where he is portrayed as a villainous bishop who took part in the Ridolfi plot and who vehemently opposed Elizabeth I's Act of Uniformity; in reality, Gardiner had died before Elizabeth ascended the throne. A more accurate portrayal of Gardiner can be seen in the BBC dramas The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Elizabeth R (in both of which he is played by Basil Dignam). In The Tudors television series Gardiner is played by Simon Ward.

The wedding of Alexander and Roxane by Andr√© Castaigne (1898-1899).  Biography  Roxana was born in c. 340 BC as the daughter of a Bactrian nobleman named Oxyartes, who served Bessus, the satrap of Bactria and Sogdia. He was thus probably also involved in the murder of the last Achaemenid king Darius III. After Bessus was captured by the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great, Oxyartes and his family continued to resist the Greeks, and along with other Iranian notables such as the Sogdian warlord Spitamenes, took up a defensive position in a fortress known as the Sogdian Rock. However, they were eventually defeated by Alexander, who reportedly fell in love with Roxana on sight; in 327 BC, Alexander married Roxana despite the strong opposition from all his companions and generals. Alexander thereafter made an expedition into India and while there he appointed Oxyartes as the governor of the Hindu Kush region which was adjoining India. During this period, Roxana was in a safe place in Susa. When Alexander returned to Susa, he promoted a brother of Roxana to the elite cavalry.

Roxana and her son, named Alexander IV after his deceased father, were protected by Alexander's mother, Olympias, in Macedonia. Olympias' assassination in 316 BC allowed Cassander, who imprisoned Roxana and Alexander in the citadel of Amphipolis under the supervision of Glaucias, to seek kingship. Since Alexander IV was the legitimate heir to the Alexandrian empire, Cassander ordered Glaucias to poison Alexander and Roxana c. 310 BC.

Biography Alcock was born at Beverley in Yorkshire, son of Sir William Alcock, Burgess of Kingston upon Hull and educated at Cambridge. In 1461 he was made dean of St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, and his subsequent promotion was rapid in both church and state. In the following year he was made Master of the Rolls,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 88 and in 1470 was sent as ambassador to the court of Castile. He was nominated to the see of Rochester on 8 January 1472 and consecrated Bishop of Rochester on 15 MarchFryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 268 and was successively translated to the see of Worcester on 15 July 1476Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 280 and the see of Ely on 6 October 1486.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 245 He was the first president of the Council of the Marches in Wales from 1473 to 1500. He twice held the office of Lord Chancellor, once from June 1475 to September 1475 and then again from October 1485 to March 1487. Alcock was one of the leading pre-Reformation divines; he was a man of deep learning and also of great proficiency as an architect. Besides founding a charity at Beverley and a grammar school at Kingston upon Hull, he restored many churches and colleges; but his greatest achievement was the building of Jesus College, Cambridge, which he established on the site of the former Convent of St Radegund. Alcock was appointed to the Council in 1470 and became Master of the Rolls in 1471, soon after being appointed tutor to King Edward IV's eldest son, Prince Edward. After the King's death he was with Prince Edward when he was intercepted by Richard, Duke of Gloucester, at Stony Stratford. Alcock was arrested and removed from office but soon rejoined the Council. He was with King Richard III when he entered York in August 1483 and was a member of the English delegation that met the Scots at Nottingham. Later Alcock was one of several clerics who openly canvassed the proposition that Henry Tudor marry Elizabeth of York. Appointed temporary Lord Chancellor he opened King Henry VII's first Parliament on 7 November 1485 and became one of the new king's most trusted servants. Alcock died on 1 October 1500 and lies buried in the Alcock Chantry in Ely Cathedral. Princes in the Tower Valerie Anand, a believer in the innocence of Richard III in the matter of The Princes in the Tower, points out that Alcock, the tutor of Edward V, never quarrelled with Richard III, either publicly or privately, but chose to \\"continue to work serenely beside Richard\\".Anand, Valerie Crown of Roses (1989), p. 404 This would have been unthinkable if Alcock had any reason at all to suspect that King Richard had done any harm at all to young Edward.

Engraving by Simon de Passe Sir Robert Naunton (1563 ‚Äì 27 March 1635) was an English writer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1606 and 1626. Family Robert Naunton was the son of Henry Naunton of Alderton, Suffolk, and Elizabeth Asheby of Hornsby, Leicestershire. According to Schreiber, the Nauntons were 'established members of the county gentry and had been so for well over two centuries'. Robert Naunton's grandfather, William Naunton, was trained as a lawyer and married Elizabeth Wingfield, the daughter Sir Anthony Wingfield, a trusted servant of Henry VIII. William Naunton was a Member of Parliament, and one of the principal officers of the King's brother-in-law, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and later of his widow, Katherine Willoughby, Duchess of Suffolk.Naunton, William (by 1511-52/53), of Alderton, Suffolk, History of Parliament Retrieved 19 August 2013. Robert Naunton's father, Henry, served as Master of Horse to the Dowager Duchess, while his maternal uncle, William Ashby,Ashby, William (d.1593), of Clerkenwell, Middlesex, History of Parliament Retrieved 19 August 2013. was a member of the diplomatic service under Queen Elizabeth. Career He was educated at Norwich School and Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming a fellow of his college in 1585 and public orator of the university in 1594.Harries et al. (1991), p. 175 Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, commissioned him to spend some time abroad, sending information about European affairs. On his return, Naunton was elected Member of Parliament for Helston at a by-election in 1606. In 1614 Naunton was knighted and in 1616 became Master of Requests and later surveyor of the court of wards. In December 1617 his friend George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham procured for him the position of Secretary of State on the condition of his making Christopher Villiers, Buckingham's brother, his heir, and during his lifetime Villiers gained from Naunton estates worth ¬£500 a year.A. F. Pollard, revised by Sean Kelsey, 'Villiers, Christopher, first earl of Anglesey (d. 1630), courtier', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, dated October 2006, accessed 1 January 2011 In 1621 Naunton was elected MP for Cambridge University. His strong Protestant opinions led him to favour more active intervention by England in the interests of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and more vigorous application of the laws against Roman Catholics. Naunton was censured after the Spanish ambassador, Gondomar, complained to King James I. Consequently, in January 1623, Naunton resigned as Secretary of State and was made master of the Court of Wards and Liveries. Sir Robert was re-elected MP for Cambridge University in 1624 and 1625. He was elected MP for Suffolk in 1626. Naunton died at Letheringham, Suffolk at the age of 71. Marriages and issue Penelope Naunton (circle of Anthony van Dyck) Naunton married secondly Penelope Perrot, widow of the astronomer Sir William Lower, and daughter of Sir Thomas Perrot and Dorothy Devereux, daughter of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex.Lower, Sir William (c.1570-1615), of St. Winnow, Cornwall and Trefenti (Tra'Venti), Llanfihangel Abercowin, Carmarthenshire, History of Parliament Retrieved 19 August 2013.Trefenty, Dyfed Archaeological Trust Retrieved 19 August 2013. Naunton's daughter Penelope married firstly Paul Bayning, 2nd Viscount Bayning (son of Paul Bayning, 1st Viscount Bayning), and secondly Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke in his first marriage, by whom he became the grandfather of William Herbert, 6th Earl of Pembroke. Works Naunton's account of Queen Elizabeth's reign was still in manuscript when he died. As Fragmenta regalia, written by Sir Robert Naunton, it was printed in 1641 and again in 1642, a revised edition Fragmenta Regalia, or Observations on the late Queen Elizabeth, her Times and Favourites, being issued in 1653. It was again published in 1824, and an edition edited by Edward Arber was brought out in 1870. It has also been printed in several collections and has been translated into French and Italian. There are several manuscript copies extant, and some of Naunton's letters are in the British Museum and in other collections. A modern critical edition was prepared by J. S. Cerovski and published in 1985. He is the source for Elizabeth's rebuke to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester: \\"by God there shall be one mistress here and no master\\". He is also noted for his judgement of Henry VIII \\"He never spared a man in his anger or a woman in his lust\\". He was largely responsible for the claim that Sir John Perrot, his wife's grandfather, was Henry VIII's natural son.

The first stadium built for use by a Football League club, it was one of the first British grounds to have floodlights installed and hosted some of the earliest European club games in the 1950s. At the time of its multi-million pound renovation in the early 1990s, Molineux was one of the biggest and most modern stadia in England, though it has since been eclipsed by other ground developments. The stadium has hosted England internationals and, more recently, England under-21 internationals, as well as the first UEFA Cup Final in 1972. Molineux is a 32,050 all-seater stadium, but it consistently attracted much greater attendances when it was mostly terracing. The record attendance is 61,315. Plans were announced in 2010 for a ¬£40 million redevelopment programme to rebuild and link three sides of the stadium to increase capacity to 38,000 seats. The first stage of this project, the Stan Cullis Stand, was completed in 2012. The next two stages were postponed because the club prioritised funds for development of the youth academy.Molineux Stadium Guide. There are provisional plans for a longer term redevelopment of every stand that could create a 50,000 capacity. Stadium The stadium is a few hundred yards north of Wolverhampton city centre, at the far side of the city's ring road, and is a prominent building due to its size in an area with predominantly low-rise buildings. It consists of four stands: the Steve Bull Stand (formerly the John Ireland Stand), the Sir Jack Hayward Stand (formerly the Jack Harris Stand), the Stan Cullis Stand and the Billy Wright Stand. Both the Billy Wright and Stan Cullis Stands feature statues of each man in front of them and on 14 June 2018, a statue of Sir Jack Hayward was also unveiled near to the stand bearing his name. The total seated capacity of the stands is approximately 31,500, with a temporary seating area lifting the present official capacity to 32,050. The current stadium design stems from the early 1990s when it was extensively redeveloped to become a modern all-seater venue in accordance with the Taylor Report, which required British football stadia to provide seating for all those attending. In the days before seating regulations, the ground could hold more than 60,000 spectators; the record attendance for a match at the ground is 61,315 for a Football League First Division game against Liverpool on 11 February 1939. The 1940s and 1950s saw average attendances for seasons regularly exceed 40,000, coinciding with the club's peak on the field. Molineux has hosted England internationals. The first was a 6‚Äì1 win over Ireland on 7 March 1891. England again beat Ireland, this time 4‚Äì0, on 14 February 1903 and lost to Wales 2‚Äì1 on 5 February 1936. The last was a 5‚Äì2 defeat of Denmark in a 1958 World Cup qualifier on 5 December 1956. It has also hosted four England under-21 internationals (in 1996, 2008, 2014 and 2018) and, in 2005, hosted some European Youth Championship qualifying matches. On 24 June 2003, Molineux also became Wolverhampton's biggest live concert venue, with Bon Jovi performing in front of 34,000 people. Up until May 2011, the ground had a capacity of 29,400. However the 5,500 Stan Cullis Stand was knocked down for redevelopment and 230 seats in the lower tier of the Steve Bull Stand were taken out as part of the process taking temporary capacity down to 23,670. The lower tier of the new North Bank (holding 4,000) was opened for use in September 2011 for the team's second home game of the season, which took the stadium capacity up to 27,670. The upper tier on the new stand (3,700 seats) was completed by the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season, taking the overall capacity of the stadium up to 31,700. However the club have delayed the second phase of the redevelopment in rebuilding the Steve Bull Stand. Following relegation from the top flight in 2012, the South-West Corner was dismantled until regaining promotion six years later. History =Origins= The Molineux name originates from Benjamin Molineux, a successful local merchant (and a distant relative of the now extinct Earls of Sefton) who, in 1744, purchased land on which he built Molineux House (later converted to the Molineux Hotel) and on which the stadium would eventually be built. The estate was purchased in 1860 by O.E. McGregor, who converted the land into a pleasure park open to the public. Molineux Grounds, as it was titled, included a wide range of facilities including an ice rink, a cycling track, a boating lake, and, most crucially, an area for football. The grounds were sold to the Northampton Brewery in 1889, who rented its use to Wolverhampton Wanderers, who had previously played at Dudley Road. After renovating the site, the first-ever league game was staged on 7 September 1889 in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Notts County before a crowd of 4,000. Wolves bought the freehold in 1923 for ¬£5,607 (¬£303,338.70 in 2018 prices) and soon set about constructing a major grandstand on the Waterloo Road side (designed by Archibald Leitch). In 1932, the club also built a new stand on the Molineux Street side and followed this by adding a roof to the South Bank two years later. The stadium finally now had four stands, which formed Molineux for the next half-century. The South Bank Stand terraces were one of the largest goal stands in Britain. In 1953, the club became one of the first in Britain to install floodlights, at a cost of around ¬£10,000 (¬£274,000 in 2018 prices). The first-ever floodlit game was held on 30 September 1953, as Wolves won 3‚Äì1 against South Africa. The referee for this match was Mr. F Read of Willenhall. The addition of the floodlights opened the door for Molineux to host a series of midweek friendlies against teams from across the globe. In the days prior to the formation of the European Cup and international club competitions, these games were highly prestigious and gained huge crowds and interest, the BBC often televising such events. A new taller set of floodlights were later installed in 1957, at a cost of ¬£25,000 (¬£595,000 in 2018 prices), as the stadium prepared to host its first European Cup games. =Further redevelopment and decline= In 1958, plans were unveiled to rebuild Molineux into a 70,000 capacity stadium during the early 1960s, but these were rejected by the local council and there were no major changes at the stadium for another 20 years. The Molineux Street Stand (by now all-seater) failed to meet the standards of the 1975 Safety of Sports Grounds Act. The club set about building a new stand behind the existing one, on land where housing had been demolished. The new stand, designed by architects Atherden and Rutter, had a 9,348 capacity, equipped with 42 executive boxes, although sporting red seats in contrast to the club's traditional colours. When the construction was complete, the old stand lying in front was demolished, leaving the stand some 100 ft from the touchline. This new stand, named the John Ireland Stand (after the then-club president), was opened on 25 August 1979 at the start of a First Division game against Ipswich Town. This was intended as the first phase of a complete reconstruction of the ground, which would have given it a 40,000 capacity by 1984 and made it the first completely rebuilt stadium in postwar league football. However, the John Ireland Stand was the only phase of this project which would become reality. Further redevelopment was still a decade away. In 1981, plans were unveiled for further redevelopment at the stadium which would have cost more than ¬£4million and involved five-a-side football pitches, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, and an eight-lane running track. However, these were soon scrapped due to rising debts. The John Ireland Stand (renamed as The Steve Bull Stand in 2003), completed in 1979, had cost ¬£2.5 million (¬£13,675,000 in 2018 prices) and had been one of the most expensive developments at any football ground in the U.K. The cost of the stand's construction plunged Wolves deep into debt and the club narrowly avoided liquidation in 1982, when it was taken over by a group fronted by former player Derek Dougan. By the time Wolves slid into the Football League Fourth Division in 1986, the John Ireland Stand and the South Bank terrace were the only sections of the ground in use, after new safety laws implemented following the Bradford City stadium fire forced the closure of the North Bank and Waterloo Road Stand, which had become very dilapidated. Additionally, attendances had fallen due to the club's on-the-field decline. The club's perilous financial situation meant the stadium fell into ruin, with no funding either for repairs or to move the pitch. The club was saved from folding in August 1986 when Wolverhampton Council bought the ground for ¬£1,120,000 (¬£3,236,800 in 2018 prices), along with the surrounding land, while Gallagher Estates, in conjunction with the Asda Superstore chain, agreed to pay off the outstanding debt ‚Äì subject to building and planning permission for a superstore being granted. Although the stadium continued in use, the disused sections were never reopened. =Present-day stadium= The takeover of the club and stadium by Sir Jack Hayward in 1990 paved the way for redevelopment, which was further prompted by legislation following the Taylor Report that outlawed terraces which affected Premier League and Division One stadiums from the 1993‚Äì94 season. The North Bank terrace was demolished in October 1991 and the new Stan Cullis Stand was completed in August 1992, in time for the 1992‚Äì93 season. Next came the demolition of the Waterloo Road Stand, with the new Billy Wright Stand opening in August 1993. The final phase of the redevelopment came in December 1993, when the new Jack Harris Stand was opened on the site of the South Bank terrace. The newly renovated stadium was officially opened on 7 December 1993, in a friendly with Honv√©d, the Hungarian team who had been beaten in one of Molineux's most famous original floodlit friendlies. Steve Bull stand, Molineux Stadium, 28 April 2018 In 2003, the John Ireland Stand was renamed the Steve Bull Stand (in honour of the club's record goalscorer) and, at the same time, the south-west corner of the ground was filled with 900 temporary seats, known as the Graham Hughes Stand, which, until their removal in the summer of 2006, raised the Molineux capacity to 29,400. This seating area ‚Äì now officially named the Wolves Community Trust Stand ‚Äì was again added on the club's return to the top flight in 2009, which lifted the capacity to 29,195 before the club began its redevelopment of the stadium in summer 2011. In August 2015, the Jack Harris Stand was renamed the Sir Jack Hayward Stand in honour of Steve Morgan's predecessor as the club's owner, who had died earlier that year. The record attendance for the stadium in its current configuration is 31,746, which was achieved against Liverpool on 23 January 2020 in the Premier League. Current redevelopment The partially built Stan Cullis stand in October 2011 Plans were announced in May 2010 to begin an extensive multi-million pound programme of redevelopment to enlarge the stadium's capacity and develop its facilities. A full application for planning permission was submitted in September 2010, and granted three months later. Phase 1 of this process was confirmed in February 2011, and commenced on 23 May 2011 as demolition of the Stan Cullis Stand began. In its place a new two-tier stand (seating 7,798), complete with mega-store, museum, caf√© and hospitality facilities, was planned for the 2012‚Äì13 season which extended around into the north-east corner. This phase, costing an estimated ¬£18 million, was carried out by contractors the Buckingham Group. By September 2011 the lower tier was opened to fans, permitting a temporary stadium capacity of 27,828. The stand was fully opened on 11 August 2012 for the club's first fixture of the 2012‚Äì13 season, creating a new official stadium capacity of 31,700. Phase 2 will be the rebuilding of the Steve Bull Stand over a two-season period. Work was initially set to begin in summer 2012, but has since been postponed with no revised start date yet set. In January 2013 club owner Steve Morgan stated the club would prioritise the redevelopment of its academy facilities over the stadium. At the conclusion of this stage stadium capacity would reach around 36,000 and see this stand connected to the new Stan Cullis Stand. Proceeding with this second stage would raise the redevelopment spend to in excess of ¬£40 million. Phase 3 is subject to demand and finance, but is planned to be the construction of a new top-tier on the Sir Jack Hayward Stand, that will connect it to the new Steve Bull Stand. This would bring capacity up to around 38,000. Phase 4 is a tentative plan to completely redevelop the Billy Wright Stand in a move that would bring capacity to 50,000. However, no planning permission will yet be sought for this phase and it remains only a potential, rather than planned, development with no timeframe in place.

He served as the Spanish ambassador to England from 1613 to 1622 and afterwards, as a kind of ambassador emeritus, Spain's leading expert on English affairs until his death.Charles H. Carter, \\"Gondomar: Ambassador to James I\\" The Historical Journal 7.2 (1964), pp. 189-208. The popular notion in England of his day painted him as the head of a Spanish faction at the English court, as privy to the inner thoughts of King James I, and as a fiendish schemer for Popery (for whom the term \\"Machiavellian\\" was brought into common English usage). Early life Baiona He was the eldest son of the Galician knight Garcia Sarmiento de Soutomaior ‚ÄîLord of Salvaterra de Mi√±o, who served as corregidor of Toro and governor of the Canary Islands‚Äî and of Juana de Acu√±a, heiress of the noble house of Acu√±a. He was born in Astorga, near Galicia, inheriting large estates both in Galicia and in Old Castile. He took an active part during the Anglo-Spanish War in repelling an English raid led by Sir Francis Drake on Baiona and Vigo in 1585. They met forces again four years later in Vigo, after the \\"English Armada\\" was turned away in A Coru√±a and Lisbon; there Drake was rejected but not before the bombing and sack of the town. As a result of these military successes, he was appointed by King Philip II of Spain as governor of Baiona, and keeper of the fortress of Monte Real, so warding the southern frontier and sea coast of Galicia. Later, in 1596, he was appointed first corregidor of Toro, and later of Valladolid, then the residence and capital of King Philip III. From that moment he was forced to reconcile both roles, as courtier and corregidor in the capital, and as soldier and Capitan in Galicia: in 1603 he was sent from court to Vigo to superintend the distribution of the treasure brought from America by two galleons which were driven to take refuge there; on his return he was appointed a member of the board of finance. In 1609 he repelled a Dutch naval attack on the coast of Galicia. Although he held both military and administrative employs, his residence was at Valladolid, where he owned the Casa del Sol estate and was already collecting his fine library. He was known as a courtier, and apparently as a friend of the favourite, the Duke of Lerma. In 1612 he was appointed ambassador in England, but he did not leave to take up his appointment until May 1613. The embassy to London Gondomar's reputation as a diplomat, which brought him to international historical prominence, is based on his two periods of service in England ‚Äì from 1613 to 1618 and from 1619 to 1622. The excellence of his latinity pleased the literary tastes of King James I, whose character he judged with remarkable insight. He flattered the king's love of books and of peace, and he made skillful use of the king's desire for a matrimonial alliance between the Prince of Wales and the infanta Maria Anna of Spain (the proposed \\"Spanish Match\\"). The British historian J. P. Kenyon calls him \\"a cleverer man than any in England\\", who was gifted enough to tie England to Spain's interests for the next decade. The ambassador's task in the prelude to the Thirty Years' War was to keep James from aiding the Protestant states against Spain and Habsburg Austria, and to avert English attacks on Spanish possessions in the Americas. His success made him odious to the anti-Spanish and Puritan parties. The active part he took in promoting the execution of Sir Walter Raleigh aroused particular animosity. He was attacked by popular pamphleteers ‚Äî Thomas Scott's extravagant propaganda, Vox populi, was widely believed ‚Äî and the dramatist Thomas Middleton made him a principal character in the strange political play A Game at Chess, which was suppressed by order of the council. Portrait of Gondomar, engraving by Simon de Passe, 1622 The Howards were Gondomar's principal friends at court ‚Äì Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton (died 1614), Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, Lord High Treasurer, whose daughter was married to James's favourite, Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral, Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, and their prot√©g√©s. The \\"Howard faction\\" preferred a marriage alliance with Spain over one with France, the traditional ally of Scotland, and they preferred to keep out of open warfare with Spain promoted by the more zealous Puritans. Most of the Howards were Catholics, encouraging them towards a spirit of toleration at home. Like many at the English court, they were receiving pensions from Spain,Carter 1964:193, 195. The pensions had been instituted with the first Spanish embassy to James, to the annual tune of ¬£9125. Gondomar, with an English reputation as a spymaster, actually spent a paltry average of ¬£350 for information. without much effect on their opinions and actions, and Gondomar seldom had the money to follow through. Among the pensioners, in an embarrassing list that surfaced in 1613, at Gondomar's first arrival was the King of England himself. Gondomar conceived of his embassy as a sortie in enemy country, and he took for his maxim aventurar la vida y osar morir (\\"risk your life and dare to die\\"). His opening challenge was his refusal to strike the colours of Spain at his warships' entry to Portsmouth harbour, in which an appeal to the king averted an exchange of cannon fire. His handling of the unconditional release of the Catholic agitator Luisa Carvajal y Mendoza further established him in James's eyes as a man of unexpected strengths. In 1617 Sarmiento was created Count of Gondomar. The key to Gondomar's success was his relationship with James, whom he brought to admire and like his witty and learned companionship, his candour, within the obvious limits, and his personal integrity. They called themselves the \\"two Diegos\\" and drank from the same bottle (Carter 1964:205). It was to Gondomar, after the failure of the Addled Parliament of 1614, that James made his celebrated remark \\"I am amazed that my ancestors should have allowed such an institution to come into existence\\". A key program for Gondomar at the outset was to block the marriage negotiations between Prince Charles and a sister of Louis XIII of France, a French counterweight to marital alliances being concluded with the Spanish Habsburgs (see the Spanish Match). In the matter of Sir Walter Raleigh, it was Gondomar's pressure that cost Sir Walter his head on 29 October 1618. In a moment of weakness, James had shown Gondomar the contract under which Raleigh had sailed, and the restriction upon attacking Spanish settlements, in order to mollify Gondomar's objections to an enterprise on which James had set his heart. Raleigh's attack on San Thom√© (near modern Ciudad Guayana) was a public violation; his execution kept the peace with Spain. The English could not forgive Gondomar, who in 1618 obtained leave to come home for his health, but he was then ordered to return by way of Flanders and France with a diplomatic mission. In 1619 he returned to London and remained until 1622. The Guyana expedition of Roger North in 1620 seemed to be a repeat of Raleigh's violation of Spanish settlements in the Caribbean, and at Gondomar's insistence, North was imprisoned. The tensest late confrontation was over Count Mansfeld's projected movement of troops raised in England to rescue James's son-in-law Frederick V, Elector Palatine, the \\"Winter King\\" of Bohemia. Habsburg Madrid and Brussels were concerned that the French aimed to join Mansfeld's forces and retrieve Artois for France, and the project was let slide. When Gondomar was allowed to retire and return to Spain, he was named a member of the royal council and governor of one of the king's palaces, and he was appointed to a complimentary mission to Vienna. Gondomar was in Madrid when the Prince of Wales-- afterwards Charles I-- made his journey there in search of a wife. He died at the house of the Constable of Castile, near Haro in the Rioja. Gondomar was twice married, first to his niece Beatrix Sarmiento, by whom he had no children, and then to his cousin Constanza de Acu√±a, by whom he had four sons and three daughters. The hatred he aroused in England, which was shown by widespread mockery of an intestinal complaint from which he suffered for years, was a tribute to the zeal with which he served his own master. Gondomar collected, both before he came to London and during his residence there, a fine library of printed books and manuscripts. Orders for the arrangement, binding and storing of his books in his house at Valladolid appear frequently in his voluminous correspondence. In 1785 the library was ceded by his descendant and representative the marquis of Malpica to Charles III of Spain, and it is now in the Royal Library at Madrid. A portrait of Gondomar, attributed to Diego Vel√°zquez, was formerly at Stowe, Buckinghamshire. It was mezzotinted by Robert Cooper. Gondomar and the Galician language Gondomar, Galicia: Don Diego Sarmiento de Acu√±a, 1st Count of Gondomar, diplomatic, defender of the Galician language, and lover of Galicia Part of the private correspondence of Gondomar with his relatives and with other Galician noblemen have been preserved in the archives of the house of Alba. These private letters are frequently written totally or partially in Galician, and represent an invaluable source for the knowledge of this language in the transition from Old Galician to Middle Galician, a period for which there are but a few literary or public documents preserved. Gondomar is also well known for his Galician patriotic writings in defence of the antiquity and noblesse of the Kingdom of Galicia and of the Galicians, because 'Galicia was a Kingdom and her kings got this title well before any other in Spain'. 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Authorities Gondomar's missions to England were largely dealt with in Samuel Rawson Gardiner's History of England (London, 1883-1884) and more recently in Glyn Redworth, The Prince and the Infanta: The Cultural Politics of the Spanish Match (New Haven, 2003). In Spanish, Don Pascual de Gayangos wrote a useful biographical introduction to a publication of a few of his letters ‚Äì Cinco Cartas politico-literarias de Don Diego Sarmiento de Acu√±a, conde de Gondomar, issued at Madrid in 1869 by the Sociedad de Bibli√≥filos of the Spanish Academy; and there is a life in English by F.H.

It resembles similar species found in Africa, Eurasia and North America, including the black-winged kite, a species that has in the past also been called \\"black-shouldered kite\\". Measuring around in length with a wingspan of , the adult black-shouldered kite has predominantly grey-white plumage and prominent black markings above its red eyes. It gains its name from the black patches on its wings. The primary call is a clear whistle, uttered in flight and while hovering. It can be confused with the related letter-winged kite in Australia, which is distinguished by the striking black markings under its wings. The species forms monogamous pairs, breeding between August and January. The birds engage in aerial courtship displays which involve high circling flight and ritualised feeding mid-air. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days. Chicks are fully fledged within five weeks of hatching and can hunt for mice within a week of leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the home territory. The black- shouldered kite hunts in open grasslands, searching for its prey by hovering and systematically scanning the ground. It mainly eats small rodents, particularly the introduced house mouse, and has benefitted from the modification of the Australian landscape by agriculture. It is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of \\"Endangered species.\\" Taxonomy Illustration in John Gould's Birds of Australia, 1840s The black-shouldered kite was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801, as Falco axillaris. Its specific name is derived from the Latin axilla, meaning \\"armpit\\", relating to the dark patches under the wings. He reported the description came from a bird that had been kept for two months in the early colony. The species description was based on one of four paintings by Australian painter Thomas Watling of a bird in the Sydney district in the 1790s. English naturalist John Gould described the same species as Elanus notatus in 1838 from a specimen from New South Wales, apparently unaware of Latham's description. English zoologist George Robert Gray followed Latham using the binomial Elanus axillaris in 1849. Gould conceded Latham's name was valid and hence had precedence, and E. notatus was reduced to synonymy. Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews argued that Latham's description mentioned black axillaries and hence must have referred to the letter-winged kite, and that Watling's drawings were inconclusive. He promoted the use of E. notatus over E. axillaris in 1916. This was followed for many years. But in 1980 Australian taxonomists Richard Schodde and Ian J. Mason refuted Mathews' claim that the original description of E. axillaris was ambiguous and reinstated the name. This has been followed by subsequent authorities. The black-shouldered kite is monotypic; no subspecies are recognised. \\"Black-shouldered kite\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). It has also been called the Australian black-shouldered kite to distinguish it from the Eurasian black- winged kite (E. caeruleus) and American white-tailed kite (E. leucurus)‚Äîboth formerly known as \\"black-shouldered kite\\". Watling had recorded the Dharug term Geo-ga-rack. In 1959, American ornithologist Kenneth C. Parkes noted that the plumage of the black-shouldered kite is similar to that of the black- winged and white-tailed kites, and proposed that all three were subspecies of a single cosmopolitan species E. caeruleus‚Äîmuch like the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Researchers William S. Clark and Richard C. Banks disputed this, pointing out the differences in anatomical proportions such as wing shape and tail length, and hunting behavior (E. caeruleus rarely hunts by hovering, unlike the other two species) and proposed the species be separated again in 1992. They are regarded as distinct in the IOC World Bird List. Molecular evidence shows that the black-shouldered kite and its relatives belong to a subfamily Elaninae that is an early offshoot within the raptor family Accipitridae. There is some evidence they are more divergent from other raptors and better placed in their own family. Description Immature bird with buff markings The adult black-shouldered kite is around in length, with a wingspan of between . The female is slightly heavier, weighing on average around compared to the male's average weight of . The sexes have similar plumage. The crown, neck and upperparts are pale grey, while the head and underparts are white. A black comma-shaped marking lies in front of and stretches over and behind the eye, which is deep red and surrounded by a black orbital ring. The leading edge of the outer wing is black. When perched, this gives the species its prominent black \\"shoulders\\". The central rectrices of the tail are pale grey, while the rest of the tail feathers are white. The bill is short with a sharp, hooked tip to the upper mandible. Its nostrils and the cere are bright or dull yellow and the bill is black. The legs and feet are also yellow or golden-yellow, and the feet have three toes facing forwards and one toe facing backwards. The juvenile has a white forehead and chin and rusty brown neck, nape and breast with darker streaks. The back and wings are mottled buff or brown. There is a less distinctive dark shoulder patch, but a larger comma-shaped patch over the eyes. The eyes themselves are dark brown. The bill is black with a horn-coloured cere. Black-shouldered kites spiral into the wind like a kestrel. They soar with v-shaped up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned, giving the tail a squarer appearance and visible 'fingers' on the wings. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern has been described as 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down. The black-shouldered kite is very similar to the related letter-winged kite (E. scriptus), but has the black mark above and behind the eye, a white rather than grey crown, and shows all-white underparts in flight except for the black markings on the shoulder, dark wingtips, and a small black patch on the underwing. It is slightly larger than the nankeen kestrel (Falco cenchroides). The latter species lacks wing markings and has pale brown plumage. It keeps its wings level when soaring, and has a faster wingbeat when hovering. The grey falcon (Falco hypoleucos) has somewhat similar coloration to the black-shouldered kite but is bulkier and heavier overall and lacks the black markings. Its wings are barred and it preys on birds. The grey goshawk (Accipiter novaehollandiae) has wider more rounded wings, underwing markings and glides with lowered wings. =Vocalisations= The black-shouldered kite is generally silent, except in the breeding season when its calls, though weak, can be persistent. It primarily utters a clear whistled chee, chee, chee call in flight and while hovering, or a hoarse wheezing skree-ah when perched. A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh scraping call is the most common call used by the female and large young, and brooding females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak. A variety of different calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh calls were made when a bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type calls were emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration \\"chatter\\" calls were given when a bird sighted a human near the enclosure. Distribution and habitat Flying with a mouse in its talons. Also showing small black underwing patches visible in flight Black-shouldered kites may be sedentary or nomadic, and are generally found in open grasslands or valleys where there are scattered clumps of trees, where the grass or groundcover is accessible from the air and ranges from 30 cm to 1.5 m (1‚Äì3 ft) high. As well as native grasslands they forage over pastures, cereal or vegetable crops and vineyards, often focusing on areas that have been recently harvested or ploughed and hence rendering prey more exposed. In urban areas they are encountered on the edge of towns on wasteland, irregularly mown areas, sports fields, golf courses or grassy roadside verges. They also hunt over coastal dunes and drier marshland, but avoid areas with dense cover such as forest as well as bare or rocky ground. Their numbers fluctuate during drought and floods, and can be irruptive in response to sudden increases in mouse populations. The most distant banding recovery was from the Red Banks area in South Australia to Lithgow in eastern New South Wales three and a half years later, a distance of . Although reported throughout Australia, they are most common in the relatively fertile south-east and south-west corners of the mainland, and in south-east Queensland. They are rare in the deep desert and dryer areas such as western Cape York or the Northern Territory, and are occasional visitors to northern Tasmania, King Island, and the Torres Strait islands. Behaviour Hunting from a perch Black-shouldered kites usually hunt singly or in pairs, though where food is plentiful they occur in small family groups and can be loosely gregarious at times of irruptions, with up to 70 birds reported feeding together during a mouse plague. They roost communally, like other Elanus species. They are territorial when food is not abundant. The practice of \\"tail flicking\\" where, on landing, the tail is flicked up and lowered and the movement repeated persistently is thought to be a possible territorial display. =Breeding= Mature bird with prey Aerial courtship displays involve single and mutual high circling flight, and the male may fly around with wings held high rapidly fluttering, known as flutter-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling. Black-shouldered kites form monogamous pairs. The breeding season is usually August to January, but is responsive to mice populations, and some pairs breed twice in a good season. Both sexes collect material for the nest but the female alone builds it. A large untidy shallow cup of sticks usually in the foliage near the top of trees, the nest takes anywhere from two to six weeks to be built. It is constructed of thin twigs and is around across when newly built, but growing to around across and deep after repeated use. The nest is lined with green leaves and felted fur, though linings of grass and cow dung have also been reported. It is generally located in the canopy of an isolated or exposed tree in open country, elevated or more above the ground. Black-shouldered kites have been known to use old Australian magpie, crow or raven nests. Females perform most of the care of eggs and nestlings, though males take a minor share of incubation and brooding. The clutch consists of three to four dull white eggs of a tapered oval shape measuring and with red- brown blotches that are often heavier around the larger end of the egg. The eggs are laid at intervals of two to five days. The female incubates the eggs for 30 days and when the eggs hatch the chicks are helpless but have soft down covering their body. For the first two weeks or so the female broods the chicks constantly, both day and night. She does no hunting at all for the first three weeks after hatching, but calls to the male from the nest, and he generally responds by bringing food. The female feeds the chicks with the mice brought back to the nest by the male, feeding them in tiny pieces for the first week or two, at which time the chicks are capable of swallowing a mouse whole. The nestling period lasts around 36 days, and the post-fledging period at least 36 days with parental feeding for at least 22 days. When the chicks are older both parents take it in turns to feed them. Black feathers start to appear along the chicks' wings when they are about a fortnight old, and they are fully fledged and are ready to fly in five weeks. Within a week of leaving the nest the young birds are capable of hunting for mice on their own. Juveniles disperse widely, taking up territory that can be as far as from the nest site. =Food and hunting= Hovering while hunting The black-shouldered kite has become a specialist predator of the introduced house mouse, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. It takes other suitably- sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (very rarely) rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of its diet. Its influence on mouse populations is probably significant; adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings within an hour. In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird. Like other elanid kites, the black-shouldered kite hunts by quartering grasslands for small creatures. This can be from a perch, but more often by hovering in mid-air. It is diurnal, preferring to hunt during the day, particularly in the early morning and mid to late afternoon, and occasionally hunts in pairs. Its hunting pattern, outside breeding periods and periods of abundant prey, has distinct crepuscular peaks, perhaps corresponding to mouse activity. When hunting, the kite hovers with its body hanging almost vertically, and its head into the wind. Unlike the nankeen kestrel, the black- winged kite shows no obvious sideways movement, even in a strong breeze. One study of a nesting pair noted that the male searched aerially for 82% of the search time. Typically, a kite hovers above a particular spot, peering down intently, sometimes for only a few seconds, often for a minute or more, then glides swiftly to a new vantage point and hovers again. When hunting from a perch, a dead tree is the preferred platform. Like other Elanus kites, The black-shouldered kite grips a vertical branch with a foot on either side, each one above the other and turned inwards, which enables them to maintain a secure footing on relatively small branches. Though hovering is the most common hunting method, the kites have been observed searching the ground beneath a vantage point for periods of up to an hour. When a mouse or other prey is spotted, the kite drops silently onto it, feet-first with wings raised high; sometimes in one long drop to ground level, more often in two or more stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a perch. Birds will have a favoured feeding perch, beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or castings. Conservation status European occupation of Australia has, on the whole, benefited the black- shouldered kite through land clearing and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much larger numbers of mice. As the species has a large range and an increasing population, it is listed as \\"Least Concern\\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species. In southwestern Australia, it has become one of the most commonly recorded raptors in the wheatbelt. According to raptor researcher Stephen Debus, this species did not suffer from eggshell thinning during the period of DDT use in Australia, though he believes secondary poisoning is possible from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.

He authored the hadith collection known as Sahih al- Bukhari, regarded by Sunni Muslims as the most authentic (sahih) hadith collections. He also wrote other books such as Al-Adab al-Mufrad.Al-Adab al- Mufrad.  Biography  =Birth= Muhammad ibn Isma øil al-Bukhari al-Ju øfi was born after the Jumu'ah prayer on Friday, 21 July 810 (13 Shawwal 194 AH) in the city of Bukhara in Transoxiana (in present-day Uzbekistan). His father, Ismail ibn Ibrahim, a scholar of hadith, was a student and associate of Malik ibn Anas. Some Iraqi scholars related hadith narrations from him. =Lineage= Imam Bukhari's great-grandfather, al-Mughirah, settled in Bukhara after accepting Islam at the hands of Bukhara's governor, Yaman al- Ju øfi. As was the custom, he became a mawla of Yaman, and his family continued to carry the nisbah of \\"al-Ju øfi\\". Al-Mughirah's father, Bardizbah, is the earliest known ancestor of Bukhari according to most scholars and historians. Bardizbah was a Zoroastrian Magi, and died as such. As-Subki is the only scholar to name Bardizbah's father, who he says was named Bazzabah (). Little is known of either Bardizbah or Bazzabah, except that they were Persian and followed the religion of their people. Historians have also not come across any information on Bukhari's grandfather, Ibrahim ibn al-Mughirah. =Hadith studies and travels= The historian al-Dhahabi described his early academic life: Bukhari's travels seeking and studying hadith. At the age of sixteen, he, together with his brother and widowed mother, made the pilgrimage to Mecca. From there he made a series of travels in order to increase his knowledge of hadith. He went through all the important centres of Islamic learning of his time, talked to scholars and exchanged information on hadith. It is said that he heard from over 1,000 men, and learned over 600,000 traditions. After sixteen years absence, he returned to Bukhara, and there he drew up his al-Jami' as-Sahih, a collection of 7,275 tested traditions, arranged in chapters so as to afford a basis for a complete system of jurisprudence without the use of speculative law. His book is highly regarded among Sunni Muslims, and considered the most authentic collection of hadith, even ahead of the Muwatta Imam Malik and Sahih Muslim of Bukhari's student Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj. Most Sunni scholars consider it second only to the Quran in terms of authenticity. He also composed other books, including al-Adab al- Mufrad, which is a collection of hadiths on ethics and manners, as well as two books containing biographies of hadith narrators (see isnad). = Last years = In the year 864/250, he settled in Nishapur. It was in Nishapur that he met Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj. He would be considered his student, and eventually collector and organiser of hadith collection Sahih Muslim which is considered second only to that of al-Bukhari. Political problems led him to move to Khartank, a village near Samarkand where he died in the year 870/256.  Mausoleum  Imam Al Bukhari Memorial Today his tomb lies within the Imam al- Bukhari Complex, in Hartang Village, 25 kilometers from Samarkand. It was restored in 1998 after centuries of neglect and dilapidation. The mausoleum complex consists of Imam al-Bukhari's tomb, a mosque, a madrassah, library, and a small collection of Qurans. The modern ground level mausoleum tombstone of Imam Bukhari is only a cenotaph, the actual grave lies within a small burial crypt below the modern structure.  Writings  Below is a summary of the discussion of Bukhari's available works in Fihrist Mu·π£annafƒÅt al-BukhƒÅri by Umm 'AbdullƒÅh bint Ma·∏•r≈´s, Mu·∏•ammad ibn ·∏§amza and Ma·∏•m≈´d ibn Mu·∏•ammad.Fihris Mu·π£annafƒÅt al-BukhƒÅri, pp. 9-61, DƒÅr al-'ƒÄ·π£imah, Riya·∏ç: 1410. = Works describing narrators of hadith = Bukhari wrote three works discussing narrators of hadith with respect to their ability in conveying their material: the \\"brief compendium of hadith narrators,\\" \\"the medium compendium\\" and the \\"large compendium\\" * Al-Tarikh al-Kabƒ´r (Eng: The great history) known as al-Tarƒ´kh al-·π¢aghƒ´r, and al-Tarƒ´kh al-Awsa≈£). The large compendium is published and well-identified. The medium compendium was thought to be the brief collection and was published as such. The brief compendium has yet to be found.Fihris MusannafƒÅt al-BukhƒÅri, pp. 28-30. Another work, al- KunƒÅ, is on patronymics: identifying people who are commonly known as \\"Father of so-and-so\\". Then there is a brief work on weak narrators: al-·∏åu'afƒÅ al- ·π¢aghƒ´r. =·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏• al-Bukharƒ´ & extant hadith= Two of Bukhari's works on hadith survive: *·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏• al-Bukharƒ´full title, al-JƒÅmi‚Äô al-Musnad al-Sahƒ´h al- Mukhta·π£ar min um≈´r Ras√ªl AllƒÅh wa sunnanihi wa ayyƒÅmihi \\"Collection of Selected True Reports of the Prophet, his Practices and Times\\"); al-Bukharƒ´'s famous magnum opus. [Note: these al-Musnad are reports with chains of narration that go back to the Prophet.] *Al-Adab al-Mufrad ; hadith on respect and propriety. Theological Views Bukhari was a follower of early Sunni theologian (mutakallim) Ibn Kullab in creed,Wahab, Muhammad Rashidi, and Syed Hadzrullathfi Syed Omar. \\"Peringkat Pemikiran Imam al-Ash‚Äôari Dalam Akidah.\\" International Journal of Islamic Thought 3 (2013): 58-70. \\"Disebabkan itu, al- Bukhari dalam kebanyakan perkara berkaitan dengan persoalan akidah dikatakan akan mengambil pendapat Ibn Kullab dan al-Karabisi(al-'Asqalani 2001: 1/293)\\" preaching that one's recitation of the Qur'an is created, whilst the Qur'an itself is uncreated.Azmi, Ahmad Sanusi. \\"Ahl al-Hadith Methodologies on Qur'anic Discourses in the Ninth Century: A Comparative Analysis of Ibn Hanbal and al-Bukhari.\\" Online Journal of Research in Islamic Studies 4.1 (2017): 17-26.Melchert, Christopher. \\"The Piety of the Hadith folk.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 34.3 (2002): 425-439. \\"Hadith folk in Baghdad warned those of Nishapur against the famous traditionist Bukhari, whom they then drove from the city for suggesting one's pronunciation of the Qur'an was created\\" Reacting to such teaching, the hadith scholars of Baghdad warned the people of Nishapur against him, had him imprisoned and then drove him out of the city. Other followers of Ibn Kullab, such as Harith al-Muhasibi, were also criticised and made to relocate.Shakir, Zaid. \\"Treatise for the Seekers of Guidance.\\" NID Publishers, 2008. Away from discussions relating to God's speech, Bukhari also repudiated rejection of Qadar (the divine decree) in his Sahih by quoting a verse of the Quran implying that God had already determined all human acts with a precise determining. According to Ibn Hajar, Bukhari signified that if someone was to accept autonomy in creating his acts, he would be assumed to be playing God's role and so would subsequently be declared a polytheist. In another chapter, Bukhari refutes the creeds of the Kharijites, and according to al-Ayni, the heading of that chapter was designed not only to refute the Kharijites but also any who held similar beliefs. = Interpretation of God's attributes = In Sahih al-Bukhari, in the book entitled \\"Tafsir al-Qur'an wa 'ibaratih\\" [i.e., Exegesis of the Qur'an and its expressions], surat al-Qasas, verse 88: \\"kullu shay'in halikun illa Wajhah\\" [the literal meaning of which is \\"everything will perish except His Face\\"], he said the term [illa Wajhah] means: \\"except His Sovereignty/Dominance\\". And there is [in this same chapter] other than that in terms of ta'wil (metaphorical interpretation), like the term 'dahk' () which is narrated in a hadith, [which is interpreted by] His Mercy.  School of thought  Many are of the opinion that Bukhari was a mujtahid with his own school of jurisprudence.Mughal, Justice R. Dr, and Munir Ahmad. \\"Imam Bukhari (ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖ€É ÿßŸÑŸÑ€Å ÿπŸÑ€å€Å) Was a Mujtahid Mutlaq.\\" Available at SSRN 2049357 (2012).Sattar, Abdul. \\"Konstruksi Fiqh Bukhari dalam Kitab al-Jami‚Äôal-Shahih.\\" De Jure: Jurnal Hukum dan Syar'iah 3.1 (2011).Masrur, Ali, and Imam Zainuddin Az-Zubaidi. \\"Imam Muhammad bin Ismail al-Bukhari (194-256 H): Kolektor Hadis Nabi Saw. paling unggul di Dunia Islam.\\" (2018): 1-16.Hasyim, Muh Fathoni. \\"FIKIH IMAM AL- BUKHAR1.\\" (2009). Bukhari has however been claimed as a follower of the Hanbali school,Imam al-Bukhari. (d. 256/870; Tabaqat al-Shafi'iya, 2.212-14 [6]) although members of the Shafi'i and ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´ schools levy this claim as well.Falih al-Dhibyani, Al-zahiriyya hiya al-madhhab al-awwal, wa al- mutakallimun 'anha yahrifun bima la ya'rifun . Interview with Abdul Aziz al- Harbi for Okaz. 15 July 2006, Iss. #1824. Photography by Salih Ba Habri. JRD Mughal and Munir Ahmad assert that historically most jurists considered him to be a muhaddith and not a jurist, and that as a muhaddith they thought that he followed the Shafi'i school.Mughal, Justice R. Dr, and Munir Ahmad. \\"Imam Bukhari (ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖ€É ÿßŸÑŸÑ€Å ÿπŸÑ€å€Å) Was a Mujtahid Mutlaq.\\" Available at SSRN 2049357 (2012). However, both go on to evidence the opinion that he was an absolute scholar of independent reasoning (Mujatahid Mutlaq).Mughal, Justice R. Dr, and Munir Ahmad. \\"Imam Bukhari (ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖ€É ÿßŸÑŸÑ€Å ÿπŸÑ€å€Å) Was a Mujtahid Mutlaq.\\" Available at SSRN 2049357 (2012). Scott Lucas argues that Bukhari's legal positions were similar to those of the ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´s and Hanbalis of his time, suggesting Bukhari rejected qiyas and other forms of ra'y completely. He makes comparisons between Bukhari's positions and those of Ibn Hazm.

al-Nawawƒ´ (; 1233‚Äì1277), popularly known as al- Nawawƒ´ or Imam Nawawƒ´ (631‚Äì676 A.H./1234‚Äì1277), was a Sunni Shafi'ite jurist and hadith scholar.Ludwig W. Adamec (2009), Historical Dictionary of Islam, pp.238-239. Scarecrow Press. . He authored numerous and lengthy works ranging from hadith, to theology, biography, and jurisprudence.Fachrizal A. Halim (2014), Legal Authority in Premodern Islam: Yahya B Sharaf Al-Nawawi in the Shafi'i School of Law, p. 1. Routledge. . Al-Nawawi never married.  Creed  He did not interpret the mutashabihat, or 'unapparent in meaning' verses and hadiths in a literal anthropomorphic way. He states in his commentary of a hadith that: Early years =Background= He was born at Nawa near Damascus, Syria. As with Arabic and other Semitic languages, the last part of his name refers to his hometown. Yasin bin Yusuf Marakashi, says: \\"I saw Imam Nawawi at Nawa when he was a youth of ten years of age. Other boys of his age used to force him to play with them, but Imam Nawawi would always avoid the play and would remain busy with the recitation of the Noble Qur'an. When they tried to domineer and insisted on his joining their games, he bewailed and expressed his no concern over their foolish action. On observing his sagacity and profundity, a special love and affection developed in my heart for young Nawawi. I approached his teacher and urged him to take exceptional care of this lad as he was to become a great religious scholar. His teacher asked whether I was a soothsayer or an astrologer. I told him I am neither soothsayer nor an astrologer but Allah caused me to utter these words.\\" His teacher conveyed this incident to Imam's father and he keeping in view the learning quest of his son, decided to dedicate the life of his son for the service and promotion of the cause of Islam. = Education = He had no academic or scholarly atmosphere and there were no religious academies or institutes where one could earn excellence in religious learning, so his father took him to Damascus, which was considered the center of learning and scholarship, and the students from far and wide gathered there for schooling. During that period, there were more than three hundred institutes, colleges and universities in Damascus. Imam Nawawi joined Madrasah Rawahiyah which was affiliated with the Ummvi University. The founder and patron of this Madrasah was a trader named Zakiuddin Abul-Qassim who was known as Ibn Rawahah. Madrasah was named after him. Noted and eminent teachers of the period taught in that Madrasah. Imam Nawawi says, \\"I studied in this institution for two years. During my stay in Madrasah Rawahiyah, I never had complete rest and lived on the limited food supplied by the institution.\\" As a routine he used to sleep very little at night. When it became irresistible as a human being, he would lean and slumber for a while against the support of books. After a short duration he would again be hard at his scholastic pursuits. Life as a scholar He studied in Damascus from the age of 18 and after making the pilgrimage in 1253 he settled there as a private scholar. =Notable teachers= During his stay at Damascus, he studied from more than twenty teachers. These teachers were regarded as masters and authority of their subject field and disciplines they taught. Imam studied Hadith, Islamic Jurisprudence, its principles, syntax and Etymology. Abu Ibrahim Ishaq bin Ahmad AI-Maghribi, Abu Muhammad Abdur-Rahman bin Ibrahim Al-Fazari, Radiyuddin Abu Ishaq Ibrahim bin Abu Hafs Umar bin Mudar Al-Mudari, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim bin Isa Al-Muradi, Abul-Baqa Khalid bin Yusuf An-Nablusi, Abul-Abbas Ahmad bin Salim Al-Misri, Abu Abdullah Al-Jiyani, Abul-Fath Umar bin Bandar, Abu Muhammad At-Tanukhi, Sharafuddin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad Al-Ansari, Abul-Faraj Abdur-Rahman bin Muhammad bin Ahmad Al-Maqdisi, Abul-Fada'il Sallar bin Al- Hasan Al Arbali.  Relationship with the Mamluk Sultanate  Nawawi drew the ire of Mamluk Sultan Rukn al-Din Baybars, when he petitioned on behalf of residents of Damascus who sought relief from heavy tax burdens during a drought that lasted many years. This prompted Baybars to threaten to expel him from Damascus. To this, he responded: > \\"As for myself, threats do not harm me or mean anything to me. They will not > keep me from advising the ruler, for I believe that this is obligatory upon > me and others.\\" Death and legacy He died at Nawa at the relatively young age of 44. Imam Nawawi's Forty Hadith taught in the Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan in Cairo, Egypt An-Nawawi's lasting legacy is his contribution to hadith literature through his momentous works Forty Hadiths and Riyadh as-Saaliheen. This made him respected in all madhabs, despite of him being of Shafi'i jurisprudence. According to Al-Dhahabi, Imam Nawawi's concentration and absorption in academic love gained proverbial fame. He had devoted all his time for learning and scholarship. Other than reading and writing, he spent his time contemplating on the interacted and complex issues and in finding their solutions. Sheikh Mohiuddin expresses his impression about Imam Nawawi as thus: > Imaam an-Nawawi had three distinctive commendable qualities in his person. > If anybody has only one out of these three, people turn to him in abundance > for guidance. First, having knowledge and its dissemination. Second, to > evade completely from the worldly inclinations, and the third, inviting to > all that is good (Islam) enjoining virtue and forbidding vice. Imaam an- > Nawawi had all three in him. =Destruction of tomb= In 2015, during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, his tomb was demolished by rebels linked to Al Nusra.  Works  During his life of 45 years he wrote \\"at least fifty books\\"Jamaal al-Din M.

They are named for the trumpeting or cackling threat call of the males. The three species resemble chickens in size; they measure long and weigh . They are rotund birds with long necks and legs and curved bills and a hunched posture. Their heads are small, but their eyes are relatively large, making them look \\"good-natured\\". The plumage is soft, resembling fur or velvet on the head and neck. It is mostly black, with purple, green, or bronze iridescence, particularly on the wing coverts and the lower neck. In the best-known taxa the secondary and tertial flight feathers are white, grey, or greenish to black, and hairlike, falling over the lower back, which is the same colour. These colours give the three generally accepted species their names. Taxonomy and systematics Traditionally only three species of trumpeters have been recognised.Remsen, J. V., Jr., C. D. Cadena, A.

Behaviour and ecology Trumpeters fly weakly but run fast; they can easily outrun dogs. They are also capable of swimming across rivers. They spend most of the day in noisy flocks, sometimes numbering more than 100, on the forest floor. They feed on fallen fruit (particularly fruit knocked down by monkeys). They also eat a small amount of arthropods, including ants and flies, and even some reptiles and amphibians. At night they fly with difficulty into trees to roost above the ground. Trumpeters nest in a hole in a tree or in the crown of a palm tree. They lay 2 to 5 eggs with rough, white shells, averaging about . In the pale-winged trumpeter and the grey-winged trumpeter, groups of adults care for a single clutch. Relationship with humans Trumpeters are often used as \\"guard dogs\\" because they call loudly when alarmed, become tame easily, and are believed to be adept at killing snakes. One source states their skill at hunting snakes as a fact, and the nineteenth-century botanist Richard Spruce gave an account of the friendliness and snake-killing prowess of a tame grey-winged trumpeter. For these reasons, Spruce recommended that England import trumpeters to India. However, another source says this prowess is \\"reputed\\".

Along with the German Theodor N√∂ldeke and the Dutch Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, he is considered the founder of modern Islamic studies in Europe. Biography Born in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r of Jewish heritage, he was educated at the universities of Budapest, Berlin, Leipzig and Leiden with the support of J√≥zsef E√∂tv√∂s, Hungarian minister of culture. He became privatdozent at Budapest in 1872. In the next year, under the auspices of the Hungarian government, he began a journey through Syria, Palestine and Egypt, and took the opportunity of attending lectures of Muslim sheiks in the mosque of al-Azhar in Cairo. Goldziher kept a personal record of his reflections, travel records and daily records. This journal was later published in German as Tagebuch. The following quotation from Goldziher's published journal provides insight into his feelings about Islam. : (p. 59) :i.e., \\"In those weeks, I truly entered into the spirit of Islam to such an extent that ultimately I became inwardly convinced that I myself was a Muslim, and judiciously discovered that this was the only religion which, even in its doctrinal and official formulation, can satisfy philosophic minds. My ideal was to elevate Judaism to a similar rational level. Islam, as my experience taught me, is the only religion, in which superstitious and heathen ingredients are not frowned upon by rationalism, but by orthodox doctrine.\\" Sander Gilman, in commenting on this passage, writes that, 'the Islam he discovered becomes the model for a new spirit of Judaism at the close of the nineteenth century.‚Äô In Cairo, Goldziher even prayed as a Muslim: \\"In the midst of the thousands of the pious, I rubbed my forehead against the floor of the mosque. Never in my life was I more devout, more truly devout, than on that exalted Friday.\\"The Jewish Discovery of Islam by Martin Kramer Despite his love for Islam, Goldziher remained a devout Jew all his life. This bond to the Mosaic faith was unusual for a man seeking an academic career in Europe in the late 19th century. This fact is significant in understanding his work. He saw Islam through the eyes of someone who refused to assimilate into contemporary European culture. In fact, despite his fondness for Islam, he had little affection, if not outright scorn, for European Christianity. As a convert to Christianity he would have easily received a university appointment as full professor but he refused. Goldziher died in Budapest. Career In 1890 he published ' in which he showed how Hadith reflected the legal and doctrinal controversies of the two centuries after the death of Muhammad rather than the words of Mohamed himself. He was a strong believer in the view that Islamic law owes its origins to Roman law but in the opinion of Patricia Crone his arguments here are \\"uncharacteristically weak\\". Goldziher was denied a teaching post at Budapest University until he was 44. He represented the Hungarian government and the Academy of Sciences at numerous international congresses. He received the large gold medal at the Stockholm Oriental Congress in 1889. He became a member of several Hungarian and other learned societies, and was appointed secretary of the Jewish community in Budapest. He was made Litt.D. of Cambridge (1904) and LL.D. of Aberdeen (1906). Works * *Tagebuch, ed. Alexander Scheiber.

Legacy =Islamic traditions= Goldziher's eminence in the sphere of scholarship was due primarily to his careful investigation of pre-Islamic and Islamic law, tradition, religion and poetry, in connection with which he published a large number of treatises, review articles and essays contributed to the collections of the Hungarian Academy. Scholarly work of his that is still considered relevant include his contention that Mecca, as the birthplace of Islam, is a myth.G.S. Reynolds \\"Quranic studies and its controversies\\". Along with Joseph Schacht (1902-1969), who expanded on his work, Goldziher is thought to have authored one of the \\"two influential and founding works\\" of Islamic studies or \\"Orientalist\\" studies (Goldziher's being Muslim Studies) according to Mohammed Salem Al-Shehri. Writing in the late 19th and early 20th century, Goldziher \\"inaugurated the critical study\\" of the hadith's authenticity and concluded that \\"the great majority of traditions from the Prophet are documents not of the time to which they claim to belong\\" but created \\"during the first centuries of Islam,\\"Goldziher, Muslim Studies, pp.1-274 i.e. were fraudulent. This included hadith \\"accepted even in the most rigorously critical Muslim collections\\", which meant that \\"the meticulous isnads which supported them were utterly fictitious\\" (R. Stephen Humphreys).Humphreys, R.S., Islamic History, A Framework for Inquiry, Princeton, 1991, p.83 Instead, Goldziher argued in his book Muslim Studies, hadith were the product of \\"debates and arguments within the emerging [Islamic] religion and society ... projected back into the time of the Prophet\\" and were a means of putting \\"support for one party or another ... into the mouth of the prophet\\" (in the words of G.R. Hawting).Hawting, \\"John Wansbrough, Islam, and Monotheism\\", 2000: p.517 ;Comments of Edward Said Goldziher's works have taken on a renewed importance in recent times owing to Edward Said's critical attacks in his book Orientalism. Said himself was to reprove his work's defect for failing to pay sufficient attention to scholars like Goldziher. Of five major German orientalists, he remarked that four of them, despite their profound erudition, were hostile to Islam. Goldziher's work was an exception in that he appreciated 'Islam's tolerance towards other religions', though this was undermined by his dislike of anthropomorphism in Mohammad's thought, and what Said calls 'Islam's too exterior theology and jurisprudence'.Said, ibid. p.209. In his numerous books and articles, he sought to find the origins of Islamic doctrines and rituals in the practices of other cultures. In doing so, he posited that Islam continuously developed as a civilization, importing and exporting ideas.

It is the only extant species in the genus Aramus and the family Aramidae. It is found mostly in wetlands in warm parts of the Americas, from Florida to northern Argentina. It feeds on molluscs, with the diet dominated by apple snails of the genus Pomacea. Its name derives from its seeming limp when it walks. Taxonomy and systematics The limpkin is placed in its own monotypic family, Aramidae, which is in turn placed within the crane and rail order Gruiformes. The limpkin had been suggested to be close to the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae, based upon shared bird lice. The Sibley‚ÄìAhlquist taxonomy of birds, based upon DNA‚ÄìDNA hybridization, suggested that the limpkin's closest relatives were the Heliornithidae finfoots, and Sibley and Monroe even placed the species in that family in 1990. More recent studies have found little support for this relationship. More recent DNA studies have confirmed a close relationship with particularly the cranes, with the limpkin remaining as a family close to the cranes and the two being sister taxa to the trumpeters. Between 1856 and 1934, the limpkin was treated as two species, one in South America (Aramus guarauna) and the other found in Central America, the Caribbean, and Florida (Aramus pictus). Today, it is treated as a single species with four subspecies. Along with the nominate subspecies A. g. guarauna, A. g. dolosus, A. g. elucus (both J. L. Peters, 1925), and A. g. pictus (F. A. A. Meyer, 1794) are recognized. The difference between the subspecies are related to slight differences in size and plumage. Although the limpkin is the only extant species in the family today, several fossils of extinct Aramidae are known from across the Americas. The earliest known species, Aramus paludigrus, is dated to the middle Miocene, while the oldest supposed members of the family, Aminornis and Loncornis, have been found in early Oligocene deposits in Argentina, although whether these are indeed related is not certain; in fact, Loncornis seems to be a misidentified mammal bone. Another Oligocene fossil from Europe, Parvigrus pohli (family Parvigruidae), has been described as a mosaic of the features shared by the limpkins and the cranes. It shares many morphological features with the cranes and limpkins, but also was much smaller than either group, and was more rail- like in its proportions. In the paper describing the fossil, Gerald Mayr suggested that it was similar to the stem species of the grues (the cranes and limpkins), and that the limpkins evolved massively long bills as a result of the specialisation to feeding on snails. In contrast, the cranes evolved into long-legged forms to walk and probe on open grasslands. Description The limpkin is a somewhat large bird, long, with a wingspan of . Body mass ranges from , averaging . The males are slightly larger than the females in size, but no difference in plumage is seen. Its plumage is drab‚Äîdark brown with an olive luster above. The feathers of the head, neck, wing coverts, and much of the back and underparts (except the rear) are marked with white, making the body look streaked and the head and neck light gray. It has long, dark-gray legs and a long neck. Its bill is long, heavy, and downcurved, yellowish bill with a darker tip. The bill is slightly open near but not at the end to give it a tweezers-like action in removing snails from their shells, and in many individuals the tip curves slightly to the right, like the apple snails' shells. The white markings are slightly less conspicuous in first-year birds. Its wings are broad and rounded and its tail is short. It is often confused with the immature American white ibis. This bird is easier to hear than see. Its common vocalization is a loud wild wail or scream with some rattling quality, represented as \\"kwEEEeeer or klAAAar.\\" This call is most often given at night and at dawn and dusk. Other calls include \\"wooden clicking\\", clucks, and in alarm, a \\"piercing bihk, bihk...\\". Limpkin-2.jpgthumbleftLimpkin performing a wing-stretch Aramus guarauna-takes off.jpgthumbTaking off Distribution and habitat The limpkin occurs from peninsular Florida (and formerly the Okefenokee Swamp in southern Georgia) and southern Mexico through the Caribbean and Central America to northern Argentina. In South America, it occurs widely east of the Andes; west of them its range extends only to the Equator. It inhabits freshwater marshes and swamps, often with tall reeds, as well as mangroves. In the Caribbean, it also inhabits dry brushland. In Mexico and northern Central America, it occurs at altitudes up to . In Florida, the distribution of apple snails is the best predictor of where limpkins can be found. The limpkin undertakes some localized migrations, although the extent of these is not fully understood. In some parts in the northern part of the range, females (and a few males) leave the breeding areas at the end of summer, returning at the end of winter. In Brazil, birds breeding in some seasonal marshes leave during the dry season and return again with the rains. Birds may also migrate between Florida and Cuba, as several limpkins on the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas have been reported, but these records may also represent vagrants or postbreeding dispersal. One study in Florida using wing tags found limpkins dispersed up to away from the breeding site. This tendency may explain vagrant limpkins seen in other parts of the United States and at sea near the Bahamas. Behavior and ecology Limpkins are active during the day, but also forage at night. Where they are not persecuted, they are also very tame and approachable. Even so, they are usually found near cover. They are not aggressive for the most part, being unconcerned by other species and rarely fighting with members of their own species. Because of their long toes, they can stand on floating water plants. They also swim well, both as adults or as newly hatched chicks, but they seldom do so. They fly strongly, the neck projecting forward and the legs backward, the wings beating shallowly and stiffly, with a jerky upstroke, above the horizontal most of the time. =Feeding= Limpkin with an apple snail (Pomacea) Limpkin searching underwater for food Limpkins forage primarily in shallow water and on floating vegetation such as water hyacinth and water lettuce. When wading, they seldom go deeper than having half the body underwater, and never are submerged up to the back. They walk slowly with a gait described as \\"slightly undulating\\" and \\"giving the impression of lameness or limping\\", \\"high-stepping\\", or \\"strolling\\", looking for food if the water is clear or probing with the bill. They do not associate with other birds in mixed-species feeding flocks, as do some other wading birds, but may forage in small groups with others of their species. The diet of the limpkin is dominated by apple snails (Ampullariidae) of the genus Pomacea. The availability of this one mollusk has a significant effect on the local distribution of the limpkin. Freshwater mussels, including Anodonta cowperiana, Villosa vibex, Elliptio strigosus, E. jayensis, and Uniomerus obesus, as well as other kinds of snails, are a secondary food sources. Less important prey items are insects, frogs, lizards, crustaceans and worms. These prey items may be important in periods of drought or flooding when birds may be pushed into less than optimal foraging areas. In one site in Florida, moon snails and mussels were the most important prey items. Two studies, both in Florida, have looked at the percentage composition of the diet of limpkins. One, looking at stomach contents, found 70% Pomacea apple snails, 3% Campeloma, and 27% unidentified mollusc, probably Pomacea. When a limpkin finds an apple snail, it carries it to land or very shallow water and places it in mud, the opening facing up. It deftly removes the operculum or \\"lid\\" and extracts the snail, seldom breaking the shell. The extraction takes 10 to 20 seconds. The orange-yellow yolk gland of female snails is usually shaken loose and not eaten. It often leaves piles of empty shells at favored spots. =Reproduction and breeding= Juvenile limpkin Males have exclusive territories, which can vary in size from . In large, uniform swamps, nesting territories can often be clumped together, in the form of large colonies. These are vigorously defended, with males flying to the territory edges to challenge intruders and passing limpkins being chased out of the territory. Territorial displays between males at boundaries include ritualized charging and wing-flapping. Females may also participate in territorial defense, but usually only against other females or juveniles. Territories may be maintained year-round or abandoned temporarily during the nonbreeding season, usually due to lack of food. Limpkins may be either monogamous, with females joining a male's territory, or serially polyandrous, with two or more females joining a male. With the monogamous pairs, banding studies have shown that a small number of pairs reform the following year (four out of 18 pairs). Limpkin chicks with parents Nests may be built in a wide variety of places ‚Äì on the ground, in dense floating vegetation, in bushes, or at any height in trees. They are bulky structures of rushes, sticks, or other materials. Nest building is undertaken by the male initially, which constructs the nest in his territory prior to pair-bond formation. Unpaired females visit a number of territories before settling on a male with which to breed. Males may initially challenge and fight off prospective mates, and may not accept first-year females as mates. Pair-bond formation may take a few weeks. Courtship feeding is part of the bonding process, where males catch and process a snail and then feed it to the female. The clutch consists of three to eight eggs, with five to seven being typical and averaging 5.5, which measure . The egg color is highly variable. Their background color ranges from gray-white through buff to deep olive, and they are marked with light-brown and sometimes purplish-gray blotches and speckles. The eggs are laid daily until the clutch is complete, and incubation is usually delayed until the clutch is completed. Both parents incubate the eggs during the day, but only the female incubates at night. The shift length is variable, but the male incubates for longer during the day. The male remains territorial during incubation, and leaves the clutch to chase off intruders; if this happens, the female returns quickly to the eggs. The incubation period is about 27 days, and all the eggs hatch within 24 hours of each other. The young hatch covered with down, capable of walking, running, and swimming. They follow their parents to a platform of aquatic vegetation, where they are brooded. They are fed by both parents; they reach adult size at 7 weeks and leave their parents at about 16 weeks. =Ecology= Limpkins are reported to be attacked and eaten by American alligators. Also, adults with serious foot and leg injuries have been reported, suggesting they may have been attacked by turtles while standing on floating vegetation. Their nests are apparently preyed upon by snakes, raccoons, crows, and muskrats. Foraging adults may in times of drought be victims of kleptoparasitism by snail kites, and the attempted theft of apple snails caught by limpkins has also been observed in boat-tailed grackles. Limpkins in Florida were examined for parasites, which included trematodes, nematodes, and biting lice. Two biting lice species were found, Laemobothrion cubense and Rallicola funebris. The trematode Prionosoma serratum was found in the intestines of some birds; this species may enter the bird after first infecting apple snails (this has been shown to be the route of infection for a closely related trematode to infect snail kites). Nematodes Amidostomum acutum and Strongyloides spp. are also ingested and live in the gut. Relationship with humans Many of the limpkin's names across its range are onomatopoeic and reflect the bird's call; for example, carau in Argentina, carrao in Venezuela, and guare√°o in Cuba. The species also has a range of common names that refer to its call, for example lamenting bird, or to its supposed gait, crippled bird. The limpkin does not feature much in folklore, although in the Amazon people believe that when the limpkin starts to call, the river will not rise any more. Its call has been used for jungle sound effects in Tarzan films and for the hippogriff in the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Recognized both during and after his lifetime for his patriotic verse and his significant role in the cultural development of Quebec, Cr√©mazie has been called \\"the father of French Canadian poetry.\\" Octave was the youngest of the four surviving children of Jacques Cr√©mazie and Marie-Anne Miville. From 1836 to 1844, he was a student at the Seminary of Quebec, where the priest John Holmes (American priest) introduced him to the works of the French Romantic writers. Alfred de Musset, Alphonse de Lamartine, and Victor Hugo, in particular, had a profound influence on the future poet. After finishing his studies at the Seminary of Quebec, Cr√©mazie went into business with his brother Joseph, a bookseller. Their shop in Quebec City, the J. et O. Cr√©mazie bookstore, was instrumental in the North American dissemination of works by many Romantic writers. It was also a meeting place for the members of what would become known as Quebec's literary movement of 1860. While still in his early twenties, Cr√©mazie helped found the Institut canadien, an organization devoted to the promotion of French Canadian culture. He would later serve as the organization's president (from 1857 to 1858). Cr√©mazie's first published poems appeared in L'Ami de la religion et de la patrie (edited by his brother Jacques) and other Quebec City newspapers. Recognition for his poetry grew throughout the 1850s. As French-Canadian literature scholar Odette Condemine writes: > His nostalgic evocation of the happiness that preceded the Conquest and the > miseries that followed roused his compatriots' fervour. \\"Le vieux soldat > canadien\\" (1855) and Le Drapeau de Carillon (1858) were enthusiastically > received and won Cr√©mazie his title as \\"national bard.\\" The longing for a glorious, vanished past and the sense of estrangement from France in Cr√©mazie's work has prompted the critic Gilles Marcotte to describe it as a poetry of exile. Despite the popularity of his bookstore, Octave Cr√©mazie's extravagant taste for foreign commodities led to large debts and trouble with creditors. By 1862, his financial situation had become so dire that he fled to France in secret, leaving the bookstore bankrupt. He lived at different times in Paris, Bordeaux, and Le Havre under the name of Jules Fontaine, poor and isolated despite having secured a modest job and the support of a few French friends. Cr√©mazie's poetic production stopped when he left Quebec. The documents that survive from his later years include his Journal du si√®ge de Paris, a diary detailing the hardship that Parisians and Cr√©mazie himself endured during the siege of the capital in 1870 and 1871. Many of his letters to close friends and family members also survive, including his correspondence with the priest Raymond Casgrain, to whom Cr√©mazie often expressed his ideas about literature. Octave Cr√©mazie died in Le Havre on January 16, 1879. ≈íuvres compl√®tes, a volume of Cr√©mazie's poems and letters edited by Raymond Casgrain, was published in 1882 by the Beauchemin bookstore in Montreal and the Institut canadien de Qu√©bec. The book included the following remarks: \\"In a word, the publishers wanted this book to stand as the most enduring monument that could be raised to the memory of the most patriotic, and indeed the most hapless, of our poets.\\" A statue depicting a French Canadian soldier stands in Montreal's Saint-Louis Square (Rue de Malines and Saint-Denis) with Cr√©mazie's name across the top and the years 1827‚Äì1879 (his years of birth and death). Underneath the soldier are the words: Pour mon drapeau je viens ici mourir (literally: \\"For my flag I come here to die\\"). There is also a Montreal metro station named for him on the orange line, located on the boulevard likewise named in his honour.

Often referred to as \\"Madame Pele\\" or \\"T≈´t≈´ Pele\\" as a sign of respect, she is a well-known deity within Hawaiian mythology and is notable for her contemporary presence and cultural influence as an enduring figure from ancient Hawaii. Epithets of the goddess include Pele-honua-mea (\\"Pele of the sacred land\\") and Ka wahine  ªai honua (\\"The earth-eating woman\\"). In different stories talking about the goddess Pele, she was born from the female spirit named Haumea. This spirit is important when talking about Hawaii's gods as she descended from Papa, or Earth Mother, and Wakea, Sky Father, both descendants of the supreme beings.

Many Hawaiians believe Kilauea to be inhabited by a \\"family of fire gods\\", one of the sisters being Pele who is believed to govern Kilauea and is responsible for controlling its lava flows.Martha Warren Beckwith, Hawaiian Mythology (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1970). There are several traditional legends associated with Pele in Hawaiian mythology. In addition to being recognized as the goddess of volcanoes, Pele is also known for her power, passion, jealousy, and capriciousness. She has numerous siblings, including KƒÅne Milohai, Kamohoalii, NƒÅmaka, and numerous sisters named Hiiaka, the most famous being Hiiakaikapoliopele (Hiiaka in the bosom of Pele). They are usually considered to be the offspring of Haumea. Pele's siblings include deities of various types of wind, rain, fire, ocean wave forms, and cloud forms. Her home is believed to be the fire pit called Halema ªuma ªu at the summit caldera of Kƒ´lauea, one of the Earth's most active volcanoes, but her domain encompasses all volcanic activity on the Big Island of Hawaii. Pele shares features similar to other malignant deities inhabiting volcanoes, as in the case of the devil Guayota of Guanche Mythology in Canary Islands (Spain), living on the volcano Teide and was considered by the aboriginal Guanches as responsible for the eruptions of the volcano.Ethnografia y anales de la conquista de las Islas Canarias Legend told that Pele herself journeyed on her canoe from the island of Tahiti to Hawaii. When going through with her journeys, it was said that she tried to create her fires on different islands, but her sister, NƒÅmaka, was chasing her wanting to put an end to her. In the end, the two sisters fought each other and Pele in the end was killed. With this happening, her body was destroyed but her spirit lives in Halema ªuma ªu on Kilauea. They say, \\"Her body is the lava and steam that comes from the volcano. She can also change form, appearing as a white dog, old woman, or beautiful young woman\\" (2).\\"Who is the goddess of Pele and how is she related to the origin of the Hawaiian Islands?\\" Oregon State University System website, http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/who-goddess-pele- and-how-she-related-origin-hawaiian-islands, N/A, retrieved on 9 April 2018.

Retrieved on 6 April 2018. http://www.hulapreservation.org/hulatype.asp?ID=18 =Expulsion version= In one version of the story, Pele is the daughter of Kanehoalani and Haumea in the mystical land of Kuaihelani, a floating free land like Fata Morgana. Kuaihelani was in the region of Kahiki (Kukulu o Kahiki). She stays close to her mother's fireplace with the fire-keeper Lono-makua. Her older sister NƒÅ- maka-o-Kahai, a sea goddess, fears that Pele's ambition would smother the home-land and drives Pele away. Kamohoali'i drives Pele south in a canoe called Honua-i-a-kea with her younger sister Hiiaka and with her brothers Kamohoalii, Kanemilohai, Kaneapua, and arrives at the islets above Hawaii. There Kane-milo-hai is left on Mokupapapa, just a reef, to build it up in fitness for human residence. On Nihoa, 800 feet above the ocean she leaves Kane-apua after her visit to Lehua and crowning a wreath of kau-no'a. Pele feels sorry for her younger brother and picks him up again. Pele used the divining rod, Pa‚Äòoa to pick a new home. A group of chants tells of a pursuit by Namakaokaha'i and Pele is torn apart. Her bones, KaiwioPele form a hill on Kahikinui, while her spirit escaped to the island of Hawaii. =Flood version= In another version, Pele comes from a land said to be \\"close to the clouds,\\" with parents Kane-hoa-lani and Ka-hina-lii, and brothers Ka-moho-alii and Kahuila-o-ka-lani. From her husband Wahieloa (also called Wahialoa) she has a daughter Laka and a son Menehune. Pele-kumu-honua entices her husband and Pele travels in search of him. The sea pours from her head over the land of Kanaloa (perhaps the island now known as Kahoolawe) and her brothers say: > O the sea, the great sea! Forth bursts the sea: Behold, it bursts on > Kanaloa! The sea floods the land, then recedes; this flooding is called Kai a Kahinalii (\\"The sea of Ka-hina-lii\\"), as Pele's connection to the sea was passed down from her mother Kahinalii.\\"Pele and the Deluge,\\" Access Genealogy Hawaiian Folk Tales A Collection of Native Legends , 1907, Retrieved on 24 October 2012. =Pele and Poli ªahu= Pele is considered to be a rival of the Hawaiian goddess of snow, Poli ªahu, and her sisters Lilinoe (a goddess of fine rain), Waiau (goddess of Lake Waiau), and Kahoupokane (a kapa maker whose kapa making activities create thunder, rain, and lightning). All except Kahoupokane reside on Mauna Kea. The kapa maker lives on Hualalai. One myth tells that Poli ªahu had come from Mauna Kea with her friends to attend sled races down the grassy hills south of Hamakua. Pele came disguised as a beautiful stranger and was greeted by Poli ªahu. However, Pele became jealously enraged at the goddess of Mauna Kea. She opened the caverns of Mauna Kea and threw fire from them towards Poli ªahu, with the snow goddess fleeing towards the summit. Poli ªahu was finally able to grab her now-burning snow mantle and throw it over the mountain. Earthquakes shook the island as the snow mantle unfolded until it reached the fire fountains, chilling and hardening the lava. The rivers of lava were driven back to Mauna Loa and Kƒ´lauea. Later battles also led to the defeat of Pele and confirmed the supremacy of the snow goddesses in the northern portion of the island, and Pele in the southern portion.W. D. Westervelt, Hawaiian legends of volcanoes. Boston, G.H. Ellis Press, 1916. = Pele, Hi'iaka, and Lohi'au = In one account of the Pele myths she is banished from her home in Tahiti by her older sister, Namakaokaha'i, for creating hot spots and convincing the rest of her family that Pele would burn them all. Then, Pele travels on the canoe Honuaiakea to find a new home with her brother Kamohoali'i. Her mother gave her an egg to take care of and it later hatches into a baby girl who Pele names Hi'iaka-i-ka-poli-o-pele (Hi'iaka in the Bosom of Pele) or Hi'iaka for short. She is her favorite sister and encouraged her to befriend the people of Puna. However, when Hi'iaka became best friends with a girl named Hopoe, Pele became jealous of their friendship. Pele saw Lohi'au, a chief of Kaua'i, in a dream and sent Hi'iaka to bring him to her in forty days or else she would punish them. When Hi'iaka arrives there, Lohi'au is dead but she calls upon the power of the sorcery goddess Uli to revive him. As Hi'iaka is on the journey, Pele grew impatient and sent a lava flow to Hopoe's home before the forty days were up. When Hi'iaka returned to Hawaii with Lohiahu, she saw Hopoe covered in stone and knew Pele was behind this. Hi'iaka spitefully embraced Lohi'au in Pele's view, which further angered her, and covered Lohiau with lava as well. The sisters saw that their anger led to the two people who meant the most to them being dead, so Pele apologetically brought Lohi'au back to life and let him decide who he would choose. Unfortunately for Pele, Lohi'au ended up choosing Hi'iaka but gave them her blessing regardless. In another version of the myth, Pele hears the beating of drums and chanting coming from Kaua'i while she is sleeping and travels there in her spirit form. She disguises herself as a beautiful young woman and meets Lohi'au in this way. After three days of making love together, Pele goes back to Hawaii and Lohi'au dies from a broken heart. Modern times Belief in Pele continued after the old religion was officially abolished in 1819. In the summer of 1823 English missionary William Ellis toured the island to determine locations for mission stations. After a long journey to the volcano Kƒ´lauea with little food, Ellis eagerly ate the wild berries he found growing there. The berries of the ≈çhelo (Vaccinium reticulatum) plant are considered sacred to Pele. Traditionally prayers and offerings to Pele were always made before eating the berries. The volcano crater was an active lava lake, which the natives feared was a sign that Pele was not pleased with the violation. Although wood carvings and thatched temples were easily destroyed, the volcano was a natural monument to the goddess. Kapi ªolani defying the volcano goddess Pele In December 1824 the High Chiefess Kapiolani descended into Halema ªuma ªu after reciting a Christian prayer instead of the traditional Hawaiian one to Pele. As it was predicted, she survived and this story was often told by missionaries to show the superiority of their faith. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809‚Äì1892) wrote a poem about the incident in 1892. An urban legend states that Pele herself occasionally warns locals of impending eruptions. Appearing in the form of either a beautiful young woman or an elderly woman with white hair, sometimes accompanied by a small white dog, and always dressed in a red muumuu, Pele is said to walk along the roads near Kƒ´lauea, but will vanish if passersby stop to help her, similar to the Resurrection Mary or vanishing hitchhiker legend. The passerby is then obliged to warn others or suffer misfortune in the next eruption. Another legend, Pele's Curse, states that Pele's wrath will fall on anyone who removes items from her island. Every year numerous small natural items are returned by post to the National Park Service by tourists seeking Pele's forgiveness. It is believed Pele's Curse was invented in the mid-20th century to deter tourist depredation. When businessman George Lycurgus ran a hotel at the rim of Kƒ´lauea, called the Volcano House from 1904 through 1921, he would often \\"pray\\" to Pele for the sake of the tourists. Park officials frowned upon his practices of tossing items, such as gin bottles (after drinking their contents), into the crater. William Hyde Rice included an 11-page summary of the legends of Pele in his 1923 collection of Hawaiian legends, a reprint of which is available online from the Bernice P. Bishop Museum's Special Publications section. In 2003 the Volcano Art Center had a special competition for Pele paintings to replace one done in the early 20th century by D. Howard Hitchcock displayed in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park visitors center. The existing portrait of what looked like a blond Caucasian as the Hawaiian goddess had been criticized by many Native Hawaiians. Over 140 paintings were submitted, and finalists were displayed at sites within the park. The winner of the contest was artist Arthur Johnsen of Puna. This version shows the goddess in shades of red, with her digging staff P√£'oa in her left hand, and an embryonic form of her sister goddess Hi'iaka in her right hand. The painting is now on display at the Kilauea Visitors Center.

Other data  Pele shares features similar to other malignant deities inhabiting volcanoes, as in the case of the devil Guayota of Guanche Mythology in Canary Islands (Spain), living on the volcano Teide and was considered by the aboriginal Guanches as responsible for the eruptions of the volcano.Ethnografia y anales de la conquista de las Islas Canarias In geology  Pele's hair, a volcanic glass in strands Several phenomena connected to volcanism have been named after her, including Pele's hair, Pele's tears, and Limu o Pele (Pele's seaweed). A volcano on the Jovian moon Io is also named Pele. In popular culture * The musician Tori Amos named an album Boys for Pele in her honor. A single lyrical excerpt from the song \\"Muhammad My Friend\\" makes the only outright connection, \\"You've never seen fire until you've seen Pele blow.\\" However, the entire record deals with the ideas usually associated with Pele, such as feminine \\"fire,\\" or power. Amos claims the title reflects the idea of boys being devoured by Pele, or alternatively, as boys worshiping Pele. * Simon Winchester, in his book Krakatoa, stated about the Pele myth: \\"Like many legends, this old yarn has its basis in fact. The sea attacks volcanoes - the waters and the waves erode the fresh laid rocks. And this is why Pele herself moved, shifting always to the younger and newer volcanoes, and relentlessly away from the older and worn-out islands of the northwest.\\" * In 2004, American composer Brian Balmages composed a piece entitled \\"Pele for Solo Horn and Wind Ensemble\\" on commission by Jerry Peel, professor of French Horn at the University of Miami Frost School of Music. It was premiered by the University of Miami Wind Ensemble under the direction of Gary Green, with Jerry Peel on Horn. * Steven Reineke created a musical composition called \\"Goddess of Fire\\" which was inspired by the story and life of Pele. * In the 1990s a character claiming to be the goddess Pele appeared as a villainess in the DC Comics comic book Superboy. Pele later reappeared in the comic book Wonder Woman where she sought revenge against Wonder Woman for the murder of KƒÅne Milohai, who in that story was her father, at the hands of the Greek god Zeus.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #35-36 * Pele appears on Sabrina, the Teenage Witch in the episode \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Luau\\" as Sabrina's cousin, who gives her the final clue to the family secret. This version of Pele has a humorous tendency to unwittingly set things on fire. * In the Wildefire book series written by Karsten Knight, Pele is one of many deities that are reincarnated in teenagers along the centuries. Ashline Wilde and her two sisters (Evelyn and Rose) represent the spirit of the goddess (the Flame, the Spark and the Fuse), which was divided in three by the Cloak because of the (self)destructiveness of hers. * Pele appears in a 1969 Hawaii Five-0 episode \\"The Big Kahuna\\" in which her appearance is faked by a couple of crooks intent on frightening their uncle into selling his property to them. * The song Budding Trees by Nahko and Medicine for the People references the Hawaiian goddess Pele. * She is a playable Smite (video game) character representing the entire Polynesian pantheon. * She is referenced in the song \\"Israel\\" by Willow Smith off her self titled album, WILLOW.

Volume 5, page 140, Essex He was entrusted with joint custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1568, and appointed Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire in 1569 (which he held through the end of his life). Lord Hereford, as he was now, provided signal service in suppressing the Northern Rebellion of 1569, serving as high marshal of the field under The 3rd Earl of Warwick and Lord Clinton. For his zeal in the service of Queen Elizabeth I on this and other occasions, he was made a Knight of the Garter on 17 June 1572 and was created Earl of Essex and Ewe, and Viscount Bourchier, on 4 May 1572.The titles assumed by the 1st Earl of the Devereux family are attributed to his son in the act of restoration, which recites that ‚Äúthe said Robert, late Earl of Essex, before his said attainder, was lawfully and rightly invested ‚Ä¶ with the name, state, place, and dignity of Earl of Essex and Ewe, Viscount Hereford and Bourchier, Lord Ferrers of Chartley, and Lord Bourchier and Louvaine.‚Äù Eager to give proof of \\"his good devotion to employ himself in the service of her Majesty,\\" Lord Essex, as he was now, offered on certain conditions to subdue or colonise, at his own expense, a portion of the Irish province of Ulster. At that time, Ulster, in the north of Ireland, was completely under the dominion of the O'Neills, led by Sir Brian MacPhelim and Sir Turlough Luineach, and of the Scots led by Sorley Boy MacDonnell. His offer, with certain modifications, was accepted. He set sail for Ireland from Liverpool in August 1573,Jonathan Bardon, A Narrow Sea: The Irish-Scottish Connection in 120 Episodes, p. 80. Gill, Dublin, 2018. accompanied by a number of earls, knights and gentlemen, and with a force of about 1,200 men. His enterprise had an inauspicious beginning; a storm dispersed his fleet and drove some of his vessels as far as Cork and the Isle of Man. His forces did not all reach the place of rendezvous till late in the autumn, and he was compelled to entrench himself at Belfast for the winter. Here his troops were diminished by sickness, famine and desertion to not much more than 200 men. Intrigues of various sorts and fighting of a guerilla type followed, and Essex had difficulties both with his deputy Fitzwilliam and with the Queen. He was in dire straits, and his offensive movements in the east of Ulster took the form of raids and brutal massacres among the O'Neills. In October 1574, he treacherously captured MacPhelim at a conference in Belfast, and after slaughtering his attendants, had MacPhelim, his wife and brother executed at Dublin. He arrested William Piers, who had been active in driving the Scots out of Ulster, and accused him of passing military intelligence to Sir Brian mac Phelim O'Neill. Essex ordered Piers's arrest and detention in Carrickfergus Castle in December 1574, but Piers was freed and he successfully executed Sir Brian mac Phelim O'Neill for treason. After encouraging Lord Essex to prepare to attack the Irish chief Sir Turlough Luineach O'Neill, apparently at the instigation of The 1st Earl of Leicester, the Queen suddenly commanded him to \\"break off his enterprise.\\" However, she left him a certain discretionary power, and he took advantage of that to defeat Sir Turlough Luineach and chastise County Antrim. He also massacred several hundreds of Sorley Boy's following, chiefly women and children, who had hidden in the caves of Rathlin Island in the face of an amphibious assault led by Francis Drake and Sir John Norreys. He returned to England at the end of 1575, resolved \\"to live henceforth an untroubled life.\\" He was, however, persuaded to accept the offer of the Queen to make him Earl Marshal of Ireland. He arrived in Dublin in September 1576, but fell ill at the banquet given in his honour at Dublin Castle, and died three weeks later, probably of dysentery. It was suspected that he had been poisoned at the behest of Lord Leicester, who married his widow two years later. A post-mortem was carried out and concluded that Essex had died of natural causes (although Alice Draycott, daughter of the prominent judge, Henry Draycott, who drank from the same cup at the banquet, also died soon afterwards). He was succeeded in the Earldom of Essex by his son Robert. Marriage and issue In 1561 or 1562, Lord Hereford, as he was at the time, married Lettice Knollys, daughter of Sir Francis Knollys and Catherine Carey.

Major accomplishments of the Drapeau Administration include the development of the Montreal Metro mass transit system, the successful revival of international expositions such as with Expo 67 as well as the construction of a major performing arts centre, the Place des Arts. Drapeau also successfully lobbied for the 1976 Summer Olympics and personally chose its lead architect, Roger Taillibert, to design the city's iconic stadium, athlete's village and inclined tower. Drapeau was also primarily responsible for leading the city's effort to secure a Major League Baseball franchise, with the creation of the Montreal Expos in 1969. Under Drapeau, Montreal solidified its position as Canada's premier urban area, and various projects initiated under his administration foretokened a continental status for the city. This ambition was present until the economic decline of Montreal. Although he is remembered as a visionary, Drapeau's mishandling of the construction of the Olympic Games facilities resulted in massive cost overruns and left the city with a debt of over $1 billion that took its citizens over thirty years to fully pay off.  Early life and career  The son of Joseph-Napol√©on Drapeau and Alberta (Berthe) Martineau, Jean Drapeau was born in Montreal in 1916. His father, an insurance broker, city councilor and election worker for the Union nationale, introduced him to politics. Jean Drapeau studied law at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Drapeau was a prot√©g√© of nationalist priest Lionel Groulx in the 1930s and 1940s,\\" Jean Drapeau\\" in the Canadian Encyclopedia online and was a member of Andr√© Laurendeau's anti-conscription Ligue pour la d√©fense du Canada. In 1942, he ran as a candidate of the nationalist Bloc Populaire, which opposed Canadian conscription during World War II, in a federal by-election (see Second Conscription Crisis). Drapeau lost the election. He was also a Bloc populaire candidate in the 1944 provincial election but was badly defeated in his Montreal constituency. He began his practice as a criminal lawyer in Montreal in 1944. During the Asbestos Strike of 1949, he took on the legal defence of some of the strikers. In 1945, he married Marie-Claire Boucher. They had three sons.  Mayor of Montreal  Jean Drapeau (right) with Premier of Quebec Jean Lesage (left) in June, 1964, at the ceremony to hand over the site of Expo 67 Jean Drapeau's profile grew as the result of his role in a public inquiry led by Pacifique Plante into police corruption in the early 1950s. When Camillien Houde retired as mayor of Montreal, Drapeau was well poised to succeed him. Drapeau was elected mayor of Montreal in 1954 at the age of 37, as the candidate of the Civic Action League, on a platform of cleaning up the administration. He ran an exceptionally wide-flung campaign, uniting a large coalition of voters from English-speaking and French-speaking parts of Montreal. Drapeau's charismatic demeanor, accessible style, and his near- fluency in both English and French (unprecedented for a mayoral candidate) propelled him to such popularity. In 1957, he lost to Sarto Fournier who was backed by the powerful Premier of Quebec Maurice Duplessis, but Drapeau was elected again in the election of 1960 at the helm of his newly-formed Civic Party (Parti Civique). He was re-elected without interruption until he retired from political life in 1986. By the end of the decade, Montreal was a virtual one-party state, with Drapeau and his party only facing nominal opposition in City Hall. During Jean Drapeau's tenure as mayor, he initiated the initial construction of the Montreal Metro subway system, Place des Arts, and Expo 67, the Universal Exposition of 1967. To support the expenditures, Drapeau created the first public lottery in Canada in 1968, which he called simply a \\"voluntary tax\\", an idea that would later gain favour and become enlarged by the provincial government by creating Loto-Qu√©bec corporation in 1970. In 1967, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University. In 1968, he received the Loyola Medal from Loyola College, which later merged with Sir George Williams to found Concordia University. In the municipal elections of October 1970, Drapeau used the proclamation of the War Measures Act and the October Crisis to discredit and neutralize the candidates of the opposition party by accusing them of being terrorist sympathisers and supporters of the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec. Some opposition candidates, including his main opponent, were imprisoned only to be released after the end of the election in which Drapeau's party won all 52 seats. The 1970s saw the preparation of the 1976 Summer Olympics. Cost overruns and scandals forced the Quebec government to take over the project eight months before the Games opened. Almost a year after the Games had ended, Quebec Premier Ren√© L√©vesque appointed a commission to investigate the high cost overruns of the games, led by Quebec supreme court judge Albert Malouf. The inquiry found that Drapeau lacked the competence to organize the Games. Moreover, the Malouf commission found that in conjunction with the serious mistakes that were made, the price tag for the games soared due to a culture of kickbacks. The Summer Games were also marked by Drapeau's controversial decision to dismantle the Corridart public art display just before the Games. Even before the Games debacle, public criticism of Drapeau's municipal administration was already growing. By 1974, a new opposition party had formed in the Montreal Citizens' Movement, which gradually grew in popularity over the next decade. In 1982, Drapeau faced his stiffest competition in decades in the person of MCM leader Jean Dor√©, who held Drapeau to only 48 percent of the vote. Drapeau retired ahead of the 1986 elections. Due to his long tenure, the Civic Party had become Drapeau's personal fief, and he had no clear successor. At the 1986 elections, the Civic Party was heavily defeated by the MCM; it would collapse altogether only eight years later. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed Drapeau to the position of Canadian ambassador to UNESCO in Paris. Despite the nationalism of his youth, Drapeau remained neutral during the 1980 Quebec referendum. In 1967, Drapeau was made a Companion of the Order of Canada and received the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada‚Äôs Gold Medal. He was named a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1987. After his death in 1999 (at age 83), Drapeau was interred in the Cimeti√®re Notre-Dame-des- Neiges in Montreal. One of the biggest parks in Montreal, Parc Jean-Drapeau, composed of √éle Notre-Dame and Ile Sainte-H√©l√®ne in the middle of the Saint Lawrence river, site of the universal exposition of 1967, was renamed in his honour, as was the Metro station serving the park. Quotations Sign of Jean Drapeau in Montreal. Drapeau said \\"The Olympics can no more lose money than a man can have a baby.\\" after announcing the budget for the Montreal Olympic games. Following the Olympics, the city was left with a debt of $1 billion. Aislin published a famous political cartoon depicting a pregnant Drapeau on the phone, saying \\"'Ello, Morgentaler?\\", referring to a prominent Montreal then later Ontarian physician who performed abortions. As rival Toronto grew in size and prestige, Drapeau declared: \\"Let Toronto become Milan. Montreal will always be Rome.\\" This quote was later lampooned in folk wisdom, with one running joke quipping: \\"Montreal will always be Rome... right after the sacking.\\" One opponent called him \\"a combination of Walt Disney and Al Capone.\\" His critics described most of his projects as circuses.

He established a number of forts on the Great Lakes and engaged in a series of battles against the English and the Iroquois. In his first term, he supported the expansion of the fur trade, establishing Fort Frontenac (in what is now Kingston, Ontario) and came into conflict with the other members of the Sovereign Council over its expansion and over the corv√©es required to build the new forts. In particular, despite the opposition of bishop Fran√ßois de Laval, he supported selling brandy to the aboriginal tribes, which Laval considered a mortal sin. The conflict with the Sovereign Council led to his recall in 1682. His second term was characterised by the defence of Quebec from a British invasion during King William's War, a successful guerrilla campaign against the Iroquois and English settlements that resulted in the elimination of the Iroquois threat against New France and a large expansion of the fur trade using Canadian coureurs des bois. He died before his second recall to France. Early life Frontenac was born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France, the son of Henri de Buade, colonel in the regiment of Navarre, and Anne Ph√©lypeaux, daughter of Raymond Ph√©lypeaux. The details of his early life are meager, as no trace of the Frontenac papers have been discovered. The de Buades, however, were a family of distinction in the principality of Bearn. Antoine de Buade, seigneur de Frontenac, grandfather of the future governor of New France, attained eminence as a councilor of state under Henri IV; and his children were brought up with the dauphin, afterwards Louis XIII. Frontenac entered the army at an early age. In 1635 he began his military career and he served under the prince of Orange in Holland, and fought with credit and received many injuries during engagements in the Low Countries and in Italy. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in the regiment of Normandy in 1643, and three years later, after distinguishing himself at the siege of Orbetello, where he had an arm broken, he was made mar√©chal de camp. In the 17th century, warfare ceased during the winter months, and Frontenac, being a soldier, needed to keep occupied. Like many military officers, Frontenac took residence at the King's court. Such a lavish lifestyle proved to be costly, and his time at the King's court only led him to amass more debt. His growing debt led him to seek an Arr√™t du Conseil d'√©tat later in his life in order to protect his properties from his creditors who otherwise would have been able to seize them. Frontenac married Anne de La Grange-Trianon in October 1648. His service seems to have been continuous until the conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, when he returned to his father's house in Paris and married, without the consent of her parents, Anne de la Grange-Trianon in October 1648. Frontenac courted her because she was set to inherit a large sum of money from her deceased mother and her father upon his death. Anne de la Grange-Trianon's father had remarried and had a second child to ensure that his fortune would not go to his daughter and the son-in-law that he disapproved of. Therefore, when Frontenac's father-in-law died, Frontenac did not receive the money he was hoping for as his wife's father left his fortune to his new wife. The marriage was not a happy one, and after the birth of a son incompatibility of temper led to a separation, the count retiring to his estate on the Indre, where by an extravagant course of living, he became hopelessly in debt. Little is known of his career for the next fifteen years beyond the fact that he held a high position at court, but in 1669, when France sent a contingent to assist the Venetians in the defense of Crete against the Turks, Frontenac was placed in command of the troops on the recommendation of Turenne. In this expedition he won military glory, but his fortune was not improved. In 1664, Frontenac admitted to owing debt of 325,878 livres plus 17,350 livres of interest to his creditors,W. J. Eccles, Frontenac: The Courtier Governor (Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1959), 23. which was not repaid by 1672 when his property was seized by creditors.Arthur Quinn, A New World: An Epic of Colonial America from the Founding of Jamestown to the Fall of Quebec (Boston: Faber & Faber, 1994), 277 Frontenac, however, was offered the position of governor-general of New France which deferred his debts until the end of his governorship. Frontenac was appointed governor and lieutenant general of New France, Acadia, the island of Newfoundland on 7 April 1672 and arrived in Quebec on the 7 September that same year. A 17th-century painting of Anne de la Grange-Trianon can be seen today at the Chateau de Versailles. First term in New France At this period the affairs of New France claimed the unexpected attention of the French court. From the year 1665 the colony had been successfully administered by three men: Daniel de R√©my de Courcelle, the governor, Jean Talon, the intendant, and the Marquis de Tracy, who had been appointed lieutenant general for the French king in America; but a difference of opinion had arisen between the governor and the intendant, and each had demanded the other's recall in the public interest. At this crisis in the administration of New France, Frontenac was appointed to succeed R√©my de Courcelle. From the beginning of Frontenac's term, it was evident that he was prepared effect a policy of colonial expansion. He was also anxious to inaugurate an era of prosperity for Canada. He exercised an independence of action that did not coincide with the views of his minister Colbert. As governor, Frontenac was the most powerful figure within the colony. Among his most prominent duties as governor, Frontenac maintained control over military matters and foreign affairs. Situated within the context of the French colony throughout the seventeenth century, foreign affairs largely encompassed the relations between French settlers and indigenous peoples.Eccles, Frontenac, 2‚Äì3. Although the governor was not allowed to intervene in matters handled by the Sovereign Council and the intendant, persons in these formal posts had to respect the governor as the ultimate voice of authority. Such compliance was based on the notion that the governor was the king's representative. The governor was not merely an intermediary or a stand-in. The governor extended the king's authority from France to the North American colony. As one of his first acts as governor, he established his presence as the sovereign delegate of the king by establishing in Canada the three estates ‚Äì nobles, clergy and people ‚Äì and convening a colonial Estates General to pledge fealty to him.Quinn, A New World, 296. The arrival of the governor implied that all of the colony's settlers pledge allegiance to the king. Frontenac did not take this lightly. The royal policy, however, was adverse to the granting of extensive political rights to the Canadians, and Frontenac's reforms in this direction were disapproved. In relation to the hierarchy of authority within the colonial setting, any check on the governor's power was absent. In Frontenac's case, France's finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who resided in France, could only impose restraints upon the governor's powers.Eccles, Frontenac, 31. Thus, measures were adopted to curb his ambition by increasing the power of the Sovereign Council and by reviving the office of intendant. Responding to his reduction in the Sovereign Council to a figurehead, he expressed his infuriation by challenging the authority of the intendant, Jacques Duchesnau and demanding that the council refer to him as the \\"chief and president\\".Eccles, Frontenac, 134-36. Frontenac, however, was a dominant man, jealous of authority, prepared to exact obedience from all and to yield to none. In the course of events he soon became involved in quarrels with the intendant touching questions of precedence and with the ecclesiastics, one or two of whom ventured to criticize his proceedings. The church in New France had been administered for many years by the religious orders; for the see of Quebec, so long contemplated, had not yet been erected. But three years after the arrival of Frontenac, a former vicar apostolic, Fran√ßois-Xavier de Montmorency-Laval, returned to Quebec as bishop, with a jurisdiction over the whole of New France. The governor found a vigorous opponent in de Montmorency- Laval, who was determined to render the state subordinate to the church. Frontenac, following in this respect in the footsteps of his predecessors, had issued trading licenses which permitted the sale of intoxicants. The bishop, supported by the intendant, tried to suppress this trade and sent an ambassador to France to obtain remedial action. The views of the bishop were upheld and authority was divided. Troubles ensued between the governor and the Sovereign Council, over its expansion and over the corv√©es required to build the new forts. In particular, despite the opposition of bishop Fran√ßois de Laval, he supported selling brandy to the First Nations, which Laval considered a mortal sin. The king and his minister had to listen to and adjudicate upon the appeals from the contending parties until one incident tried their patience. After the adolescent son of Duchesneau was verbally abused on the street by a follower of Frontenac, Frontenac physically assaulted him with his cane when he deemed his explanation unacceptable and, after negotiation between himself, the intendant and the bishop, an officer of Frontenac detained and imprisoned Duchesneau's son.Eccles, Frontenac, 149-51. Under the king's edict of 1679, it was forbidden for a governor to arbitrarily imprison any subjects.Eccles, Frontenac, 151. Following a deliberation in Versailles, both governor and intendant were recalled to France in the year 1682. During Frontenac's first administration many improvements had been made in the country. The defenses had been strengthened, a fort was built at Cataraqui (now Kingston, Ontario), bearing the governor's name, and conditions of peace had been fairly maintained between the Iroquois on the one hand and the French and their allies, the Ottawas and the Hurons, on the other. Frontenac made his way to Cataraqui to build his post that would facilitate trading with the Iroquois Confederacy. Even though Frontenac was disobeying Colbert's policies, he was able to continuously act in such a way because he represented the king. Throughout his first term, Frontenac was engaging in the fur trade to increase his own fortune and those of his associates. According to La Salle, in his personal memoir, Frontenac was also trying to secure a monopoly over a large part of the fur trade.Eccles, Frontenac, 79. The progress of events during the next few years proved that the recall of the governor had been ill-timed. The Iroquois were assuming a threatening attitude towards the inhabitants, and Frontenac's successor, La Barre, was quite incapable of leading an army against such foes. At the end of a year, La Barre was replaced by the Marquis de Denonville, a man of ability and courage, who, though he showed some vigour in marching against the western Iroquois tribes, angered rather than intimidated them, and the massacre of Lachine on 5 August 1689 must be regarded as one of the unhappy results of his administrations. Second term in New France Reception for Frontenac's return to Quebec in October 1689. The affairs of the colony were now critical. A man of experience and decision was needed to cope with the difficulties, and Louis XIV, chose Frontenac to represent and uphold the power of France. When on 17 October 1689, Frontenac arrived in Quebec as governor for the second time, he received an enthusiastic welcome, and confidence was at once restored in the public mind. Quebec was not long to enjoy peace. Frontenac's return to New France during the Nine Years' War offered him an opportunity to display his military capabilities against England in North America.Quinn, A New World, 277. Despite the tensions created during his first term as governor-general, Frontenac was still unwilling to share power with the Sovereign Council and continued to profit from the Canadian fur trade.Eccles, Frontenac, 274-75. In January 1690, Frontenac approved the use of raiding parties composed of Canadians and Indigenous allies to ravage English border settlements. These parties raided the towns of Schenectady and Salmon Falls and murdered English settlers, but spared the Iroquois.Eccles, Frontenac, 224-26 The raids were intended to deter the English from forming an alliance with the Iroquois, but instead united the English colonies against New France. On October 16, 1690, several New England ships under the command of Sir William Phips, governor of Massachusetts, appeared off the Island of Orl√©ans, and an officer was sent ashore to demand the surrender of the fort. Frontenac, bold and fearless, responded with the famous words: \\"Non, je n'ai point de r√©ponse √† faire √† votre g√©n√©ral que par la bouche de mes canons et de mes fusils.\\" (\\"No, I have no reply to make to your general other than from the mouths of my cannons and muskets.\\"). Frontenac completely repulsed the enemy, who in their hasty retreat left behind a few pieces of artillery on the Beauport shore. William Phipps demanding the surrender of Quebec prior to the Battle of Quebec in 1690. The prestige of the governor was increased by this event, and he was prepared to follow up his advantage by an attack on Boston from the sea, but his resources were inadequate. New France now rejoiced in a brief respite from her enemies, and during the interval Frontenac encouraged the revival of the drama at the Chateau St-Louis and paid some attention to the social life of the colony. New France had been under intermittent attack throughout the 17th century. The people, however, were not subdued and for two years after the Phips attack, petty warfare was maintained. The sufferings of the colony, infested by war parties, were extreme. The fur trade, which formed its only resource for subsistence, was completely cut off, and a great accumulation of furs remained in the trading posts of the upper lakes, prevented from descending by the watchful enemy. To meet the threat, he dispatched Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes to establish a trading post and fort at Kekionga, present day Fort Wayne, Indiana.\\"Vincennes, Sieur de (Jean Baptiste Bissot),\\" The Encyclopedia Americana (Danbury, CT: Grolier, 1990), 28:130. At a grand council of the friendly tribes, Frontenac took up a hatchet, brandished it in the air, and sang the war song, his officers following his example. The Christian Indians of the neighboring missions rose and joined them, and so did the Hurons and the Algonquins of Lake Nipissing, while Frontenac led the dance, whooping like the rest. His allies promised war to the death, and several years of conflict followed. After three years of destitution and misery, Frontenac broke the blockade of the Ottawa; the coveted treasure came safely to Montreal, and the colonists hailed him as their father and deliverer. Frontenac with indigenous allies, c. 1690. In 1696 Frontenac decided to take the field against the Iroquois, although at this time he was 74 years old. On July 6 he left Lachine at the head of a considerable force for the village of the Onondagas, where he arrived a month later. In the meantime the Iroquois had abandoned their villages, and as pursuit was impracticable, the army commenced its return march on August 10. Frontenac endured the march as well as the youngest soldier, and for his courage and prowess he received the cross of St. Louis. Under Frontenac's leadership, the Canadian militia became increasingly adept at guerrilla warfare and took the war into Iroquois territory and attacked a number of English settlements.Quinn, A New World, 320-21. After waging a war of attrition between 1690 and 1698, the Iroquois fled the raided territory and negotiated for peace with the French.Quinn, A New World, 325-26. The result was that the threat of the Iroquois to New France was finally diffused. At the time of his second appointment as governor in 1689, France authorized the importation of slaves to Quebec from the West Indies. Frontenac died on 28 November 1698 at the Chateau St-Louis after a brief illness, deeply mourned by the Canadian people. The faults of the governor were those of temperament. His nature was turbulent, and from his youth he had been used to command, but underlying a rough exterior there was evidence of a kindly heart. He was fearless, resourceful and decisive, and triumphed as few men could have done over the difficulties and dangers of a most critical position. Quebec's most famous building and landmark, the Ch√¢teau Frontenac, is named after him, as is the Kingston Frontenacs ice hockey team. In Ontario, Frontenac Provincial Park near the site of the former Fort Frontenac and Fort Cataraqui (present day Kingston), is also named in his honour. In Qu√©bec, Frontenac National Park commemorates his governorship and leadership of Canada during challenging period of war with the English colonies.

MacDonnell is best known for establishing the MacDonnell clan in Antrim and resisting the campaign of Shane O'Neill and the English crown to expel the clan from Ireland. Sorley Boy's connection to other Irish Catholic lords was complicated, but also culturally and familiarly strong: for example, he married Mary O'Neill the daughter of Conn O'Neill.  Clan MacDonnell  The MacDonnells of Antrim were a sept of the powerful Clan Donald of the royal Clann Somhairle, (see Lords of the Isles), that the English crown had attempted to cultivate since the early 14th century in its efforts to influence the course of politics in Scotland. At the end of that century an ancestor of Sorley's, E√≤in M√≤r T√†naiste Mac Dh√≤mhnaill, had married Margaret Bisset, of the lordship on the Antrim coast known as the Glynns or Glens, which union would eventually lay the basis for Sorley Boy's claim to the lordship of that territory in Ireland. MacDonnell migration to the Glynns and Rathlin Island increased in the early 16th century (by way of swift galleys propelled by oar and sail), after the clan had rejected overtures from an increasingly powerful James IV, King of Scotland. However, the last known lord of the Mac Eoin Bissetts, a supporter of the O'Neills, was slain in battle in 1522,Annals of the Four Masters 1522.9 and it is only after this that the MacDonnells somehow emerge as claimants to the lordship. The precise circumstances of this transfer or encroachment have been lost to history, but the English authorities, themselves preparing to claim overlordship in Ulster and the rest of Ireland, still recognised the Bissetts as the lords of the Glynns as late as 1515.State Papers, Henry the Eighth. Volume II. pp. 7, 27 The English feared the formation of a fifth column, with the Ulster clans of O'Neill and O'Donnell, which might lay the foundation of a Bruce-style invasion of Ireland, and the clan did spread into the adjacent territories of Clandeboy and the Route. This migration from Scotland was cemented when the king's successor, James V, chose to maintain favourable relations with the rival Clan Campbell, although he did swing around to favour the MacDonnells in the 1530s, restoring certain lands to them in Kintyre and Islay while encouraging their expansion in Ireland. This period of royal favour ended with the defeat in 1539 at the Battle of Belahoe of a combined Irish force (including the MacDonnells) by an English army: Scottish plans for an invasion of Ireland were then put off, while the French invasion of England that King Henry VIII had feared failed to occur.  Military Leader  Once the invasion crisis had passed, the MacDonnells resisted efforts by the English and Scots governments to drive them from their lands in the Western Isles of Scotland and Ulster in Ireland. Sorley Boy was born at Dunanynie Castle near Ballycastle, County Antrim in Ireland, and came to prominence during the mid- to-late 16th century, when the Dublin administration waged periodic campaigns in the Route. During the first campaign in 1550, Sorley Boy was taken prisoner and confined in Dublin Castle for twelve months, and was finally released in exchange for certain prisoners held by his brother, James, who was leader of the clan. After his release, Sorley Boy received a large ransom upon seizing the constable of Carrickfergus Castle, and went on to subjugate the MacQuillans. This clan was the immediate rival of the MacDonnells in Ireland, dominating the northern portion of Antrim ‚Äì the Route ‚Äì with their stronghold at Dunluce Castle, near the mouth of the River Bush. In 1558, the MacDonnell chieftain committed to him the lordship of the Route upon the death of his brother Colla, and Sorley Boy promptly raised a force of troops on the Scottish coast to confront the MacQuillans, former allies of the MacDonell clan. He landed at Marketon Bay in July 1559, where the MacQuillans were strongly posted at the foot of Glenshesk, his camp at Bonamargy was attacked with both suffering heavy losses. Sorley then attacked them at Beal a Faula, driving them south with heavy losses. Several bloody encounters followed, where the MacQuillans were defeated and driven from the Route. Sorley Boy was now too powerful and turbulent to be neglected by Queen Elizabeth and her ministers, who were also being troubled by his great contemporary, Shane O'Neill. For the next twenty years, the history of Ulster consists for the most part of alternating conflict and alliance between MacDonnells and O'Neills, and attempts on the part of the English government to subdue them both. With this object Elizabeth aimed at fomenting the rivalry between the two clans; she came to terms sometimes with the one and sometimes with the other. One event that simplified the situation for the queen was the success in 1560 of the Protestant revolution in Scotland, which largely removed the threat of invasion her father had suffered in 1539. But complications were never wanting in Ulster, owing to the criss-cross of dynastic and political allegiances and betrayals. At this time Shane O'Neill was allied by marriage with the Campbells, the MacDonnell clan's chief rival in Scotland; yet Sorley Boy's wife was a half-sister of the same Shane.  Clan Chief  Upon Elizabeth's accession in 1559 Sorley Boy had submitted to her authority under Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, then Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and in return was confirmed in his Irish possessions. In 1562 Shane O'Neill paid his celebrated visit to London, where he obtained recognition by Elizabeth of his claims as head of the O'Neills. But in 1563, Sussex mounted a campaign against O'Neill, in which Sorley Boy played his part. Sussex retired in frustration, and O'Neill entered into a sustained offensive against the MacDonnells, ostensibly in the interests of ridding the English of Scottish interference in Ireland: he defeated Sorley Boy near Coleraine in the summer of 1564, laying waste his territory; in 1565 he invaded the Glynns, destroying all Scottish settlements there, and at the Battle of Glentasie he won a decisive victory, in which James MacDonnell and Sorley Boy were taken prisoner and Dunluce Castle fell into O'Neill's hands. James died soon afterward, but Sorley Boy remained O'Neill's captive until 1567, during which period he seems to have won his captor's confidence. After his unexpected defeat by the O'Donnells in the battle of Farsetmore, O'Neill turned to the MacDonnells for assistance and attended a feast laid on by them at Cushendun, bringing with him out of captivity Sorley Boy and his late brother's widow, Agnes, to secure an alliance with the Scots. In an event which seems to have had the approbation of the lord deputy of Ireland, Henry Sidney, O'Neill was stabbed and murdered by his hosts. Sorley Boy visited Scotland immediately and returned to Marketon Bay with 600 redshanks, in whose presence he swore never to leave Ireland. In 1569, an alliance between the O'Neills and MacDonnells was secured upon the marriage on Rathlin Island of Shane's successor, Turlough Luineach O'Neill, to the widow Agnes. Sorley Boy spent the next few years in striving to frustrate the schemes of Sir Thomas Smith, and later of the Earl of Essex, for colonising Ulster with English settlers. (See Plantations of Ireland for details). He was willing to come to terms with the government provided his claims to the lands were allowed, but Essex determined to reduce him to unconditional submission. After a retreat into Scotland, Sorley Boy returned and made an unsuccessful attempt on the crown garrison at Carrickfergus. In time, he did come to terms with Smith, who supported his claims to title in the Route on condition that he take up the reformed religion. In 1573, letters of denization were addressed to Sorley Boy from the crown, but Essex frustrated these with the renewal of his plantation scheme; still, Sorley Boy managed to hold his position, when Essex failed in his negotiation with the Scottish regent and the Earl of Argyll of a withdrawal of the Scots from Ulster. Essex then switched tack, having struck a deal with Turlough Luineach, and defeated Sorley Boy around Castle Toome, where the Bann flows out of Lough Neagh. Essex had to withdraw to Carrickfergus for lack of provisions, but he then ordered a follow-up operation, with the intention of driving the Scots from Ulster. Under the commands of John Norreys and Francis Drake an amphibious strike force proceeded by sea from Carrickfergus to Rathlin Island, where Sorley Boy's children and valuables, together with the families of his principal retainers, had been lodged for safety; and while the chieftain was himself at Ballycastle, within sight of the island, the women and children (perhaps 700) were massacred by the English. Sorley Boy retaliated with a successful raid on Carrickfergus, in which the garrison broke before a highland charge, and managed to partly re-establish his power in the Glynns and the Route. In 1583, taking advantage of Sorley's perceived weakness through the absence of a significant number of MacDonnell warriors, who had been hired by Turlough Luineach O'Neill for a campaign in the west, the Mac Quillans made their last great attempt to decisively defeat the MacDonnells and recover the Route. In alliance with Sir Hugh MacPhelim 'Bacach' O'Niall of Edenduffcarrig (Shane's Castle, Randlestown) and accompanied by two companies of English shot 'sent from the pale' and commanded by the newly appointed Senechel of Clandeboye, Captain Chatterton, the Mac Quillans launched a devastating raid on the northern glens. Sorley assembled a small force which threatened the main camp of the raiders sited on a broad ridge near Slieve na Orra. The cavalry and heavy infantry of the raiders were tricked into charging the small, apparently vulnerable, MacDonnell host across what they believed to be sound ground but what was in fact a deep bog, where they were incapacitated and decisively defeated by the MacDonnells. Hugh Mac Phelim and Chatterton fled, but were hunted down and killed near the summit of Orra while Rory Oge MacQuillan sought refuge on a crannog at Loughgile, where he was killed by a pursuer. This action is called the battle of Slieve-an-aura and has been inaccurately dated to 1559 by a number of sources, following Rev. George Hill's history, The MacDonnells of Antrim. The accurate date has been preserved in the State Papers for Ireland.Hector McDonnell, A Fragment of an Irish MS History of the MacDonalds of Antrim, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Third Series, vol. 64, 2005, pgs 142-3; Hector McDonnell, A Sword from the Battle of Orra, The Irish Sword, vol xx, no.81, pgs 253‚Äì259; Hans Claude Hamilton [ed]Caledar of State Papers, Ireland, vol ii, 1574‚Äì1585, London, 1867, pg 418, 440, 443 On surveying the results, Lord Deputy Sidney agreed to a ceasefire, although he supported the claims of the MacQuillans to the Route, and of Sorley Boy's nephews (sons of the widow Agnes) to possession of the Glens ‚Äì a typical Campbell manoeuvre, effected through their alliance with Turlough Luineach. At the same time, Sidney forwarded to London Sorley Boy's petition for title, although it sat there without response for years. With fortitude, the MacDonnells managed to strengthen their position through an alliance with Turlough Luineach, and by a formidable immigration of followers from the Scottish Isles following their decisive victory at Aura.  Ambition achieved  For some years the politics of eastern Ulster were maintained in a balance. But in 1584 the recently arrived lord deputy of Ireland, Sir John Perrot, led his army into the province in a determined effort to dislodge the Scots. Following an expedition to Scotland in search of reinforcements, Sorley Boy landed at Cushendun in January 1585 with a substantial army, but after initial successes he was driven back to Scotland, where he offered to accept the terms formerly put to him by Sidney; Perrot declined, whereupon Sorley Boy returned and regained possession of Dunluce Castle. Perrot reluctantly opened negotiations with Sorley Boy, sending as his emissary Sir William Warren, whose father Humphrey had been on good terms with Sorley during Sussex's Deputyship. Warren persuaded Sorley to come to terms, and in the summer of 1586 he repaired to Dublin and made submission to Elizabeth's representative. When shown the severed head of his son, which had been nailed above the gate of Dublin Castle, Sorley Boy gave the memorable response, \\"My son hath many heads\\". Having made his submission, Sorley Boy at last obtained a grant to himself and his heirs of the greater part of the Route country, between the rivers Bann and Bush (an area then called the Boys), with certain other lands to the east, and was made constable of Dunluce Castle. A month beforehand, Sorley Boy's nephew had received a grant in similar terms of the greater part of the Glynns. At the same time, in the Treaty of Berwick, a clause was inserted recognising the right of the Clan MacDonnell to remain in Ireland. Sorley Boy gave no further trouble to the English government, although he did assist survivors of the Spanish Armada to escape Ireland in 1588 (see Girona). He died in 1590 at the very place of his birth, the Castle of Dunanynie, and was buried in the traditional place of the MacDonnells, Bonamargy Friary at Ballycastle.  Legacy  Prior to the Plantation of Ulster in 1610, Sorley Boy had been the most powerful of the province's Scoto-Irish. Owing to his efforts, successive Tudor and Stuart administrations in England and Scotland were presented with ongoing strategic difficulties in the region of east Ulster and south-west Scotland. During the previous forty years, he had played those difficulties with courage, skill and deception, to the point that MacDonnell claims were largely accepted and the clan's fortunes secured. This period of Irish history throws up few winners, but Sorley Boy can be counted among them.  Family  By his first wife, Mary, daughter of Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone, their children were: *Alaster MacDonnell, Killed in battle in 1585 *Donnell MacDonnell *James MacDonnell, Died on 13 April 1601 at Dunluce Castle *Randal MacDonnell Earl of Antrim d. 10 December 1636 *Angus MacDonnell *Ludar MacDonnell *unknown daughter married a chief of Clan Macnaghten *unknown daughter married a chief of Clan McQuillan *unknown daughter married Cormack O'Neill *unknown daughter married Magennis, Lord of Iveagh *unknown daughter married Shane O'Neill of Clandeboye In 1588, when he was past the age of eighty years, his second wife, was a daughter of Turlough Luineach O'Neill, a kinswoman of his first wife. Two of his five daughters married members of the O'Neill family. By his first marriage Sorley Boy had several sons (known as the MacSorleys): two were killed, and Randal, who was created earl of Antrim, is the ancestor of the present holder of that title. It was to Randal that King James I renewed the grants of the Route and the Glynns. Citations References *See G.

Prosthetic makeup goes back to the beginning of film making with A Trip to the Moon (French: Le Voyage dans la Lune), a 1902 French adventure short film directed by Georges M√©li√®s where the man on the moon effect was accomplished using a combination of makeup and a prosthetic type mask with added pastes. The makeup artist Jack Pierce was another early Hollywood make-up artist, best remembered for creating the iconic makeup worn by Boris Karloff in Frankenstein, his makeup for the Wolfman, and more. Modern prosthetic makeup was revolutionized by John Chambers, whose work can be seen in Planet of the Apes, as well as Dick Smith's work in Little Big Man, Stan Winston in the Terminator series, and Rob Bottin in The Thing. Many of the techniques developed during that period are still regularly used in the field today. Additionally, many of these artists taught and inspired the next generation of Special Effects makeup artists, who in turn developed more advanced techniques for effects makeup, including developing different materials, animatronics and incorporating added computer elements. Technique The process of creating a makeup prosthetic appliance typically begins with concept art, created by the artist or production. Once the actor has been chosen, the effects artist will prepare the actor for the process of taking a mold of the actor's face, head or body part. This process is called lifecasting. Lifecast molds are made from prosthetic alginate or more recently, from skin-safe platinum silicone rubber. This initial mold can be relatively weak but flexible. A hard mother mold, also known as a jacket or matrix, is typically made of plaster or fiberglass which is created over the outside of the initial flexible mold to provide support. This mold is used to cast a copy of that part of the actor, in a hard resin or plaster type material to eventually use as a base for sculpting the prosthetic. This is considered a \\"positive\\" or lifecast. Before sculpting the clay prosthetic over the positive, The positive must be prepared by adding \\"keys\\" or mold points along the edges of it, which are often added using clay or more plaster or carved into the lifecast, to make sure that the two pieces of the mold will fit together correctly. Often the lifecast will be given an additional border in clay or plaster in order to have an area free of detail and undercuts to add these keys. The entire lifecast with borders and keys included is then molded. This ensures a stable area with built in keys to sculpt the prosthetic over. This also provides the artist an easily duplicated copy, if needed. Multiple copies are typically used to make variations or stages of prosthetics or different prosthetics for the same actor. Lifecasts of full bodies and body parts are also used and reused as the basis for making fake body parts, severed limbs, and various \\"gore\\" type effects used in horror films or films where body parts are required. The prosthetic required will be sculpted over the lifecast of that body part to become the design intended. For example, if the desired look is a pig nosed person then the artist would sculpt the pig nose over the actors real nose on the lifecast or positive copy. The edges of the clay should be made as thin as possible, for the clay is a stand-in for what will eventually be the prosthetic piece. Once sculpted, the new addition of the clay sculpted prosthetic part must be molded. Since the positive has been prepared with the additional boarder and keys, it actually becomes part of the prosthetic mold itself. Once molded, and clay removed, new mold cleaned out, the positive is one part of the mold and the new mold is the other side which has the negative of the newly sculpted prosthetic. This gives two or more pieces of a mold - a positive of the face or body part, and one (or more for complex molds) \\"negative\\" mold piece(s) with prosthetic sculpted in. To make the new prosthetic, material is cast into the mold cavity (where the clay used to be). The prosthetic material can be foam latex, gelatin, silicone or other similar materials. The prosthetic is cured within the two part mold. The prosthetic is carefully removed and prepared for painting and or application to the actor.  Conflict with CGI  As the film/television industry continues to grow, so do the capabilities of the technologies behind it. Since the debut of newer technologies, many have feared that CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) will put practical SFX makeup out of business. CGI can be used to accomplish effects that simply aren't possible when working in practical effects. Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis, two experienced SFX artists from Amalgamated Dynamics near L.A., share what they see as the middle ground on the subject. In an interview, they explain that most movies use (out of necessity) a combination of practical effects and CGI. They see CGI as a tool that can be utilized in a good way or a bad way, just like practical effects. Tom Savini (an SFX artist known for his work in Dawn of the Dead and Creepshow) states: \\"They still use the make-up guys to design the creatures and that‚Äôs what they work from. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see make-up effects guys hanging out on corners with signs that say: WILL DO EFFECTS FOR FOOD.‚Äù  Real-world use  Moulage is a process in which makeup is used to simulate different wounds and trauma in order to prepare medical, emergency, and military personnel for what they could experience in the field and lessen psychological trauma. Other real world uses are to create real disguises for Government agencies such as the F.B.I., C.I.A., Department of Justice, used to infiltrate possible terrorist groups. Special effects artists can create and apply special effects makeup prosthetics to undercover agents to gather intelligence for combating international terrorism. Disguises let officers and agents move around as another person to complete undercover work without jeopardizing their actual identity. Another real word use of prosthetics is the appearance of wounds to emulate death to be used by agencies such as the police departments to make someone appear as the victim of a murder during \\" hit or murder for hire \\" stings. If a suspect hires a hit-man (killer) to murder someone, the police are able to stage a set of pictures or video to make the suspect believe that the \\"hit\\" or murder has been carried out. These situations are made to gather evidence on the suspect before the actual crime of murder has been committed.

He is often linked to his brother-in-law M√©dard des Groseilliers. The decision of Radisson and Groseilliers to enter the English service led to the formation of the Hudson's Bay Company. His career was particularly notable for its repeated transitions between serving Britain and France. There is no image of him other than that provided in his writings and those of the people who encountered him in New France, in Paris on the fringes of the court, on remote Hudson Bay, and in late Stuart London. Radisson has been seen by the historian Germaine Warkentin primarily as a reporter of the historical events he witnessed, and in their view was not always a reliable one because he was undoubtedly devious. Radisson should be considered in multiple contexts; for his achievement as a narrator of his own life, the range of his explorations, his experiences among the Indigenous peoples, and his social formation, both as a man of the early modern period for whom personal honour was an important value and as a working trader participating in the mercantile projects of the era. Radisson's life and writings have been interpreted from many different perspectives, such as that of French Canadians, who until the twentieth century accepted the verdict of his French contemporaries that he was a traitor to France. Early life =Birth and emigration to New France= Pierre-Esprit Radisson's birthplace is unclear, but was likely in France's lower Rh√¥ne region near the town Avignon. A 1697 affidavit and a 1698 petition selfreport his ages as 61 and 62, respectively, suggesting birth in 1636. Yet a 1681 census in New France, Canada, reported his age as 41, suggesting birth in 1640, which coheres with baptismal records, from Carpentras, a city near Avignon, France, that concern Radisson's father, Pierre-Esprit Radisson Sr. Radisson would trace his family, the Hayet- Radissons, to the town St. Malo, whereas records suggest either Paris or Avignon. According to Radisson, he emigrated from France to Canada on 24 May 1651. He may have arrived with his two sisters, √âlisabeth and Fran√ßoise, and perhaps with his maternal half-sister Marguerite Hayet, who would eventually marry Radisson's eventual fur-trading partner M√©dard Chouat Des Groseilliers. By sometime in 1651, all three women were living together in Trois-Rivi√®res. =Capture, adoption, and torture by Iroquois= In 1651 or 1652, hunting fowl near his Trois-Rivi√®res home, a petty squabble separated Radisson from his hunting group. After discovering its several men killed by a Mohawk raiding party, he was captured by the Iroquois. Perhaps because of his youth, he received fairly mild treatment and, as he showed interest in Mohawk language and culture, was assimilated. In a Mohawk custom of adopting young captives, whether indigenous or European, to replace relatives lost to disease or warfare, Radisson joined a local Mohawk family near modernday Schenectady in New York state. Not long after Radisson's integration, which took about six weeks, while out hunting with three Iroquois, he met an Algonquin man who convinced him to defect and return to Trois-Rivi√®res. Together, they killed Radisson's Iroquois companions, travelled 14 days, and sighted the town, but then were captured by patrolling Iroquois. The Mohawks killed the Algonquin and subjected Radisson, along with some 20 prisoners, to ritual torture, although his adoptive, Mohawk family advocated for him and materially compensated the bereaved families to spare him execution and temper his torture. As the Iroquois despised cowardice and punished it with death, Radisson's adoptive parents advised him to be brave and yet not too brave, since the Iroquois also sometimes ate the hearts of exceptionally brave men to acquire their courage. Radisson's fingernails were pulled out while he was forced to sing, one finger was cut to the bone, and he watched ten Huron Indians get tortured to death. The next day, an old man burned Radisson, tied to a scaffold, and a young man drove a red-hot dagger though his foot. After three days of similar treatment, the Iroquois brought out Huron prisoners and, using tomahawks, bashed in the heads of some, whereas the rest were then adopted by Iroquois families. Once eventually released, the overwhelmed Radisson found that, as he would recall, \\"all my paines and griefs ceased, not feeling the least paine. [My father] bids me be merry, makes me sing, to wich I consented with all my heart.\\" He felt deep gratitude to his adoptive parents, whom he described as very loving, for saving his life. By Iroquois standards, Radisson's torture had been moderate, whereas Radisson himself recounts witnessing gruesome torture: \\"They burned a Frenchwoman; they pulled out her breasts, and took a child out of her belly, with they broyled [broiled] and made the mother eat it, so in short she died\\". Sometime after his own wounds healed, Radisson spent some five months on a war-party expedition. =Departure from Iroquois and missionary work= With other Mohawk warriors, Radisson traveled to a trading ship at Fort Orange, then controlled by the Dutch, in present-day Albany, New York. There, a governor recognized him as a Frenchman and offered to pay for his freedom. Radisson instead returned to the Iroquois village, but, regretting this, escaped on 29 October 1653, \\"at 8 of the clock in the morning\\". Again at Fort Orange, he met Jesuit priest Joseph Antoine Poncet, who made him \\"a great offer\\", whereby he returned to Holland in early 1654 under an agreement now unclear but perhaps involving missionary work. Later that year, 1654, Radisson returned to Trois- Rivi√®res. Over the next three years, he would embark on several missionary expeditions. His writings largely ignoring this period, little is known about his whereabouts during it, apart from information in a deed of sale that he signed in November 1655. In 1657, Radisson accompanied a joint Franco‚ÄìHuron‚ÄìIroquois expedition into Onondaga Iroquois territory to aid a local Jesuit mission and promote further fur trading. In 1658, under rising tensions with local Iroquois, the French left, ending the expedition. Radisson soon returned to Qu√©bec. Career Radisson's biggest impact in Canadian history came from 1658 to 1684, when he was an active coureur-des-bois, fur trader and explorer. In August of 1659, Radisson persuaded his brother-in-law, M√©dard Chouart des Groseilliers, to hire him for his journey around Lake Superior. The reason for the year-long trip was to collect furs, in order to participate in the ever-lucrative fur trade. In the winter of 1659‚Äì1660, Radisson and Des Groseilliers lived just south of Lake Superior in what is now Wisconsin, associating with groups of Huron, Ottawa, Ojibwa and Sioux Indians. When Radisson arrived at an Ojibwa village on the shores of Lake Superior, where he spent much of the winter, he gave three types of presents to the men, women and children of the village. Radisson wrote that to the men he gave \\"...a kettle, two hatchets [tomahawks], and six knives and a blade for a sword\\", to the women \\"...2 and 20 awls, 50 needles, 2 graters [scrapers] of castors, 2 ivory combs and 2 wooden ones, with red painte [vermilion], 6 looking-glasses of tin\\", and to the children \\"...brasse rings, of small bells, and rasades [beads] of divers colors...\\". American historian Bruce White wrote that Radission and Des Groseilliers did not entirely understand Ojibwa society as the kettles were used much more by the women than by the men, while the gift of paint and make-up for the women ignored the fact that Ojibwa men used make-up and painted their faces just as much as Ojibwa women did. Kettles played a prominent role in the Huron holiday of the Feast of the Dead, and Radisson appears to have believed that the Ojibwa men would appreciate the gift of a kettle for their own version of the Feast of the Dead. On the other hand, White noted that the two Frenchmen clearly understood some aspects of Ojibwa gender very well, as the gift of tomahawks for the men reflected that Ojibwa men were hunters and warriors while the gift of awls for the women reflected that Ojibwa women gathered rice, gardened, cooked, fished, built bark houses, and wove mats. Ojibwa women played important roles in the fur trade, and often used their sexuality as a way of establishing long-term relations, so to speak, with the French in order to ensure the continued supply of European goods and prevent the French from trading with other Indians. Radisson reported on visiting one Ojibwa village in the spring of 1660, there was a welcoming ceremony where: \\"The women throw themselves backward on the ground, thinking to give us tokens of friendship and wellcome [welcome]\\". Radisson was confused at first by what was meant by this gesture, but as the women started to engage in more overtly sexual behavior, he quickly realized what they were offering. Several tribal elders informed Radisson that they did not want him trading with their enemies, the Dakota [Sioux], and that he and Des Groseilliers were free to sleep with the unmarried women of the village just as long as they did not trade with the Dakota. As Radisson's account was written for an English audience, he left it rather vague about whether he and Des Groseilliers took up this offer or not. The return of Radisson and Groseilliers to Qu√©bec on August 24, 1660 was received with joy by the merchants who were waiting on them so as be able to return to Europe, but was received with jealousy from the Governor. In 1659 Groseillier had gone to Governor Pierre de Voyer d'Argenson to demand the year-long permit to explore New France, and had it granted to him and his crew. Seeing the success of the trip and the number of furs they had brought back, d'Argenson levied high taxes on them, as they had been gone for a couple of days past their year-long permit. After a number of unsuccessful attempts in the courts to regain what had been confiscated from them by the Governor, Radisson and Groseillier decided to base themselves out of Boston in the British Thirteen Colonies for their next explorations. =Trade and journeys to Hudson Bay= Arrival of Radisson in an Indian camp in 1660. Throughout their 1659‚Äì1660 voyage, the French explorers kept hearing of the \\"salt sea\\" as an area with an abundance of good furs. The \\"salt sea\\" they determined must be Hudson Bay and so looked for financing and sea-going ships for their new explorations. What was different between their approach to the trip was they would reach it from outside of the continent, instead of through a number of internal rivers. The first voyage to Hudson Bay was unsuccessful since the winter of that year came too early, and the rations on board wouldn't be sufficient for the winter. They were forced to make their way back to Boston but were promised two ships and crew for a second attempt the following year. This second attempt however never occurred since one of the ships was destroyed in a storm, though the two were invited to King Charles II's in 1665. There they passed the winter, and in the spring leave for New World with ship's crew that had been promised to them by Charles II. The vessel Eaglet, which was carrying Radisson to Hudson's Bay nearly sank in an Atlantic storm and was forced to turn back to Plymouth. In September 1668, landed in the Rupert River region on the shores of James Bay, where Des Groseilliers used his knowledge of frontier living to build dwellings for the crew in which to pass the winter. About 300 Cree Indians came up in the spring of 1669 to trade furs in exchange for European goods. Radisson sought the support of a royal patron to secure a crown monopoly on trade with in the Hudson's Bay region and found one in the form of Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the king's first cousin and a war hero on the royalist side during the English Civil War. Prince Rupert was not considered to be a good businessman and was not of the king's closest friends, but as the only member of the royal family prepared to champion the Radisson‚ÄìDes Groseilliers project of fur trading on the shores of Hudson's Bay, he was their only hope of getting a royal charter from Charles II. Radisson and des Groseilliers in their dealings in London to receive financing from the City of London had the advantages of being the only men who knew not only how to survive in the north, but also the local languages, customs, and geography. =Foundation of the Hudson's Bay Company= In 1670, Radisson was back in England and on 2 May received a royal charter giving him and his partners the exclusive rights to the land surrounding Hudson Bay, ultimately founding the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). The next few years are filled with a number of highly profitable trips between England and the Bay region. The founding of the HBC reconfigured Radisson‚Äôs life, situating him henceforth in a European context where he had to struggle for survival among rival monarchs, competing courtiers, and the changing political and economic world in which they operated. King Charles II in his charter for the Hudson's Bay Company founded a proprietary colony named Rupert's Land declaring that the lands adjacent to Hudson's Bay or rivers flowing into Hudson's Bay now belonged to the Hudson's Bay Company. In theory, much of modern Canada now belonged to the Hudson's Bay Company as Rupert's Land was a vast region, but in practice, the company only had a few forts on the sea coasts of northern Ontario and northern Qu√©bec, to which were later added forts on the sea coast of northern Manitoba. It was not until the late 18th century that the Hudson's Bay Company showed any interest in moving inland and making good its claims to control Rubert's Land. Both Radisson and Groseilliers operated within the HBC with the support of Prince Rupert and the Company's director Sir John Robinson. Radisson and Groseilliers were successful in having the HBC receive much capital from the City of London in order to fund its operations. In 1672, Radisson married Mary Kirke, the daughter of Sir John Kirke, one of the City investors in the HBC. As anti- French and anti-Catholic sentiment increased in England following discontent expressed in events such as the Bawdy House Riots of 1668, both Prince Rupert and Sir John decreased their support for the men. Although Radisson's reasons for doing so are not fully clear, he finally left London in 1675 with Grosseiliers to reenter the service of France, leaving his wife behind in England. =In French service= After leaving Britain, Radisson found himself unpopular in the royal court. In 1677 he decided to join the navy and to fund Marshal of France, Jean II d'Estr√©es' expedition in the Franco-Dutch War to conquer the island of Tobago, winning the man's favor. Following his involvement in the war, he borrowed 100 Louis d'or from the Marshall in a failed attempt to pay to bring his wife back from Britain, and subsequently failed to regain a position in the Hudson's Bay Company, as a further result of anti-French prejudice. In 1681 Radisson headed out to found a fort on the Nelson River under a French flag, albeit against the wishes of the French state. He did so as a means of capturing the market, fearing the construction of a British fort on the same river and thus further dominance of the bay by the Hudson's Bay Company. He recruited Grosseiliers the following year to build a more permanent base. In the winter of 1683 he and Groseilliers went to France to deal with their legal problems. (They had seized two English parties in time of peace and paid Qu√©bec tax on furs from Hudson Bay from their Nelson River fort, which may not have been part of Canada.) Here they found themselves pawns in the events that led up to the Glorious Revolution. The English ambassador, Lord Preston, asked that they be punished. Compromise plans were made to send Radisson back to the Bay to pick up the remaining furs and divide the profits fairly. Lord Preston seduced Radisson back into the English service and Groseilliers returned to Qu√©bec. =Working for the Hudson's Bay Company= In 1684 he sailed for the Hayes River in the vessel Happy Return, where he found Groseilliers' son Jean-Baptiste conducting a brisk trade with the Indians. He talked Jean-Baptiste into HBC service and left for England in September, leaving John Abraham in charge of the fort. (Eight days later two ships belonging to Charles Aubert de La Chesnaye arrived from Qu√©bec. Although there was conflict, no blood was shed. The French wintered near the English and returned to Qu√©bec with a moderate load of furs.) In 1685 he was made \\"Superintendent and Chief Director of the Trade at Port Nelson\\", where he seems to have accomplished little. In 1687 he made serious charges against the superintendent of York Factory. The HBC rejected the charges and Radisson was removed. Thereafter he lived in England on an HBC pension which was irregularly paid. He died in 1710. In 1729 the company voted ten pounds to his third wife, \\"she being ill and in great want.\\" Radisson's differences with various Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company underlings in the 1680s suggests that he was not admired by the English seamen who had to work with him, because of their rooted detestation of the French. Radisson wrote his Voyages in 1668 or 1669 in England after a storm prevented him from joining the first expedition into Hudson Bay. The original has been lost but an English translation was found among the papers of Samuel Pepys and now resides in the Bodleian Library. Its reliability as a historical source is contentious. Cultural references The towns Radisson, Quebec; Radisson, Saskatchewan and Radisson, Wisconsin, as well as a street and Metro station in Montreal and the Radisson provincial electoral district in Manitoba, are named after him. The Radisson Hotels group, starting with the Radisson Hotel in Minneapolis in 1909, is also named after him. Sinclair Lewis wrote several novels about Grand Republic, the seat of the fictitious Radisson County, Minnesota. The Canadian Coast Guard also has a vessel named . Sterling North dramatized his life and adventures in his young adult novel Captured by the Mohawks. Radisson was portrayed by Paul Muni in the 1941 film Hudson's Bay. The CBC Television series Radisson (1957‚Äì1958) was based on the explorer's life. Jacques Godin played the character of Radisson.

After serving in the British army in Nova Scotia, the Netherlands, India, the Mediterranean (including Sicily), and Spain, he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in 1811. During the War of 1812, his policies and victory in the conquest of present-day Maine, renaming it the colony of New Ireland, led to significant prosperity in Nova Scotia. Spain He served under the Duke of Wellington as a Major General in the Peninsular War from 1807 until his reassignment to Nova Scotia. Simultaneously, he was a Lieutenant General of Portuguese forces. Nova Scotia Sherbrooke arrived at Halifax on 16 October 1812 as commander of the forces in the Atlantic provinces (the Provinces of Nova-Scotia, New- Brunswick, and their Dependencies, including the Islands of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Prince Edward and Bermuda).The Quebec Almanack, 1815. The five years of Sherbrooke's administration were dominated by war with the United States, which broke out in June 1812, and matters relating to the colony's defence. He mounted guns at harbour entrances across the colony and placed the militias in a state of readiness. The war proved to be profitable for Nova Scotia. Sherbrooke's commercial policies turned the Atlantic provinces into a thriving entrep√¥t for international trade. From 1813‚Äì1830 Sherbrooke was Colonel of the 33rd Regiment of Foot.of Wellington's regimental website, Colonels of The Regiment New Ireland Deciding to strike at the long-disputed borderland between Passamaquoddy Bay and the Penobscot River, Sherbrooke led an expeditionary force that August which successfully landed at Castine and proceeded to subdue the entire region between the Penobscot and the St Croix. He renamed the region the colony of New Ireland. The eight-month occupation of Castine yielded customs revenues which were subsequently used to finance the Cambridge Military Library in Halifax and found Dalhousie College. The financing of Dalhousie college, now Dalhousie University in Halifax had largely come from custom duties collected by Sir John Coape Sherbrooke, then lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia during the occupation of Castine, Maine during the War of 1812, investing ¬£7000 as the initial endowment and ¬£3000 reserved for the actual construction of the college.The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History, by Various 2010 British North America His active defence of the colony during the War of 1812 led to his appointment as Governor General of British North America in 1816. His talent as a mediator helped settle disputes, and he won the confidence of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Ill health (probably a stroke) forced Sherbrooke to resign after only two years, and he retired to Nottinghamshire in England. However, his brief tenure was remembered as a period of calm before the coming storm (see Rebellions of 1837). While he resided in Nova Scotia, his home was at Birch Cove on Bedford Basin, near Halifax. Named Sherwood, it eventually lent its name to the neighbourhoods of Sherwood Park and Sherwood Heights. The community of Sherbrooke, Nova Scotia also bears his name.Bruce Fergusson (1967). Place names of Nova Scotia , p. 620 Other honorific eponyms are listed below.

This set of subgraphs can be described algebraically as a vector space over the two- element finite field. The dimension of this space is the circuit rank of the graph. The same space can also be described in terms from algebraic topology as the first homology group of the graph. Using homology theory, the binary cycle space may be generalized to cycle spaces over arbitrary rings. Definitions =Graph theory= A spanning subgraph of a given graph G may be defined from any subset S of the edges of G. The subgraph has the same set of vertices as G itself (this is the meaning of the word \\"spanning\\") but has the elements of S as its edges. Thus, a graph G with m edges has 2m spanning subgraphs, including G itself as well as the empty graph on the same set of vertices as G. The collection of all spanning subgraphs of a graph G forms the edge space of G... A graph G, or one of its subgraphs, is said to be Eulerian if each of its vertices has an even number of incident edges (this number is called the degree of the vertex). This property is named after Leonhard Euler who proved in 1736, in his work on the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg, that a connected graph has a tour that visits each edge exactly once if and only if it is Eulerian. However, an Eulerian subgraph does not need to be connected; for instance, the empty graph, in which all vertices are disconnected from each other, is Eulerian. The cycle space of a graph is the collection of its Eulerian spanning subgraphs. =Algebra= If one applies any set operation such as union or intersection of sets to two spanning subgraphs of a given graph, the result will again be a subgraph. In this way, the edge space of an arbitrary graph can be interpreted as a Boolean algebra.. The symmetric difference of two Eulerian subgraphs (red and green) is a Eulerian subgraph (blue). The cycle space, also, has an algebraic structure, but a more restrictive one. The union or intersection of two Eulerian subgraphs may fail to be Eulerian. However, the symmetric difference of two Eulerian subgraphs (the graph consisting of the edges that belong to exactly one of the two given graphs) is again Eulerian. This follows from the fact that the symmetric difference of two sets with an even number of elements is also even. Applying this fact separately to the neighborhoods of each vertex shows that the symmetric difference operator preserves the property of being Eulerian. A family of sets closed under the symmetric difference operation can be described algebraically as a vector space over the two-element finite field \\\\Z_2.. This field has two elements, 0 and 1, and its addition and multiplication operations can be described as the familiar addition and multiplication of integers, taken modulo 2\\\\. A vector space consists of a set of elements together with an addition and scalar multiplication operation satisfying certain properties generalizing the properties of the familiar real vector spaces; for the cycle space, the elements of the vector space are the Eulerian subgraphs, the addition operation is symmetric differencing, multiplication by the scalar 1 is the identity operation, and multiplication by the scalar 0 takes every element to the empty graph, which forms the additive identity element for the cycle space. The edge space is also a vector space over \\\\Z_2 if we use the symmetric difference as addition. As vector spaces, the cycle space and the cut space of the graph (the family of edge sets that span the cuts of the graph) are the orthogonal complements of each other within the edge space. This means that a set S of edges in a graph forms a cut if and only if every Eulerian subgraph has an even number of edges in common with S, and S forms an Eulerian subgraph if and only if every cut has an even number of edges in common with S. Although these two spaces are orthogonal complements, some graphs have nonempty subgraphs that belong to both of them. Such a subgraph (an Eulerian cut) exists as part of a graph G if and only if G has an even number of spanning forests.. =Topology= An undirected graph may be viewed as a simplicial complex with its vertices as zero-dimensional simplices and the edges as one-dimensional simplices.. The chain complex of this topological space consists of its edge space and vertex space (the Boolean algebra of sets of vertices), connected by a boundary operator that maps any spanning subgraph (an element of the edge space) to its set of odd-degree vertices (an element of the vertex space). The homology group :H_1(G,\\\\Z_2) consists of the elements of the edge space that map to the zero element of the vertex space; these are exactly the Eulerian subgraphs. Its group operation is the symmetric difference operation on Eulerian subgraphs. Replacing \\\\Z_2 in this construction by an arbitrary ring allows the definition of cycle spaces to be extended to cycle spaces with coefficients in the given ring, that form modules over the ring.. In particular, the integral cycle space is the space :H_1(G,\\\\Z). It can be defined in graph theoretic terms by choosing an arbitrary orientation of the graph, and defining an integral cycle of a graph G to be an assignment of integers to the edges of G (an element of the free abelian group over the edges) with the property that, at each vertex, the sum of the numbers assigned to incoming edges equals the sum of the numbers assigned to outgoing edges.. A member of H_1(G,\\\\Z) or of H_1(G,\\\\Z_k) (the cycle space modulo k) with the additional property that all of the numbers assigned to the edges are nonzero is called a nowhere-zero flow or a nowhere-zero k-flow.. Circuit rank As a vector space, the dimension of the cycle space of a graph with n vertices, m edges, and c connected components is m-n+c.. This number can be interpreted topologically as the first Betti number of the graph. In graph theory, it is known as the circuit rank, cyclomatic number, or nullity of the graph. Combining this formula for the rank with the fact that the cycle space is a vector space over the two- element field shows that the total number of elements in the cycle space is exactly 2^{m-n+c}. Cycle bases A basis of a vector space is a minimal subset of the elements with the property that all other elements can be written as a linear combination of basis elements. Every basis of a finite- dimensional space has the same number of elements, which equals the dimension of the space. In the case of the cycle space, a basis is a family of exactly m-n+c Eulerian subgraphs, with the property that every Eulerian subgraph can be written as the symmetric difference of a family of basis elements. =Existence= By Veblen's theorem,. every Eulerian subgraph of a given graph can be decomposed into simple cycles, subgraphs in which all vertices have degree zero or two and in which the degree-two vertices form a connected set. Therefore, it is always possible to find a basis in which the basis elements are themselves all simple cycles. Such a basis is called a cycle basis of the given graph. More strongly, it is always possible to find a basis in which the basis elements are induced cycles or even (in a 3-vertex-connected graph) induced cycles whose removal does not separate the remaining graph., pp. 32, 65. =Fundamental and weakly fundamental bases= One way of constructing a cycle basis is to form a spanning forest of the graph, and then for each edge e that does not belong to the forest, form a cycle C_e consisting of e together with the path in the forest connecting the endpoints of e. The set of cycles C_e formed in this way are linearly independent (each one contains an edge e that does not belong to any of the other cycles) and has the correct size m-n+c to be a basis, so it necessarily is a basis. A basis formed in this way is called a fundamental cycle basis. If there exists a linear ordering of the cycles in a cycle basis such that each cycle includes at least one edge that is not part of any previous cycle, then the cycle basis is called weakly fundamental. Every fundamental cycle basis is weakly fundamental (for all linear orderings) but not necessarily vice versa. There exist graphs, and cycle bases for those graphs, that are not weakly fundamental.. =Minimum weight bases= If the edges of a graph are given real number weights, the weight of a subgraph may be computed as the sum of the weights of its edges. The minimum weight basis of the cycle space is necessarily a cycle basis, and can be constructed in polynomial time. The minimum weight basis is not always weakly fundamental, and when it is not it is NP-hard to find the weakly fundamental basis with the minimum possible weight. Planar graphs =Homology= If a planar graph is embedded into the plane, its chain complex of edges and vertices may be embedded into a higher dimensional chain complex that also includes the sets of faces of the graph. The boundary map of this chain complex takes any 2-chain (a set of faces) to the set of edges that belong to an odd number of faces in the 2-chain. The boundary of a 2-chain is necessarily an Eulerian subgraph, and every Eulerian subgraph can be generated in this way from exactly two different 2-chains (each of which is the complement of the other)., pp. 105‚Äì106. It follows from this that the set of bounded faces of the embedding forms a cycle basis for the planar graph: removing the unbounded face from this set of cycles reduces the number of ways each Eulerian subgraph can be generated from two to exactly one. =Mac Lane's planarity criterion= Mac Lane's planarity criterion, named after Saunders Mac Lane, characterizes planar graphs in terms of their cycle spaces and cycle bases. It states that a finite undirected graph is planar if and only if the graph has a cycle basis in which each edge of the graph participates in at most two basis cycles. In a planar graph, a cycle basis formed by the set of bounded faces of an embedding necessarily has this property: each edge participates only in the basis cycles for the two faces it separates. Conversely, if a cycle basis has at most two cycles per edge, then its cycles can be used as the set of bounded faces of a planar embedding of its graph.. =Duality= The cycle space of a planar graph is the cut space of its dual graph, and vice versa. The minimum weight cycle basis for a planar graph is not necessarily the same as the basis formed by its bounded faces: it can include cycles that are not faces, and some faces may not be included as cycles in the minimum weight cycle basis. There exists a minimum weight cycle basis in which no two cycles cross each other: for every two cycles in the basis, either the cycles enclose disjoint subsets of the bounded faces, or one of the two cycles encloses the other one. Following the duality between cycle spaces and cut spaces, this basis for a planar graph corresponds to a Gomory‚ÄìHu tree of the dual graph, a minimum weight basis for its cut space.. =Nowhere zero flows= In planar graphs, colorings with k distinct colors are dual to nowhere zero flows over the ring \\\\Z_k of integers modulo k. In this duality, the difference between the colors of two adjacent regions is represented by a flow value across the edge separating the regions. In particular, the existence of nowhere zero 4-flows is equivalent to the four color theorem. The snark theorem generalizes this result to nonplanar graphs.

It was found in the Sahara desert in 2007. A lunar meteorite is a meteorite that is known to have originated on the Moon. A meteorite hitting the Moon is normally classified as a transient lunar phenomenon. Discovery In January 1982, John Schutt, leading an expedition in Antarctica for the ANSMET program, found a meteorite that he recognized to be unusual. Shortly thereafter, the meteorite now called Allan Hills 81005 was sent to Washington, DC, where Smithsonian Institution geochemist Brian Mason recognized that the sample was unlike any other known meteorite and resembled some rocks brought back from the Moon by the Apollo program. Several years later, Japanese scientists recognized that they had also collected a lunar meteorite, Yamato 791197, during the 1979 field season in Antarctica. , 371 lunar meteorites have been discovered, perhaps representing more than 30 separate meteorite falls (i.e., many of the stones are \\"paired\\" fragments of the same meteoroid). The total mass is more than . All lunar meteorites have been found in deserts; most have been found in Antarctica, northern Africa, and the Sultanate of Oman. None have yet been found in North America, South America, or Europe.Washington University in St. Louis: How Do We Know That It's a Rock from the Moon? Lunar origin is established by comparing the mineralogy, the chemical composition, and the isotopic composition between meteorites and samples from the Moon collected by Apollo missions. Transfer to Earth Most lunar meteorites are launched from the Moon by impacts making lunar craters of a few kilometers in diameter or less. No source crater of lunar meteorites has been positively identified, although there is speculation that the highly anomalous lunar meteorite Sayh al Uhaymir 169 derives from the Lalande impact crater on the lunar nearside. Cosmic-ray exposure history established with noble-gas measurements have shown that all lunar meteorites were ejected from the Moon in the past 20 million years. Most left the Moon in the past 100,000 years. After leaving the Moon, most lunar meteoroids go into orbit around Earth and eventually succumb to Earth's gravity. Some meteoroids ejected from the Moon get launched into orbits around the Sun. These meteoroids remain in space longer, but eventually intersect the Earth's orbit and land.B. Gladman and J. Burns, \\"The Delivery of Martian and Lunar Meteorites to Earth\\". Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society 28 (1996) 1054. Scientific relevance All six of the Apollo missions on which samples were collected landed in the central nearside of the Moon, an area that has subsequently been shown to be geochemically anomalous by the Lunar Prospector mission. In contrast, the numerous lunar meteorites are random samples of the Moon and consequently provide a more representative sampling of the lunar surface than the Apollo samples. Half the lunar meteorites, for example, likely sample material from the farside of the Moon. At the time the first meteorite from the Moon was discovered in 1982, there was speculation that some other unusual meteorites that had been found previously originated from Mars. The positive identification of lunar meteorites on Earth supported the hypothesis that meteoroid impacts on Mars could eject rocks from that planet. There are also speculations about the possibility of finding \\"Earth meteorites\\" on the surface of the Moon. This would be very interesting because in this case stones from Earth older than 3.9 billion years, which are destroyed on Earth by various geological processes, may have survived on the Moon. Thus some scientists propose new missions to the Moon to search for ancient rocks from Earth. Observation history About one in every thousand newly discovered meteorites is a lunar meteorite, whereas the vast majority of meteorites are from the asteroid belt. In the early 19th century most scientists believed that all meteorites falling towards the Earth were from the Moon. Although today supported only by a minority of researchers, there are also theories that tektites are from the Moon and should therefore also be regarded as lunar meteorites. However, most scientists regard such theories as outdated. Private ownership NWA 4483 Lunar meteorites collected in Africa and Oman are, for all practical purposes, the only source of moon rocks available for private ownership. This is because all rocks collected during the Apollo moon-landing program are property of the United States government or of other nations to which the U.S. conveyed them as gifts. Similarly, all lunar meteorites collected by the U.S. and Japanese Antarctic programs are, by treaty, held by those governments for research and education purposes only. Although there is no U.S. law specifically against the ownership of Apollo moonrocks, none has ever been (or is likely to ever be) given or sold by the U.S. government to private citizens. Even in the cases of plaques containing genuine Apollo moonrocks given in 2004 to astronauts and Walter Cronkite, NASA retained ownership of the rocks themselves. Most of the moonrocks collected by the Luna 16 probe are also unavailable for private ownership, although three tiny samples were sold at auction for $442,500 in 1993.In Search of the Goodwill Moon Rocks: A Personal Account Geotimes Magazine, Joseph Gutheinz, November 2004.\\"Hunting Moon Rocks\\" Alvin Sun Advertise, Judy Zavalla, November 4, 2009.

The Italian allies wanted Roman citizenship, and the power, influence and the right to vote at Rome itself that came with it. They believed that they should be treated equal to the Romans, because of their cultural, linguistic and historical ties, and also because they had been fighting alongside Romans for over two hundred years and had been mostly loyal allies. The Romans strongly opposed their demands and refused to grant them citizenship, thus leaving the Italian groups with fewer rights and privileges. This led to a devastating war, which lasted four years and caused many casualties. The war eventually resulted in a Roman victory. However, Rome granted Roman citizenship to all of its Italian allies, to avoid another costly war. This war also led to a complete Romanization of Italy. The Etruscans and the Italic peoples quickly integrated themselves into the Roman world, after gaining Roman citizenship. Their own languages and cultures became extinct in the process, and the term \\"Roman\\" came to refer to all inhabitants of Italy.Suetonius, Life of Claudius, section 42.2. The Romans did not consider Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica part of Italy during this period. Cisalpine Gaul was also not considered Italian territory until 42 BC, when it was merged into Roman Italy as indicated in Caesar's unpublished acts (Acta Caesaris). Origins Roman victory in the Samnite Wars ( 343-290 BC ) resulted in effective Roman dominance of the Italian peninsula. This dominance was expressed in a collection of alliances between Rome and the cities and communities of Italy, on more or less favorable terms depending on whether a given city had voluntarily allied with Rome or been defeated in war. These cities were theoretically independent, but in practice Rome had the right to demand from them tribute money and a certain number of soldiers: by the 2nd century BC the Italian allies contributed between one half and two-thirds of the soldiers in Roman armies. Rome also had virtual control over the allies' foreign policy, including their interaction with one another. Aside from the Second Punic War, where Hannibal had limited success in turning some Italian communities against Rome, for the most part the Italian communities were content to remain as client states of Rome in return for local autonomy. The Romans' policy of land distribution had led to great inequality of land- ownership and wealth.. This led to the \\"Italic people declining little by little into pauperism and paucity of numbers without any hope of remedy.\\". A number of political proposals had attempted to address the growing discrepancy whereby Italians made a significant contribution to Rome's military force, while receiving disproportionately small shares of land and citizenship rights. These efforts came to a head under the impetus of Marcus Livius Drusus in 91 BC. His reforms would have granted the Italian allies Roman citizenship, giving them a greater say in the external policy of the Roman Republic. Most local affairs came under local governance and were not as important to the Romans as, for example, when the alliance would go to war or how they would divide the plunder. The response of the Roman senatorial elite to Drusus' proposals was to reject his ideas and assassinate him. This brusque dismissal of the granting of rights that the Italians considered to be long overdue greatly angered them, and communities throughout Italy attempted to declare independence from Rome in response, sparking a war. War The Social War began in 91 BC when the Italian allies revolted. The Latins as a whole remained largely loyal to Rome, with the one exception of Venusia. The Etruscans and Umbrians, who were the most powerful people amongst Socii, mostly stayed neutral at the beginning. They were soon offered citizenship by Rome to prevent them from joining the rebellion. The rebellious allies not only planned a formal separation from Rome, but also the re-organisation of Italia (the Roman term for the peninsula) as its own independent federation, with its own capital at Corfinium (in modern Abruzzo) that was renamed Italica.Tom Holland, Rubicon, pp 54‚Äì55. To pay for the troops, they created their own coinage that was used as propaganda against Rome. The coins depict eight warriors taking an oath, probably representing the Marsi, Picentines, Paeligni, Marrucini, Vestini, Frentani, Samnites and Hirpini. The Italian soldiers were battle-hardened, most of them having served in the Roman armies. The 12 allies of Italia were originally able to field 120,000 men. The Italians divided this force according to their positions within Italy. * Quintus Poppaedius Silo had overall command of the \\"Marsic Group\\", as consul. * Gaius Papius Mutilus had overall command of the \\"Samnite Group\\", as consul. * Titus Lafrenius commanded the Marsi in 90 BC, when he was killed in action.

He was succeeded by Pontius Telesinus who was also killed in action that year. The Roman strategy focused on surviving the first onslaught, while simultaneously trying to entice other Italian clients to remain loyal or refrain from defection, and then meet the threat of the revolt with troops raised from provinces as well as from client kingdoms. One of the two separate theatres of war was assigned to each of the consuls of 90 BC. In the north, the consul Publius Rutilius Lupus was advised by Gaius Marius and Pompeius Strabo; in the south the consul Lucius Julius Caesar had Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Titus Didius. =Events in 91 BC= * Marcus Livius Drusus, a champion of the Italian cause, was assassinated by an unknown assailant. Drusus's death meant the end of his enfranchisement policy.Lynda Telford, Sulla, p.84. * When news of Drusus's assassination reached the Marsi they decided on a show of force. Quintus Poppaedius Silo, a leader of the Marsi and a good friend of Drusus, led a march on Rome. They were met by Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, the Pontifex Maximus, who persuaded them to go back.Lynda Telford, Sulla, p.85. When Ahenobarbus returned to Rome he informed the Senate something had to be done quickly or there would be war. * By mid-autumn, the peace had irrevocably broken down. Diplomacy and negotiations had failed; the Social War started.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p.77. * The first to rebel and take up arms were the Marsi.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p.71.

They were quickly joined by more Italian tribes including the Hirpini, the Lucanians, Apulia and the Frentani.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p.73. * The Italian rebels chose two consuls to take command of the war. Quintus Poppaedius Silo commanded the 'northern' group, while Gaius Papius Mutilus commanded the 'southern' group.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 80‚Äì81. * The Roman colonies of Alba Fucensis and Aesernia, which were in Italian territory, came under siege.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 77. * When the rebels took Asculum, the first city to fall to them, they slaughtered every Roman they could find. The wives of the men who refused to join them were tortured and scalped.Tom Holland, Rubicon, p. 53. * While marching his legions south through Picentum, Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo, who had recruited troops (3‚Äì4 legions) on Rome's behalf in his native Picenum, was suddenly attacked by a large force of Picentes, Vestini and Marsi led by the rebel general Scato. Although the battle favoured neither side Pompeius Strabo was heavily outnumbered and he decided to withdraw. Eventually he found himself blockaded in Picenum.Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 86; Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 89. * The Romans elected Lucius Julius Caesar and Publius Rutilius Lupus as consuls for the following year. Caesar was to command the southern front against the Samnites and their allies while Lupus was to command the northern front against the Marsi and their allies. Caesar was allocated Gaius Marius as senior legate (second-in-command) while Lupus was allocated Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Marius and Sulla were considered Rome's best military commanders.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 81; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 86. =Events in 90 BC= * In central Italy, Gaius Perpenna, a lieutenant of the consul Publius Rutilius Lupus, suffered a defeat at the hands of the Italian general Presentius. Perpenna lost 4,000 men. The remnant of his force was transferred to the army of Marius.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 85. * In Lucania, a lieutenant of the consul Lucius Julius Caesar, lost 800 men when the Italians set fire to his camp. * Sextus Julius Caesar attempted to head off Italian reinforcements going to the siege of Aesernia, but was beaten back with the loss of 2,000 men.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 86. * Aesernia was taken by the Italians. * The Italian 'consul' Mutilus invaded Campania and took the city of Nola (by betrayal). Afterwards, he starved his Roman prisoners (including the praetor Lucius Postumus) to death.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 86‚Äì87. * Mutilus attacked Lucius Caesar's camp, but Caesar fought off the assault and killed 6,000 rebels. This was the first substantial defeat of the Italian rebels. The news of the victory caused the Senate to decree that the population should resume wearing togas again (they had stopped doing so as a sign their country was struggling at war).Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 87‚Äì88. * On 11 July, the consul Rutilius was ambushed by the Marsi led by Vettius Scato while crossing the River Tolenus. The Rebels killed 8,000 of Rutilius's men, including the consul himself.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 86.90‚Äì92; Lynda Telford, Sulla, pp 87‚Äì88. * Gaius Marius, in command of a separate division of Rutilius' army, arrived during the aftermath of the Marsi ambush captured their camp and then attacked the Marsi from the rear routing them with heavy losses.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 92‚Äì93; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 88. * Quintus Servilius Caepio defeated the Paeligni, a rebel tribe related to the Marruncini.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 94; Livy, Periochae, 73.5. * The Senate then decided to give joint command to Marius and Caepio. Marius had expected sole command and he did not get along with Caepio with disastrous results.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 94; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 88. After having dealt with a raiding party of Marsi at Varnia, Caepio attempted to give Marius instructions, but Marius ignored them.Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 89. Caepio left on his own was then obliged to move his legions back towards Caeoli. Once they reached the Arno at Sublaqueum they were attacked by the Marsi. Caepio's column was massacred.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 94‚Äì95; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 89; Appian, Civil Wars, 1.44. It is said he was killed by Quintus Poppaedius Silo himself. * The Marsi and Marruncini were defeated in battle by Marius working in tandem with Sulla, his old subordinate from the Jugurthine and Cimbri wars. Together they killed 6,000 rebels and the Marruncini general Herius Asinus.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 95‚Äì96; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 89. * In the Volturnus valley (at the Melfa Gorge) the Samnites under Marius Egnatius ambushed Lucius Caesar who still managed to fight his way through to Teanum where he took up a defensive position. Lucius Caesar lost 8,000 of his 30,000 men in the ambush.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 96; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 89. * Pompeius Strabo succeeded in breaking out of Picenum and drove the rebels all the way back to Asculum. He then started to besiege the city.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 97. * The consul Lucius Caesar returned to Rome and pushed through the Lex Julia de civitate Latinis et sociis danda which gave Roman citizenship to any Italian with Latin Rights, and made eligible for citizenship any Italian who had not taken up arms against the Romans. This marked the turning point of the war. Many Italians flocked to the Roman standards depriving the rebels of manpower.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 99; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 90; Tom Holland, Rubicon, p. 58. * Pompeius Strabo, who by now had been elected one of the consul for the next year, attacked and defeated a rebel column trying to march into Etruria killing 5,000 rebels. Another 5,000 died while trying to get back across the Apennines.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 100. =Events in 89 BC= * Lucius Porcius Cato Licinianus, who had been elected junior consul for 89 BC, took over the southern command from Lucius Caesar.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 102; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 91. * Vidacilius, the leader of the rebels in southern Picenum, and his men (ca. 4,000) managed to fight their way through the siege lines and reinforced Asculum. However, upon seeing the hopelessness of their cause he and his followers committed suicide.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 103. * Sextus Caesar, now a lieutenant of the Senior Consul Pompeius Strabo, caught the rebels shifting camp outside Asculum and fell upon them, killing 8,000 and scattering the rest.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 103‚Äì104. * The consul Cato engaged the Marsi in battle near Fucine Lake (close to Alba Fucensis). He died in an attempt to storm the enemy camp. Sulla then took command of the southern front.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 105. * In a huge battle near Asculum Pompeius Strabo defeated an Italian relief army of 60,000 men. The city capitulated soon after.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.15; Velleius Paterculus, Historia Romana, II. 21. * In the south Sulla, now a praetor, moved on the offensive. He started to besiege Pompeii and Herculaneum. When the rebel general Cleuntius tried to reinforce the city, Sulla routed the rebel army, chased them to Nola and there massacred 20,000 rebels in battle right in front of the walls.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 107; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 93. * After his victory at Nola, Sulla turned on the Hirpini to the north. He quickly forced them to surrender. He then marched on Samnium.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 107; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 94. * Sulla invaded Samnium by a circuitous route and hereby surprised and defeated Mutilus (the Samnite commander) attacking him from an unsuspected direction. With the Samnite army routed he marched on Bovianum, the Samnite capital, and stormed it in a three- hour assault.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 107‚Äì108; Tom Holland, Rubicon, p. 65. * The praetor Gaius Cosconius caught the rebel general Trebatius and a Samnite army in mid-crossing at the Aufidius near Cannae killing 15,000 rebels.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 108; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 95. * Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius captured Venusia, along with 3,000 rebel soldiers.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 108. * After Sulla had returned to his sieges in Campania, Poppaedius Silo recaptured Bovianum. Silo then tried to eject Metellus from Apulia, but failed and died in the attempt.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 108; Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, II p. 42; Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic, II p. 378; Diod. XXXVII 2, 9‚Äì11; App. BC I 53; Auc. Vir. Ill. 63, 1. * Herculaneum, Pompeii and several rebel cities in Campania surrendered to Sulla. Only Nola and Aesernia remained defiant.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 109; Tom Holland, Rubicon, p. 65. By the end of 89 BC most of the rebel leaders were dead. In the north the last pockets of resistance were being mopped up by Pompeius Strabo and in the south only the Samnites remained a threat. Aftermath in 88‚Äì87 BC: another war At the beginning of 88 BC, the war was largely over except for the Samnites, the old rivals of Rome, who still held out. It is likely that the war would have continued for some time had Rome not made concessions to their allies. Rome could now return their focus on the rest of their empire. In the East a new threat loomed; Mithridates, the king of Pontus, invaded the Roman province of Asia and slaughtered Romans and Italians alike.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 110‚Äì112. Rome's generals contended for the honour (and profit) of commanding the war against the eastern king.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 116. Unfortunately for the Republic, this led to a new civil war. Eventually the Samnites would become major players in the second round of that civil war. The Samnites and Lucanians held out at Nola and Bruttium until 87 BC, when the conflict subsumed into the Roman civil war that broke out that year. Roman concessions to the Allies Lucius Julius Caesar sponsored the Lex Julia during his consulship, which he carried out before his office ended. The law offered full citizenship to all Latin and Italian communities who had not revolted. This was mainly done to prevent the Etruscans and Umbrians from joining the rebellion. However, the law offered the option of citizenship to whole communities and not to individuals. This meant that each individual community had to pass the law, most likely by a vote in assembly, before it could take effect. It was also possible under the Lex Julia for citizenship to be granted as a reward for distinguished military service in the field. It is assumed that the Lex Julia was closely followed by a supplementary statute, the Lex Plautia Papiria, which stated that a registered male of an allied Italian state could obtain Roman citizenship by presenting himself to a Roman praetor within 60 days of the passing of the law. This law granted Roman citizenship to Italians who had rebelled against Rome.

Life Adamov (originally Adamian) was born in Kislovodsk in the Terek Oblast of the Russian Empire to a wealthy Armenian family, which lost its wealth in 1917. In common with many other wealthy Russians of the time, Adamov was brought up with French as his first language, and in 1924 he moved to Paris. In Paris Adamov met surrealists and edited the surrealist journal Discontinuit√©. He began to write plays after World War II, with La Parodie (1947) being his first. His work, influenced by Bertolt Brecht, is often dream-like and later works in particular have a political element. The title character of one of his best known works, Le Professeur Taranne (1953), is accused of various things (public nudity, littering, plagiarism), all of which he strenuously denies, only to have his denials turned against him into more evidence of misdemeanours. This particular play was directly influenced by a dream Adamov had. Lesser known to the public is his prose work with short stories like Fin Ao√ªt (in Je... Ils..., 1969). Their themes revolve around topics like masochism, which the author regarded as \\"immunisation against death\\". Adamov translated a number of works by German authors (Rilke, B√ºchner) and Russian classics (Gogol, Chekhov) into French. The Algerian war radicalised his political views and in the 1960s he became a Communist. During his later years, he began to drink and use drugs.Albee, Edward, The American Dream, Coward, 1961.

Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere. It involves a change of chemical composition. The word is coined from the Greek-derived elements pyro \\"fire\\" and lysis \\"separating\\". Pyrolysis is most commonly used in the treatment of organic materials. It is one of the processes involved in charring wood.Burning of wood , InnoFireWood's website. Accessed on 2010-02-06. In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves a solid residue enriched in carbon, char. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly carbon as the residue, is called carbonization. Pyrolysis is considered as the first step in the processes of gasification or combustion. The process is used heavily in the chemical industry, for example, to produce ethylene, many forms of carbon, and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, to produce coke from coal. Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert natural gas (methane) into non-polluting hydrogen gas and non- polluting solid carbon char, biomass into syngas and biochar, waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances. Terminology Pyrolysis is one of various types of chemical degradation processes that occur at higher temperatures (above the boiling point of water or other solvents). It differs from other processes like combustion and hydrolysis in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as oxygen (O2, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis).Cory A. Kramer, Reza Loloee, Indrek S. Wichman and Ruby N. Ghosh, 2009, Time Resolved Measurements of Pyrolysis Products From Thermoplastic Poly-Methyl-Methacrylate (PMMA) ASME 2009 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition Pyrolysis produces solids (char), condensable liquids (tar), and uncondensing/permanent gasses. =Types of pyrolysis= Complete pyrolysis of organic matter usually leaves a solid residue that consists mostly of elemental carbon; the process is then called carbonization. More specific cases of pyrolysis include: * methane pyrolysis, in the presence of catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to non-polluting hydrogen fuel and separable solid carbon * hydrous pyrolysis, in the presence of superheated water or steam, producing hydrogen and also substantial atmospheric carbon dioxide, also used in oil refining * dry distillation, as in the original production of sulfuric acid from sulfates * destructive distillation, as in the manufacture of charcoal, coke and activated carbon * caramelization of sugars * high-temperature cooking processes such as roasting, frying, toasting, and grilling * charcoal burning, the production of charcoal * tar production by pyrolysis of wood in tar kilns * cracking of heavier hydrocarbons into lighter ones, as in oil refining * thermal depolymerization, that breaks down plastics and other polymers into monomers and oligomers * ceramization involving the formation of polymer derived ceramics from preceramic polymers under an inert atmosphere * catagenesis, the natural conversion of buried organic matter to fossil fuels and * flash vacuum pyrolysis, used in organic synthesis. General processes and mechanisms Processes in the thermal degradation of organic matter at atmospheric pressure. Pyrolysis generally consists in heating the material above its decomposition temperature, breaking chemical bonds in its molecules. The fragments usually become smaller molecules, but may combine to produce residues with larger molecular mass, even amorphous covalent solids. In many settings, some amounts of oxygen, water, or other substances may be present, so that combustion, hydrolysis, or other chemical processes may occur besides pyrolysis proper. Sometimes those chemical are added intentionally, as in the burning of firewood, in the traditional manufacture of charcoal, and in the steam cracking of crude oil. Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a vacuum or in an inert atmosphere to avoid adverse chemical reactions. Pyrolysis in a vacuum also lowers the boiling point of the byproducts, improving their recovery. When organic matter is heated at increasing temperatures in open containers, the following processes generally occur, in successive or overlapping stages: * Below about 100 ¬∞C, volatiles, including some water, evaporate. Heat-sensitive substances, such as vitamin C and proteins, may partially change or decompose already at this stage. * At about 100 ¬∞C or slightly higher, any remaining water that is merely absorbed in the material is driven off. Water trapped in crystal structure of hydrates may come off at somewhat higher temperatures. This process consumes a lot of energy, so the temperature may stop rising until this stage is complete. * Some solid substances, like fats, waxes, and sugars, may melt and separate. * Between 100 and 500 ¬∞C, many common organic molecules break down. Most sugars start decomposing at 160‚Äì180 ¬∞C. Cellulose, a major component of wood, paper, and cotton fabrics, decomposes at about 350 ¬∞C. Lignin, another major wood component, starts decomposing at about 350 ¬∞C, but continues releasing volatile products up to 500 ¬∞C. The decomposition products usually include water, carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide , as well as a large number of organic compounds. Gases and volatile products leave the sample, and some of them may condense again as smoke. Generally, this process also absorbs energy. Some volatiles may ignite and burn, creating a visible flame. The non-volatile residues typically become richer in carbon and form large disordered molecules, with colors ranging between brown and black. At this point the matter is said to have been \\"charred\\" or \\"carbonized\\". * At 200‚Äì300 ¬∞C, if oxygen has not been excluded, the carbonaceous residue may start to burn, in a highly exothermic reaction, often with no or little visible flame. Once carbon combustion starts, the temperature rises spontaneously, turning the residue into a glowing ember and releasing carbon dioxide and/or monoxide. At this stage, some of the nitrogen still remaining in the residue may be oxidized into nitrogen oxides like and . Sulfur and other elements like chlorine and arsenic may be oxidized and volatilized at this stage. * Once combustion of the carbonaceous residue is complete, a powdery or solid mineral residue (ash) is often left behind, consisting of inorganic oxidized materials of high melting point. Some of the ash may have left during combustion, entrained by the gases as fly ash or particulate emissions. Metals present in the original matter usually remain in the ash as oxides or carbonates, such as potash. Phosphorus, from materials such as bone, phospholipids, and nucleic acids, usually remains as phosphates.  Occurrence and uses  =Cooking= Pyrolysis has many applications in food preparation. Caramelization is the pyrolysis of sugars in food (often after the sugars have been produced by the breakdown of polysaccharides). The food goes brown and changes flavour. The distinctive flavours are used in many dishes; for instance, caramelized onion is used in French onion soup. The temperatures needed for caramelization lie above the boiling point of water. Frying oil can easily rise above boiling point. Putting a lid on the frying pan keeps the water in, and some of it re- condenses, keeping the temperature too cool to brown for longer. Pyrolysis of food can also be undesirable, as in the charring of burnt food (at temperatures too low for the oxidative combustion of carbon to produce flames and burn the food to ash). = Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars = Charcoal briquettes, often made from compressed sawdust or similar, in use. Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are nonvolatile, even at high temperatures. Consequently, pyrolysis is used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials. Charcoal is a less smoky fuel than pyrolyzed wood). Some cities ban, or used to ban, wood fires; when residents only use charcoal (and similarly-treated rock coal, called coke) air pollution is significantly reduced. In cities where people do not generally cook or heat with fires, this is not needed. In the mid-20th century, \\"smokeless\\" legislation in Europe required cleaner-burning techniques, such as coke fuel and smoke-burning incineratorsSmokeless incinerator patent as an effective measure to reduce air pollution A blacksmith's forge, with a blower forcing air through a bed of fuel to raise the temperature of the fire. On the periphery, coal is pyrolyzed, absorbing heat; the coke at the center is almost pure carbon, and releases a lot of heat when the carbon oxidizes. Typical organic products obtained by pyrolysis of coal (X = CH, N). The coke-making or \\"coking\\" process consists of heating the material in \\"coking ovens\\" to very high temperatures (up to ) so that those molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25‚Äì30% of it by weight. High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to convert coal into coke. This is useful in metallurgy, where the higher temperatures are necessary for many processes, such as steelmaking. Volatile by-products of this process are also often useful, including benzene and pyridine. Coke can also be produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining. The original vascular structure of the wood and the pores created by escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By starting with a dense wood-like material, such as nutshells or peach stones, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called activated carbon, which is used as an adsorbent for a wide range of chemical substances. Biochar is the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from cooking fires. They are a key component of the terra preta soils associated with ancient indigenous communities of the Amazon basin. Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced suite of beneficial microbiota, compared to the typical red soil of the region. Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through biochar, the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly organic waste. Œºm. Carbon fibers are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable polymer, and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature (from ). The first carbon fibers were made from rayon, but polyacrylonitrile has become the most common starting material. For their first workable electric lamps, Joseph Wilson Swan and Thomas Edison used carbon filaments made by pyrolysis of cotton yarns and bamboo splinters, respectively. Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a layer of pyrolytic carbon. This is typically done in a fluidized bed reactor heated to . Pyrolytic carbon coatings are used in many applications, including artificial heart valves.Ratner, Buddy D. (2004). Pyrolytic carbon. In Biomaterials science: an introduction to materials in medicine . Academic Press. pp. 171‚Äì180. . = Liquid and gaseous biofuels = Pyrolysis is the basis of several methods for producing fuel from biomass, i.e. lignocellulosic biomass.Evans, G. \\"Liquid Transport Biofuels ‚Äì Technology Status Report\\" , \\"National Non-Food Crops Centre\\", 14-04-08. Retrieved on 2009-05-05. Crops studied as biomass feedstock for pyrolysis include native North American prairie grasses such as switchgrass and bred versions of other grasses such as Miscantheus giganteus. Other sources of organic matter as feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood, leaves, vegetables, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls, and orange peels. Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation. Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including paper sludge, distillers grain, and sewage sludge. In the biomass components, the pyrolysis of hemicellulose happens between 210 and 310 ¬∞C. The pyrolysis of cellulose starts from 300-315 ¬∞C and ends at 360-380 ¬∞C, with a peak at 342-354 ¬∞C. Lignin starts to decompose at about 200 ¬∞C and continues until 1000 ¬∞C. Synthetic diesel fuel by pyrolysis of organic materials is not yet economically competitive. Higher efficiency is sometimes achieved by flash pyrolysis, in which finely divided feedstock is quickly heated to between for less than two seconds. Syngas is usually produced by pyrolysis. The low quality of oils produced through pyrolysis can be improved by physical and chemical processes, which might drive up production costs, but may make sense economically as circumstances change. There is also the possibility of integrating with other processes such as mechanical biological treatment and anaerobic digestion.Marshall, A. T. & Morris, J. M. (2006) A Watery Solution and Sustainable Energy Parks , CIWM Journal, pp. 22‚Äì23 Fast pyrolysis is also investigated for biomass conversions. Fuel bio-oil can also be produced by hydrous pyrolysis. =Hydrogen= Methane pyrolysis to produce non-polluting hydrogen in high volume at low cost. Used in non-polluting electric power generation , non-polluting fuel-cell transportation and non-polluting hydrogen for industrial processes . Methane pyrolysis is the process operating around 1000¬∞C for producing hydrogen from natural gas that allows removal of carbon easily (solid non-polluting carbon is a byproduct of the process).The reaction that would give us clean fossil fuels foreverHydrogen from methane without CO2 emissions The carbon can then be stored underground and is not released into the atmosphere. It is being evaluated in the BASF \\"methane pyrolysis at scale\\" test plant, in such research laboratories as Karlsruhe Liquid-metal Laboratory (KALLA)KITT/IASS ‚Äì Producing CO2 free hydrogen from natural gas for energy usage and the chemical engineering team at University of California - Santa Barbara =Ethylene= Pyrolysis is used to produce ethylene, the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially (>110 million tons/year in 2005). In this process, hydrocarbons from petroleum are heated to around in the presence of steam; this is called steam cracking. The resulting ethylene is used to make antifreeze (ethylene glycol), PVC (via vinyl chloride), and many other polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene. = Semiconductors = Illustration of the metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy process, which entails pyrolysis of volatiles The process of metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOCVD) entails pyrolysis of volatile organometallic compounds to give semiconductors, hard coatings, and other applicable materials. The reactions entail thermal degradation of precursors, with deposition of the inorganic component and release of the hydrocarbons as gaseous waste. Since it is an atom-by-atom deposition, these atoms organize themselves into crystals to form the bulk semiconductor. Silicon chips are produced by the pyrolysis of silane: :SiH4 ‚Üí Si + 2 H2. Gallium arsenide, another semiconductor, forms upon co-pyrolysis of trimethylgallium and arsine. = Waste Management= Pyrolysis can also be used to treat municipal solid waste and plastic waste. The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste. In principle, pyrolysis will regenerate the monomers (precursors) to the polymers that are treated, but in practice the process is neither a clean nor an economically competitive source of monomers.N.J.

Oil derived from tire rubber pyrolysis contains high sulfur content, which gives it high potential as a pollutant and should be desulfurized.Ringer, M.; Putsche, V.; Scahill, J. (2006) Large-Scale Pyrolysis Oil Production: A Technology Assessment and Economic Analysis ; NREL/TP-510-37779; National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, CO. Alkaline pyrolysis of sewage sludge at low temperature of 500 ¬∞C can enhance H2 production with in-situ carbon capture. The use of NaOH as has the potential to produce H2-rich gas that can be used for fuels cells directly. = Thermal cleaning = Pyrolysis is also used for thermal cleaning, an industrial application to remove organic substances such as polymers, plastics and coatings from parts, products or production components like extruder screws, spinnerets and static mixers. During the thermal cleaning process, at temperatures between 310 C¬∞ to 540 C¬∞ (600 ¬∞F to 1000 ¬∞F), organic material is converted by pyrolysis and oxidation into volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons and carbonized gas. Inorganic elements remain. Several types of thermal cleaning systems use pyrolysis: * Molten Salt Baths belong to the oldest thermal cleaning systems; cleaning with a molten salt bath is very fast but implies the risk of dangerous splatters, or other potential hazards connected with the use of salt baths, like explosions or highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas. * Fluidized Bed Systems use sand or aluminium oxide as heating medium; these systems also clean very fast but the medium does not melt or boil, nor emit any vapors or odors; the cleaning process takes one to two hours. * Vacuum Ovens use pyrolysis in a vacuum avoiding uncontrolled combustion inside the cleaning chamber; the cleaning process takes 8 to 30 hours. * Burn-Off Ovens, also known as Heat-Cleaning Ovens, are gas-fired and used in the painting, coatings, electric motors and plastics industries for removing organics from heavy and large metal parts. =Fine chemical synthesis= Pyrolysis is used in the production of chemical compounds, mainly, but not only, in the research laboratory. The area of boron-hydride clusters started with the study of the pyrolysis of diborane (B2H6) at ca. 200 ¬∞C. Products include the clusters pentaborane and decaborane. These pyrolyses involve not only cracking (to give H2), but also recondensation. gives Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd ed.). Butterworth-Heinemann. .

Similar considerations apply to the smoking of marijuana and the burning of incense products and mosquito coils. * Pyrolysis occurs during the incineration of trash, potentially generating volatiles that are toxic or contribute to air pollution if not completely burned. * Laboratory or industrial equipment sometimes gets fouled by carbonaceous residues that result from coking, the pyrolysis of organic products that come into contact with hot surfaces.  PAHs generation  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be generated from the pyrolysis of different solid waste fractions, such as hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, pectin, starch, polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PS, PVC, and lignin generate significant amount of PAHs. Naphthalene is the most abundant PAH among all the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. When the temperature is increased from 500 to 900 ¬∞C, most PAHs increase. With the increase of the temperature, the percentage of light PAHs decrease and the percentage of heavy PAHs increase.  Study tools  = Thermogravimetric analysis = Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is one of the most common techniques to investigate pyrolysis with no limitations of heat and mass transfer. The results can be used to determine mass loss kinetics. Activation energies can be calculated using Kissinger method or peak analysis-least square method (PA-LSM). TGA can couple with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and mass spectrometry. As the increase of temperature, the volatiles generated from pyrolysis can be measured. = Macro-TGA = In TGA, sample is loaded first before the increase of temperature, and the heating rate is low (less than 100 ¬∞C min‚àí1). Macro-TGA can use gram level samples which can be used to investigate the pyrolysis with mass and heat transfer effects. = Pyrolysis‚Äìgas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry = Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) is an important laboratory procedure to determine the structure of compounds. History Oak charcoal Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into charcoal since ancient times. In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood. The dry distillation of wood remained the major source of methanol into the early 20th century. The 8th century Caliphate philosopher Jabir ibn Hayyan (known as Geber in the West) may be considered the father of experimental chemistry because of his development of the retort, which he used to discover sulfuric, hydrochloric, and nitric acids, as well as aqua regia, by dry distillation of vitriol mixed with other salts. These discoveries became known in Europe in the 14th century, through the books of Pseudo-Geber. Pyrolysis was also instrumental in the discovery of many important chemical substances, such as phosphorus (from ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate in concentrated urine) and oxygen (from mercuric oxide and various nitrates).

He should not be confused with \\"Papa\\" Jo Jones, another drummer who had a long tenure with Count Basie. The two men died only a few days apart. Biography =Early career= As a child, Jones appeared as a featured tap dancer on The Kiddie Show on the Philadelphia radio Station WIP. He was in the US Army during World War II. In 1947 he became the house drummer at Caf√© Society in New York City, where he played with the leading bebop players of the day. Among them, the most important influence on Jones was Tadd Dameron. Jones toured and recorded with Miles Davis Quintet from 1955 to 1958‚Äîa band that became known as \\"The Quintet\\" (along with Red Garland on piano, John Coltrane on sax, and Paul Chambers on bass). Davis acknowledged that Jones was his favorite drummer, and stated in his autobiography that he would always listen for Jones in other drummers. From 1958 Jones worked as a leader, but continued to work as a sideman with other musicians, including Bill Evans and Hank Mobley. Evans, like Davis, also openly stated that Jones was his all-time favorite drummer. =Europe= Between late 1967 and 1972 Jones lived in London and Paris,\\"About Philly Joe Jones\\", MTV Artists. performing and recording with musicians including Archie Shepp, Mal Waldron and Hank Mobley.\\"Philly Joe Jones Discography - session index\\", Jazzdisco.org.

This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures (>700 ¬∞C), without combustion, with a controlled amount of oxygen and/or steam. The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from synthesis gas) or producer gas and is itself a fuel. The power derived from gasification and combustion of the resultant gas is considered to be a source of renewable energy if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass.The Clean and Renewable Energy Source, biomass.uk.com, accessed 16.05.11 Thermal Gasification of Biomass, International Energy Agency Task 33 , http://www.gastechnology.org, accessed 16.05.11 The advantage of gasification is that using the syngas (synthesis gas H2/CO) is potentially more efficient than direct combustion of the original fuel because it can be combusted at higher temperatures or even in fuel cells, so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by Carnot's rule is higher (or in case of fuel cells not applicable). Syngas may be burned directly in gas engines, used to produce methanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process into synthetic fuel. For some materials gasification can be an alternative to landfilling and incineration. Some gasification processes aims at refining out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and potassium, allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity. Gasification can generate lower amounts of some pollutants as SOx and NOx than combustion.Chris Higman and Maarten van der Burgt. Gasification, Second Edition, Elsevier (2008). History Adler Diplomat 3 with gas generator (1941) The process of producing energy using the gasification method has been in use for more than 180 years. In the early time coal and peat were used to power these plants. Initially developed to produce town gas for lighting and cooking in the 1800s, this was replaced by electricity and natural gas, it was also used in blast furnaces but the bigger role was played in the production of synthetic chemicals where it has been in use since the 1920s. During both world wars, especially the World War II, the need for fuel produced by gasification reemerged due to the shortage of petroleum.Gas Generator Project History of the Gasogene technology Wood gas generators, called Gasogene or Gazog√®ne, were used to power motor vehicles in Europe. By 1945 there were trucks, buses and agricultural machines that were powered by gasification. It is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on producer gas all over the world. Chemical reactions In a gasifier, the carbonaceous material undergoes several different processes: Pyrolysis of carbonaceous fuels Gasification of char # The dehydration or drying process occurs at around 100 ¬∞C. Typically the resulting steam is mixed into the gas flow and may be involved with subsequent chemical reactions, notably the water-gas reaction if the temperature is sufficiently high (see step #5). # The pyrolysis (or devolatilization) process occurs at around 200‚Äì300 ¬∞C. Volatiles are released and char is produced, resulting in up to 70% weight loss for coal. The process is dependent on the properties of the carbonaceous material and determines the structure and composition of the char, which will then undergo gasification reactions. # The combustion process occurs as the volatile products and some of the char react with oxygen to primarily form carbon dioxide and small amounts of carbon monoxide, which provides heat for the subsequent gasification reactions. Letting C represent a carbon-containing organic compound, the basic reaction here is {\\\\rm C} + {\\\\rm O}_2 \\\\rarr {\\\\rm CO}_2 # The gasification process occurs as the char reacts with steam and carbon dioxide to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen, via the reactions {\\\\rm C} + {\\\\rm H}_2 {\\\\rm O} \\\\rarr {\\\\rm H}_2 + {\\\\rm CO} and {\\\\rm C} + {\\\\rm CO}_2 \\\\rarr 2{\\\\rm CO} # In addition, the reversible gas phase water-gas shift reaction reaches equilibrium very fast at the temperatures in a gasifier. This balances the concentrations of carbon monoxide, steam, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. {\\\\rm CO} + {\\\\rm H}_2 {\\\\rm O} \\\\lrarr {\\\\rm CO}_2 + {\\\\rm H}_2 In essence, a limited amount of oxygen or air is introduced into the reactor to allow some of the organic material to be \\"burned\\" to produce carbon dioxide and energy, which drives a second reaction that converts further organic material to hydrogen and additional carbon dioxide. Further reactions occur when the formed carbon monoxide and residual water from the organic material react to form methane and excess carbon dioxide (4 {\\\\rm CO} + 2 {\\\\rm H}_2{\\\\rm O} \\\\rarr {\\\\rm CH}_4 + 3 {\\\\rm CO}_2). This third reaction occurs more abundantly in reactors that increase the residence time of the reactive gases and organic materials, as well as heat and pressure. Catalysts are used in more sophisticated reactors to improve reaction rates, thus moving the system closer to the reaction equilibrium for a fixed residence time. Processes Main gasifier types Several types of gasifiers are currently available for commercial use: counter-current fixed bed, co-current fixed bed, fluidized bed, entrained flow, plasma, and free radical.Beychok, M.R., Process and environmental technology for producing SNG and liquid fuels, U.S. EPA report EPA-660/2-75-011, May 1975Beychok, M.R., Coal gasification for clean energy, Energy Pipelines and Systems, March 1974Beychok, M.R., Coal gasification and the Phenosolvan process, American Chemical Society 168th National Meeting, Atlantic City, September 1974 =Counter-current fixed bed (\\"up draft\\") gasifier= A fixed bed of carbonaceous fuel (e.g. coal or biomass) through which the \\"gasification agent\\" (steam, oxygen and/or air) flows in counter- current configuration.Thanapal SS, Annamalai K, Sweeten J, Gordillo G, (2011), ‚ÄúFixed bed gasification of dairy biomass with enriched air mixture‚Äù. Appl Energy, doi:10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.11.072 The ash is either removed in the dry condition or as a slag. The slagging gasifiers have a lower ratio of steam to carbon, achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature. The nature of the gasifier means that the fuel must have high mechanical strength and must ideally be non-caking so that it will form a permeable bed, although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent. The throughput for this type of gasifier is relatively low. Thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low. However, this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures, so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use. The tar can be recycled to the reactor. In the gasification of fine, undensified biomass such as rice hulls, it is necessary to blow air into the reactor by means of a fan. This creates very high gasification temperature, as high as 1000 C. Above the gasification zone, a bed of fine and hot char is formed, and as the gas is blow forced through this bed, most complex hydrocarbons are broken down into simple components of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. =Co- current fixed bed (\\"down draft\\") gasifier= Similar to the counter-current type, but the gasification agent gas flows in co-current configuration with the fuel (downwards, hence the name \\"down draft gasifier\\"). Heat needs to be added to the upper part of the bed, either by combusting small amounts of the fuel or from external heat sources. The produced gas leaves the gasifier at a high temperature, and most of this heat is often transferred to the gasification agent added in the top of the bed, resulting in an energy efficiency on level with the counter-current type. Since all tars must pass through a hot bed of char in this configuration, tar levels are much lower than the counter-current type. =Fluidized bed reactor= The fuel is fluidized in oxygen and steam or air. The ash is removed dry or as heavy agglomerates that defluidize. The temperatures are relatively low in dry ash gasifiers, so the fuel must be highly reactive; low-grade coals are particularly suitable. The agglomerating gasifiers have slightly higher temperatures, and are suitable for higher rank coals. Fuel throughput is higher than for the fixed bed, but not as high as for the entrained flow gasifier. The conversion efficiency can be rather low due to elutriation of carbonaceous material. Recycle or subsequent combustion of solids can be used to increase conversion. Fluidized bed gasifiers are most useful for fuels that form highly corrosive ash that would damage the walls of slagging gasifiers. Biomass fuels generally contain high levels of corrosive ash. Fluidized bed gasifiers uses inert bed material at a fluidized state which enhance the heat and biomass distribution inside a gasifier. At a fluidized state, the superficial fluid velocity is greater than the minimum fluidization velocity required to lift the bed material against the weight of the bed. Fluidized bed gasifiers are divided into Bubbling Fluidized Bed (BFB), Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) and Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB) gasifiers. =Entrained flow gasifier= A dry pulverized solid, an atomized liquid fuel or a fuel slurry is gasified with oxygen (much less frequent: air) in co-current flow. The gasification reactions take place in a dense cloud of very fine particles. Most coals are suitable for this type of gasifier because of the high operating temperatures and because the coal particles are well separated from one another. The high temperatures and pressures also mean that a higher throughput can be achieved, however thermal efficiency is somewhat lower as the gas must be cooled before it can be cleaned with existing technology. The high temperatures also mean that tar and methane are not present in the product gas; however the oxygen requirement is higher than for the other types of gasifiers. All entrained flow gasifiers remove the major part of the ash as a slag as the operating temperature is well above the ash fusion temperature. A smaller fraction of the ash is produced either as a very fine dry fly ash or as a black colored fly ash slurry. Some fuels, in particular certain types of biomasses, can form slag that is corrosive for ceramic inner walls that serve to protect the gasifier outer wall. However some entrained flow type of gasifiers do not possess a ceramic inner wall but have an inner water or steam cooled wall covered with partially solidified slag. These types of gasifiers do not suffer from corrosive slags. Some fuels have ashes with very high ash fusion temperatures. In this case mostly limestone is mixed with the fuel prior to gasification. Addition of a little limestone will usually suffice for the lowering the fusion temperatures. The fuel particles must be much smaller than for other types of gasifiers. This means the fuel must be pulverized, which requires somewhat more energy than for the other types of gasifiers. By far the most energy consumption related to entrained flow gasification is not the milling of the fuel but the production of oxygen used for the gasification. =Plasma gasifier= In a plasma gasifier a high-voltage current is fed to a torch, creating a high-temperature arc. The inorganic residue is retrieved as a glass like substance. Feedstock There are a large number of different feedstock types for use in a gasifier, each with different characteristics, including size, shape, bulk density, moisture content, energy content, chemical composition, ash fusion characteristics, and homogeneity of all these properties. Coal and petroleum coke are used as primary feedstocks for many large gasification plants worldwide. Additionally, a variety of biomass and waste-derived feedstocks can be gasified, with wood pellets and chips, waste wood, plastics and aluminium, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Refuse-derived fuel (RDF), agricultural and industrial wastes, sewage sludge, switch grass, discarded seed corn, corn stover and other crop residues all being used. Chemrec has developed a process for gasification of black liquor. =Waste disposal= HTCW reactor, one of several proposed waste gasification processes. Waste gasification has several advantages over incineration: * The necessary extensive flue gas cleaning may be performed on the syngas instead of the much larger volume of flue gas after combustion. * Electric power may be generated in engines and gas turbines, which are much cheaper and more efficient than the steam cycle used in incineration. Even fuel cells may potentially be used, but these have rather severe requirements regarding the purity of the gas. * Chemical processing (Gas to liquids) of the syngas may produce other synthetic fuels instead of electricity. * Some gasification processes treat ash containing heavy metals at very high temperatures so that it is released in a glassy and chemically stable form. A major challenge for waste gasification technologies is to reach an acceptable (positive) gross electric efficiency. The high efficiency of converting syngas to electric power is counteracted by significant power consumption in the waste preprocessing, the consumption of large amounts of pure oxygen (which is often used as gasification agent), and gas cleaning. Another challenge becoming apparent when implementing the processes in real life is to obtain long service intervals in the plants, so that it is not necessary to close down the plant every few months for cleaning the reactor. Environmental advocates have called gasification \\"incineration in disguise\\" and argue that the technology is still dangerous to air quality and public health. \\"Since 2003 numerous proposals for waste treatment facilities hoping to use... gasification technologies failed to receive final approval to operate when the claims of project proponents did not withstand public and governmental scrutiny of key claims,\\" according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. One facility which operated from 2009‚Äì2011 in Ottawa had 29 \\"emissions incidents\\" and 13 \\"spills\\" over those three years. It was also only able to operate roughly 25% of the time.Plasco Energy Group Demonstration Project Final Report Several waste gasification processes have been proposed, but few have yet been built and tested, and only a handful have been implemented as plants processing real waste, and most of the time in combination with fossil fuels.Gasification case studies by the Environment Agency of England and Wales One plant (in Chiba, Japan using the Thermoselect processThermoselect website ‚Äî A waste gasification plant supplier) has been processing industrial waste with natural gas and purified oxygen since year 2000, but has not yet documented positive net energy production from the process. In 2007 Ze-gen erected a waste gasification demonstration facility in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The facility was designed to demonstrate gasification of specific non-MSW waste streams using liquid metal gasification. This facility came after widespread public opposition shelved plans for a similar plant in Attleboro, Massachusetts. Today Ze-gen appears to be defunct, and the company website was taken down in 2014. Also in the US, in 2011 a plasma system delivered by PyroGenesis Canada Inc. was tested to gasify municipal solid waste, hazardous waste and biomedical waste at the Hurlburt Field Florida Special Operations Command Air Force base. The plant, which cost $7.4 million to construct, was closed and sold at a government liquidation auction in May 2013. The opening bid was $25. The winning bid was sealed. Current applications Syngas can be used for heat production and for generation of mechanical and electrical power. Like other gaseous fuels, producer gas gives greater control over power levels when compared to solid fuels, leading to more efficient and cleaner operation. Syngas can also be used for further processing to liquid fuels or chemicals. =Heat= Gasifiers offer a flexible option for thermal applications, as they can be retrofitted into existing gas fueled devices such as ovens, furnaces, boilers, etc., where syngas may replace fossil fuels. Heating values of syngas are generally around 4‚Äì10 MJ/m3. =Electricity= Currently Industrial-scale gasification is primarily used to produce electricity from fossil fuels such as coal, where the syngas is burned in a gas turbine. Gasification is also used industrially in the production of electricity, ammonia and liquid fuels (oil) using Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC), with the possibility of producing methane and hydrogen for fuel cells. IGCC is also a more efficient method of CO2 capture as compared to conventional technologies. IGCC demonstration plants have been operating since the early 1970s and some of the plants constructed in the 1990s are now entering commercial service. =Combined heat and power= In small business and building applications, where the wood source is sustainable, 250‚Äì1000 kWe and new zero carbon biomass gasification plants have been installed in Europe that produce tar free syngas from wood and burn it in reciprocating engines connected to a generator with heat recovery. This type of plant is often referred to as a wood biomass CHP unit but is a plant with seven different processes: biomass processing, fuel delivery, gasification, gas cleaning, waste disposal, electricity generation and heat recovery.Wood Gasification CHP / Cogeneration Plants , 02.09.09 =Transport fuel= Diesel engines can be operated on dual fuel mode using producer gas.

Hofmann et al. in Journal of Power Sources 173 (2007) 357‚Äì366 Mechanical energy from the engines may be used for e.g. driving water pumps for irrigation or for coupling with an alternator for electrical power generation. While small scale gasifiers have existed for well over 100 years, there have been few sources to obtain a ready to use machine. Small scale devices are typically DIY projects. However, currently in the United States, several companies offer gasifiers to operate small engines. =Renewable energy and fuels= Gasification plant G√ºssing, Austria (2001-2015) In principle, gasification can proceed from just about any organic material, including biomass and plastic waste. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it may be used for power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to dimethyl ether (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the Sabatier reaction, or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher. Regardless of the final fuel form, gasification itself and subsequent processing neither directly emits nor traps greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Power consumption in the gasification and syngas conversion processes may be significant though, and may indirectly cause CO2 emissions; in slagging and plasma gasification, the electricity consumption may even exceed any power production from the syngas. Combustion of syngas or derived fuels emits exactly the same amount of carbon dioxide as would have been emitted from direct combustion of the initial fuel. Biomass gasification and combustion could play a significant role in a renewable energy economy, because biomass production removes the same amount of CO2 from the atmosphere as is emitted from gasification and combustion. While other biofuel technologies such as biogas and biodiesel are carbon neutral, gasification in principle may run on a wider variety of input materials and can be used to produce a wider variety of output fuels. There are at present a few industrial scale biomass gasification plants. Since 2008 in Svenljunga, Sweden, a biomass gasification plant generates up to 14 MWth, supplying industries and citizens of Svenljunga with process steam and district heating, respectively. The gasifier uses biomass fuels such as CCA or creosote impregnated waste wood and other kinds of recycled wood to produces syngas that is combusted on site.Gasification allows less emissions, less dust and fuel flexibility ‚Äì News at Elmia Recycling to Energy 2010, 03.03.11SFC ‚Äì Soot Free Combustion: large scale biomass gasification, 03.03.11 In 2011 a similar gasifier, using the same kinds of fuels, is being installed at Munkfors Energy's CHP plant.

A three-time Grammy Award winner and fifteen-time nominee, Vai started his music career in 1978 at the age of eighteen as a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, and played in Zappa's band from 1980 to 1983. He embarked on a solo career in 1983 and has released eight solo albums to date. He has recorded and toured with Alcatrazz, David Lee Roth, and Whitesnake, as well as recording with artists such as Public Image Ltd, Mary J. Blige, Spinal Tap, and Ozzy Osbourne. Additionally, Vai has toured with live-only acts G3, Zappa Plays Zappa, and the Experience Hendrix tour, as well as headlining international tours. Vai has been described as a \\"highly individualistic player\\" and part of a generation of \\"heavy rock and metal virtuosi who came to the fore in the 1980s\\". He released his first solo album Flex-Able in 1984, while his most successful release, Passion and Warfare (1990), was described as \\"the richest and best hard rock guitar- virtuoso album of the '80s\\". He was voted the \\"10th Greatest Guitarist\\" by Guitar World magazine, and has sold over 15 million records. Biography =Early life= Steve Vai, a descendant of Italian immigrants, was born in Carle Place, New York on June 6, 1960. He is the fourth son of John and Theresa Vai. He described his first experiences with music as, \\"at the age of five I walked up to [a] piano, hit a note, and noticed that to the right the notes go higher and to the left the notes go lower. In that very moment, I had a full-on epiphany. I was flooded with the instinctual realization of how music was created and how it worked from a theoretical standpoint‚Äîthe whole language of music was very obvious. I also understood immediately, instinctually, and unequivocally something that has only deepened through the years that the creation of music is an infinite personal expression. I realized that I could do this, I could make music, and it could be whatever I want.\\" It was a year later, at the age of six, that Vai experienced his first introduction to the guitar, remembering that, \\"I saw this nine-year-old boy playing the guitar in my grade school auditorium, and that was another epiphany that I had. It was my first recognition of the instrument. When I saw that guitar and I saw this kid playing it, I knew instinctually that I was going to play the guitar someday, and that it would be my instrument. Don't ask me how I knew, I just knew. It was the coolest thing I had ever seen.\\" As a young child, Vai was influenced by the music his parents had listened to. One album in particular that he cites as his \\"musical awakening\\" was the original motion picture soundtrack to the 1961 film West Side Story. At age eleven, Vai was introduced to the contemporary rock and progressive music of the era, and after hearing the guitar solo to Led Zeppelin's \\"Heartbreaker\\" at age twelve, decided to begin playing the guitar. In 1973, Vai began to take guitar lessons from fellow New York native Joe Satriani, and played in local bands (The Ohio Express, Circus, and Rayge) throughout his high school years. Vai cites artists such as Jimmy Page, Brian May, Ritchie Blackmore, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, as well as jazz fusion guitarists Allan Holdsworth and Al Di Meola as some of his major influences in that time period. In 1978, to further pursue his interest in music composition and theory, Vai attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. While at Berklee, Vai began working for Frank Zappa as a transcriptionist, and in the middle of his fourth semester, moved to California to start his career as a session and touring artist for Zappa. Also while at Berklee, Vai met his future spouse Pia Maiocco, with whom he has been together since; they have two children. In 2003, Vai was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee. =Early music career (1978‚Äì1986)= Steve Vai (on guitar in between the drums and keyboard, to the right), Frank Zappa and band during a concert at the Memorial Auditorium in Buffalo, New York (October 25, 1980) In 1978, Vai sent both a notated transcription of Frank Zappa's \\"The Black Page\\", and a recording of his college band, Morning Thunder, to Zappa. Impressed by this, Zappa responded by putting Vai on salary as a transcriptionist to transcribe his work, which included pieces from the Joe's Garage and Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar albums. After leaving Berklee College of Music and moving to California, Vai auditioned for and became a full-time member of Zappa's band, going on his first tour with Zappa in late 1980. Zappa often referred to Vai as his \\"little Italian virtuoso\\", and Vai is frequently listed in the liner notes of Zappa's albums as having performed \\"stunt\\" or \\"impossible\\" guitar parts. Vai was a featured artist on the 1993 release Zappa's Universe, and in 2006, Vai appeared as a special guest on Dweezil Zappa's Zappa Plays Zappa tour; both projects won Vai a Grammy Award. After moving on from Zappa's employ in 1983, Vai bought a house in Sylmar, Los Angeles, where he built his first professional studio. During this period, Vai formed two bands (The Classified and 777) as well as writing and recording a large amount of music that was not originally intended for release. Out of this material, Vai compiled his first studio album Flex-Able. He created his own record label, Akashic Records (later Light Without Heat Records), which he used to take Flex-Able directly to distribution channels. Flex-Able was released in January 1984. Vai began his rise to public acclaim in 1983 when, shortly before the release of Flex-Able, his composition \\"The Attitude Song\\" was published in Guitar Player magazine. The song centered itself on a main guitar riff in the time signature 7/16, played over a rhythm section centered in 4/4. Each following section of the song showcased a number of specialized techniques (such as two-handed tapping, whammy bar acrobatics, sweep picking, alternate picking, multi-part harmonies, and odd phrasing) used in angular and exaggerated ways that were unique to the song at the time. Interest from the public eye grew more so when Vai's song \\"Blue Powder\\" (a demonstration for the Carvin X100b amplifier) was published in Guitar Player as well, which showed the virtuoso side of Vai's compositional process. Also in 1986, Vai was cast in the blockbuster film Crossroads as the Devil's guitar player \\"Jack Butler\\". In the famous \\"duel scene\\" between Vai and Ralph Macchio's character, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar, which was performed by Ry Cooder. In between solo work, Vai replaced Yngwie Malmsteen in June 1984 as the lead guitarist of Alcatrazz, with whom he recorded the album Disturbing the Peace. Vai left shortly after the subsequent tour to join David Lee Roth's band. =With David Lee Roth (1985‚Äì1989)= In 1985, Vai joined David Lee Roth's post-Van Halen band as lead guitarist, together with former Talas Bassist Billy Sheehan on bass; and former Maynard Ferguson drummer Gregg Bissonette on drums. The foursome's debut album Eat 'Em and Smile, released on July 7, 1986, was both a critical and commercial success, reaching number four on the Billboard 200 albums chart and selling over two million copies. Guitar World magazine editor Brad Tolinski commented on Vai's playing at the time, saying that \\"Steve Vai's guitar wizardry is so profound that in earlier times he would have been burned as a witch.\\" Retrospectively, Eat 'Em and Smile is frequently evaluated as one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980s. The group's Eat 'Em and Smile Tour began in August 1986 and continued through February 1987. Roth's subsequent album Skyscraper, released in 1988, was produced by both Roth and Vai. Like its predecessor, the album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the Billboard 200 chart. In 1989, following the successful Skyscraper Tour, Vai departed from the band. He was replaced by Cacophony guitarist Jason Becker. In 1985, after having joined Roth's band, Vai designed the JEM guitar, a unique instrument that incorporated a series of groundbreaking designs that have since become staples in feature throughout the guitar industry. Vai began working with Ibanez in 1986 to develop the guitar, and the first production Ibanez JEM 777 guitars were released in 1987. =1990s= twin-necked Ibanez, 1990s From 1985-90, Vai recorded Passion and Warfare at his home studio, his second studio solo album. After leaving Roth's band in 1989, Vai bought out of his Capitol Records contract and signed on with Relativity Records for the release of Passion and Warfare, which was completed shortly after he began recording the guitar parts for Whitesnake's Slip of the Tongue album, where he replaced the injured Adrian Vandenberg. Upon its release in November 1989, Slip of the Tongue sold over three million copies worldwide, reaching number 10 on the Billboard 200 while Vai joined the band on their thirteen-month world tour. In May 1990, Vai released Passion and Warfare through Relativity Records,Graham, Jonathan. Forgotten Guitar: Steve Vai's 1990 Appearance on MTV‚Äôs 'Headbangers Ball'. Guitar World. Retrieved 2019-09-20. and following its release, the album had reached number 18 in the Billboard 200, selling over a million and a half copies worldwide. Passion and Warfare won Vai a number of awards such as Guitar World and Guitar Player's \\"Best Album\\" and \\"Best Rock Guitarist\\" awards. Passion and Warfare has been cited as one of the most pertinent instrumental albums released. 1990 also saw the release of the Ibanez Universe seven-string guitar co-designed by Vai in conjunction with Ibanez. Vai left Whitesnake in 1990 to pursue his own musical avenues, and formed a band that included Devin Townsend on vocals, T. M. Stevens on bass, and Terry Bozzio on drums. The group released Sex & Religion on July 23, 1993, that was described as visceral in nature, combining a compositional and progressive metal rhythm section with Devin Townsend's vocal arrangements. After the following tour in support of the album, the group disbanded. Vai began working with Ozzy Osbourne in 1994, with whom he wrote and recorded the Ozzmosis album. Due to conflicts, the album was re-written and recorded with Zakk Wylde on guitar. In 1994, Vai won a Grammy award for his performance of \\"Sofa\\", from Zappa's Universe. While recording his fourth studio album Fire Garden, Vai took time to record and release the stripped down EP Alien Love Secrets. A departure from the often highly compositional and heavily produced style of his previous projects, the seven-track EP was recorded in four weeks and released through Relativity/Epic Records on March 21, 1995. Vai cites this record as one of his favorites, saying \\"The recording and release of Alien Love Secrets marked another turning point in my personal evolution. I was more concerned with making the record that I wanted to make, and not worry about what some others thought I should be doing.\\" On September 17, 1996, Vai released Fire Garden, 19-track double album, through Epic, with the first half being primarily instrumental while the second half featured Vai on vocals. After the release of Fire Garden, Vai joined his former teacher Joe Satriani, along with guitarist Eric Johnson, for the second installment of the ongoing G3 concert tours. On each G3 tour, three guitar-centric headlining acts are chosen to perform their own sets, and then collectively jam to fan favorite songs at the end of the show. G3: Live in Concert, a video of the 1996 tour was filmed in Columbus, Ohio and released on June 3, 1997. In 1998, Vai independently released a performance footage DVD of Alien Love Secrets. Also in 1998, Vai started the Make a Noise Foundation with his then-manager Ruta Sepetys. The goal of the foundation was to provide funding for musical education to those otherwise unable to attain it. Today, Vai often auctions items in his possession with proceeds going to the foundation. =2000s= Vai performing in 2001 In December 2001, Vai recorded two performances at The Astoria in London, with his band The Breed (composed of former David Lee Roth bandmate Billy Sheehan, guitarist/pianist Tony MacAlpine, guitarist Dave Weiner, and drummer Virgil Donati). This live show was released independently in DVD format as Steve Vai: Live at the Astoria, London in 2003, and was Vai's first of many successful live concert DVD projects. In 2004, Vai released twelve tracks from the DVD in an online only release. 2001 saw the limited release of The Secret Jewel Box, a conceptual ten-CD box set containing unique material from various eras of Vai's career. Four compilation albums (The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1; Mystery Tracks ‚Äì Archives Vol. 3; Various Artists ‚Äì Archives Vol. 4; and Vai: Piano Reductions, Vol. 1) included as part of the box set, were released to the public both in 2001 and the years following. Also in 2001, Vai's record label Favored Nations released No Substitutions: Live in Osaka. The release, which Vai himself produced and engineered, won him his second Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album in February 2002. While most widely recognized for his stature as a rock guitar player, Vai is also a musical composer fluent in the composition and arranging of orchestral music. In May 2004, Vai premiered \\"The Aching Hunger\\", a project commissioned by the Netherlands Programme Service and performed with the Netherlands' Metropole Orchestra. \\"The Aching Hunger\\" performances consisted of two parts: the first showcasing Vai's original contemporary orchestral compositions, and the second consisting of Vai (on guitar) playing newly arranged material from his catalog with the orchestra. This project yielded both the Visual Sound Theories DVD and the Sound Theories Vol. I & II album, which were recorded in 2005 during multiple \\"Aching Hunger\\" performances and released in June 2007. While \\"The Aching Hunger\\" and its following releases started Vai's public career as an orchestral composer, Vai had been composing since he began a music theory class (taught by Bill Westcott) in high school. In speaking of Westcott, Vai says \\"He taught me how to write, compose and appreciate music. There was no greater musical influence in my life.\\" In 2005, Vai released Real Illusions: Reflections, the first installment in an ongoing three-part trilogy concept album. Each of the three installments to the series contain material (songs, lyrics, and both spoken and written narration) with particular relationships to the storyline, purposefully left out of order. Upon the release of the third installment, Vai intends to complete a fourth album of material, which will then be released with the previous three installments and completed storyline in order. In speaking of the storyline, Vai says \\"It's a human interest story, about the human condition. ... It's a story about this man who has a traumatic experience in his life, and it drives him insane. We see the story through his eyes. It also involves the town he lives in and this stranger that enters the town who's like a shaman; he builds this giant edifice, like a reflecting pond, and when people come to it they see aspects of their personalities and identities and discover things about themselves. There's some comedy involved, too, but it's pretty esoteric. It's about a lot of lofty principles, so it's not a bad idea to dish this all out slowly.\\" The installments to the series will be released over periods of time, with the second, The Story of Light, having been released in 2012. In 2006, Vai joined the Zappa Plays Zappa tour as a special guest, alongside additional Zappa band alumni Terry Bozzio and Napoleon Murphy Brock. In 2008, for his performance of \\"Peaches en Regalia\\" from the Zappa Plays Zappa tour, Vai won his third Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Having always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business, Vai began a series of \\"Alien Guitar Secrets\\" masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play (see Notable contributions for more on this). In support of Sound Theories Vol. I & II and Visual Sound Theories, Vai put together a new band for a five-month world tour of the United States, Europe, South America, and Australia. While evaluating unique options for the band (which included ideas for a horn section or percussion section), Vai began auditioning violin players to complement the new lineup. This new band, known as the String Theories band, featured previous The Breed members Jeremy Colson (drums) and Dave Weiner (guitar and sitar), along with new members Bryan Beller (bass), Alex DePue (violin), and Ann Marie Calhoun (violin). During a month of twelve- to fifteen-hour a day rehearsals, Vai and the band perfected the performance (which consisted of pieces from Vai's catalog, arranged by Vai to include the two violins). The tour began in June 2007 and ended in December the same year. Midway through the String Theories tour in 2007, Vai recorded a performance at the State Theatre in Minneapolis, which yielded the acclaimed 2009 live concert DVD and Blu-ray release of Where the Wild Things Are. Certified gold in the United States and Canada, Where the Wild Things Are showcased the diverse musical range of the String Theories band, with pieces such as the visceral Grammy-nominated \\"Now We Run\\", to the dynamic ballad \\"Angel Food\\". 2007 also marked the 20th anniversary of the production of the Ibanez JEM guitar, a milestone which was commemorated with the 20th anniversary JEM model. Made of an acrylic body with three-dimensional \\"swirl painted\\" interior, this guitar can be seen in the beginning of the Where the Wild Things Are DVD. In 2008, Vai announced the release of his signature Ibanez Jemini distortion pedal, a twin distortion pedal with both a custom overdrive and lead distortion section. =2010‚Äìpresent= Vai performing with Led Zeppelin tribute band Zepparella, May 2017 2010 marked the twentieth anniversary of the production of the Ibanez Universe guitar, which was commemorated with a twentieth anniversary Universe model. A reissue of the early 1990s Universe 77 MC (multi-color swirl), the model included a new five- piece maple/bubinga Universe neck and original swirl-paint job by Darren Johansen (the painter of the original Universe 77 MC guitars). In February 2010, Vai announced the introduction of \\"VaiTunes\\", a platform used to release digital-only singles via iTunes and other digital media outlets. In April, Vai performed with Mary J. Blige, Orianthi, Randy Jackson, and Travis Barker for a rendition of the Led Zeppelin classic \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", on the hit television show American Idol. October 2010 saw more movement from Vai as a composer, with the premiere of two original symphonies at the Steve Vai Festival in Groningen, the Netherlands, and performed by the North Netherlands Orchestra. Shortly after the festival, Vai embarked on the Experience Hendrix tour (along with Eric Johnson, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Susan Tedeschi, Billy Cox, Vernon Reid, Robert Randolph, Jonny Lang, Brad Whitford, and others) for a nationwide tour of the United States. In March 2011, Vai (in conjunction with the online education division of Berklee College of Music) set a Guinness World Record for the world's largest online guitar lesson. The lesson was held as a promotion for Berklee's online \\"Steve Vai Guitar Techniques\\" course, which Vai helped to construct. In April 2011, Vai (along with music and technology entrepreneur Andy Alt) announced the launch of GuitarTV, an online streaming website dedicated to bringing free guitar-related content to the community of guitar players around the world. Vai's eighth studio album, The Story of Light, was released in August 2012 as the second installment in the Real Illusions concept album trilogy. The Story of Light tour, which began on the month of the album's release, spanned 254 engagements in 52 different countries, ending in September 2014. This tour yielded the 2015 release of Vai's fourth live DVD project Stillness in Motion, filmed in October 2012 during his Story of Light tour at the Club Nokia in Los Angeles. Released on April 7, the double-disc set contained a copy of the Stillness in Motion concert footage and a special bonus feature disc called The Space Between the Notes. The latter is a complete chronological timeline of the Story of Light tour, with a video or picture representation of each show of all of the 254 engagements attended. 2014 saw the announcement of a new, intensive guitar camp called the \\"Vai Academy\\", which was an evolution of the Alien Guitar Secrets masterclass. Each year the camp is held, Vai creates a syllabus with a particular theme and invites special guests to help him teach it. During the day, Vai and the special guests (of whom have included Guthrie Govan, Jeff Baxter, Vernon Reid, Eric Johnson, Sonny Landreth, and others) hold classes in which they add their insight and perspective to the theme. Each evening, Vai and the special guests jam with the campers. The themes have included 2014's Vai Academy- Song Evolution Camp, and 2015's Vai Academy: All About the Guitar. Vai has announced an upcoming 2016 release commemorating the 25th anniversary of Passion and Warfare. This release will contain remastered songs from the album, as well as the inclusion of a new album of material written from the time between the recording of Passion and Warfare and his first solo album Flex-Able. After the release, Vai will hold a world tour in which he will play the entire Passion and Warfare album, along with material from the new release. The tour would continue during the first half of 2017. In 2016, Vai played an uncredited guitar solo on the track \\"Go!,\\" from the album \\"Junk\\" by French electronic band M83. In April an May of the same year, Vai took part in the Generation Axe tour, alongside Tosin Abasi, Nuno Bettencourt, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Zakk Wylde. Starting in June, Vai embarked on the Passion and Warfare 25th Anniversary World Tour, where he played the album in its entirety for the first time. Vai is a featured artist on the track \\"Do You Feel Love\\" from Jacob Collier's 2019 album Djesse Vol. 2. Media appearances =Video games= \\"Juice\\", from Alien Love Secrets, was featured on the 1996 video game Formula One for the PlayStation. Vai's guitar work also appeared in the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. David Lee Roth's \\"Yankee Rose\\" was featured on Vice City's soundtrack, as well as \\"God Blessed Video\\" by Alcatrazz, as part of the Lazlow-led, 1980s rock/metal radio station \\"V-Rock.\\" In 2004, Vai was featured on the soundtrack to the Xbox video game Halo 2, performing a heavy rock guitar rendition of the \\"Halo theme\\", known as \\"Halo Theme (MJOLNIR Mix)\\". He also performed on the track \\"Never Surrender\\". He later featured in the second volume of the soundtrack, where he performed on the track \\"Reclaimer\\". Vai returned to re-record his Halo work for the Halo 2 Anniversary Original Soundtrack, which was released in 2014 and included as part of the anniversary edition of Halo 2. In an interview shot during the development of Halo 2 Anniversary, Vai reveals that his part in the ‚ÄúMJOLNIR Mix‚Äù was a last minute inclusion in the song. In 2008, Vai's song \\"For the Love of God\\" and \\"Halo Theme (MJOLNIR Mix)\\" were featured as downloadable tracks for the game Guitar Hero 3. A live version of \\"For the Love of God\\" was also available on the Rock Band Network service, as well as the song \\"Get the Hell Out of Here\\" from his 2002 compilation album The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1 on March 4, 2010. \\"The Attitude Song\\" and a live version of \\"The Crying Machine\\" were both also added to the Rock Band Network. A re-recording of \\"Speeding\\" is featured in the 2010 video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock for Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3. =Films= In 1986, Vai was cast in director Walter Hill's film Crossroads as the Devil's guitar player \\"Jack Butler.\\" In the \\"cutting heads\\" scene between Vai's Jack Butler and Ralph Macchio's Eugene \\"Lightning\\" Martone, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar (which was performed by Ry Cooder). The main body of the final piece performed in the duel scene (the fast-paced neoclassical track \\"Eugene's Trick Bag\\") was based heavily on Niccol√≤ Paganini's Capriccio number 5. The Crossroads duel appeared on the 2002 album The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1. In 1987, Vai performed \\"Amazing Grace\\" in the film Dudes. In 1991, Vai performed on the film Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, as well as on 1992's Encino Man, PCU (1994), and John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars (where he played on the tracks \\"Ghosts of Mars\\" and \\"Ghost Poppin'\\"). In 2010, Vai's record label Favored Nations produced and released the award- winning original motion picture Crazy. An independent film, Crazy was inspired by the life and music of the guitarist Hank Garland. Style and influence At the age of thirteen, after having purchased his first guitar and begun taking his first lessons from fellow New York native Joe Satriani, Vai became obsessed with the discipline of practice. Vai's practice routine, consisting of a rigid and structured regimen of ten-to-fifteen hour-a-day practice schedules, became the basis of his work ethic for the rest of his career. During his employment by Frank Zappa, Vai transcribed and played very rhythmically complex music, believing that if started slow and perfected, any piece of music could be played. Vai's first solo album, Flex-able, began his career as a solo artist in 1984. During the period of time that the album was recorded, Vai was heavily influenced by his previous tenure in Frank Zappa's band. Originally not intended for release, Flex-able expressed a certain creative \\"quirky\\" and \\"angular\\" freedom in the eclectic nature of Vai's writing style. Passion and Warfare, Vai's second solo album, expressed a more mature and evolved \\"signature\\" style but retained a certain freedom of unfettered inspiration that would continue to influence Vai's future releases. In speaking of his inspiration, Vai has said that it comes to him in many forms (even from the flowers pushed up against a fence outside of his studio, which he transcribed and used in the ninth track \\"Weeping China Doll\\", from The Story of Light). While expressing that he is not continuously inspired, Vai uses a concept he calls \\"musical meditation\\" to enter a state of consciousness that he calls \\"The Ultra Zone\\". When inside this un-critical frame of mind, Vai is able to achieve inspiration in the form of musical ideas (often in forms of melody or rhythm). For these moments of inspiration, Vai created what he calls the \\"Infinity Shelf\\", a drive of thousands of snippets of song ideas that he has collected over his entire career. These esoteric principles are taught by Vai during his Alien Guitar Secrets masterclasses, among a host of other information. Vai's playing style utilizes specialized guitar techniques (such as two-handed tapping, alternate picking, legato, hybrid picking, sweep picking, whammy bar acrobatics, and circular vibrato) in his music, as well as a wide range of recording techniques. Notable contributions =Work with Frank Zappa= As a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, Vai transcribed some of Zappa's most rhythmically complex music, using a range of conceptualizations for the notation of rhythmic music. Vai says \\"While transcribing the material, I was often confronted with situations that led me to reach into the intuitional areas of my imagination to come up with various notational devices and constructions that I had never seen before. I soon discovered that many contemporary composers were then (and are still) using these notations\\". These concepts can be seen throughout the \\"Frank Zappa Guitar Book\\", which were composed of Vai's guitar and drum transcriptions from various Zappa albums. Vai toured with Zappa from 1980 to 1983, performing selections of this technically demanding music with Zappa's band at the time. =JEM, PIA and Universe guitars= Vai designed the Ibanez JEM guitar, a unique instrument that incorporated a series of groundbreaking designs that have since become staples in feature throughout the guitar industry, in 1985. In speaking of the development of the guitar, Vai says, \\"Stratocasters had whammy bars‚Äîwhich were fantastic‚Äîbut they were very limited, were always going out of tune, and had single-coil pickups. Les Pauls had humbuckers‚Äîwhich gave you that real scream in the bridge position‚Äîbut no whammy bar, and I didn't like the way they sat. Neither guitar had twenty-four frets. So I went to a guitar shop in Hollywood, where I had these elements implemented into a guitar (what would have been considered a Superstrat at the time). The guitar was designed with a sharper body shape, a large cutaway around the neck, twenty- four frets, a fully floating tremolo system, a specially wired five-way pickup selector switch, and an output jack angled on the side of the body (so that when you step on the cable, it doesn't pull out of your guitar). I knew of course that these features would eventually be taken and used in other guitars, so I did something completely preposterous: I said, 'Put a handle in it!' That way, during videos and photoshoots I could swing the guitar around.\\" Vai had several custom prototypes of these guitars built (which were used on the Eat 'Em and Smile tour) by Joe \\"Jem\\" Despagni, a custom guitar luthier and friend of Vai's. Due to Vai's highly coveted position in Roth's band, many guitar companies were eager to propose endorsement opportunities. In response to these offers, Vai sent out the specifications of the JEM guitar, detailing that the company that returned the best guitar would be given the endorsement. Dissatisfied with the guitars returned and unwilling to compromise, Vai held out on a guitar endorsement until Ibanez approached him, sending him an instrument superior to that of the other companies and willing to follow his instructions. After the pre-production prototypes were perfected, the first production Ibanez JEM 777 guitars were unveiled at the NAMM Show in 1987. Since its original 1987 release, the JEM has become one of the longest-running and most successful signature series guitars in history, with its sister guitar, the Ibanez RG, being the second highest-selling guitar (behind the Fender Stratocaster) on the market. Another design by Vai was the Ibanez Universe, the first production seven-string guitar, which was released in 1989. The Universe incorporated many of the aspects that made the JEM a unique instrument (2 octave fretboard, full floating tremolo, humbucker/single coil/humbucker pickup configuration, angled output jack and deeper body cutaways), with an added low 'B' string, allowing for new low-range sonic possibilities. Used by Vai on much of Passion and Warfare and all of Whitesnake's Slip of the Tongue, the Universe was a large stepping stone for the burgeoning Nu-metal genre (with bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Fear Factory and Meshuggah having adopted the instrument and incorporating it into their signature sound). In 2020 the Ibanez PIA was introduced, featuring an alder body and a 5-piece maple / walnut neck with 24 frets, rosewood fretboard with floral inlays. This model differs from the JEM for its softer body curves and a Petal Grip handle replacing the original Monkey Grip cutout. It also sports DiMarzio UtoPIA pickups in an HSH configuration, gold hardware and a Prestige locking vibrato unit. =Alien Guitar Secrets masterclasses= Having always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business, Vai began a series of \\"Alien Guitar Secrets\\" masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play. Vai details certain concepts he has discovered that have helped him in all areas of his life and career, both in playing guitar/ musically as well as spiritually. Vai accessibly shares these concepts with masterclass participants using examples from his own experiences, delving into the ongoing process of identifying the self-critical nature of one‚Äôs own thoughts. Vai explains the techniques and exercises he uses to circumnavigate one‚Äôs own insecurities and thoughts of self-doubt, and encourages masterclass participants to use these tools in their own lives. Often embarking on masterclass tours through Europe, South America, and Russia, Vai considers this ongoing series of classes as one of his most important contributions. =Eventide H3000 Ultra-Harmonizer= Guitar effects manufacturer Eventide approached Vai in the mid-1980s to contribute unique ideas for their H3000 effects unit. Vai suggested many specific concepts, such as diatonic pitch change and multi-voice harmony, that were used in the unit and have since become standard algorithms in guitar effects processors. =DiMarzio pickups= In 1993, Vai's signature series high-output \\"Evolution\\" humbucker pickup set was released by DiMarzio. The Evolution pickups use DiMarzio's patented \\"Dual-Resonance\\" design. The \\"EVO 2\\" humbucker, a lower output model, was released in 2004. =Carvin Legacy amplifier= In 1997, Vai had begun working with the Carvin Corporation to design a signature series of Legacy amplifiers, which were used on his 1999 Epic Records release The Ultra Zone. The original Legacy I model was released in 1999, with the most recent Legacy III being released in 2012. =Touring= In the 1990s, Vai began touring in European and Asian countries (such as Russia and China) as well as South America, often having been the first American rock act in history to have performed in these areas. In 2014, Vai performed on the Chinese television station BTV's Spring Festival Global Gala, a program broadcast to over two billion viewers. With the broadcasting of this event on January 26, 2014, Vai became the first rock artist ever broadcast on a Chinese television program. Equipment Vai's FLO guitar in 2014 Vai's personal studio, The Harmony Hut, is a large edifice located in his backyard equipped with a full control room and performance room. The studio, built in 2011, is where Vai currently produces, records, and mixes his new material. Vai has two main signature series Ibanez JEM six-string guitars (dubbed \\"EVO\\" and \\"FLO III\\") that he uses live and in the studio. \\"EVO\\", a prototype Ibanez JEM 7VWH, was received in 1993 while developing Vai's signature DiMarzio Evolution pickups (hence the name of the guitar), and \\"FLO III\\" is a basswood Ibanez Los Angeles Custom Shop JEM 7VWH equipped with a Fernandes Sustainer system and a DiMarzio PAF Pro pickup in bridge position. His other favourite guitars include \\"BO\\", a JEM77BRMR prototype, also equipped with Fernandes Sustainer system and blue LED dot inlays, which was stolen in 2015, but recovered after; the original \\"FLO\\" guitar, a transformed original 77FP JEM to 7VWH specifications, also equipped with Fernandes Sustainer System and EVO 2 bridge pickup; and \\"Bruno\\" aka \\"For the Love of God\\" Ibanez Universe UV77MC seven-string guitar with burnt finish and mirror pickguard (this guitar was used in the For the Love of God music video). Vai uses his signature Carvin Legacy amplifier, as well as Morley Pedals, with whom he has his signature Bad Horsie and Bad Horsie II wah pedals, and Little Alligator volume pedal. Vai uses the Ibanez Jemini distortion pedal, a signature twin distortion pedal with separate overdrive and distortion sections. Before his endorsement with Ibanez, Vai was endorsed by Charvel guitars, most notably using a green and black San Dimas model. In addition, over the course of his career, Vai has used guitars made by various other companies, including Jackson, Fender, and Gavtone. =Guitar rig and signal flow= Vai's 2016 live guitar rig utilizes his signature Carvin Legacy amplifier (now on its third version), the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL, and an MFC-101 foot controller. Depending on the location and venue, Vai will use either his Legacy I or Legacy III heads, and Carvin Legacy 4x12 speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses EL-34 tubes by Groove Tubes in his Legacy amps. Vai uses the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL as the only modulation effects unit in his guitar rig. Generally for live use he utilizes the unit for stereo effects such as delay, chorus, and phase, with a separate preset for the parameters of each different song in his setlist. The Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller is set up in conjunction with the unit, allowing Vai to switch effects on and off in a fashion reminiscent to that of standard stompboxes. Vai's pedalboard consists of a wah-wah pedal (either his Morley Bad Horsie signature pedal, or a Dunlop Cry Baby 95q), an Ibanez Jemini twin distortion pedal, and DigiTech Whammy DT pitch shifting pedal. The centerpiece of the pedalboard is the Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller for the Axe-Fx II XL, which, as previously mentioned, controls the effects in a manner similar to switching on and off stompboxes. There are two expression pedals used for the Axe-Fx, one to act as a volume pedal, and the other to control the harmonizer built into the Axe-Fx unit. The signal from the guitar (usually one of the main guitars \\"EVO\\" or \\"FLO III\\") goes into either the Morley Bad Horsie or Dunlop 95q wah pedal. From there, it goes directly into the Ibanez Jemini twin distortion pedal, and then to the Digitech Whammy DT. From the output of the Whammy, the signal heads into the input of the Carvin Legacy amplifier head. Out of the effects loop of the Legacy, the signal heads directly into the Axe-Fx II XL, where it is split into stereo and the effects are applied (and controlled via the MFC-101 foot controller). Out of the output of the Axe-Fx, one signal is sent back to the original Legacy head return, and a second is sent to a second Carvin Legacy head return, bypassing the preamp stage completely and acting as a slave power amp. Vai utilizes his stereo setup on effects like delay, where he sets up two separate delay times (one slower and one faster) and allows them to alternate back and forth. The signal is then sent from the amp to the 4x12 Carvin Legacy speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses AKG microphones to mic his amps, and uses a separate Carvin power amp to power a direct guitar monitor cabinet instead of relying on the PA. In 1997, Vai began working with the Carvin Corporation to design a signature series of Legacy amplifiers, which were used on his 1999 album The Ultra Zone. The original Legacy I model was released in 1999, with the most recent Legacy III model being released in 2012.

Vai is married to Pia Maiocco, former bassist of the band Vixen (who can be seen in the 1984 film Hardbodies), with whom he has two children, Julian and Fire Vai. Vai is also a vegetarian and a beekeeper, regularly tending to the beehives kept on his Encino property. Band history Not including guest appearances.

Accessed January 2008. was an American blues and rhythm- and-blues singer and saxophonist, who was most successful in the late 1940s. He is considered a performer of dirty blues because of the suggestive nature of some of his songs, such as \\"I Want a Bowlegged Woman\\" and \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\". Career Jackson was born Benjamin Joseph Jackson in Cleveland, Ohio. He played violin as a child but quickly became drawn to the saxophone and started his first band, the Harlem Hotshots, while he was still in high school. In 1943, he was recruited as a saxophonist by the bandleader Lucky Millinder, and the musicians in Millinder's band gave him the nickname \\"Bull Moose\\" for his appearance. He began singing when he was required to stand in for Wynonie Harris at a show in Texas. Millinder encouraged Jackson to sign a solo contract with Syd Nathan of King Records to play rhythm and blues. The first recording in his own right was \\"I Know Who Threw the Whiskey\\", in 1946, an answer song to Millinder's \\"Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well\\". The following year, his recording of \\"I Love You, Yes I Do\\" reputedly became the first R&B; single to sell a million copies, holding the number 1 spot on the R&B; chart for three weeks and crossing over to the pop chart, where it reached number 24. He formed his own group, the Buffalo Bearcats, and over the next five years recorded in a wide variety of musical styles, including both romantic crooning and bawdy jump blues. His big hits in 1948 included the double-sided hit \\"All My Love Belongs to You\\" / \\"I Want a Bowlegged Woman\\", and his biggest R&B; chart hit, \\"I Can't Go on Without You\\", which stayed at number 1 on the R&B; chart for eight weeks. He also made an appearance in the 1948 film Boarding House Blues, with Millinder. In 1949, Jackson covered \\"Why Don't You Haul Off and Love Me\\", a song that been successful for Wayne Raney and also for several country-and-western performers. Jackson toured throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. Around 1951, his band included the bebop composer and arranger Tadd Dameron on piano and Benny Golson, another jazz musician, on saxophone. Some of Jackson's later risqu√© material, including \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" and \\"Nosey Joe\\" (written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller), caused a sensation during live performances but were too suggestive for the radio, and few of the records were sold. However, his band faithfully played \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" at every show. By the mid-1950s, Jackson was tired of touring and retired from music to work for a catering firm in Washington, DC, although he occasionally still performed at private parties. In 1961, he re-recorded \\"I Love You, Yes I Do\\" with modern high-fidelity equipment and had a minor hit. Twenty years later, the Flashcats, a blues band that performed in western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, regularly included \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" in their performances. A local DJ reputedly told the Flashcats that he knew Bull Moose Jackson, and the band's frontman, Carl Grefensette, found him catering at Howard University. Grefensette convinced Jackson to perform with them, and they quickly became a sensation in western Pennsylvania. Jackson then made the Flashcats his backing band and began a revival of his career. He also recorded a comeback album, Moosemania! (1985).\\"Bull Moose Jackson And The Flashcats ‚Äì Moosemania!\\" at Discogs. During the 1980s, Jackson, then in his 60s, had an extremely successful run performing in the United States and internationally. However, he fell ill with lung cancer in 1987 and retired from the touring circuit in the spring of 1988. An old girlfriend of his came back to care for him during his final illness. He died in Cleveland on July 31, 1989.

The uncle of the somewhat more famous Giovanni Gabrieli, he was the first internationally renowned member of the Venetian School of composers, and was extremely influential in spreading the Venetian style in Italy as well as in Germany. Life Details on Gabrieli's early life are sketchy. He was probably a native of Venice, most likely the parish of S. Geremia. He may have been a pupil of Adrian Willaert at St. Mark's in Venice at an early age. There is some evidence that he may have spent some time in Verona in the early 1550s, due to a connection with Vincenzo Ruffo, who worked there as maestro di cappella ‚Äì Ruffo published one of Gabrieli's madrigals in 1554, and Gabrieli also wrote some music for a Veronese academy. Gabrieli is known to have been organist in Cannaregio between 1555 and 1557, at which time he competed unsuccessfully for the post of organist at St. Mark's. In 1562 he went to Germany, where he visited Frankfurt am Main and Munich; while there he met and became friends with Orlande de Lassus, one of the most wide-ranging composers of the entire Renaissance, who wrote secular songs in French, Italian, and German, as well as abundant Latin sacred music. This musical relationship proved immensely fruitful for both composers: while Lassus certainly learned from the Venetian, Gabrieli took back to Venice numerous ideas he learned while visiting Lassus in Bavaria, and within a short time was composing in most of the current idioms, including one which Lassus entirely avoided: purely instrumental music.Arnold, Giovanni Gabrieli and the Music of the Venetian High Renaissance, p. 4. Note: while this book is mainly on Giovanni, Andrea's nephew, the initial chapter discusses in detail several of the other Venetian School composers, including Andrea. In 1566 Gabrieli was chosen for the post of organist at St. Mark's, one of the most prestigious musical posts in northern Italy; he retained this position for the rest of his life. Around this time he acquired, and maintained, a reputation as one of the finest current composers. Working in the unique acoustical space of St. Mark's, he was able to develop his unique, grand ceremonial style, which was enormously influential in the development of the polychoral style and the concertato idiom, which partially defined the beginning of the Baroque era in music.Arnold, Grove online His duties at St. Mark's clearly included composition, for he wrote a great deal of music for ceremonial affairs, some of considerable historical interest. He provided the music for the festivities accompanying the celebration of the victory over the Turks in the Battle of Lepanto (1571); he also composed music for the visit of several princes from Japan (1585). Late in his career he also became famous as a teacher. Prominent among his students were his nephew Giovanni Gabrieli; the music theorist Lodovico Zacconi; Hans Leo Hassler, who carried the concertato style to Germany; and many others. The date and circumstances of his death were not known until the 1980s, when the register containing his death date was found. Dated August 30, 1585, it includes the notation that he was \\"about 52 years old\\"; his approximate birth date has been inferred from this. His position at St. Mark's was not filled until the end of 1586, and a large amount of his music was published posthumously in 1587. Works Gabrieli was a prolific and versatile composer, and wrote a large amount of music, including sacred and secular vocal music, music for mixed groups of voices and instruments, and purely instrumental music, much of it for the huge, resonant space of St. Mark's. His works include over a hundred motets and madrigals, as well as a smaller number of instrumental works. His early style is indebted to Cipriano de Rore, and his madrigals are representative of mid-century trends. Even in his earliest music, however, he had a liking for homophonic textures at climaxes, foreshadowing the grand style of his later years. After his meeting with Lassus in 1562, his style changed considerably, and the Netherlander became the strongest influence on him. Once Gabrieli was working at St. Mark's, he began to turn away from the Franco-Flemish contrapuntal style which had dominated the music of the 16th century, instead exploiting the sonorous grandeur of mixed instrumental and vocal groups playing antiphonally in the great basilica. His music of this time uses repetition of phrases with different combinations of voices at different pitch levels; although instrumentation is not specifically indicated, it can be inferred; he carefully contrasts texture and sonority to shape sections of music in a way which was unique, and which defined the Venetian style for the next generation. Not everything Gabrieli wrote was for St. Mark's, though. He provided the music for one of the earliest revivals of an ancient Greek drama in Italian translation: Oedipus tyrannus, by Sophocles, for which he wrote the music for the choruses, setting separate lines for different groupings of voices. It was produced at Vicenza in 1585. Evidently Andrea Gabrieli was reluctant to publish much of his own music, and his nephew Giovanni Gabrieli published much of it after his uncle's death.

Wave drag is independent of viscous effects,Clancy, L.J. (1975), Aerodynamics, Section 11.7 and tends to present itself as a sudden and dramatic increase in drag as the vehicle increases speed to the Critical Mach number. It is the sudden and dramatic rise of wave drag that leads to the concept of a sound barrier.  Overview  Wave drag presents itself as part of pressure drag due to compressibility effects. It is caused by the formation of shock waves around a body. Shock waves create a considerable amount of drag, which can result in extreme drag on the body. Although shock waves are typically associated with supersonic flow, they can form at subsonic aircraft speeds on areas of the body where local airflow accelerates to supersonic speed. The effect is typically seen on aircraft at transonic speeds (about Mach 0.8), but it is possible to notice the problem at any speed over that of the critical Mach of that aircraft. It is so pronounced that, prior to 1947, it was thought that aircraft engines would not be powerful enough to overcome the enhanced drag, or that the forces would be so great that aircraft would be at risk of breaking up in midflight. It led to the concept of a sound barrier.  Research  In 1947, studies into wave drag led to the development of perfect shapes to reduce wave drag as much as theoretically possible. For a fuselage the resulting shape was the Sears‚ÄìHaack body, which suggested a perfect cross- sectional shape for any given internal volume. The von K√°rm√°n ogive was a similar shape for bodies with a blunt end, like a missile. Both were based on long narrow shapes with pointed ends, the main difference being that the ogive was pointed on only one end. = Reduction of drag = A number of new techniques developed during and just after World War II were able to dramatically reduce the magnitude of wave drag, and by the early 1950s the latest fighter aircraft could reach supersonic speeds. These techniques were quickly put to use by aircraft designers. One common solution to the problem of wave drag was to use a swept wing, which had actually been developed before World War II and used on some German wartime designs. Sweeping the wing makes it appear thinner and longer in the direction of the airflow, making a conventional teardrop wing shape closer to that of the von K√°rm√°n ogive, while still remaining useful at lower speeds where curvature and thickness are important. The wing need not be swept when it is possible to build a wing that is extremely thin. This solution was used on a number of designs, beginning with the Bell X-1, the first manned aircraft to fly at the speed of sound. The downside to this approach is that the wing is so thin it is no longer possible to use it for storage of fuel or landing gear. Such wings are very common on missiles, although, in that field, they are often referred to as \\"fins\\". Fuselage shaping was similarly changed with the introduction of the Whitcomb area rule. Whitcomb had been working on testing various airframe shapes for transonic drag when, after watching a presentation by Adolf Busemann in 1952, he realized that the Sears-Haack body had to apply to the entire aircraft, not just the fuselage. This meant that the fuselage needed to be made narrower where it joined the wings, so that the cross-section of the entire aircraft matched the Sears-Haack body. The Convair 990 had particularly obvious anti- shock bodies; modern airliners usually have more subtle shaping for area ruling. Application of the area rule can also be seen in the use of anti-shock bodies on transonic aircraft, including some jet airliners. Anti-shock bodies, which are pods along the trailing edges of the wings, serve the same role as the narrow waist fuselage design of other transonic aircraft.  Other drag reduction methods  Several other attempts to reduce wave drag have been introduced over the years. The supercritical airfoil is a type that results in reasonable low speed lift like a normal airfoil, but has a profile considerably closer to that of the von K√°rm√°n ogive. All modern civil airliners use forms of supercritical aerofoil and have substantial supersonic flow over the wing upper surface.  Mathematical formula  = For flat plate aerofoil = cd_w = 4*\\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2}{\\\\sqrt{(M^2 - 1)}} = For double- wedge aerofoil = cd_w = 4*\\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2 + (t/c)^2}{\\\\sqrt{(M^2 - 1)}}  Notes   References  * L.

Life  He was born in Vejrum, Jutland, Denmark, baptized J√∏rgen Axel J√∏rgensen, the brother of Asger Jorn. He later changed his family name from J√∏rgensen to Nash. He was married three times and had six children. His last marriage was with the painter Lis Zwick and would last until his death in 2004. The last forty years of his life he lived in the artist collective Drakabygget outside √ñrkelljunga, Sweden. From 1948 to 1951 he was involved with CoBrA. He went on to join the Situationist International. In 1959 he produced Stavrim, Sonetter a book of poetry illustrated by Jorn. In 1960 he founded the Situationist Bauhaus based at the farm Drakabygget with Jorn. He is the editor of Drakabygget, a journal about art and social philosophy. In 1963 became an honorary artist of the Royal Danish Academy of Art.  Exhibitions  He has exhibited at: * Galerias del Palacio de Belles Artes, Mexico City * Kobe Art Museum, Kobe, Japan * Museum of Modern Art New York * Moderna Museet * National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo * Museum de Art Moderno, Mexico City * Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo * Rooseum, Sweden * The Modern Art Gallery Silkeborg, Denmark * Museo Carillo Gil, Mexico City * Klingspor- Museum, Offenbach am Main, Germany * Yokohama City Art Hall, Yokohama, Japan * Tessin Institute, Paris * Museo National de Belles Artes and Centro Wifredo Lam, Havana, Cuba * Skissernas Museum, Lund, Sweden * Kongelige Kobberstiksamling, Copenhagen, Denmark * Centre Pompidou, Paris * Royal Academi of Art, Stockholm * Museu D√°rt Contemporani, Barcelona, Spain  Exclusion from the SI  On 10 February 1962, Nash voted with the majority of the Central Council of the Situationist International, for the exclusion of the Spur group. The majority was 5 to 1, with Dieter Kunzelmann be the only opposer.Situationist News, Internationale Situationniste #7 (April 1962) Nash rebuked those responsible for Spur, was initially in favor of them publishing a retraction, but stopped short of demanding an exclusion. After a debate on this subject, however, Nash decided on the option of exclusion. Kunzelmann too, the only opposing vote, and himself part of Spur, expressed his approval of all the Central Council's critiques towards the other Spur members. In Sweden, on March 1962, J√∂rgen Nash suddenly attacked the SI in the name of the Scandinavian section, with the tract Danger! Do Not Lean Out, and planned to convert the section in another Swedish \\"Bauhaus\\". Reckoning on the considerable geographical dispersion of the Scandinavian situationists, Nash had not even consulted with all of them before his putsch. Surprised at not being unanimously followed and at finding himself countered on the spot by the partisans of the SI majority ‚Äî Jeppesen Victor Martin, who immediately circulated a definitive repudiation of his imposture ‚Äî Nash at first feigned astonishment that things had gone to the point of a complete break with the situationists; as if the fact of launching a public surprise attack full of lies was compatible with carrying on a dialogue, on the basis of some sort of Nashist Scandinavian autonomy. According to the SI, Nash's main goal was to use the seal of \\"situationism\\" to attract a few highly profitable art dealers. The SI stated that this was confirmed by the fact that Nash's new Swedish \\"Bauhaus\\", which consisted of two or three Scandinavian ex-situationists plus \\"a mass of unknowns flocking to the feast\\", immediately plunged into \\"the most shopworn forms of artistic production\\".The Counter-Situationist Campaign in Various Countries, Internationale Situationniste #8, 1963. According to the SI, the development of this conspiracy was no doubt precipitated by the recent elimination of the SI's right wing, the Spur group, on whose support the Nashists had relied. In the tract Danger! Do Not Lean Out,Danger! Do Not Lean Out! published as a tract, and then reprinted in The Situationist Times #1 (1962) Nash, with Ansgar Elde and Jacqueline de Jong, stated that although there may be grounds to criticise the Spur group (Ervin Eisch, Lothar Fischer, Dieter Kunzelmann, Renee Nele, Heimrad Prem, Gretel Stadler, Helmut Sturm and Hand-Peter Zimmer), the way they had been expelled, and the SI itself, were totalitarian. However, the decision followed a debate and was voted by the majority 5 to 1, with Nash also voting in favor of it. Nash also implied that Ansgar Elde was present at the Council and that Jacqueline de Jong was part of if, which was false. The SI, at the behest of Jeppesen Victor Martin, described those they had expelled as nashists. On 24 April 1964 Nash with other members of Bauhaus Situationniste decapitated the statue of The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen harbour. This manifestation was part of the movements campaign against consumerist society. Following his exclusion he became involved in the Second Situationist International and the creation in 1974 of the Situationist Antinational. See also *Stewart Home See also * Jorgen Nash, Hangegal.

He is best known for his long-term collaboration with Elton John, having written the lyrics for most of John's songs. In 1967, Taupin answered an advertisement placed in the UK music paper New Musical Express by Liberty Records, a company that was seeking new songwriters. John responded to the same advertisement and they were brought together, collaborating on many projects since.Bernie Taupin Biography Songwriters Hall of Fame Taupin and John were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992. Birth and childhood Taupin was born at Flatters House, a farmhouse located between the village of Anwick and the town of Sleaford in the southern part of Lincolnshire, England, the son of Daphne (Cort) and Robert Taupin. His paternal grandparents were French. Taupin's father was educated in Dijon, and was employed as a stockman by a large farm estate near the town of Market Rasen. Taupin's mother worked as a nanny, having previously lived in Switzerland. The family later moved to Rowston Manor, a significant step up from Flatters farmhouse, which had no electricity.Elton John, Philip Norman, Fireside, 1991A Cradle of Haloes, Bernie Taupin, Aurum Press, 1988 Taupin's father decided to try his hand at independent farming, and the family moved to the run-down Maltkiln Farm in the north-Lincolnshire village of Owmby-by- Spital. Taupin's 11-year younger brother, Kit, was born there. Unlike his older brother Tony who attended a grammar school (selective secondary school), Taupin was not a diligent student, although he showed an early flair for writing. At age 15, he left school and started work as a trainee in the print room of the local newspaper, The Lincolnshire Standard, with aspirations of becoming a journalist. Taupin soon left that job, and spent the rest of his teenage years hanging out with friends, hitchhiking the country roads to attend youth club dances in the surrounding villages, playing snooker in the Aston Arms Pub in Market Rasen and drinking. Taupin had worked at several part-time, dead-end jobs when, at age 17, he answered the advertisement that eventually led to his collaboration with Elton John. Early influences Taupin's mother had studied French literature and his maternal grandfather John Leonard Palchett \\"Poppy\\" Cort was a classics teacher and graduate of the University of Cambridge. They taught him an appreciation for nature and literature and narrative poetry, both of which influenced his early lyrics. Collaboration with Elton John Taupin (left) with Elton John, 1971 In 1967, Taupin answered an advertisement for talent that was placed in the New Musical Express by Liberty Records A&R; man Ray Williams. Elton John answered the same advert. Neither Taupin nor John passed the audition for Liberty Records. Elton told the man behind the desk that he could not write lyrics, so the man handed Elton a sealed envelope from the pile of people submitting lyrics, which he opened on the London Underground ride home. The envelope contained poems by Taupin. The duo have collaborated on more than thirty albums to date. The team took some time off from each other for a while between 1977 and 1979, while Taupin worked with other songwriters, including Alice Cooper, and John worked with other lyricists, including Gary Osborne and Tom Robinson. (The 1978 single-only A side \\"Ego\\" was their only collaboration of note during the period, although John/Taupin B-sides such as \\"Lovesick\\" and \\"I Cry at Night\\" were issued with the respective singles \\"Song for Guy\\" and \\"Part-time Love\\" from the album A Single Man.) John and Taupin resumed writing together on (at first) an occasional basis in 1980, with Taupin contributing lyrics to only three or four songs each on albums such as The Fox, 21 at 33 and Jump Up!. However, by 1983's Too Low for Zero, the two renewed their partnership on a full-time basis and from that point forward Taupin was again John's primary lyricist for his solo releases. John often works with other lyricists on specific theatrical or film projects such as 1994's The Lion King and 2000's Aida, both of which featured lyrics by Tim Rice, and 2005's Billy Elliot, which has script and lyrics by the original film's screenwriter, Lee Hall. Hall also wrote the screenplay for Elton John biopic Rocketman, in which Taupin features heavily as a major character. Taupin wrote the lyrics for \\"Rocket Man\\", \\"Levon\\", \\"Crocodile Rock\\", \\"Honky Cat\\", \\"Tiny Dancer\\", \\"Candle in the Wind\\", \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\", \\"Bennie and the Jets\\", \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\", \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\", \\"The Bitch is Back\\", \\"Daniel\\", and 1970's \\"Your Song\\", their first hit. Hits in the 1980s include \\"I'm Still Standing\\", \\"I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues\\", \\"Sad Songs\\", and \\"Nikita.\\" In the 1990s, Taupin and John had more hits, including \\"The One\\", \\"Simple Life\\", \\"The Last Song\\", \\"Club at the End of the Street\\" and \\"Believe.\\" In September 1997, Taupin rewrote the lyrics of \\"Candle in the Wind\\" for \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\", a tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales. The 1991 film documentary, Two Rooms, described the John/Taupin writing style, which involves Taupin writing the lyrics on his own and John then putting them to music, with no further interaction between the two. The process is still fundamentally the same, with John composing to Taupin's words, but the two interact on songs far more today, with Taupin joining John in the studio as the songs are written and occasionally during recording sessions. Taupin and John had their first Broadway musical open in March 2006 with Lestat: The Musical. Taupin wrote lyrics for 10 songs (and an 11th completed non-album track \\"Across the River Thames\\") for John's 2006 album The Captain & The Kid (sequel to Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy) and appeared on the cover with him for the first time marking their 40th anniversary of working together. (\\"Across the River Thames\\" was issued as an Internet-only download as a bonus with certain editions of The Captain & the Kid.) On 25 March 2007, Taupin made a surprise appearance at John's 60th birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden, briefly discussing their 40-year songwriting partnership. Of Taupin's importance to their careers, as recorded on the Elton 60 - Live at Madison Square Garden DVD, John told the audience that without Taupin there probably wouldn't be an Elton John as the public has come to know him. Taupin and John also composed several songs for The Union, a collaboration album between Elton and his longtime hero Leon Russell released in October 2010. They also collaborated on five original songs for the 2011 Miramax movie Gnomeo and Juliet, including the Golden Globe-nominated \\"Hello Hello\\". Taupin and John's most recent album collaboration is Wonderful Crazy Night, released in 2016. In 2018, Taupin and John collaborated on two original songs for the animated film Sherlock Gnomes. In 2019, the movie Rocketman was released, containing an original song written by Taupin and John for the film, \\"(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again\\", which plays over the closing credits. The film depicts the personal friendship of Taupin (played by Jamie Bell) and John during the 1970s and 1980s. They later won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song \\"(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again\\". Collaboration with other artists In addition to writing for Elton John, Taupin has also written lyrics for use by other composers, with notable successes including \\"We Built This City\\", which was recorded by Starship, and \\"These Dreams,\\" recorded by Heart (both of which were collaborations with English composer/musician Martin Page). In 1978, he co-wrote the album From the Inside with Alice Cooper. Taupin has also produced American Gothic for singer-songwriter David Ackles. Released in 1972, it did not enjoy big sales, but the album was highly acclaimed by music critics in the US and UK. The influential British music critic Derek Jewell of the UK Sunday Times described the album as being \\"the Sgt. Pepper of folk.\\" Of Ackles' four albums, it was the only one recorded in England rather than in the United States. Taupin and Ackles had become acquainted when Ackles was selected to be the co-headlining act for Elton John's 1970 American debut at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Taupin was mentioned specifically as being one of the reasons American Gothic was selected by the writers and editors for inclusion in the book, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. He also collaborated on the book Burning Cold with photographer Gary Bernstein. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Taupin also collaborated with French American musician, Josquin Des Pres on at least 13 songs in his collection that have been performed and recorded by artists worldwide. In 2002, Willie Nelson and Kid Rock recorded \\"Last Stand in Open Country\\" for Nelson's album The Great Divide. The song was the title track of the first album from Taupin's band Farm Dogs (see below). Nelson's album included two other Taupin songs, \\"This Face\\" and \\"Mendocino County Line\\". The latter song, a duet between Nelson and Lee Ann Womack, was made into a video and released as the album's first single. The song won the 2003 Grammy for best vocal collaboration in country music. In 2004, he co-wrote Courtney Love's song \\"Uncool\\", from her 2004 debut solo album America's Sweetheart. In 2005, he co-wrote the title track to What I Really Want For Christmas with Brian Wilson for his first seasonal album. In 2006, he won a Golden Globe Award for his lyrics to the song \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" from the film Brokeback Mountain. The music of the song was composed by Argentine producer and songwriter Gustavo Santaolalla.

Side one, \\"Child\\", contains poems about his early childhood in southern Lincolnshire. The first poem, \\"The Greatest Discovery,\\" which looks at his birth from the perspective of his older brother Tony, was also set to music by Elton John and included on Elton's eponymous second album, Elton John. There are poems about Taupin's first two childhood homes, Flatters and Rowston Manor, and others about his relationship with his brother and grandfather. Side Two includes a variety of poems of varying obscurity, from a marionette telling her own story to a rat catcher who falls victim to his prey.Bernie Taupin: The One Who Writes the Words for Elton John, Bernie Taupin, Jonathan Cape, 1973 Taupin stated in interviews that he wasn't pleased with the album.A Conversation with Elton John and Bernie Taupin, Paul Gambaccini, Flash Books, 1974 In 1980, Taupin recorded his first album as a singer, He Who Rides the Tiger. The album failed to make a dent in the charts. Taupin later suggested in interviews that he didn't have the creative control he would have liked over the album. In 1987, he recorded another album, Tribe. The songs were co-written with Martin Page. \\"Citizen Jane\\" and \\"Friend of the Flag\\" were released as singles. Videos of both singles featured Rene Russo, the sister of Toni, his wife at that time. In 1996, Taupin formed a band called Farm Dogs, whose two albums were conscious (and successful) throwbacks to the grittier, earthier sound of Tumbleweed Connection. While Taupin wrote the lyrics, the music was a collaborative effort among the band members. Their first album, 1996's Last Stand in Open Country, received critical praise but little airplay. The title track was later recorded by Willie Nelson and Kid Rock for Nelson's 2002 album The Great Divide. In 1998, Farm Dogs released its second and final album, Immigrant Sons. The album was unsuccessful despite a tour of small clubs across America. Non-musical projects In 1973, Taupin collected all his lyrics up through the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album into a book, Bernie Taupin: The One Who Writes the Words for Elton John. In addition to the lyrics from the albums, this book contained the lyrics to all the single B-sides, various rarities, and Taupin's 1970 spoken-word album. The songs are illustrated by various artists, friends, and celebrity guests such as John Lennon and Joni Mitchell. The book is in black & white except for the cover. In 1977, Taupin collaborated with rock photographer David Nutter on It's A Little Bit Funny, adding text and helping chronicle Elton John's year- long Louder Than Concorde Tour. The now-collectible book was published in hard and soft cover editions by Penguin Books. It collects the better part of one year's worth of personal adventures and memories of Elton and the band, aboard his private plane, on the beaches of Barbados, at backstage gatherings and in some quieter off-stage moments with friends (including some famous faces that Elton and Bernie met and palled around with in their travels). In 1978, Taupin also appeared in an episode of The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, \\"The Hardy Boys & Nancy Drew Meet Dracula\\", singing backup to Shaun Cassidy. In 1988, Taupin published an autobiography of his childhood, A Cradle of Haloes: Sketches of a Childhood. The book was released only in the UK. It tells the tale of a childhood fuelled by fantasy in rural Lincolnshire in the 1950s and 1960s, ending in 1969 as Taupin gets on the train to seek his fortune in London. In 1991, Taupin self-published a book of poems called The Devil at High Noon. In 1994, Taupin's lyrics up through the Made in England album were collected into a hardcover book, Elton John & Bernie Taupin: The Complete Lyrics, published by Hyperion. However, it doesn't appear that Taupin was intimately involved in this project, as it contains multiple misspellings and outright misrenderings of the lyrics. It is also missing some of the rarities and B-sides found in the earlier collection. As with the 1973 collection, the songs are illustrated by various artists, this time in full colour throughout. In 1992, Taupin was asked to produce a benefit for AIDS Project Los Angeles. The event featured no songs written by the writer, instead opening with an acoustic set of performances of material chosen by the performers followed by selections from the musical West Side Story, chosen for its \\"timeless message of tolerance that is relevant to every decade.\\" = Bibliography = * 1971 ‚Äì The Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin (sheet music) * 1973 ‚Äì Bernie Taupin: The One Who Writes the Words for Elton John * 1977 ‚Äì Elton: It's a Little Bit Funny * 1991 ‚Äì Two Rooms: Elton John and Bernie Taupin =Visual art career= In addition to his music, much of his time is spent creating his visual art. Attributing his passion for art to his mother, Daphne, Taupin began displaying and selling his original artwork in 2010. Consisting of large, mixed media, contemporary assemblages, the art has been shown and collected across the United States and Canada. Canvassing North America over the last 10 years, Taupin's artwork has been seen at Art Miami, Art Southampton, the LA Art Fair, and in galleries in Denver, Toronto, Los Angeles, New York City, Houston, Dallas, Fort Lauderdale and Aspen to name a few. Patriotic and emotional in nature, the artwork often incorporates the American flag in many forms. Most recently, his work was exhibited in Beverly Hills at world-renowned gallery Galerie Michael. Personal life Bernie Taupin and wife Heather, attending the premiere of The Union at the Tribeca Film Festival, April 2011 Taupin has been married four times and divorced three: Maxine Feibelman (1971‚Äì76); Toni Lynn Russo (1979‚Äì91), sister of actress Rene Russo; Stephanie Haymes Roven (1993‚Äì98), daughter of entertainers Dick Haymes and Fran Jeffries; and Heather Kidd (March 2004‚Äìpresent), with whom he has two daughters, Charley Indiana and Georgey Devon. Taupin moved to Southern California from England in the mid-1970s and became a United States citizen in 1990. He lives in Santa Barbara County, California.

For Tusser the garden was the domain of the housewife, and the 1562 text expands on this theme. Scholars also consider it a text of interest for its defense of enclosures. It was among the best selling poetry books of the Elizabethan age.Samson, Alexander. Locus Amoenus: Gardens and Horticulture in the Renaissance, 2012 :3 Early life Tusser was born in Rivenhall, Essex, in about 1524, the son of William and Isabella Tusser. At a very early age he became a chorister in the St Nicholas collegiate chapel at Wallingford Castle, Wallingford, Oxfordshire. He appears to have been pressed for service in the King's Chapel, the choristers of which were usually afterwards placed by the king in one of the royal foundations at Oxford or Cambridge. But Tusser entered the choir of St. Paul's Cathedral, and from there went to Eton College. He has left a quaint account of his privations at Wallingford, and of the severities of Nicholas Udall at Eton. He was elected to King's College, Cambridge in 1543, a date which sets the earliest limit of his birth-year, as he would have been ineligible at nineteen. From King's College he moved to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. On leaving Cambridge, he went to court in the service of William Paget, 1st Baron Paget of Beaudesart, as a musician. After ten years of life at court, he married and settled as a farmer at Cattawade, Suffolk, near the River Stour. Literary career There he wrote A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie, a long poem in rhyming couplets recording the country year. This work was first printed in London in 1557 by publisher Richard Tottel, and was frequently reprinted. Tottel published an enlarged edition Five Hundreth Pointes of Good Husbandrie in 1573. Tusser includes a homely mix of instructions and observations about farming and country customs which offer insight into life in Tudor England, and his work records many terms and proverbs in print for the first time. In this work, he also famously presents ten characteristics the perfect cheese must have: > Not like Gehazi, i.e., dead white, like a leper > Not like Lot's wife, all salt > Not like Argus, full of eyes > Not like Tom Piper, \\"hoven and puffed\\" > Not like Crispin, leathery > Not like Lazarus, poor > Not like Esau, hairy > Not like Mary Magdalene, full of whey or maudlin > Not like the Gentiles, full of maggots > Not like a Bishop, made of burnt milkThomas Tusser, Five Hundred Good > Points of Husbandry (1573) as quoted in Ben Schott, Schott's Mischellany > Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008), November 7. > He never remained long in one place. For his wife's health he removed to Ipswich. After her death he married again, and farmed for some time at West Dereham. He then became a singing man in Norwich Cathedral, where he found a good patron in the dean, John Salisbury. =Samples= Five Hundred Points contains these rhyming couplets: > Sw√©ete April showers, > Doo spring Maie flowers.Tusser, Thomas (1573, 1577, 1580).

The latter is an early version of the proverb A fool and his money are soon parted. See also the reply by G. L. Apperson to the same query. Later life After another experiment in farming at Fairstead, Essex, he moved once again to London, whence he was driven by the plague of 1572‚Äì1573 to find refuge at Trinity Hall, being matriculated as a servant of the college in 1573. At the time of his death he was in possession of a small estate at Chesterton, Cambridgeshire, and his will proves that he was not, as has sometimes been stated, in poverty of any kind, but had in some measure the thrift he preached. Thomas Fuller says he \\"traded at large in oxen, sheep, dairies, grain of all kinds, to no profit\\"; that he \\"spread his bread with all sorts of butter, yet none would stick thereon.\\"{citation needed} Death Tusser died on 3 May 1580 at the age of about 55. An erroneous inscription at Manningtree, Essex, asserts that he was 65 years old. According to John Stow's Survey of London, Cheape Ward, Thomas Tusser was buried in the now lost church of St Mildred in the Poultry.Thoms 1876, 98‚Äì99: the fact is also noted from Stow in William Hone's Every-Day Book (London 1830), p. 285 (20 February). The inscription on his tomb there was as follows: > \\"Here Thomas Tusser, clad in earth, doth lie, > That sometime made the pointes of Husbandrie; > By him then learne thou maiest; here learne we must, > When all is done, we sleepe, and turne to dust: > And yet, through Christ, to Heaven we hope to goe; > Who reades his bookes, shall find his faith was so.\\" Stow's editorThoms 1876, p. 99, n. adds the following epigram on Tusser from a volume called The More the Merrier (1608), by 'H. P.': > Ad Tusserum > \\"Tusser, they tell me, when thou wert alive, > Thou, teaching thrift, thyselfe couldst never thrive. > So, like the whetstone, many men are wont > To sharpen others, when themselves are blunt.\\" Notes References  *W.

The symmetric difference is the union without the intersection: ~=~ 40px In mathematics, the symmetric difference of two sets, also known as the disjunctive union, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. For example, the symmetric difference of the sets \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{3,4\\\\\\\\} is \\\\\\\\{1,2,4\\\\\\\\}. The symmetric difference of the sets A and B is commonly denoted by A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B, or A \\\\ominus B or A \\\\oplus B. The power set of any set becomes an abelian group under the operation of symmetric difference, with the empty set as the neutral element of the group and every element in this group being its own inverse. The power set of any set becomes a Boolean ring, with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring and intersection as the multiplication of the ring.  Properties  thumb Venn diagram of ~A \\\\triangle B \\\\triangle C ~=~ 40px The symmetric difference is equivalent to the union of both relative complements, that is: :A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B = \\\\left(A \\\\setminus B\\\\right) \\\\cup \\\\left(B \\\\setminus A\\\\right), The symmetric difference can also be expressed using the XOR operation ‚äï on the predicates describing the two sets in set-builder notation: :A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B = \\\\\\\\{x : (x \\\\in A) \\\\oplus (x \\\\in B)\\\\\\\\}. The same fact can be stated as the indicator function (denoted here by \\\\chi) of the symmetric difference, being the XOR (or addition mod 2) of the indicator functions of its two arguments: \\\\chi_{(A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B)} = \\\\chi_A \\\\oplus \\\\chi_B or using the Iverson bracket notation [x \\\\in A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B] = [x \\\\in A] \\\\oplus [x \\\\in B]. The symmetric difference can also be expressed as the union of the two sets, minus their intersection: :A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B = (A \\\\cup B) \\\\setminus (A \\\\cap B), In particular, A\\\\triangle B\\\\subseteq A\\\\cup B; the equality in this non-strict inclusion occurs if and only if A and B are disjoint sets. Furthermore, denoting D = A\\\\triangle B and I = A \\\\cap B, then D and I are always disjoint, so D and I partition A \\\\cup B. Consequently, assuming intersection and symmetric difference as primitive operations, the union of two sets can be well defined in terms of symmetric difference by the right-hand side of the equality :A\\\\,\\\\cup\\\\,B = (A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B)\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,(A \\\\cap B). The symmetric difference is commutative and associative (and consequently the leftmost set of parentheses in the previous expression were thus redundant): :\\\\begin{align} A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B &= B\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,A, \\\\\\\\\\\\ (A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B)\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,C &= A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,(B\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,C). \\\\end{align} The empty set is neutral, and every set is its own inverse: :\\\\begin{align} A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,\\\\varnothing &= A, \\\\\\\\\\\\ A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,A &= \\\\varnothing. \\\\end{align} Thus, the power set of any set X becomes an abelian group under the symmetric difference operation. (More generally, any field of sets forms a group with the symmetric difference as operation.) A group in which every element is its own inverse (or, equivalently, in which every element has order 2) is sometimes called a Boolean group; the symmetric difference provides a prototypical example of such groups. Sometimes the Boolean group is actually defined as the symmetric difference operation on a set. In the case where X has only two elements, the group thus obtained is the Klein four-group. Equivalently, a Boolean group is an elementary abelian 2-group. Consequently, the group induced by the symmetric difference is in fact a vector space over the field with 2 elements Z2. If X is finite, then the singletons form a basis of this vector space, and its dimension is therefore equal to the number of elements of X. This construction is used in graph theory, to define the cycle space of a graph. From the property of the inverses in a Boolean group, it follows that the symmetric difference of two repeated symmetric differences is equivalent to the repeated symmetric difference of the join of the two multisets, where for each double set both can be removed. In particular: :(A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,B)\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,(B\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,C) = A\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,C. This implies triangle inequality: the symmetric difference of A and C is contained in the union of the symmetric difference of A and B and that of B and C. Intersection distributes over symmetric difference: :A \\\\cap (B\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,C) = (A \\\\cap B)\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,(A \\\\cap C), and this shows that the power set of X becomes a ring, with symmetric difference as addition and intersection as multiplication. This is the prototypical example of a Boolean ring. Further properties of the symmetric difference include: * A\\\\triangle B = A^c\\\\triangle B^c, where A^c, B^c is A's complement, B's complement, respectively, relative to any (fixed) set that contains both. * \\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}}A_\\\\alpha\\\\right)\\\\triangle\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}}B_\\\\alpha\\\\right)\\\\subseteq\\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}}\\\\left(A_\\\\alpha\\\\triangle B_\\\\alpha\\\\right), where \\\\mathcal{I} is an arbitrary non-empty index set. * If f : S \\\\rightarrow T is any function and A, B \\\\subseteq T are any sets in f's codomain, then f^{-1}\\\\left(A \\\\triangle B\\\\right) = f^{-1}\\\\left(A\\\\right) \\\\triangle f^{-1}\\\\left(B\\\\right). The symmetric difference can be defined in any Boolean algebra, by writing : x\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,y = (x \\\\lor y) \\\\land \\\\lnot(x \\\\land y) = (x \\\\land \\\\lnot y) \\\\lor (y \\\\land \\\\lnot x) = x \\\\oplus y. This operation has the same properties as the symmetric difference of sets. n-ary symmetric difference The repeated symmetric difference is in a sense equivalent to an operation on a multiset of sets giving the set of elements which are in an odd number of sets. As above, the symmetric difference of a collection of sets contains just elements which are in an odd number of the sets in the collection: :\\\\triangle M = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ a \\\\in \\\\bigcup M: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{A \\\\in M:a \\\\in A\\\\\\\\}\\\\right \\\\mbox{ is odd}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Evidently, this is well-defined only when each element of the union \\\\bigcup M is contributed by a finite number of elements of M. Suppose M = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{M_1, M_2, \\\\ldots, M_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a multiset and n \\\\ge 2. Then there is a formula for \\\\triangle M, the number of elements in \\\\triangle M, given solely in terms of intersections of elements of M: :\\\\triangle M = \\\\sum_{l=1}^n (-2)^{l-1} \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\\\ldots < i_l \\\\leq n} \\\\leftM_{i_1} \\\\cap M_{i_2} \\\\cap \\\\ldots \\\\cap M_{i_l}\\\\right. Symmetric difference on measure spaces As long as there is a notion of \\"how big\\" a set is, the symmetric difference between two sets can be considered a measure of how \\"far apart\\" they are. First consider a finite set S and the counting measure on subsets given by their size. Now consider two subsets of S and set their distance apart as the size of their symmetric difference. This distance is in fact a metric, which makes the power set on S is a metric space. If S has n elements, then the distance from the empty set to S is n, and this is the maximum distance for any pair of subsets.Claude Flament (1963) Applications of Graph Theory to Group Structure, page 16, Prentice-Hall Using the ideas of measure theory, the separation of measurable sets can be defined to be the measure of their symmetric difference. If Œº is a œÉ-finite measure defined on a œÉ-algebra Œ£, the function :d_\\\\mu(X, Y) = \\\\mu(X\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,Y) is a pseudometric on Œ£. dŒº becomes a metric if Œ£ is considered modulo the equivalence relation X ~ Y if and only if \\\\mu(X\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,Y) = 0. It is sometimes called Fr√©chet-Nikodym metric. The resulting metric space is separable if and only if L2(Œº) is separable. If \\\\mu(X), \\\\mu(Y) < \\\\infty, we have: \\\\mu(X) - \\\\mu(Y) \\\\leq \\\\mu(X\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,Y). Indeed, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mu(X) - \\\\mu(Y) &= \\\\left\\\\left(\\\\mu\\\\left(X \\\\setminus Y\\\\right) + \\\\mu\\\\left(X \\\\cap Y\\\\right)\\\\right) - \\\\left(\\\\mu\\\\left(X \\\\cap Y\\\\right) + \\\\mu\\\\left(Y \\\\setminus X\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left\\\\mu\\\\left(X \\\\setminus Y\\\\right) - \\\\mu\\\\left(Y \\\\setminus X\\\\right)\\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq \\\\left\\\\mu\\\\left(X \\\\setminus Y\\\\right)\\\\right + \\\\left\\\\mu\\\\left(Y \\\\setminus X\\\\right)\\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\mu\\\\left(X \\\\setminus Y\\\\right) + \\\\mu\\\\left(Y \\\\setminus X\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\left(X \\\\setminus Y\\\\right) \\\\cup \\\\left(Y \\\\setminus X\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\mu\\\\left(X\\\\, \\\\triangle \\\\, Y\\\\right) \\\\end{align} If S = \\\\left(\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{A},\\\\mu\\\\right) is a measure space and F, G \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A} are measurable sets, then their symmetric difference is also measurable: F \\\\triangle G \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}. One may define an equivalence relation on measurable sets by letting F and G be related if \\\\mu\\\\left(F \\\\triangle G\\\\right) = 0. This relation is denoted F = G\\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right]. Given \\\\mathcal{D}, \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{A}, one writes \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal{E}\\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right] if to each D\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D} there's some E \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E} such that D = E\\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right]. The relation \\"\\\\subseteq\\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right]\\" is a partial order on the family of subsets of \\\\mathcal{A}. We write \\\\mathcal{D} = \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right] if \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal{E}\\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right] and \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right]. The relation \\"= \\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right]\\" is an equivalence relationship between the subsets of \\\\mathcal{A}. The symmetric closure of \\\\mathcal{D} is the collection of all \\\\mathcal{A}-measurable sets that are = \\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right] to some D \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}. The symmetric closure of \\\\mathcal{D} contains \\\\mathcal{D}. If \\\\mathcal{D} is a sub-\\\\sigma-algebra of \\\\mathcal{A}, so is the symmetric closure of \\\\mathcal{D}. F = G\\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right] iff \\\\left\\\\mathbf{1}_F - \\\\mathbf{1}_G\\\\right = 0 \\\\left[\\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu\\\\right] almost everywhere.  Hausdorff distance vs. symmetric difference  right The Hausdorff distance and the (area of the) symmetric difference are both pseudo- metrics on the set of measurable geometric shapes. However, they behave quite differently. The figure at the right shows two sequences of shapes, \\"Red\\" and \\"Red ‚à™ Green\\". When the Hausdorff distance between them becomes smaller, the area of the symmetric difference between them becomes larger, and vice versa. By continuing these sequences in both directions, it is possible to get two sequences such that the Hausdorff distance between them converges to 0 and the symmetric distance between them diverges, or vice versa.

The mine was built by the Ralph M. Parsons Construction Company of the USA with General Enterprises Ltd. of Whitehorse being the main subcontractor. As of 2011, the population is 344, considerably lower than its peak of over 2,100 in February 1982. Faro was named after the card game. credited with discovering several significant deposits of lead and zinc ore and playing a major role in the discovery of the Faro Mine, which became Canada's largest lead-zinc mine. As these industries have declined over the past decade, Faro is attempting to attract eco-tourists to the region to view such animals as Dall's sheep and Stone's sheep, a species of mountain sheep almost unique to the surrounding area. Several viewing platforms have been constructed in and around the town. One unusual feature of Faro is that it has a golf course running through the main part of town. Lorne Greene, famous for his work in Bonanza, once narrated a film about Faro called A New World in the Yukon.  History  The area was prospected in the 1950s and 1960s by Al Kulan, credited with discovering several significant deposits of lead and zinc ore and playing a major role in the discovery of the Faro Mine, which became Canada's largest lead-zinc mine. The Cyprus Anvil Mining Corporation established the first operations to mine the deposits, and established the town of Faro. A new highway was built between Carmacks and Ross River to serve the Faro area - initially numbered Highway 9, it is today part of the Robert Campbell Highway, Yukon Highway 4. A forest fire in 1969 destroyed the newly built homes, which had to be re-built. Faro Mine \\"Faro Mine was once the largest open pit lead-zinc mine in the world.

Retrieved 2017-01-05 From the late 1960s until 1982 the mine became one of the largest lead-zinc mines in the world. At one time it was the largest open-pit mine in the world. During its history, 320 million tonnes of waste rock was removed to access the ore. The mine remained in more-or-less constant production until 1982. Trucks carried the ore concentrate from the mill by highway to Whitehorse, where the buckets were lifted from the trucks and lowered onto cars of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway. The trains took the buckets another 106 miles to Skagway, Alaska, where the contents were poured out into the holds of ships. During those years, Cyprus Anvil was purchased by Dome Petroleum. World prices for metals fell in 1982, and the mine owners announced in May a two-month halt to production starting in June, 1982. In July, the mine owners extended the shutdown to four months. In September, the owners announced that the shutdown would be indefinite. The shock to the Yukon economy, where the mine produced approximately 40% of territorial GDP, was massive.Down and out in the Yukon Territory, New York Times, July 28, 1985.

This operation ended in 1993, not long after Curragh Resources suffered a coal mining disaster at the Westray Mine in Plymouth, Pictou County, Nova Scotia. A third operation, by the Anvil Range Mining Corporation, opened in 1995 and ceased production in January 1998, followed by the bankruptcy of Anvil Range. Much of the heavy mining and milling equipment was sold and removed from the Yukon. Any prospect for further mining of the lead- zinc resource would now require significant investment to bring in mining equipment, and it would need to come entirely by road unless a B.C.-Alaska railway is built or the White Pass route is reopened to freight traffic to Whitehorse. Cost of cleanup is estimated at close to a billion dollars.Merit Consultants International Ltd.; responsible for projected clean-up cost reports.

In 2016 the federal Treasury reported that between $250 million and $350 million had been spent maintaining the mine site, without starting cleanup. The $40 million annual costs are to run pumps to prevent the tailings from breaching the dams.

The concerns listed by federal officials include the leaching of toxic metals into the Pelly and Yukon rivers as the acidic rock drainage worsens over time. The remediation work will include rerouting regional creeks to avoid tailings and waste rock areas, treating contaminated water, and avoiding clean water from becoming contaminated.  Transportation  The town is served by the Faro Airport. Climate Faro has a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen Dfc) with mild summers and severely cold winters. Extreme seasonal swings are common, although less severe than farther east in Canada due to the warm spells in summers and occasional mild spells in winter.

(Futures, Volume 68, April 2015, p. 5‚Äì18) Modern-day publicly listed multinational corporations (including Forbes Global 2000 companies), in many respect, are all 'descendants' of a business model pioneered by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the 17th century. One of the oldest known stock certificates, issued by the VOC chamber of Enkhuizen, dated 9 Sep 1606 In the early modern period, the Dutch developed several financial instruments and helped lay the foundations of the modern financial system.Tracy, James D. (1985). A Financial Revolution in the Habsburg Netherlands: Renten and Renteniers in the County of Holland, 1515‚Äì1565. (University of California Press, 300 pp)Sylla, Richard (2015). \\"Financial Development, Corporations, and Inequality\\". (BHC-EBHA Meeting). As Richard Sylla (2015) notes, \\"In modern history, several nations had what some of us call financial revolutions.... The first was the Dutch Republic four centuries ago.\\" The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first company in history to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public. In other words, the VOC was officially the first publicly traded company,Kaiser, Kevin; Young, S. David (2013): The Blue Line Imperative: What Managing for Value Really Means. (Jossey-Bass, 2013, ), p. 26. As Kevin Kaiser & David Young (2013) explain, \\"There are other claimants to the title of first public company, including a twelfth-century water mill in France and a thirteenth-century company intended to control the English wool trade, Staple of London. Its shares, however, and the manner in which those shares were traded, did not truly allow public ownership by anyone who happened to be able to afford a share. The arrival of VOC shares was therefore momentous, because as Fernand Braudel pointed out, it opened up the ownership of companies and the ideas they generated, beyond the ranks of the aristocracy and the very rich, so that everyone could finally participate in the speculative freedom of transactions.\\" because it was the first company ever to be actually listed on an official stock exchange. While the Italian city- states produced the first transferable government bonds, they did not develop the other ingredients necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market: corporate shareholders. As Edward Stringham (2015) notes, \\"companies with transferable shares date back to classical Rome, but these were usually not enduring endeavors and no considerable secondary market existed (Neal, 1997, p. 61).\\"Stringham, Edward Peter: Private Governance: Creating Order in Economic and Social Life. (Oxford University Press, 2015, ), p.42  Securities of a company  Usually, the securities of a publicly traded company are owned by many investors while the shares of a privately held company are owned by relatively few shareholders. A company with many shareholders is not necessarily a publicly traded company. In the United States, in some instances, companies with over 500 shareholders may be required to report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; companies that report under the 1934 Act are generally deemed public companies. = Advantages = Public companies possess some advantages over privately held businesses. * Publicly traded companies are able to raise funds and capital through the sale (in the primary or secondary market) of shares of stock. This is the reason publicly traded corporations are important; prior to their existence, it was very difficult to obtain large amounts of capital for private enterprises - significant capital could only come from a smaller set of wealthy investors or banks willing to risk typically large investments. The profit on stock is gained in form of dividend or capital gain to the holders. * The financial media, analysts, and the public are able to access additional information about the business, since the business is commonly legally bound, and naturally motivated (so as to secure further capital), to publicly disseminate information regarding the financial status and future of the company to its many shareholders and the government. * Because many people have a vested interest in the company's success, the company may be more popular or recognizable than a private company. * The initial shareholders of the company are able to share risk by selling shares to the public. If one were to hold a 100% share of the company, he or she would have to pay all of the business's debt; however, if an individual were to hold a 50% share, they would only need to pay 50% of the debt. This increases asset liquidity and the company does not need to depend on funding from a bank. For example, in 2013 Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg owned 29.3% of the company's class A shares, which gave him enough voting power to control the business, while allowing Facebook to raise capital from, and distribute risk to, the remaining shareholders. Facebook was a privately held company prior to its initial public offering in 2012. * If some shares are given to managers or other employees, potential conflicts of interest between employees and shareholders (an instance of principal-agent problem) will be remitted. As an example, in many tech companies, entry-level software engineers are given stock in the company upon being hired (thus they become shareholders). Therefore, the engineers have a vested interest in the company succeeding financially, and are incentivized to work harder and more diligently to ensure that success. = Disadvantages = Many stock exchanges require that publicly traded companies have their accounts regularly audited by outside auditors, and then publish the accounts to their shareholders. Besides the cost, this may make useful information available to competitors. Various other annual and quarterly reports are also required by law. In the United States, the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act imposes additional requirements. The requirement for audited books is not imposed by the exchange known as OTC Pink. The shares may be maliciously held by outside shareholders and the original founders or owners may lose benefits and control. The principal-agent problem, or the agency problem is a key weakness of public companies. The separation of a company's ownership and control is especially prevalent in such countries as U.K and U.S. = Stockholders = In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that firms whose stock is traded publicly report their major shareholders each year. The reports identify all institutional shareholders (primarily, firms owning stock in other companies), all company officials who own shares in their firm, and any individual or institution owning more than 5% of the firm's stock.  General trend  For many years, newly created companies were privately held but held initial public offering to become publicly traded company or to be acquired by another company if they became larger and more profitable or had promising prospects. More infrequently, some companies ‚Äî such as investment banking firm Goldman Sachs and logistics services provider United Parcel Service (UPS) ‚Äî chose to remain privately held for a long period of time after maturity into a profitable company. However, from 1997 to 2012, the number of corporations publicly traded on American stock exchanges dropped 45%. According to one observer (Gerald F. Davis), \\"public corporations have become less concentrated, less integrated, less interconnected at the top, shorter lived, less remunerative for average investors, and less prevalent since the turn of the 21st century\\". Davis argues that technological changes such as the decline in price and increasing power, quality and flexibility of computer Numerical control machines and newer digitally enabled tools such as 3D printing will lead to smaller and more local organization of production.  Privatization  A group of private investors or another company that is privately held can buy out the shareholders of a public company, taking the company private. This is typically done through a leveraged buyout and occurs when the buyers believe the securities have been undervalued by investors. In some cases, public companies that are in severe financial distress may also approach a private company or companies to take over ownership and management of the company. One way of doing this would be to make a rights issue designed to enable the new investor to acquire a supermajority. With a super-majority, the company could then be relisted, i.e. privatized. Alternatively, a publicly traded company may be purchased by one or more other publicly traded companies, with the target company becoming either a subsidiary or joint venture of the purchaser(s), or ceasing to exist as a separate entity, its former shareholders receiving compensation in the form of either cash, shares in the purchasing company or a combination of both. When the compensation is primarily shares then the deal is often considered a merger. Subsidiaries and joint ventures can also be created de novo ‚Äî this often happens in the financial sector. Subsidiaries and joint ventures of publicly traded companies are not generally considered to be privately held companies (even though they themselves are not publicly traded) and are generally subject to the same reporting requirements as publicly traded companies. Finally, shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures can be (re)-offered to the public at any time ‚Äî firms that are sold in this manner are called spin-outs. Most industrialized jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations that detail the steps that prospective owners (public or private) must undertake if they wish to take over a publicly traded corporation. This often entails the would-be buyer(s) making a formal offer for each share of the company to shareholders.  Trading and valuation  The shares of a publicly traded company are often traded on a stock exchange. The value or \\"size\\" of a company is called its market capitalization, a term which is often shortened to \\"market cap\\". This is calculated as the number of shares outstanding (as opposed to authorized but not necessarily issued) times the price per share. For example, a company with two million shares outstanding and a price per share of US$40 has a market capitalization of US$80 million. However, a company's market capitalization should not be confused with the fair market value of the company as a whole since the price per share are influenced by other factors such as the volume of shares traded. Low trading volume can cause artificially low prices for securities, due to investors being apprehensive of investing in a company they perceive as possibly lacking liquidity. For example, if all shareholders were to simultaneously try to sell their shares in the open market, this would immediately create downward pressure on the price for which the share is traded unless there were an equal number of buyers willing to purchase the security at the price the sellers demand. So, sellers would have to either reduce their price or choose not to sell. Thus, the number of trades in a given period of time, commonly referred to as the \\"volume\\" is important when determining how well a company's market capitalization reflects true fair market value of the company as a whole. The higher the volume, the more the fair market value of the company is likely to be reflected by its market capitalization. Another example of the impact of volume on the accuracy of market capitalization is when a company has little or no trading activity and the market price is simply the price at which the most recent trade took place, which could be days or weeks ago. This occurs when there are no buyers willing to purchase the securities at the price being offered by the sellers and there are no sellers willing to sell at the price the buyers are willing to pay. While this is rare when the company is traded on a major stock exchange, it is not uncommon when shares are traded over-the-counter (OTC). Since individual buyers and sellers need to incorporate news about the company into their purchasing decisions, a security with an imbalance of buyers or sellers may not feel the full effect of recent news.

Secondary chords are a type of altered or borrowed chord, chords which are not part of the key the piece is in. They are by far the most common sort of altered chord in tonal music. Secondary chords are referred to by the function they have and the key or chord to which they function. Conventionally, they are written with the notation \\"function/key\\". Thus, the most common secondary chord, the dominant of the dominant, is written \\"V/V\\" and read as \\"five of five\\" or \\"the dominant of the dominant\\". The major or minor triad on any diatonic scale degree may have any secondary function applied to it; secondary functions may even be applied to diminished triads in some special circumstances. Secondary chords were not used until the Baroque period and are found more frequently and freely in the Classical period, even more so in the Romantic period. Although they began to be used less frequently with the breakdown of conventional harmony in modern classical music, secondary dominants are a \\"cornerstone\\" of popular music and jazz in the 20th century.Benward & Saker (2003), p.273-7. Secondary dominant The term secondary dominant (also applied dominant, artificial dominant, or borrowed dominant) refers to a major triad or dominant seventh chord built and set to resolve to a scale degree other than the tonic, with the dominant of the dominant (written as V/V or V of V) being the most frequently encountered.Kostka and Payne (2003), p.250. The chord that the secondary dominant is the dominant of is said to be a temporarily tonicized chord. The secondary dominant is normally, though not always, followed by the tonicized chord. Tonicizations that last longer than a phrase are generally regarded as modulations to a new key (or new tonic). According to music theorists David Beach and Ryan C. McClelland, \\"[t]he purpose of the secondary dominant is to place emphasis on a chord within the diatonic progression.\\"Beach, David and McClelland, Ryan C. (2012). Analysis of 18th- and 19th-century Musical Works in the Classical Tradition, p.32. Routledge. . The secondary-dominant terminology is still usually applied even if the chord resolution is nonfunctional. For example, the V/ii label is still used even if the V/ii chord is not followed by ii.Rawlins, Robert and Nor Eddine Bahha (2005). Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians, p.59. . =Definition= The major scale contains seven basic chords, which are named with Roman numeral analysis in ascending order. Because tonic triads are either major or minor, you would not expect to find diminished chords (either the vii in major or the ii in minor) tonicized by a secondary dominant. It would also not make sense for the tonic of the key itself to be tonicized. In the key of C major, the five remaining chords are: : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 1_\\\\markup { \\\\translate #'(-4 . 0) { \\"C: ii\\" \\\\hspace #7 \\"iii\\" \\\\hspace #6.5 \\"IV\\" \\\\hspace #6.5 \\"V\\" \\\\hspace #6.8 \\"vi\\" } }_\\\\markup { \\\\translate #'(-2 . 0) \\"d minor\\" \\\\hspace #1 \\"e minor\\" \\\\hspace #1 \\"F major\\" \\\\hspace #1 \\"G major\\" \\\\hspace #1 \\"a minor\\" } } } Of these chords, the V chord (G major) is said to be the dominant of C major. However, each of the chords from ii to vi also has its own dominant. For example, V (G major) has a D major triad as its dominant. These extra dominant chords are not part of the key of C major as such because they include notes that are not part of the C major scale. Instead, they are secondary dominants. The notation below shows the secondary-dominant chords for C major. Each chord is accompanied by its standard number in harmonic notation. In this notation, a secondary dominant is usually labeled with the formula \\"V of ...\\" (dominant chord of); thus \\"V of ii\\" stands for the dominant of the ii chord, \\"V of iii\\" for the dominant of iii, and so on. A shorter notation, used below, is \\"V/ii\\", \\"V/iii\\", etc. : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 2_\\\\markup { \\\\translate #'(-4 . 0) { \\"C: V/ii ii\\" \\\\hspace #4.5 \\"V/iii iii\\" \\\\hspace #1.8 \\"V/IV IV\\" \\\\hspace #2.2 \\"V/V V\\" \\\\hspace #2.8 \\"V/vi vi\\" } }_\\\\markup { \\"A Dm\\" \\\\hspace #4.5 \\"B Em\\" \\\\hspace #2.5 \\"C F\\" \\\\hspace #4.2 \\"D G\\" \\\\hspace #4.3 \\"E Am\\" } ** } } Like most chords, secondary dominants may be seventh chords or chords with other upper extensions. Dominant seventh chords are commonly used as secondary dominants. The notation below shows the same secondary dominants as above but with dominant seventh chords. : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 2_\\\\markup { \\\\concat { \\\\translate #'(-4 . 0) { \\"C: V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/ii ii\\" \\\\hspace #4.2 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/iii iii\\" \\\\hspace #2.3 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/IV IV\\" \\\\hspace #2.0 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/V V\\" \\\\hspace #2.3 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/vi vi\\" } } }_\\\\markup { \\\\concat { \\"A\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\" Dm\\" \\\\hspace #4 \\"B\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\" Em\\" \\\\hspace #3.5 \\"C\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\" F\\" \\\\hspace #4 \\"D\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\" G\\" \\\\hspace #3.8 \\"E\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\" Am\\" } } ** } } Note that the triad V/IV is the same as the I triad. When a seventh is added (V7/IV), it becomes an altered chord because the seventh is not a diatonic pitch. Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 begins with a V7/IV chord:White, John D. (1976). The Analysis of Music, p.5. . : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << \\\\relative c { \\\\tempo \\"Adagio molto\\" \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 2(\\\\fp 8) r r4 \\\\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #3 2(\\\\fp 8) r r4 2\\\\cresc 4-.\\\\\\\\!( -.) 4\\\\f } >> ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 2(_\\\\markup { \\\\concat { \\\\translate #'(-6 . 0) { \\"C: V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/IV\\" \\\\hspace #1.5 \\"IV\\" \\\\hspace #7 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\\\hspace #3 \\"vi\\" \\\\hspace #6.5 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/V\\" \\\\hspace #10.5 \\"V\\" } } } 8) r r4 2( 8) r r4 2 4-.( -.) } >> >> } Chromatic mediants, for example VI is also a secondary dominant of ii (V/ii) and III is V/vi, are distinguished from secondary dominants with context and analysis revealing the distinction.Benward & Saker (2003), p.201-204. = History = Before the 20th century, in the music of J.S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms, a secondary dominant, along with its chord of resolution, was considered a modulation. Since this was a rather self-contradictory description, theorists in the early 1900s, such as Hugo Riemann (who used the term \\"Zwischendominante\\"‚Äî\\"intermediary dominant\\", still the usual German term for a secondary dominant), searched for a better description of the phenomenon. Walter Piston first used the analysis \\"V7 of IV\\" in a monograph entitled Principles of Harmonic Analysis.Piston, Walter (1933). Principles of Harmonic Analysis (Boston: E. C. Schirmer). . (Notably, Piston's analytical symbol always used the word \\"of\\"‚Äîe.g. \\"V7 of IV\\" rather than the virgule \\"V7/IV.) In his 1941 book Harmony, Piston used the term \\"secondary dominant\\".Piston, Walter (1941). Harmony (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.), p. 151. : \\"These temporary dominant chords have been referred to by theorists as attendant chords, parenthesis chords, borrowed chords, etc. We shall call them secondary dominants, in the belief that the term is slightly more descriptive of their function.\\" At around the same time (1946‚Äì48), Arnold Schoenberg created the expression \\"artificial dominant\\" to describe the same phenomenon, in his posthumously published book Structural Functions of Harmony.Schoenberg, Arnold (1954). Structural Functions of Harmony, edited by Humphrey Searle (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.): 15‚Äì29, 197. The term \\"artificial\\", however, appears to refer to the alteration by which a chord is changed into another: \\"By substituting for [altering] the third in minor triads, they produce 'artificial' major triads and 'artificial' dominant seventh chords. Substituting for [altering] the fifth changes minor triads to 'artificial' diminished triads, commonly used with an added seventh, and changes major triads to augmented. Artificial dominants, artificial dominant seventh chords. and artificial diminished seventh chords are normally used in progressions according to the models V-I, V‚ÄîVI and V‚ÄîIV. (p. 16.) In the fifth edition of Walter Piston's Harmony, a passage from the last movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata K. 283 in G major serves as one illustration of secondary dominants. This passage has three secondary dominants. The final four chords form a circle of fifths progression, ending in a standard dominant-tonic cadence, which concludes the phrase. : { \\\\set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1/12) ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << \\\\relative c { \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #247 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\tempo \\"Presto\\" \\\\clef treble \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 3/8 \\\\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #2 f8(\\\\p e) e-. e4( a,8) d4( g,8) c8-. r b-. \\\\grace { b8( } a4.)\\\\trill g8-. } >> ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 3/8 r8_\\\\markup { \\\\concat { \\\\translate #'(-5 . 0) { \\"G: V\\" \\\\combine \\\\raise #1 \\\\small 6 \\\\lower #1 \\\\small 5 \\"/ii\\" \\\\hspace #7 \\"vii\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"o\\" \\\\combine \\\\raise #1 \\\\small 6 \\\\lower #1 \\\\small 4 \\"/V\\" \\\\hspace #1.2 \\"vii\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"o\\" \\\\combine \\\\raise #1 \\\\small 5 \\\\lower #1 \\\\small 3 \\\\hspace #1 \\"vii\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"o\\" \\\\combine \\\\raise #1 \\\\small 6 \\\\lower #1 \\\\small 4 \\"/IV\\" \\\\hspace #1 \\"IV\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"6\\" \\\\hspace #2 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\\\hspace #4.5 \\"vi\\" \\\\hspace #4 \\"ii\\" \\\\hspace #5.8 \\"V\\" \\\\hspace #4 \\"I\\" } } } r -. r ( -.) r ( -.) -. r -. \\\\stemUp g4 fis8 g^. } ew Voice \\\\relative c' { \\\\stemDown s4. s s s c8 a d g } >> >> } =In jazz and popular music= Secondary dominant in \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\" (1971), mm. 1‚Äì8Benward & Saker (2003), p.277. In jazz harmony, a secondary dominant is any dominant seventh chord which occurs on a weak beat and resolves downward by a perfect fifth. Thus, a chord is a secondary dominant when it functions as the dominant of some harmonic element other than the key's tonic and resolves to that element. This is slightly different from the traditional use of the term, where a secondary dominant does not have to be a seventh chord, occur on a weak beat, or resolve downward. If a non-diatonic dominant chord is used on a strong beat, it is considered an extended dominant. If it doesn't resolve downward, it may be a borrowed chord. Secondary dominants are used in jazz harmony in the bebop blues and other blues progression variations, as are substitute dominants and turnarounds.Spitzer, Peter (2001). Jazz Theory Handbook, p.62. . In some jazz tunes, all or almost all of the chords that are used are dominant chords. For example, in the standard jazz chord progression ii‚ÄìV‚ÄìI, which would normally be Dm‚ÄìG7‚ÄìC in the key of C major, some tunes will use D7‚ÄìG7‚ÄìC7. Since jazz tunes are often based on the circle of fifths, this creates long sequences of secondary dominants. Secondary dominants are also use in popular music. Examples include II7 (V7/V) in Bob Dylan's \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" and III7 (V7/vi) in Betty Everett's \\"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\\".Everett, Walter (2009). The Foundations of Rock, p.198. . Everett notates major-minor sevenths Xm7. \\"Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue\\" features chains of secondary dominants.Shepherd, John (2003). Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production, Volume 11, p.10. A&C; Black. . \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" opens with V/V/V‚ÄìV/V‚ÄìV‚ÄìI. =Extended dominant= An extended dominant chord is a secondary dominant seventh chord that resolves down by a fifth to another dominant seventh chord. A series of extended dominant chords continues to resolve downwards by the circle of fifths until it reaches the tonic chord. The most common extended dominant chord is the tertiary dominant, which resolves to a secondary dominant. For example, V/V/V (in C major, A(7)) resolves to V/V (D(7)), which resolves to V (G(7)), which resolves to I. Note that V/V/V is the same chord as V/ii, but differs in its resolution to a major dominant rather than a minor chord. Quaternary dominants are rarer, but an example is the bridge section of the rhythm changes, which starts from V/V/V/V (in C major, E(7)). The example below from Chopin's Polonaises, Op. 26, No. 1 (1835)Benward & Saker (2003), p.276. has a quaternary dominant in the second beat (V/ii = V/V/V, V/vi = V/V/V/V). : { #(set-global-staff-size 16) ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #62 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\clef treble \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\voiceOne ges8 des16 es f8 c f c 16 d es8 bes es bes16 c \\\\tuplet 3/2 { des16\\\\prall[ c des] } f16[ r32\\\\fermata es]( aes,4) } ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\voiceTwo bes!8 bes a a aes aes g[ g ges ges f 16] r\\\\fermata r8 } >> ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef bass \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 8_\\\\markup { \\\\concat { \\\\translate #'(-6 . 0) { \\"D‚ô≠: ii\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\\\hspace #8.5 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/vi\\" \\\\hspace #5 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/ii\\" \\\\hspace #10 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\"/V\\" \\\\hspace #6 \\"V\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"7\\" \\\\hspace #10 \\"I\\" \\\\hspace #6.5 \\"V\\" \\\\combine \\\\raise #1 \\\\small 6 \\\\lower #1 \\\\small 5 \\"/V\\" \\\\hspace #6.7 \\"V\\" } } } [ 16] r\\\\fermata aes,8-. } >> >> }  Secondary leading-tone  In music theory, a secondary leading-tone chord or secondary diminished seventh (as in seventh scale degreeBlatter, Alfred (2007). Revisiting Music Theory: A Guide to the Practice, p.132-3. . or leading-tone, not necessarily seventh chord) is a secondary chord that is the leading-tone triad or seventh chord of the tonicized chord, rather than its dominant. In contrast to secondary dominant chords, these chords resolve up a half step.Benward & Saker (2003), p.271 Fully diminished seventh chords are more common than half-diminished seventh chords and one may also find diminished triads (without sevenths). Secondary leading-tone chords may resolve to either a major or minor diatonic triad: :In major keys: ii, iii, IV, V, vi :In minor keys: III, iv, V, VI The type of diminished seventh chord is typically related to the type of tonicized triad: # If the tonicized triad is minor, the leading-tone chord is fully diminished seventh chord. # If it is major, the leading-tone chord may be either half-diminished or fully diminished, though fully diminished chords are used more often.Kostka & Payne (2004). p. 263 Especially in four-part writing, the seventh should resolve downwards by step and if possible the lower tritone should resolve appropriately, inwards if a diminished fifth and outwards if an augmented fourthBenward & Saker (2003), p.272, as the example belowBenward & Saker (2003), p.270. shows. : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\stemUp \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 a2 g g1 } ew Voice \\\\relative c' { \\\\stemDown es2\\\\glissando d e1 } >> ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c' { \\\\stemUp \\\\clef bass \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 c2\\\\glissando b c1 } ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\stemDown fis2\\\\glissando_\\\\markup { \\\\translate #'(-7 . 0) { \\\\concat { \\"C: vii\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"o7\\" \\"/V\\" \\\\hspace #1 \\"V\\" \\\\hspace #5.2 \\"I\\" } } } g c,1 \\\\bar \\"\\" } >> >> } Because of their symmetry, secondary leading-tone diminished seventh chords are also useful for modulation; all four notes may be considered the root of any diminished seventh chord. Secondary leading-tone chords were not used until the Baroque period and are found more frequently and less conventionally in the Classical period. They are found even more frequently and freely in the Romantic period, but they began to be used less frequently with the breakdown of conventional harmony. The chord progression vii/V‚ÄìV‚ÄìI is quite common in ragtime music.  Secondary supertonic  The secondary supertonic chord, or secondary second, is a secondary chord that is on the supertonic scale degree. Rather than tonicizing a degree other than the tonic, as does a secondary dominant, it creates a temporary dominant. Examples include ii7/III (Fmin.7, in C major).Russo, William (1961/2015). Composing for the Jazz Orchestra, p.80. University of Chicago. .  Secondary subdominant  The secondary subdominant is the subdominant (IV) of the tonicized chord. For example, in C major, the subdominant chord is F major and the IV of IV chord is B major. Others The other secondary functions are the secondary mediant, the secondary submediant, and the secondary subtonic.

It is essentially a chi distribution with two degrees of freedom. A Rayleigh distribution is often observed when the overall magnitude of a vector is related to its directional components. One example where the Rayleigh distribution naturally arises is when wind velocity is analyzed in two dimensions. Assuming that each component is uncorrelated, normally distributed with equal variance, and zero mean, then the overall wind speed (vector magnitude) will be characterized by a Rayleigh distribution. A second example of the distribution arises in the case of random complex numbers whose real and imaginary components are independently and identically distributed Gaussian with equal variance and zero mean. In that case, the absolute value of the complex number is Rayleigh-distributed. The distribution is named after Lord Rayleigh ().\\"The Wave Theory of Light\\", Encyclopedic Britannica 1888; \\"The Problem of the Random Walk\\", Nature 1905 vol.72 p.318 Definition The probability density function of the Rayleigh distribution isPapoulis, Athanasios; Pillai, S. (2001) Probability, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes. , :f(x;\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sigma^2} e^{-x^2/(2\\\\sigma^2)}, \\\\quad x \\\\geq 0, where \\\\sigma is the scale parameter of the distribution. The cumulative distribution function is :F(x;\\\\sigma) = 1 - e^{-x^2/(2\\\\sigma^2)} for x \\\\in [0,\\\\infty). Relation to random vector length Consider the two- dimensional vector Y = (U,V) which has components that are normally distributed, centered at zero, and independent. Then U and V have density functions :f_U(x; \\\\sigma) = f_V(x;\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac{e^{-x^2/(2\\\\sigma^2)}}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2}}. Let X be the length of Y. That is, X = \\\\sqrt{U^2 + V^2}. Then X has cumulative distribution function :F_X(x; \\\\sigma) = \\\\iint_{D_x} f_U(u;\\\\sigma) f_V(v;\\\\sigma) \\\\,dA, where D_x is the disk :D_x = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{(u,v) : \\\\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} < x\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Writing the double integral in polar coordinates, it becomes :F_X(x; \\\\sigma) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^x r e^{-r^2/(2\\\\sigma^2)} \\\\,dr\\\\,d\\\\theta = \\\\frac 1 {\\\\sigma^2} \\\\int_0^x r e^{-r^2/(2\\\\sigma^2)} \\\\,dr. Finally, the probability density function for X is the derivative of its cumulative distribution function, which by the fundamental theorem of calculus is :f_X(x;\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac d {dx} F_X(x;\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac x {\\\\sigma^2} e^{-x^2/(2\\\\sigma^2)}, which is the Rayleigh distribution. It is straightforward to generalize to vectors of dimension other than 2. There are also generalizations when the components have unequal variance or correlations, or when the vector Y follows a bivariate Student t-distribution. Properties The raw moments are given by: : \\\\mu_j = \\\\sigma^j2^{j/2}\\\\,\\\\Gamma\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac j 2\\\\right), where \\\\Gamma(z) is the gamma function. The mean of a Rayleigh random variable is thus : :\\\\mu(X) = \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}}\\\\ \\\\approx 1.253\\\\ \\\\sigma. The variance of a Rayleigh random variable is : :\\\\operatorname{var}(X) = \\\\mu_2-\\\\mu_1^2 = \\\\left(2-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right) \\\\sigma^2 \\\\approx 0.429\\\\ \\\\sigma^2 The mode is \\\\sigma, and the maximum pdf is : f_{\\\\max} = f(\\\\sigma;\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma} e^{-1/2} \\\\approx \\\\frac{0.606}{\\\\sigma}. The skewness is given by: :\\\\gamma_1 = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}(\\\\pi - 3)}{(4 - \\\\pi)^{3/2}} \\\\approx 0.631 The excess kurtosis is given by: :\\\\gamma_2 = -\\\\frac{6\\\\pi^2 - 24\\\\pi + 16}{(4 - \\\\pi)^2} \\\\approx 0.245 The characteristic function is given by: :\\\\varphi(t) = 1 - \\\\sigma te^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2t^2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}} \\\\left[\\\\operatorname{erfi}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma t}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\right) - i\\\\right] where \\\\operatorname{erfi}(z) is the imaginary error function.

Applications  An application of the estimation of œÉ can be found in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As MRI images are recorded as complex images but most often viewed as magnitude images, the background data is Rayleigh distributed. Hence, the above formula can be used to estimate the noise variance in an MRI image from background data. The Rayleigh distribution was also employed in the field of nutrition for linking dietary nutrient levels and human and animal responses. In this way, the parameter œÉ may be used to calculate nutrient response relationship.

This may be due to formal (de jure) state sanction. Some jurists have less formal (de facto) backing by an ethical community, e.g. a religious community. In Islamic Law, for instance, such a community following (taqlid) a specific jurisprudence (fiqh) of shariah mimics judgment of a prior jurist.Ismael, J. S. and Ismael, T. Y.

It lies on a rocky hill in the northwest, near the frontier with Portugal and crossed by the Duero river, which is some downstream as it reaches the Portuguese border. With its 24 characteristic Romanesque style churches of the 12th and 13th centuries it has been called a \\"museum of Romanesque art\\". Zamora is the city with the most Romanesque churches in all of Europe. The most important celebration in Zamora is the Holy Week. History Cathedral Castle at night Ace√±as de Olivares (mills on the river Duero) Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena Church Sagasta square (modernist buildings) After the Roman victory over the Lusitanian hero Viriathus the settlement was named by the Romans Occelum Durii or Ocellodurum (literally, \\"Eye of the Duero\\"). During Roman rule it was in the hands of the Vaccaei, and was incorporated into the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis. It was on the road from Emerita (modern M√©rida) to Asturica Augusta (modern Astorga). (Ant. Itin. pp. 434, 439). Two coins from the reign of the Visigothic king Sisebuto, show that it was known at the time as \\"Semure\\". During the period of Moorish rule the settlement became known by the names of \\"Semurah\\" or \\"Azemur\\". After the establishment of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias, the settlement became a strategic frontier post and was the scene of many fierce military engagements between the Muslims and Christians. Control of the town shifted between the two sides a number of times from the early 8th century to the late 10th century. During this period it became heavily fortified. Old city hall, Plaza Mayor alt= San Vicente Church The most notable historic episode in Zamora was the assassination outside the city walls of the king Sancho II of Castile in 1072. Some decades before, king Ferdinand I of Le√≥n had divided his kingdoms between his three sons. To his daughter, Do√±a Urraca, he had bequeathed the \\"well fortified city of Zamora\\" (or \\"la bien cercada\\" in Spanish). All three sons warred among themselves, till the ultimate winner, Sancho, was left victorious. Zamora, under his sister who was allied with Leonese nobles, resisted. Sancho II of Castile, assisted by El Cid, laid siege to Zamora. King Sancho II was murdered by a duplicitous noble of Zamora, Bellido Dolfos, who tricked the king into a private meeting. After the death of Sancho, Castile reverted to his deposed brother Alfonso VI of Le√≥n. The event was commemorated by the Portillo de la Traici√≥n (Treason Gate). Zamora was also the scene of fierce fighting in the 15th century, during the conflict between the supporters of Isabella the Catholic and Juana la Beltraneja. The Spanish proverb, No se gan√≥ Zamora en una hora, literally, Zamora wasn't won in an hour, is a reference to these battles. It is the Spanish equivalent of the English proverb \\"Rome wasn't built in a day.\\" During the 12th century, the city was extraordinarily important for its strategic position in the wars between the Kingdom of Le√≥n and the Almoravids and Almohads. As a result, the city preserves many churches and buildings from that time. In the 1140s and 1150s it was ruled by Prince Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera, who has a street named after him in the city today. In the next centuries, the city lost its political and economic relevance and suffered emigration, especially to South America (where many other cities called Zamora were founded). Henry IV granted Zamora the epithet of \\"most noble and most loyal city\\". During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Zamora was from the start of the military rebellion a nationalist held city. The savagery of the repression against leftists and liberals is captured in Ram√≥n Sender Baray√≥n's 'A Death in Zamora', which tells of the extrajudicial murder of his mother, Amparo Barayon, the wife of the famous novelist Ramon Sender. Main sights Main sights of Zamora include: Torre del Salvador San Juan de Puerta Nueva Church San Isidoro Church The Transit of the Virgin Church Episcopal PalaceThe Pe√±as de Santa Marta, a rocky plateau at the side of the alt= *Cathedral, in Romanesque style, dating to the 12th century, taking only 23 years to build. * Medieval Castle of Zamora. *Palacio de los Condes de Alba y Aliste, built in 1459 by the first Count of Alva y Aliste. It boasts a patio and staircase decorated with carvings by artists from Lombardy. * Calle Balborraz. *Church of San Pedro y San Ildefonso, built from the 11th century, probably over a Visigothic temple. It was reformed in Romanesque style in the 12th‚Äì13th centuries, but was much renovated in the 15th and 18th centuries. It has presently a single nave with cross vaults *Church of Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena. The southern fa√ßade is in Romanesque style, dating back to the 13th century. * Church of San Isidoro (12th century). It has one nave, having a square major chapel. The exterior features two ogival arcades with archivolts. * Church of San Claudio de Olivares, known from the 12th century.

It was moved stone by stone and then re-erected, owing to the construction of a reservoir on its original site.  Transportation  The city is served by the Zamora Railway Station, located on one of the Spanish North-Northwestern high speed lines. Climate Zamora has a cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen: BSk), with cool winters and hot summers. Precipitation is mainly recorded in the two seasons, spring and autumn, with summer characterized by droughts. The highest temperature ever recorded is 41.0 ¬∞C (105 ¬∞F) in 24 July 1995 while the minimum stood at ‚àí13.4 ¬∞C (8 ¬∞F) on 16 January 1945. Fog occurring frequently over the winter period, often lasting for days, has tended to lower the average temperature.

Expressway, ACE, or ACX, and known locally as \\"the Expressway\\") is a , controlled-access toll road in the U.S. state of New Jersey, managed and operated by the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA). It serves as an extension of the freeway part of Route 42 from Turnersville (which is itself an extension of Interstate 76) southeast to Atlantic City. It connects Philadelphia and the surrounding Delaware Valley with Atlantic City and other Jersey Shore resorts. Besides providing a route between the Delaware Valley and Atlantic City, as well as other Shore Points, the expressway also serves other South Jersey communities, including Hammonton and Mays Landing. The expressway intersects many major roads, including Route 73 in Winslow Township, Route 54 in Hammonton, Route 50 in Hamilton Township, the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township, and U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in Pleasantville. The Atlantic City Expressway has an open system of tolling, with two mainline toll plazas (Egg Harbor in Hamilton Township and Pleasantville) and seven exits with ramp tolls. Tolls can be paid using cash or the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system. The total cost to travel the length of the Atlantic City Expressway for passenger vehicles is currently $5.50. The expressway features one service plaza, the Frank S. Farley Service Plaza, in Hamilton Township a short distance west of the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza, as well as a gas station and mini-mart in Pleasantville. Plans for the road go back to the 1930s when a parkway was proposed between Camden and Atlantic City that was never built. Plans resurfaced for the road in the 1950s when a group of officials led by State Senator Frank S. Farley pushed for a road to help the area economy. The New Jersey Expressway Authority was created in 1962, tasked with building an expressway. The Atlantic City Expressway was built between 1962 and 1965 at a total cost of $48.2 million. The South Jersey Transportation Authority assumed control of the road in 1991 from the New Jersey Expressway Authority. Route description The Atlantic City Expressway begins at Route 42 in Turnersville in Washington Township, Gloucester County, where the freeway right-of-way continues north as the North-South Freeway, a part of Route 42. Here, Route 42 continues south on the Black Horse Pike and Route 168 continues north on the Black Horse Pike. A westbound exit provides a connection to northbound Route 168. The expressway then heads southeast, straddling between Washington Township and Gloucester Township, Camden County. On the border between Gloucester Township and Winslow Township, the Atlantic City Expressway features a diamond interchange with County Route 689 (CR 689). Past this interchange, there is a full interchange with County Route 536 Spur. The expressway passes under County Route 536 and then features a partial interchange with County Route 723, with an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance. It then meets Route 73 at another partial interchange, with a westbound exit and an eastbound entrance, before passing over the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Southern Running Track line. Atlantic City Expressway westbound past the Route 54 interchange in Hammonton The expressway crosses into Hammonton, Atlantic County. Continuing to the southeast, it passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Beesleys Point Secondary before it encounters Route 54 at a full interchange. It then enters Hamilton Township and passes under County Route 559. The lanes of the Atlantic City Expressway in both directions split for the Frank S. Farley Service Plaza, which is located in the median of the expressway. The Frank S. Farley Service Plaza, named for New Jersey State Senator Frank S. Farley, is the only service plaza on the highway. Run by HMSHost, it has a building containing several fast food restaurants, a gift shop, an ATM, tourist information, and a Sunoco gas station and mini-mart. Past the service plaza, the Atlantic City Expressway meets the mainline Egg Harbor Toll Plaza. It then features a full interchange with Route 50, with the westbound exit and eastbound entrance being E-ZPass only. It meets County Route 670, with another partial interchange featuring an eastbound off-ramp and a westbound on-ramp. Next, it has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for County Route 575, which provides access to U.S. Route 40, U.S. Route 322, and the Hamilton Mall. To and from the east, a ramp runs from the Atlantic City Expressway to the US 40/US 322 split. The expressway then enters Egg Harbor Township. It interchanges with County Route 646, which provides access to the Atlantic City International Airport, and passes under County Route 563. It then features a cloverleaf interchange with the Garden State Parkway and crosses into Pleasantville. The expressway meets U.S. Route 9 at a diamond interchange. It passes under County Route 585 and features a partial interchange with North Franklin Boulevard, with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. Eastbound on the Atlantic City Expressway approaching the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township The expressway then continues to the Pleasantville Toll Plaza. Past the toll plaza, the travel lanes separate and a long parking area, used by Atlantic City casino employees, lies within the median of the expressway. It then encounters the former Atlantic City Visitor Welcome Center and a Sunoco gas station/mini-mart. and enters Atlantic City. Upon entering Atlantic City, the expressway passes under the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Pleasantville Industrial Track line and features an eastbound exit and westbound entrance to US 40/US 322. It then continues southeast, crossing the Beach Thorofare, and soon after encounters an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, which provides access to the Atlantic City Convention Center, the Marina district, and Brigantine. It then ends at a traffic light at the intersection with Baltic Avenue/Fairmount Avenue near Tanger Outlets The Walk, where it becomes the one-way pair of Missouri Avenue eastbound (also known as Christopher Columbus Boulevard and County Route 692) and Arkansas Avenue westbound (County Route 694). In 2015, the Atlantic City Expressway counted over 51 million toll-paying vehicles. The speed limit on the Atlantic City Expressway is with \\"conditions permitting\\" on the posted sign for most of the route. Call boxes are located every mile on either side. The entire length of the highway is part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Tolls Egg Harbor toll plaza As of September 13, 2020, all passenger vehicles currently must pay a $4.25 toll at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza, which is located east of the Farley Service Plaza at milepost 17.5, and a $1.25 toll near Pleasantville. Both mainline toll plazas have Express E-ZPass lanes through the center of the plaza. Tolls are also collected at several entrances and exits. A $1.25 toll for cars is charged at the eastbound exits and westbound entrances at exits 5, 28, and 33 and the westbound exits and eastbound entrances at exits 9 and 12; in addition, a $0.60 toll for cars is charged at the eastbound exits and westbound entrances at exits 38 and 41. A $4.25 E-ZPass only toll is charged for the westbound exit and eastbound entrance at exit 17. E-ZPass users who frequently use the road receive a discount on their tolls. Since 2014, eastbound tolls have been waived at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza between 5:00 and 6:00 pm on Friday before Memorial Day to promote the unofficial beginning of the summer tourist season at the Jersey Shore. Chickie's & Pete's, a local sports bar chain, pays for the tolls collected during this hour. In October 2014, eastbound tolls were waived at the Egg Harbor and Pleasantville toll plazas on Tuesdays between 12:00 pm and 12:00 am to encourage midweek tourism to Atlantic City. History The beginning of the westbound Atlantic City Expressway in Atlantic City The road was planned as a parkway in 1932, running from the Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City, but it never materialized. The idea for a limited access road between the Philadelphia area and Atlantic City resurfaced in the 1950s when South Jersey officials, led by State Senator Frank S. Farley. He pushed for an expressway between the two areas to help the economy of Southern New Jersey. The New Jersey State Highway Department authorized traffic studies for a toll road between Turnersville and Atlantic City in 1958 and 1959, and the New Jersey Expressway Authority Act in 1962 called for a five-member agency (the New Jersey Expressway Authority) with representatives from four Southern New Jersey counties to be responsible for issuing bonds to build and maintain the Atlantic City Expressway. Construction of the Atlantic City Expressway started in the middle of 1962. The design was to feature a 300- to 400-foot-wide roadway with 12-foot-wide travel lanes and right shoulders as well as 3-foot-wide left shoulders. The part between Route 42 in Turnersville and the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township was completed on July 31, 1964, and the part between the Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City was finished in July 1965. Construction of the Atlantic City Expressway cost a total of $48.2 million. Tolls on the Atlantic City Expressway initially cost $0.75 at the Egg Harbor toll plaza and $0.15 at the Pleasantville toll plaza. In 1991, the South Jersey Transportation Authority was created by the New Jersey Legislature to operate the Atlantic City Expressway, the Atlantic City International Airport, and operations of the Atlantic County Transportation Authority. In 2000, the Atlantic City Visitor Welcome Center opened in the median of the expressway near Atlantic City. Construction of the welcome center cost $3.5 million. The welcome center offered amenities including tourist information, T-shirts, restrooms, and E-ZPass sales. The Atlantic City Visitor Welcome Center closed on May 1, 2019 due to a lack of visitors. In recent years, many improvements have been made to the Atlantic City Expressway. A new interchange with County Route 689 on the border of Gloucester Township and Winslow Township was completed in 2000 for $5 million. The Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector was completed on July 31, 2001, to connect the Atlantic City Expressway to the Marina district and Brigantine. In 2005, the Atlantic City Expressway added a third lane in both directions between the Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City and in the eastbound direction between Route 73 and the Garden State Parkway. Also, the Pleasantville Toll Plaza was reconstructed, replacing the older cash booths with newer technology. Atlantic City Expressway westbound past the CR 689 interchange in Winslow Township On November 21, 2008, construction began on the reconstruction of Interchange 17, with completion on June 18, 2010. As a result of reconstructing this interchange, the SJTA approved raising the interchange toll to $3.00. This new rate is charged to motorists heading to or from the east along the Atlantic City Expressway at Route 50. The proposal drew opposition from area officials who felt the proposed rate was too high. The westbound exit and eastbound entrance at Interchange 17 were designed to be E-ZPass only, the first such interchange on the Atlantic City Expressway. In 2007, it was announced that the mainline Expressway from milepost 7.0-31.0 would be widened in the westbound direction to accommodate a third lane from north of the Garden State Parkway to Route 73. Interchange 17 (Route 50) would be reconstructed to form a full movement interchange (completed June 18, 2010), and the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza would receive Express E-ZPass lanes to allow traffic to maintain highway speed. Construction on these three projects was financed by a $25 million bond. The first phase was completed in the middle of 2010 and the Express E-ZPass was completed in May 2011. The work under the widening project also included improvements to bridges, lighting, and guide signs. Also, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technology, such as traffic cameras and variable-message signs, were added to the Atlantic City Expressway to enhance safety and aid in monitoring traffic. The first phase widened the road from the Garden State Parkway to the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza. The second phase widened the road from the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza to milepost 24.5. The third phase widened the road west to Route 73. The ITS components were installed along these sections of the roadway through the course of each phase. The widening work was completed in May 2014 and the third lane opened in its entirety by Memorial Day 2014. The fourth phase added ITS technology to the parts of the road that are not being widened. On September 13, 2020, tolls at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza increased from $3.00 to $4.25 and the $0.75 tolls at the Pleasantville Toll Plaza and several interchanges increased to $1.25. Future The SJTA revealed plans for a major road improvement project that would link the Atlantic City International Airport to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning as early as 2013. The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway. The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with an overpass above Airport Circle. Plans also call for building a service road with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an overpass at the end of Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA tech center. The proposed roadway would intrude upon a small section of a mobile home park and land owned by Egg Harbor Township. In 2020, the interchange's cost was projected at $60 million. The 2019 Statewide Transportation Improvement Plan included a project that would add a flyover ramp from the Garden State Parkway northbound to the Atlantic City Expressway westbound. Construction would go from 2020 to 2022, with an estimated cost of $20 million. In April 2020, as part of a plan to raise tolls by 37% on the Expressway, the SJTA announced a $150 million plan to widen the Expressway to three lanes from Exit 31 to the western terminus with Route 42. The project would also replace the current tolling system with an all-electronic tolling system using E-ZPass or toll-by-plate, a tolling system which mails an invoice to license plates without E-ZPass. Exit list Mileposts run from east to west.

The genus comprises about 170 species, and numerous natural and many cultivated hybrids. They are mostly liana-forming plants of the Old World tropics, ranging from South China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines; westward to Madagascar (two species) and the Seychelles (one); southward to Australia (three) and New Caledonia (one); and northward to India (one) and Sri Lanka (one). The greatest diversity occurs on Borneo, Sumatra, and the Philippines, with many endemic species. Many are plants of hot, humid, lowland areas, but the majority are tropical montane plants, receiving warm days but cool to cold, humid nights year round. A few are considered tropical alpine, with cool days and nights near freezing. The name \\"monkey cups\\" refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants. Description Nepenthes mirabilis at the Periyar Tiger Reserve, in Southern Western Ghats of India Nepenthes species usually consist of a shallow root system and a prostrate or climbing stem, often several metres long and up to or more, and usually or less in diameter, although this may be thicker in a few species (e.g. N. bicalcarata). From the stems arise alternate, sword- shaped leaves with entire leaf margins. An extension of the midrib (the tendril), which in some species aids in climbing, protrudes from the tip of the leaf; at the end of the tendril the pitcher forms. The pitcher starts as a small bud and gradually expands to form a globe- or tube-shaped trap. The shapes can evoke a champagne flute or a condom. Basic structure of an upper pitcher The trap contains a fluid of the plant's own production, which may be watery or more viscous, and is used to drown the prey. This fluid contains viscoelastic biopolymers that may be crucial to the retention of insects within the traps of many species. The viscoelastic fluid in pitchers is especially effective in the retention of winged insects. The trapping efficiency of this fluid remains high, even when significantly diluted by water, as inevitably happens in wet conditions. The lower part of the trap contains glands which absorb nutrients from captured prey. Along the upper inside part of the trap is a slick, waxy coating which makes the escape of its prey nearly impossible. Surrounding the entrance to the trap is a structure called the peristome (the \\"lip\\"), which is slippery and often quite colorful, attracting prey, but offering an unsure footing. The prey-capture effectiveness of the peristome is further enhanced in moist environments, where condensation may cause a thin water film to form on the surface of the peristome. When wet, the slippery surface of the peristome causes insects to ‚Äòaquaplane‚Äô, or slip and fall, into the pitcher. Above the peristome is a lid (the operculum); in many species, this keeps rain from diluting the fluid within the pitcher, the underside of which may contain nectar glands which attract prey. Nepenthes species usually produce two types of pitchers, known as leaf dimorphism. Appearing near the base of the plant are the large, lower traps, which typically sit on the ground. The upper or aerial pitchers are usually larger, coloured differently, and possess different features from the lower pitchers. These upper pitchers usually form as the plant reaches maturity and the plant grows taller. To keep the plant steady, the upper pitchers often form a loop in the tendril, allowing it to wrap around nearby support. In some species (e.g. N. rafflesiana), different prey may be attracted by the two types of pitchers. This varied morphology also often makes identification of species difficult. Prey usually consists of insects, but the largest species (e.g. N. rajah and N. rafflesiana) may occasionally catch small vertebrates, such as rats and lizards.Moran, J.A. 1991. The role and mechanism of Nepenthes rafflesiana pitchers as insect traps in Brunei. Ph.D. thesis, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland. Records of cultivated plants trapping small birds have been made. Flowers occur in racemes or more rarely in panicles with male and female flowers on separate plants. They are insect-pollinated, the primary agents being flies (including blow flies, midges, and mosquitoes), moths, wasps, and butterflies.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Their smells can range from sweet to musty or fungus-like. Seed is typically produced in a four-sided capsule which may contain 50-500 wind-distributed seeds, consisting of a central embryo and two wings, one on either side (though N. pervillei differs). The genus is cytologically diploid, with all studied species having a chromosome number of 2n=80.Lowrey, T.K. 1991. No. 519: Chromosome and isozyme number in the Nepenthaceae. American Journal of Botany 78(6, supplement): 200‚Äì201. This high number is thought to reflect paleopolyploidy (likely 8x or 16x).Cytology of Nepenthes. LMU Department f√ºr Biologie.Brittnacher, J. Evolution -- Nepenthes Phylogeny . International Carnivorous Plant Society. Taxonomy  About 170 species of Nepenthes are currently recognised as valid. This number is increasing, with several new species being described each year. =Etymology= The genus name Nepenthes was first published in 1737 in Carl Linnaeus's Hortus Cliffortianus.Linnaeus, C. 1737. Nepenthes. Hortus Cliffortianus. Amsterdam. It references a passage in Homer's Odyssey, in which the potion \\"Nepenthes pharmakon\\" is given to Helen by an Egyptian queen. \\"Nepenthe\\" literally means \\"without grief\\" (ne = not, penthos = grief) and, in Greek mythology, is a drug that quells all sorrows with forgetfulness.Gledhill, D. 2008. The Names of Plants. Fourth Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Linnaeus explained: > If this is not Helen's Nepenthes, it certainly will be for all botanists. > What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, > he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be > forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator! [translated > from Latin by Harry Veitch] The plant Linnaeus described was N. distillatoria, called bƒÅndurƒÅ (‡∂∂‡∑è‡∂≥‡∑î‡∂ª‡∑è), a species from Sri Lanka.Phillipps, A. & A. Lamb 1996. Pitcher-Plants of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Nepenthes was formally published as a generic name in 1753 in Linnaeus's famous Species Plantarum, which established botanical nomenclature as it exists today. Nepenthes distillatoria is the type species of the genus. Nepenthes from Carolus Linnaeus's Species Plantarum of 1753 The name \\"monkey cups\\" was discussed in the May 1964 issue of National Geographic, in which Paul A. Zahl wrote: > The carriers called them \\"monkey cups,\\" a name I had heard elsewhere in > reference to Nepenthes, but the implication that monkeys drink the pitcher > fluid seemed farfetched. I later proved it true. In Sarawak, I found an > orangutan that had been raised as a pet and later freed. As I approached it > gingerly in the forest, I offered it a half-full pitcher. To my surprise, > the ape accepted it, and with the finesse of a lady at tea, executed a > delicate bottoms-up. The plants are often called kantong semar (Semar's pocket) in Indonesia and sako ni Hudas (Judas' money bag) in the Philippines. =Evolution and phylogeny= An absence of evidence of intermediate species, fossil or living (i.e. a missing link), does not allow forming a phylogenetical timeline for the development of the distinctive traits of modern Nepenthes, which include its relatively rare strict dioecy and carnivorous pitchers. Although Nepenthes is distantly related to several modern genera, among these, even the carnivorous relatives [the sundews (Drosera), Venus flytrap (Dionea muscipula), waterwheel plant (Aldrovanda), and dewy pine (Drosophyllum)], all lack those traits. Among known Nepenthes, no protomodern characteristics or large variations are found, which suggests that all extant species radiated from a single close ancestor bearing all the modern traits. Phylogenetic comparisons of the chloroplast matK gene sequences between Nepenthes species and with related species support this conclusion, long genetic distance between Nepenthes and others, and abruptly diverging \\"pom-pom\\" grouping of the Nepenthes species . Fossilized pollen of Nepenthes-like plants living on the northern Tethys Sea from 65 to 35 million years ago indicates that then-warmer Europe may have been where the proto-Nepenthes developed, and then escaped to Asia and India as Africa collided with Europe and the ensuing climate change wiped out the ancestral species in the original habitat. About 20 million years ago, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi and possibly even the Philippines were connected to mainland Asia, providing a bridge for the colonization of most sites of Nepenthes species radiation. The extensive landbridges in the area 20,000 years ago during the ice age would have provided access to the remaining sites of Nepenthes populations in Oceania. The main complication with this hypothesis is the presence of Nepenthes on the distant islands of Seychelles and Madagascar. The seeds were thought to have been transferred by seabirds and shorebirds, which rest during their migrations in swampy habitats and may have inadvertently picked up the seeds. This hypothesis is possibly reinforced by the success of the lowland swamp-dwelling N. distillatoria in colonizing so many locations. Distribution and habitat Global distribution of Nepenthes The genus Nepenthes is mostly found within the Malay Archipelago, with the greatest biodiversity found on Borneo, Sumatra, and the Philippines, especially in the Borneo montane rain forests. The full range of the genus includes Madagascar (N. madagascariensis and N. masoalensis), the Seychelles (N. pervillei), Sri Lanka (N. distillatoria), and India (N. khasiana) in the west to Australia (N. mirabilis, N. rowanae, and N. tenax) and New Caledonia (N. vieillardii) in the southeast. Most species are restricted to very small ranges, including some only found on individual mountains. These limited distributions and the inaccessibility of the regions often means some species go decades without being rediscovered in the wild (e.g. N. deaniana, which was rediscovered 100 years after its initial discovery). About 10 species have population distributions larger than a single island or group of smaller islands. Nepenthes mirabilis has the distinction of being the most widely distributed species in the genus, ranging from Indochina and throughout the Malay Archipelago to Australia.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Because of the nature of the habitats that Nepenthes species occupy, they are often graded as either lowland or highland species, depending on their altitude above sea level, with the rough delineation between lowland and highland. Species growing at lower altitudes require continuously warm climates with little difference between day and night temperatures, whereas highland species thrive when they receive warm days and much cooler nights. Nepenthes lamii grows at a higher altitude than any other in the genus, up to . Most Nepenthes species grow in environments that provide high humidity and precipitation and moderate to high light levels. A few species, including N. ampullaria, prefer the dense, shaded forests, but most other species thrive on the margins of tree/shrub communities or clearings. Some species (e.g. N. mirabilis) have been found growing in clear-cut forest areas, roadsides, and disturbed fields. Other species have adapted to growing in savanna-like grass communities. The soils in which Nepenthes species grow are usually acidic and low in nutrients, being composed of peat, white sand, sandstone, or volcanic soils. Exceptions to these generalities include species that thrive in soils with high heavy metal content (e.g. N. rajah), on sandy beaches in the sea spray zone (e.g. N. albomarginata). Other species grow on inselbergs and as lithophytes, while others, such as N. inermis, can grow as epiphytes with no soil contact. Ecological relationships A drowned lizard found in a freshly opened pitcher of N. rajah The most obvious interaction between Nepenthes species and their environments, including other organisms, is that of predator and prey. Nepenthes species certainly attract and kill their prey, albeit passively, through active production of attractive colours, sugary nectar, and even sweet scents. From this relationship, the plants primarily gain nitrogen and phosphorus to supplement their nutrient requirements for growth, given these soil nutrients are typically lacking. The most frequent prey is an abundant and diverse group of arthropods, with ants and other insects topping the menu. Other arthropods found frequently include spiders, scorpions, and centipedes, while snails and frogs are more unusual, but not unheard of. The most uncommon prey for Nepenthes species includes rats found in N. rajah. The composition of prey captured depends on many factors, including location, but can incorporate hundreds of individual insects and many different species. While many Nepenthes species are generalists in what they capture, at least one, N. albomarginata, has specialised and almost exclusively traps termites and produces nearly no nectar. Nepenthes albomarginata gains its name from the ring of white trichomes directly beneath the peristome. These trichomes--or \\"hairs\\"--are palatable to termites and will attract them to the pitcher. In the course of collecting the edible trichomes, hundreds or thousands of termites will fall into the pitcher. =Symbioses= N. attenboroughii supporting a large population of mosquito larvae. The upright lid of this species exposes its pitchers to the elements such that they are often completely filled with fluid. Nepenthes bicalcarata provides space in the hollow tendrils of its upper pitchers for the carpenter ant Camponotus schmitzi to build nests. The ants take larger prey from the pitchers, which may benefit N. bicalcarata by reducing the amount of putrefaction of collected organic matter that could harm the natural community of infaunal species that aid the plant's digestion.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Nepenthes lowii has also formed a dependent relationship, but with vertebrates instead of insects. The pitchers of N. lowii provide a sugary exudate reward on the reflexed pitcher lid (operculum) and a perch for tree shrew species, which have been found eating the exudate and defecating into the pitcher. A 2009 study, which coined the term \\"tree shrew lavatories\\", determined between 57 and 100% of the plant's foliar nitrogen uptake comes from the faeces of tree shrews. Another study showed the shape and size of the pitcher orifice of N. lowii exactly match the dimensions of a typical tree shrew (Tupaia montana).Walker, M. 2010. Giant meat-eating plants prefer to eat tree shrew poo. BBC Earth News, March 10, 2010. A similar adaptation was found in N. macrophylla, N. rajah, N. ampullaria, and is also likely to be present in N. ephippiata. =Infauna= Organisms that spend at least part of their lives within the pitchers of Nepenthes species are often called Nepenthes infauna. The most common infaunal species, often representing the top trophic level of the infaunal ecosystem, are many species of mosquito larvae. Other infaunal species include fly and midge larvae, spiders, mites, ants, and even a species of crab (Geosesarma malayanum). Many of these species specialise to one pitcher plant species and are found nowhere else. These specialists are called nepenthebionts. Others, often associated with but not dependent on Nepenthes species, are called nepenthophiles. Nepenthexenes, on the other hand, are rarely found in the pitchers, but will often appear when putrefaction approaches a certain threshold, attracting fly larvae that would normally not be found in the pitcher infaunal community. The complex ecological relationship between pitcher plants and infauna is not yet fully understood, but the relationship may be mutualistic: the infauna is given shelter, food, or protection, and the plant that harbours the infauna receives expedited breakdown of captured prey, increasing the rate of digestion and keeping harmful bacterial populations repressed. = Antimicrobial properties = Nepenthes digestive fluids are sterile before pitchers open and contain secondary metabolites and proteins that act as bactericides and fungicides after the pitcher opens. While the digestive fluid is being produced, the pitcher is not yet open, so there is no chance of microbial contamination. During pitcher development, at least 29 digestive proteins including proteases, chitinases, pathogenesis-related proteins and thaumatin-like proteins are produced in the pitcher fluid. In addition to breaking down prey, these can act as antimicrobial agents. When the pitchers open, the fluid is exposed to bacteria, fungal spores, insects and rain. Often pitchers have a lid that covers the trap, excepting a few (e.g. N. lowii, N. attenboroughii and N. jamban), preventing rain water from entering. The lid inhibits rainwater from diluting the digestive fluid. Once the bacteria and fungi enter the fluid, secondary metabolites are produced in addition to antimicrobial proteins. Naphthoquinones, a class of secondary metabolite, are commonly produced, and these either kill or inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria and fungi. This adaptation could have evolved since Nepenthes plants that could produce secondary metabolites and antimicrobial proteins to kill bacteria and fungi were most likely more fit. Plants that produced antimicrobial compounds could prevent loss of valuable nutrients gained from insects within the pitcher. Since Nepenthes cannot digest certain bacteria and fungi, the bactericides and fungicides allow plants to maximize nutrient uptake. Botanical history Plukenet's drawing of N. distillatoria from his Almagestum Botanicum of 1696. The earliest known record of Nepenthes dates back to the 17th century. In 1658, French colonial governor √âtienne de Flacourt published a description of a pitcher plant in his seminal work Histoire de la Grande Isle de Madagascar. It reads:de Flacourt, √â. 1658. Histoire de la Grande Isle de Madagascar. > It is a plant growing about 3 feet high which carries at the end of its > leaves, which are 7 inches long, a hollow flower or fruit resembling a small > vase, with its own lid, a wonderful sight. There are red ones and yellow > ones, the yellow being the biggest. The inhabitants of this country are > reluctant to pick the flowers, saying that if somebody does pick them in > passing, it will not fail to rain that day. As to that, I and all the other > Frenchmen did pick them, but it did not rain. After rain these flowers are > full of water, each one containing a good half-glass. [translated from > French in Pitcher-Plants of Borneo] Flacourt called the plant Amramatico, after a local name. More than a century later, this species was formally described as N. madagascariensis.Poiret, J.L.M. 1797. N√©pente. In: J.B. Lamarck Encyclop√©die M√©thodique Botanique Vol. 4. The second species to be described was N. distillatoria, the Sri Lankan endemic. In 1677, Danish physician Thomas Bartholin made brief mention of it under the name Miranda herba, Latin for \\"marvellous herb\\". Three years later, Dutch merchant Jacob Breyne referred to this species as Bandura zingalensium, after a local name for the plant.Breyne, J. 1680. Bandura zingalensium etc. Prodromus Fasciculi Rariorum Plantarum 1: 18. Bandura subsequently became the most commonly used name for the tropical pitcher plants, until Linnaeus coined Nepenthes in 1737. Nepenthes distillatoria was again described in 1683, this time by Swedish physician and naturalist Herman Niklas Grim.Grimm, H.N. 1683. Planta mirabilis destillatoria. In: Miscellanea curiosa sive Ephemeridum. Med. Phys. Germ. Acad. Nat. Cur. Decuriae 2, ann. prim. p. 363, f. 27. Grim called it Planta mirabilis destillatoria or the \\"miraculous distilling plant\\", and was the first to clearly illustrate a tropical pitcher plant. Three years later, in 1686, English naturalist John Ray quoted Grim as saying:Ray, J. 1686. Bandura cingalensium etc. Historia Plantarum 1: 721‚Äì722. > The root draws up moisture from the earth which with the help of the sun's > rays rises up into the plant itself and then flows down through the stems > and nerves of the leaves into the natural utensil to be stored there until > used for human needs. [translated from Latin in Pitcher-Plants of Borneo] One of the earliest illustrations of Nepenthes appears in Leonard Plukenet's Almagestum Botanicum of 1696.Plukenet, L. 1696. Utricaria vegetabilis zeylanensium. In: Almagestum Botanicum. The plant, called Utricaria vegetabilis zeylanensium, is undoubtedly N. distillatoria. Cantharifera as illustrated in Rumphius's Herbarium Amboinensis, Volume 5, published in 1747, although probably drawn in the late 17th century. The vine on the right is not a Nepenthes, but a species of Flagellaria. Around the same time, German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius discovered two new Nepenthes species in the Malay Archipelago. Rumphius illustrated the first one, now considered synonymous with N. mirabilis, and gave it the name Cantharifera, meaning \\"tankard-bearer\\". The second, referred to as Cantharifera alba, is thought to have been N. maxima. Rumphius described the plants in his most famous work, the six-volume Herbarium Amboinense, a catalogue of the flora of Ambon Island. However, it would not be published until many years after his death.Rumphius, G.E. 1741‚Äì1750. Cantharifera. In: Herbarium Amboinense 5, lib. 7, cap. 61, p. 121, t. 59, t. 2. After going blind in 1670, when the manuscript was only partially complete, Rumphius continued work on Herbarium Amboinensis with the help of clerks and artists. In 1687, with the project nearing completion, at least half of the illustrations were lost in a fire. Persevering, Rumphius and his helpers first completed the book in 1690. However, two years later, the ship carrying the manuscript to the Netherlands was attacked and sunk by the French, forcing them to start over from a copy that had fortunately been retained by Governor-General Johannes Camphuijs. The Herbarium Amboinensis finally arrived in the Netherlands in 1696. Even then, the first volume did not appear until 1741, 39 years after Rumphius's death. By this time, Linnaeus's name Nepenthes had become established. Illustration of Bandura zeylanica (N. distillatoria) from Burmann's Thesaurus Zeylanicus of 1737 Nepenthes distillatoria was again illustrated in Johannes Burmann's Thesaurus Zeylanicus of 1737. The drawing depicts the end of a flowering stem with pitchers. Burmann refers to the plant as Bandura zeylanica.Burmann, J. 1737. Thesaurus Zeylanicus. Amsterdam. The next mention of tropical pitcher plants was made in 1790, when Portuguese priest Jo√£o de Loureiro described Phyllamphora mirabilis, or the \\"marvellous urn-shaped leaf\\", from Vietnam. Despite living in the country for around 35 years, it seems unlikely that Loureiro observed living plants of this species, as he stated the lid is a moving part, actively opening and closing. In his most celebrated work, Flora Cochinchinensis, he writes:de Loureiro, J. 1790. Flora Cochinchinensis 2: 606‚Äì607. > [...] (the) leaf-tip ends in a long hanging tendril, twisted spirally in the > middle, from which hangs a sort of vase, oblong, pot-bellied, with a smooth > lip with a projecting margin and a lid affixed to one side, which of its own > nature freely opens and closes in order to receive the dew and store it. A > marvellous work of the Lord! [translated from French in Pitcher-Plants of > Borneo] Phyllamphora mirabilis was eventually transferred to the genus Nepenthes by Rafarin in 1869.Schlauer, J. Nepenthes mirabilis. Carnivorous Plant Database. As such, P. mirabilis is the basionym of this most cosmopolitan of tropical pitcher plant species. Loureiro's description of a moving lid was repeated by Jean Louis Marie Poiret in 1797. Poiret described two of the four Nepenthes species known at the time: N. madagascariensis and N. distillatoria. He gave the former its current name and called the latter Nepente de l'Inde, or simply \\"Nepenthes of India\\", although this species is absent from the mainland. In Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Encyclop√©die M√©thodique Botanique, he included the following account: > This urn is hollow, as I have just said, usually full of soft, clear water, > and then closed. It opens during the day and more than half the liquid > disappears, but this loss is repaired during the night, and the next day the > urn is full again and closed by its lid. This is its sustenance, and enough > for more than one day because it is always about half-full at the approach > of night. [translated from French in Pitcher-Plants of Borneo] The Nepenthes house of the Veitch Nurseries as illustrated in The Gardeners' Chronicle, 1872 With the discovery of new species and Sir Joseph Banks' original introduction of specimens to Europe in 1789, interest in Nepenthes grew throughout the 19th century, culminating in what has been called the \\"Golden Age of Nepenthes\\" in the 1880s.Barthlott, W., Porembski, S., Seine, R., and Theisen, I. 2007. The Curious World of Carnivorous Plants. Portland, Oregon: Timber Press. However, the popularity of the plants dwindled in the early 20th century, before all but disappearing by World War II. This is evidenced by the fact that no new species were described between 1940 and 1966. The revival of global interest in the cultivation and study of Nepenthes is credited to Japanese botanist Shigeo Kurata, whose work in the 1960s and 1970s did much to bring attention to these plants.Clarke, C.M. & C.C. Lee 2004. Pitcher Plants of Sarawak. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Cultivation Cultivated Nepenthes rajah, Nepenthes aristolochioides and other species Nepenthes may be cultivated in greenhouses. Easier species include N. alata, N. ventricosa, N. khasiana, and N. sanguinea. These four species are highlanders (N. alata has both lowland and highland forms), some easy lowlander species are N. rafflesiana, N. bicalcarata, N. mirabilis, and N. hirsuta. Highland forms are those species that grow in habitats generally higher in elevation, and thus exposed to cooler evening temperatures. Lowland forms are those species growing nearer to sea level. Both forms respond best to rainwater (but some tap water works as long as it is flushed monthly with rainwater or water low in dissolved solid and chemicals), bright light (though some species can grow in full sun), a well- drained medium, good air circulation and relatively high humidity, although easier species such as N. alata can adapt to lower humidity environments. Highland species must have night-time cooling to thrive in the long term. Chemical fertilisers are best used at low strength. Occasional feeding with frozen (thawed before use) crickets may be beneficial. Terrarium culture of smaller plants, such as N. bellii, N. √ó trichocarpa and N. ampullaria, is possible, but most plants will get too large over time. Plants can be propagated by seed, cuttings, and tissue culture. Seeds are usually sown on damp chopped Sphagnum moss, or on sterile plant tissue culture media once they have been properly disinfected. The seeds generally become nonviable soon after harvesting, so seed are not usually the preferred method of propagation. A 1:1 mixture of orchid medium with moss or perlite has been used for germination and culture. Seed may take two months to germinate, and two years or more to yield mature plants. Cuttings may be rooted in damp Sphagnum moss in a plastic bag or tank with high humidity and moderate light. They can begin to root in one to two months and start to form pitchers in about six months. Tissue culture is now used commercially and helps reduce collection of wild plants, as well as making many rare species available to hobbyists at reasonable prices. Nepenthes species are considered threatened or endangered plants and all of them are listed in CITES appendices 2, with the exception of N. rajah and N. khasiana which are listed in CITES appendix 1. Hybrids and cultivars The complex man-made hybrid N. ventricosa √ó (N. lowii √ó N. macrophylla) There are many hybrid Nepenthes and numerous named cultivars. Some of the more well-known, artificially produced hybrids and cultivars include: *N. √ó coccinea ((N. rafflesiana √ó N. ampullaria) √ó N. mirabilis) *N. √ó ventrata (N. ventricosa √ó N. alata) *N. √ó 'Bloody Mary' (N. ventricosa √ó N. ampullaria) *N.

Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Houston, constructed in 2008 A baptismal font is an article of church furniture used for baptism. Aspersion and affusion fonts The fonts of many Christian denominations are for baptisms using a non- immersive method, such as aspersion (sprinkling) or affusion (pouring). The simplest of these fonts has a pedestal (about 1.5 metres tall) with a holder for a basin of water. The materials vary greatly consisting of carved and sculpted marble, wood, or metal. The shape can vary. Many are eight-sided as a reminder of the new creation and as a connection to the practice of circumcision, which traditionally occurs on the eighth day. Some are three- sided as a reminder of the Holy Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Detail of carved baptismal font cover (created 1930s), Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania) Fonts are often placed at or near the entrance to a church's nave to remind believers of their baptism as they enter the church to pray, since the rite of baptism served as their initiation into the Church. In many churches of the Middle Ages and Renaissance there was a special chapel or even a separate building for housing the baptismal fonts, called a baptistery. Both fonts and baptisteries were often octagonal (eight- sided), octagonal fonts becoming more common from the 13th century and the rule from the 14th century. Saint Ambrose wrote that fonts and baptisteries were octagonal \\"because on the eighth day, by rising, Christ loosens the bondage of death and receives the dead from their graves\\". Saint Augustine similarly described the eighth day as \\"everlasting... hallowed by the resurrection of Christ\\". The quantity of water is usually small (usually a litre or two). There are some fonts where water pumps, a natural spring, or gravity keeps the water moving to mimic the moving waters of a stream. This visual and audible image communicates a \\"living waters\\" aspect of baptism. Some church bodies use special holy water while others will use water straight out of the tap to fill the font. A special silver vessel called a ewer can be used to fill the font. The mode of a baptism at a font is usually one of sprinkling, pouring, washing, or dipping in keeping with the Koine Greek verb Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒπŒ∂œâ. ŒíŒ±œÄœÑŒπŒ∂œâ can also mean \\"immerse\\", but most fonts are too small for that application. Some fonts are large enough to allow the immersion of infants, however. =Regional types= In certain regions of England, a common historic type of font design can be identified. In South East England the \\"Aylesbury font\\" can be seen in several churches in Buckinghamshire and the surrounding area. These fonts, which date from the late 12th Century around the years 1170 to 1190, are typically chalice-shaped, ornately carved around the rim with fluting below, and are considered fine examples of English Norman architecture. They are named after the font found in the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Aylesbury. Other identifiable types include the Early English \\"table- top\\" font, also found in Buckinghamshire; the \\"Bodmin font\\" in Cornwall, the \\"Seven Sacrament fonts\\" in East Anglia; and \\"Chalice fonts\\" in Herefordshire. Immersion fonts The earliest baptismal fonts were designed for full immersion, and were often cross-shaped with steps (usually three, for the Trinity) leading down into them. Often such baptismal pools were located in a separate building, called a baptistery, however, this baptismal practice was then relocated to be administered near the entrance of the church, mostly nearby the main door to signify entrance to the Church. As infant baptism became more common, fonts became smaller. Denominations that believe only in baptism by full immersion tend to use the term \\"baptismal font\\" to refer to immersion tanks dedicated for that purpose, however in the Roman Catholic tradition a baptismal font differs from an immersion. Full-immersion baptisms may take place in a man-made tank or pool, or a natural body of water such as a river or lake. The entire body is fully immersed, dunked, submerged or otherwise placed completely under the water. This practice symbolizes the death of the old nature, as found in Romans . In the Eastern Orthodox Church, baptism is always by full triple immersion, even in the case of infant baptism (aspersion or pouring is permitted only in extremis). For this reason, Eastern baptismal fonts tend to be larger than Western, and are often shaped like a large chalice (significant since the Orthodox administer Holy Communion to infants after baptism), and are normally fashioned out of metal rather than stone or wood. During the baptismal service, three candles will be lit on or around the baptismal font, in honor of the Holy Trinity. In many Orthodox churches, a very special kind of holy water, called \\"Theophany Water\\", is consecrated on the Feast of Theophany (Epiphany). The consecration (literally, \\"Great Blessing\\") is performed twice: the first time on the Eve of the feast, in a baptismal font; the second, on the day of the feast, in a natural body of water. In the Roman Catholic Church, especially after its Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), greater attention is being given to the form of the baptismal font. Currently, the Roman Catholic Church encourages baptismal fonts that are suitable for the full immersion of an infant or child, and for at least the pouring of water over the whole body of an adult. The font should be located in a space that is visibly and physically accessible, and should preferably make provision for flowing water. Baptisms of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are usually done in a simple font located in a local meetinghouse, although they can be performed in any body of water in which the person may be completely immersed. In Latter-day Saint temples, where proxy baptisms for the dead are performed, the fonts rest on the sculptures of twelve oxen representing the twelve tribes of Israel, following the pattern of the Molten Sea in the Temple of Solomon (see 2 Chronicles 4:2-5).

It is in the U.S. state of Washington, extending southeastward between West Point in the north and Alki Point in the south. Seattle was founded on this body of water in the 1850s and has since grown to encompass it completely. The waterway it provides to the Pacific Ocean has served as a key element of the city's economy, enabling the Port of Seattle to become one of the busiest ports in the United States. History The Duwamish people lived in the vicinity of Elliott Bay and the Duwamish River for thousands of years and had established at least 17 settlements by the time white settlers came in the 1850s. Among the earliest white settlements was by the Denny Party at New York Alki, which is in the present-day neighborhood of Alki in West Seattle, however after a hard winter they shifted across Elliott Bay near the present- day Pioneer Square, which became Seattle. Over the years the city expanded to cover all of the waterfront on Elliott Bay and codified it as one of its fairways (a navigable waterway). The bay was named during the Wilkes expedition in 1841, after an uncertain namesake. Candidates include members of the expedition: ship's chaplain Jared Elliott, ship's boy George Elliott, and midshipman Samuel Elliott. The last has been deemed the most likely namesake. Commodore Jesse Elliott has also been proposed as a possible source of the name. The bay has been referred to as Duwamish Bay and Seattle Harbor, especially before the US Board on Geographic Names officially settled on the name \\"Elliott Bay\\" in 1895. Duwamish Head, West Seattle A local legend says that the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet, which peaked in the early 20th century, was so-named by a Seattleite who looked out over Elliott Bay and remarked that the activity resembled that of mosquitoes. Two notable sinkings related to the Mosquito Fleet occurred in the bay: the Dix in 1906, taking with it dozens of lives, and the Multnomah in 1911. Eventually these commercial passenger services faded as automobiles and ferries rose in popularity. The last remaining model of the Boeing 307 ditched into Elliott Bay in 2002 during a final test flight from Boeing Field to Everett. The craft, named the Flying Cloud, had been the subject of an eight-year restoration project meant to ready it for display at the National Air and Space Museum. Despite the incident, the aircraft was again restored, flew to the Smithsonian, and was put on display. Features Elliott Bay and the Seattle waterfront, looking north from the Pacific Coast Co. dock, c. 1907 West Point and Alki Point are the headlands into Puget Sound recognized as the northern and southern entrances of Elliott Bay respectively. A line drawn between these two points demarcates the bay to the east from the open sound to the west. More precisely, the bay has been defined as being east from a line drawn from Duwamish Head north to Magnolia Bluff. The Duwamish River empties into the southeastern part of the bay. This area was extensively modified by human development in the 20th century to channelize the river and fill in tideflats to create Harbor Island, which was once the world's largest artificial island. West of the river delta the land juts north into the bay at Duwamish Head. To the east running north and northwest is the heart of Seattle, the Alaskan Way Seawall, the Central Waterfront, and Smith Cove. Elliott Bay is home to the Port of Seattle, which, in 2002, was the 9th busiest port in the United States by TEUs of container traffic and the 46th busiest in the world. Cruise ship business, serving Alaskan cruises, became increasingly important in the 2000s. The bay is also home to Colman Dock, the main Seattle terminal of the state's ferry system, the largest in the country. Sailings regularly depart from Seattle to Bainbridge Island and Bremerton. The Seattle‚ÄìWinslow (Bainbridge Island) route is the most heavily used in the state ferry system in terms of number of vehicles and passengers transported. The King County Water Taxi, a passenger ferry, runs across the bay, connecting Downtown Seattle with West Seattle (Seacrest Dock) and Vashon Island. Elliott Bay Park along the waterfront, downtown Seattle Two marinas are in Elliott Bay. The larger of them is the privately owned Elliott Bay Marina, in the Magnolia/Interbay neighborhoods at Smith Cove, with 1,200 slips. Bell Harbor Marina, operated by the Port of Seattle, is in the Central Waterfront along Belltown. Up to 70 vessels can be moored there. Numerous piers extend into the bay, especially along Seattle's Central Waterfront. Piers 57 and 59 house tourist destinations, including the Seattle Great Wheel and the Seattle Aquarium. On Pier 67 is The Edgewater Hotel. Pier 86 is a major grain shipping terminal operated by the Louis Dreyfus Group. Grain is carried to docked cargo ships by passing over Elliott Bay Trail and a narrow shoreline park, which also features a public fishing pier near Smith Cove. In the cove is Terminal 91, which has served a variety of purposes over the years, including storage for imported automobiles and fish, and most recently became a dock for Alaskan cruise ships. To the south, in West Seattle's Seacrest Park, is another public fishing pier and a dive site. As a prominent aspect of Seattle's geography, the bay has frequently been referenced in media. The Real World: Seattle, the 1998 season of the MTV reality television series, was filmed on Pier 70 on the bay. The fictional Elliott Bay Towers, home of Frasier Crane on the TV series Frasier, are named after the bay. In Season 3 of the Seattle-set crime drama The Killing, suspect Ray Seward is incarcerated in the fictional Elliott Bay Penitentiary. A simplified map of Elliott Bay is used as the \\"Maps\\" icon in Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 Smartphone Operating System. Microsoft has its headquarters in the Seattle metropolitan area. Ecology Elliott Bay has been a focus for environmental concern. Urban and industrial development along its shores, and on the banks of the Duwamish River that leads into it, have caused concern over the levels of contaminants entering the water. On the southern shoreline are two Superfund cleanup sites: Harbor Island and the former location of Lockheed West Seattle. Several other sites have been designated for cleanup, including the Pacific Sound Resources site, and others along the lower Duwamish. The downtown waterfront offers a poor habitat for the juvenile salmon that migrate from the Duwamish River, due to the darkness under the piers and the lack of food along the vertical Alaskan Way Seawall. The seawall redevelopment project aims to improve the habitat by installing underwater structures to create shallows where salmon can find food and glass blocks in the sidewalk (cantilevered over the bay) so that sunlight can illuminate the shallows even at the piers.

It is one of the largest impact basins in the Solar System. \\"Calor\\" is Latin for \\"heat\\" and the basin is so-named because the Sun is almost directly overhead every second time Mercury passes perihelion. The crater, discovered in 1974, is surrounded by the Caloris Montes, a ring of mountains approximately tall. Appearance MESSENGERs first image of the unseen side of Mercury from a distance of about cropped to highlight Caloris. The rim is hard to discern as the Sun is directly overhead, preventing shadows. Caloris was discovered on images taken by the Mariner 10 probe in 1974. Its name was suggested by Brian O'Leary, astronaut and member of the Mariner 10 imagery team. It was situated on the terminator‚Äîthe line dividing the daytime and nighttime hemispheres‚Äîat the time the probe passed by, and so half of the crater could not be imaged. Later, on January 15, 2008, one of the first photos of the planet taken by the MESSENGER probe revealed the crater in its entirety. The basin was initially estimated to be about in diameter, though this was increased to based on subsequent images taken by MESSENGER. It is ringed by mountains up to high. Inside the crater walls, the floor of the crater is filled by lava plains, similar to the maria of the Moon. These plains are superposed by explosive vents associated with pyroclastic material. Outside the walls, material ejected in the impact which created the basin extends for , and concentric rings surround the crater. In the center of the basin is a region containing numerous radial troughs that appear to be extensional faults, with a crater, Apollodorus, located near the center of the pattern. The exact cause of this pattern of troughs is not currently known. The feature is named Pantheon Fossae.Mercury's First Fossae . MESSENGER. May 5, 2008. Accessed on July 13, 2009. Formation Comparison of the original estimated size of the Caloris basin (yellow) with that based on images from the MESSENGER probe (blue). The impacting body is estimated to have been at least 100 km (62 miles) in diameter. Bodies in the inner Solar System experienced a heavy bombardment of large rocky bodies in the first billion years or so of the Solar System. The impact that created Caloris must have occurred after most of the heavy bombardment had finished, because fewer impact craters are seen on its floor than exist on comparably-sized regions outside the crater. Similar impact basins on the Moon such as the Mare Imbrium and Mare Orientale are believed to have formed at about the same time, possibly indicating that there was a 'spike' of large impacts towards the end of the heavy bombardment phase of the early Solar System. Based on MESSENGERs photographs, Caloris' age has been determined to be between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years. Antipodal chaotic terrain and global effects Hilly, lineated terrain at the antipode of Caloris. Close up of the chaotic terrain. The giant impact believed to have formed Caloris may have had global consequences for the planet. At the exact antipode of the basin is a large area of hilly, grooved terrain, with few small impact craters that are known as chaotic terrain (also \\"weird terrain\\"). It is thought by some to have been created as seismic waves from the impact converged on the opposite side of the planet. Alternatively, it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin's antipode. This hypothetical impact is also believed to have triggered volcanic activity on Mercury, resulting in the formation of smooth plains. Surrounding Caloris is a series of geologic formations thought to have been produced by the basin's ejecta, collectively called the Caloris Group. Emissions of gas Mercury has a very tenuous and transient atmosphere, containing small amounts of hydrogen and helium captured from the solar wind, as well as heavier elements such as sodium and potassium. These are thought to originate within the planet, being \\"out-gassed\\" from beneath its crust. The Caloris basin has been found to be a significant source of sodium and potassium, indicating that the fractures created by the impact facilitate the release of gases from within the planet. The unusual terrain is also a source of these gases.

The lake is long and wide, with a maximum depth of and a surface area of . It lies east of Lake Washington and west of the Sammamish Plateau, and stretches from Issaquah in the south to Redmond in the north. At Issaquah it is fed by Issaquah Creek, and at Redmond it drains to Lake Washington via the Sammamish River, named after the native people who once lived along its entire length. The Lake Sammamish watershed stretches from Redmond through Bellevue, and Issaquah to Preston and Hobart, and consists of numerous creeks which flow into the lake. Issaquah Creek is the largest tributary, furnishing over 70% of the lake's inflow. Development The area surrounding Lake Sammamish has been, in recent times, the most rapidly growing suburban district in the Greater Seattle Metropolitan Area. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the cities of Redmond, Snoqualmie, Fall City, Issaquah and Bellevue have grown substantially. The city of Sammamish was incorporated in 1999 because of suburban growth. Ecology and conservation Historically, runoff from the high precipitation in the lake's watershed (nearly twice the 35 inches that Seattle gets each year) was absorbed by the surrounding forests. Loose, sponge-like forest soils virtually eliminated runoff during winter storms and recharged groundwater aquifers which then released fresh water to streams in the dry summer months. With rapid urbanization the forests have been replaced by impervious surfaces‚Äîroofs, roads, parking lots‚Äîand stormwater runoffs have increased flooding. The stormwater runoff carries sediment loads and toxic pollutants into streams and ultimately the lake, which generally has a negative impact on lake water clarity as well as fishes and wildlife. In May, 2010 the federal government asked the town of Sammamish to restrict development within from the lakeshore to protect local salmon and steelhead (Oncorhyncus mykiss) species. The report did not include Lake Sammamish kokanee salmon (Oncorhyncus nerka) among the species in trouble, although environmentalists and scientists said development along Lake Sammamish and tributary creeks have pushed the fish to the brink of extirpation. Despite resistance to the report by the city of Sammamish, Issaquah already limits development within of the lake, Issaquah Creek and the East Fork of Issaquah Creek under the Shoreline Management Program. It is estimated that fewer than 100 Kokanee salmon remain in Lake Sammamish. =Beavers= The recent return of beaver (Castor canadensis) to Lake Sammamish worries City of Issaquah and Lake Sammamish State Park officials who state that the mammals will cause flooding and burrow under roadways. These officials are recommending relocation of the beaver families. On July 6, 2010, officials of the City of Issaquah have asked Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife to tear out a beaver dam on Tibbetts Creek in Lake Sammamish State Park because of concerns about potential flooding and barriers to salmon migration. In contrast, research on watersheds in the Northern United States and Canada shows that beavers provide ecological benefits by creating ponds that increase fish and bird abundance and diversity. Research in the Stillaguamish River basin, approximately north of Lake Sammamish, found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. Recreation and parks Lake Sammamish from Marymoor Park Lake Sammamish is bordered by Marymoor Park at the lake's north end, Lake Sammamish State Park at its south end, and the East Lake Sammamish Trail. Lake Sammamish State Park provides nine public boat launches that can be accessed through a separate park entrance, for a fee, with parking and restroom facilities on site. The public can access the lake's west shores at Redmond's Idylwood Park. The privately owned Vasa Park Resort, located in Bellevue, provides access from the west for a fee. Vasa Park offers one ramp for launching watercraft. Several housing developments own small, private parks that provide lake access for their residents. The main leisure activities include rowing, fishing, waterskiing, wakeboarding, wakesurfing, tubing, and jet skiing. There is a public slalom course for waterskiing at the far north end of the lake, running from the west to the east. In the mid-1980s, local radio personality Pat O'Day proposed that the Seafair Cup hydroplane races be moved to Lake Sammamish from Lake Washington, an effort that was unsuccessful. Lake Sammamish offers fishing enthusiasts a variety of species to pursue, including perch, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, cutthroat trout, salmon, and steelhead trout, among others.

It is also called a 75 Cocktail, or in French simply a Soixante Quinze (Seventy Five). The drink dates to World War I, and an early form was created in 1915 at the New York Bar in Paris‚Äîlater Harry's New York Bar‚Äîby barman Harry MacElhone. The combination was said to have such a kick that it felt like being shelled with the powerful French 75mm field gun. History The Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 is the source of the name of the cocktail The drink with its current name and recipe developed over the 1920s, though similar drinks date to the 19th century. In the 19th century, the Champagne cup was a popular cocktail, consisting of champagne, lemon juice, sugar, and ice. Gin was sometimes added, yielding a drink much like the French 75.\\"Behind the Drink: The French 75\\", David Wondrich, July 09, 2012 The drink was first recorded as the 75 in Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails, 1922 edition, by Harry MacElhone, and in the same year in Robert Vermeire's Cocktails: How to Mix Them, which credits the drink to MacElhone.\\"The French 75 Cocktail ‚Äî Tom Collins in a Tuxedo\\", by Doug Ford, October 28, 2012 However, the recipes differed from the current form ‚Äì MacElhone's version consisted of Calvados, gin, grenadine, and absinthe, while Vermeire added lemon juice. The recipe took its now-classic form and \\"French 75\\" name in Here‚Äôs How, by Judge Jr. (1927), consisting of gin, sugar, lemon juice, and champagne. This recipe was republished with the name French 75 in The Savoy Cocktail Book (1930), which helped popularize the drink. Some later cocktail books use Cognac instead of gin, such as The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks by David A. Embury. The French 75 was popularized in America at the Stork Club in New York. It appears in the movie Casablanca (1942) and is referenced twice in the John Wayne films A Man Betrayed (1941) and Jet Pilot (1957). In 2016, it appears in the ITV series, Mr. Selfridge, which is set in London in the 1910s and 1920s. The Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 is still used in France on ceremonial occasions A fanciful alternative story of the invention of the French 75 was related by Jean Shepherd on November 17, 1969, wherein he credits Gervais Raoul Lufbery as the inventor. The mixture, as related by Shepherd, is Champagne and Cognac on ice with perhaps a twist of lemon.Podcast 27:00 This version is not credible, given the documented earlier version. Similar drinks The recipe of the French 75 is very similar to one of the most popular cocktails, the Tom Collins, with Champagne replacing carbonated water. According to the recipe in Harry MacElhone's book Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails, a French 75 is supposed to be served in a highball glass. The Highball glass, which the Tom Collins Cocktail is also served in, would support the theory of French 75 being a variation of the Tom Collins.https://jeffreymorgenthaler.com/french-75/  References  External links  * * Category:Cocktails with Champagne Category:Cocktails with gin ","title":"French 75 (cocktail)"},{"id":"262380","text":"Scarp may refer to: Landforms and geology * Cliff, a significant vertical, or near vertical, rock exposure * Escarpment, a steep slope or long rock that occurs from erosion or faulting and separates two relatively level areas of differing elevations * Fault scarp, the topographic expression of faulting attributed to the displacement of the land surface by movement along faults Other * Scarp, Scotland, an island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland * Scarp and counterscarp, the inner and outer sides of a ditch or moat used in fortifications * SS-9 Scarp, the NATO reporting name for the R-36 ICBM * Scarp, a 2013 book by the British writer Nick Papadimitriou See also * Scarpe (disambiguation) ","title":"Scarp"},{"id":"262390","text":"The Snoqualmie River is a long river in King County and Snohomish County in the U.S. state of Washington. The river's three main tributaries are the North, Middle, and South Forks, which drain the west side of the Cascade Mountains near the town of North Bend and join near the town of Snoqualmie just above the Snoqualmie Falls. After the falls the river flows north through rich farmland and the towns of Fall City, Carnation, and Duvall before meeting the Skykomish River to form the Snohomish River near Monroe. The Snohomish River empties into Puget Sound at Everett. Other tributaries of the Snoqualmie River include the Taylor River and the Pratt River, both of which enter the Middle Fork, the Tolt River, which joins at Carnation, and the Raging River at Fall City. Many of the Snoqualmie River's headwaters originate as snowmelt within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. On August 8, 2007, U.S. Representative Dave Reichert (WA-08), King County Executive Ron Sims, and others announced a proposal to expand the Alpine Lakes Wilderness to include the valley of the Pratt River, a tributary of the Middle Fork, near the town of North Bend. The proposal would also give the Pratt River National Wild and Scenic River status.  South Fork  The South Fork, approximately long,Calculated in Google Earth begins at the outlet of tiny Source Lake, , and flows southeast before soon turning southwest and continuing to flow in that direction until after Denny Creek joins. It then flows west for a bit before turning northwest and continuing in that general direction until it merges with the Snoqualmie River Proper just above Snoqualmie Falls. It drops over a total of 6 waterfalls (many would argue 8 because many people divide the final one into three portions).  Middle Fork  The Middle Fork Snoqualmie River near North Bend. Mt. Washington is in the background. The Middle Fork, approximately long, originates from Chains Lakes, , and flows south to Williams Lake, then in an easterly direction until it meets with the North Fork near North Bend. It receives the waters of the Taylor River and the Pratt River in short order about halfway between its source and its mouth. It has one major waterfall along its course. The upper reaches of the Middle Fork, Taylor, and Pratt river valleys are within the boundaries of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area. The Middle Fork Valley is a popular recreational area since it is accessible during the winter due to its low altitude and close proximity to Seattle. For many years the Middle Fork Road extended 24 miles to Hardscrabble Creek, but was gated at Dingford Creek in June 2007, 18 miles in. The gate at Dingford Creek was a controversial part of the Access and Travel Management plan adopted by the US Forest Service in 2005. Much of the road's route is on the 1920s and 30's era railroad grade of the North Bend Timber Company. The paved portion of the Middle Fork road was extended by 9.7 miles during a 3-year construction project from 2014-2016, extending pavement to just before the Taylor River bridge. The Middle Fork Valley was heavily logged starting in 1923 and continued up through the 1970s. The obvious railroad grades, pilings, and related debris are from the North Bend Timber Company's company's activity from 1923 to 1941.  North Fork  The North Fork, approximately long, originates at the outlet of small, rarely visited Lake Kanim, . Almost directly after exiting the lake it drops over Kanim Falls. The river then flows east before making a wide turn north. Just before its confluence with the Middle Fork the river flows through a canyon near Ernie's Grove. There are several waterfalls within this canyon including Fantastic Falls.  Waterfalls  Snoqualmie Falls and Salish Lodge The Snoqualmie River has quite a few major waterfalls. By far the most famous waterfall in Washington, receiving over 1 million visitors every year, is the high Snoqualmie Falls. However, the three forks of the upper Snoqualmie River also have notable waterfalls. The north fork has Fantastic Falls (35 ft) and Kanim Falls (200 ft). The middle fork has Nellie Falls (150 ft). And, the south fork has Twin Falls (135 ft), Middle Twin Falls, Upper Twin Falls, Weeks Falls, Upper Weeks Falls, Denny Camp Falls, Franklin Falls (135 ft), and Fall-into-the-Wall Falls (22 ft). Snoqualmie Falls was featured on the television series Twin Peaks. Shots of upriver Snoqualmie also feature in some of the show's title sequences.  Whitewater kayaking, canoeing and rafting  The Snoqualmie River has quite a few sections suitable for whitewater kayaking and rafting. It features run rate Class II to Class V+. The nearby Raging River also features a kayaking run.Kanim Falls  Flooding  Stream Gaging Station, Carnation, during the March 13, 2007 flood The Snoqualmie River is prone to flooding and typically sees multiple flood events annually that inundate local farmland and close low-lying roads. During record level floods, all road access to the towns of Carnation and Duvall becomes closed off. The last three times this happened were during the floods of 2009, 2006, and 1990. The river level of the Snoqualmie River is monitored by six USGS streamgages, one on each fork, one just above the falls, one below Carnation, and one near Duvall. Data from the streamgages are used by the National Weather Service for flood forecasting and warning. The Tolt River and the Raging River are also monitored by USGS streamgages. The Snoqualmie Flood Reduction Project was a controversial Army Corps of Engineers project completed in 2005 to reduce the effect of floods in the town of Snoqualmie by widening the river just above the falls.

It is a type of buck, therefore sometimes called a vodka buck. The Moscow mule is popularly served in a copper mug, which takes on the cold temperature of the liquid. Some public health advisories recommend copper mugs be plated with nickel or stainless steel on the inside and the lip, but it has been disputed whether the time and acidity involved in the drinking of a Moscow mule would be enough to leach out the 30 milligrams of copper per liter needed to cause copper toxicity. Variations French mule Variations use different liquors in place of vodka, with the name changed accordingly: * Kentucky mule, Horsefeather: Bourbon. * New Orleans mule: Bourbon and coffee liqueur. * Gin-gin mule, London mule, Munich mule, Foghorn: Gin. * Mexican mule: Tequila. * Jamaican mule: Spiced rum. * Aussie mule: Bundaberg Rum. * Irish mule: Irish whiskey. * Glasgow mule: Blended Scotch whisky and St-Germain liqueur. * Bohemian mule: Absinthe. * Dead man's mule: Absinthe and cinnamon schnapps. * French mule: Cognac and angostura bitters. * Prickly pear mule: Pear liqueur and Poire Williams. * Southern mule: Southern Comfort liqueur. * Tuscan mule: Tuaca liqueur. * Oslo mule: Akvavit. * Mistletoe mule: Garnished with rosemary and cranberries. Another variation uses ginger syrup instead of ginger beer. Other ingredients, such as carrot juice and angostura bitters, can also be added. The addition of raspberry syrup or cr√®me de framboise liqueur turns a Moscow mule into a Floradora. Mountain Dew can be substituted for ginger beer to make a Moscow Mole. History George Sinclair's 2007 article on the origin of the drink quotes the New York Herald Tribune from 1948: > The mule was born in Manhattan but \\"stalled\\" on the West Coast for the > duration. The birthplace of \\"Little Moscow\\" was in New York's Chatham Hotel. > That was back in 1941 when the first carload of Jack Morgan's Cock 'n' Bull > ginger beer was railing over the plains to give New Yorkers a happy > surprise‚Ä¶ The Violette Family helped. Three friends were in the Chatham bar, > one John A. Morgan, known as Jack, president of Cock 'n' Bull Products and > owner of the Hollywood Cock 'n' Bull Restaurant; one was John G. Martin, > president of G.F. Heublein Brothers Inc. of Hartford, Conn., and the third > was Rudolph Kunett, president of the Pierre Smirnoff, Heublein's vodka > division. As Jack Morgan tells it, \\"We three were quaffing a slug, nibbling > an hors d'oeuvre and shoving toward inventive genius\\". Martin and Kunett had > their minds on their vodka and wondered what would happen if a two-ounce > shot joined with Morgan's ginger beer and the squeeze of a lemon. Ice was > ordered, lemons procured, mugs ushered in and the concoction put together. > Cups were raised, the men counted five and down went the first taste. It was > good. It lifted the spirit to adventure. Four or five days later the mixture > was christened the Moscow mule... This story was well known for years, however in 2007 a new version of the invention of the Moscow mule cocktail was published. In this story the cocktail's inventor was Wes Price, Morgan's head bartender and the drink was born out of a need to clear the bar's cellar, packed with unsold inventory, including vodka and ginger beer. Eric Felten quotes Wes Price in an article that was published in 2007 in The Wall Street Journal > \\"I just wanted to clean out the basement,\\" Price would say of creating the > Moscow mule. \\"I was trying to get rid of a lot of dead stock.\\" The first one > he mixed he served to the actor Broderick Crawford. \\"It caught on like > wildfire,\\" Price bragged.\\" The Moscow mule is often served in a copper mug. The popularity of this drinking vessel is attributable to Martin, who went around the United States to sell Smirnoff vodka and popularize the Moscow mule. Martin asked bartenders to pose with a specialty copper mug and a bottle of Smirnoff vodka, and took Polaroid photographs of them. He took two photos, leaving one with the bartender for display. The other photo was put into a collection and used as proof to the next bar Martin visited of the popularity of the Moscow mule. The copper mug remains, to this day, a popular serving vessel for the Moscow mule. According to a 1942 Insider Hollywood article, the Moscow mule was most popular in Los Angeles, where it originated. The Nevada State Journal (October 12, 1943) reinforced the mule's popularity in reporting: \\"Already the mule is climbing up into the exclusive handful of most-popular mixed drinks\\". It became known as a favorite drink of Reno casino owner William F. Harrah. In his book Beat the Dealer (1964), Edward O. Thorp did not name the Tahoe casino where he thought he had been poorly treated as a card counter. Instead, he wrote, \\"Immediately I had a Moscow mule\\", subtly hinting that the location was Harrah's Lake Tahoe, due to Harrah's then well-known proclivity for the drink.Edward O. Thorp. Beat The Dealer: A Winning Strategy For The Game Of Twenty One (New York: Vintage Books, 1966), 68. =Copper vessel plating= The ingredients in Moscow mule cocktails are acidic, and the resulting beverage has a pH well below 6.0. This creates a problem when using traditional copper mugs, as copper can start dissolving into acidic solutions. Copper in solution is considered toxic at concentrations above 1 mg/L. On July 28, 2017, the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division issued a statement that pure copper vessels should not be used to serve acidic drinks, but that \\"copper mugs lined on the interior with another metal, such as nickel or stainless steel, are allowed to be used and are widely available\\". The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2013 Food Code states that copper and copper alloys such as brass \\"may not be used in contact with a food that has a pH below 6 such as vinegar, fruit juice, or wine or for a fitting or tubing installed between a backflow prevention device and a carbonator.\\" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs Model Food Code specifically prohibits copper from \\"coming into direct contact with foods that have a pH below 6.0.‚Äù The advisory relates only to solid copper mugs. Copper mugs that are lined with stainless steel or other food-safe materials are exempt from the advisory.

He was an active Reform politician in the 1830s, and produced several important legislative reports on banking, lunatic asylums, and education.  Early life  He was the eldest son of Thomas and Rhoda Tyrill Duncombe, born July 28, 1792 in Stratford, Connecticut. He studied medicine at the college of the One Hundred and One Members of the Medical Society of the City of New York, graduating in 1819. He then settled in Delaware, Upper Canada, and in 1824 he established the first medical school in Upper Canada with Dr John Rolph, in St. Thomas, under the patronage of Colonel Thomas Talbot.  Freemasonry  Debates within Upper Canada on the nature of the relationship of the provincial Grand Lodge and the English Grand Lodge paralleled political discussions on the colony's constitution. Those Freemasons who immigrated from the United States favoured an independent Provincial Grand Lodge. Duncombe was a Freemason, serving as first master of the Mount Moriah lodge at Westminster. In 1836, in a move that presaged the Rebellion, he set up a Grand Lodge independent from the British lodges and became its first Grand Master. Duncombe's Grand Lodge was short- lived, but he soon helped found another during the Patriot War that followed the Rebellion: the Hunters' Lodge. The Hunters' Lodge was patterned on Freemasonry. His last known Masonic activity was to establish a Masonic lodge in Sacramento in 1852. Dr. Charles Duncombe circa 1840 (Library and Archives Canada MIKAN 2895907  Reform politics  = Upper Canada Legislature = Duncombe was elected in 1828 to the Legislative Assembly as a representative for Oxford County. He was originally a Reformer in the same vein as Robert Baldwin, but was attracted by William Lyon Mackenzie's more radical reform movement. In 1836, Duncombe made extensive reports to a parliamentary committee of reformers on prisons, asylums and education based on an extensive tour of American facilities. In his report on prisons, Duncombe argued crime was the result of social injustice, and not just the product of individual error. He argued that government had the responsibility to not merely punish the offender, but to rectify the social conditions that produced the offender. This, he argued, was particularly true for juvenile offenders. He viewed penitentiaries as \\"schools for criminals\\" and sought their eradication. \\"Doctor Charles Duncombe's Report upon the Subject of Education, made to the Parliament of Upper Canada, 25th February, 1836.\\" called for a radical expansion of common school education in the province. He rejected the grammar school model pursued by the Family Compact and argued for practical education; the classics were of limited use in the real world for which education should kill students. A bill based on Duncombe's report passed the assembly on 4 April 1836, only to be rejected by the Family Compact dominated Legislative Council. Many of its provisions, however, would be introduced under after the Rebellion including elective school boards, female education, creation of normal schools, prescribed textbooks, and non-sectarian religious instruction. The 1836 provincial elections were marked by widespread violence by the Orange Order, and claims of voter fraud. The Lt. Governor, Sir Francis Bond Head was in charge of the elections but intervened directly in favour of the Tories in the campaign. The Reformers complained that he issued illegal land patents to new immigrants to entice them to vote for Tory candidates. When the new Tory dominated Assembly refused to hear their petition, Duncombe was charged with presenting it to the British government. He travelled to London, England in the summer of 1836 but was refused an audience by the Colonial Office. Duncombe was all the more disillusioned when his 14-year-old son was killed before his return in November. Like Samuel Lount, his fellow reform Assemblyman and rebellion organizer, he virtually withdrew from public life in 1837. = Rebellion & Hunters' Lodges = In December 1837, Duncombe heard reports of Mackenzie's rebellion in Toronto. Duncombe, with Robert Alway, Finlay Malcolm, Eliakim Malcolm, Enoch Moore and Joshua Doan, gathered about 200 men on 8 December and marched towards Toronto; this is sometimes known as the Western Rising. A few hundred more rebels joined them on their march, but they dispersed near Hamilton on December 13 when they learned of Mackenzie's defeat, and that a militia under Colonel Allan MacNab was on their way to stop them. Duncombe and Eliakim Malcolm fled to the United States. Duncombe was a central organizer of the Hunters' Lodge, a secret Masonic-like military organization with its Grand Lodge in Cleveland. This organization inducted more than 40,000 men into lodges spread across the Great Lakes and St Lawrence region. They launched the Patriot War in 1838-39, almost bringing the United States and the United Kingdom to war. The organization also declared a provisional Republic of Canada at a convention in Cleveland in September 1838, at which Duncombe established a Republican Bank of Canada to finance the war. Duncombe remained there for the rest of his life, despite being pardoned in 1843. Joshua Doan was executed in 1839. = The Story of His Escape = Main Article: The History of the County Brant, 1883, p. 395 Local History of Burford Township Ontario speaks of Dr. Charles Duncombe and his escape from Canada. A writer was able to give it from the statement of the gentleman who, by his intrepidity and knowledge of the Western part of the Ontario frontier, aided an escape and which recalls those of some of Scott's Jacobite heroes a century before. Charles Tilden, Uncle of Dr. Hagel of Toronto, Ontario, was, with several of the Hagel family among the Scotland insurgents. Living near Amherstberg, he happened to be specially well acquainted with the entire western frontier, and noticed that although Sir Francis Head's agents had placed guards all along the line to prevent the escape of \\"rebels\\", now that a month had passed from the first excitement, the vigilance was much relaxed. Tilden went to see Duncombe, who, in the depth of winter (January, 1838, was a specially cold season), was kept hid in a hay-loft, and supplied with food by stealth by those who left the house as if to feed the cattle. Tilden urged him to attempt escape disguised as a woman, which Duncombe's smooth round face rendered it possible enough. The attempt was dangerous; a reward had been offered for his head, and all over the country the noble savages of the Grand River reserve were on the lookout for his scalp and the blood-money it would bring. They left the house next day in an old-fashioned farmers box sleigh. Tilden drove, Mrs. Shennick and Duncombe sat side by side, the latter disguised as an elderly farmer's wife. Mrs. Shennick's little girl, a child of nine years, was taught to address him as \\"Auntie\\". All day they drove along without molestation; at night they stopped at a country hotel, where there not being sufficient accommodation, Charles Tilden had to sleep in another a room for the hotel staff, while the three women had a room to themselves. Unable to sleep from the excitement of his position, Dr. Duncombe sat up all night. At early dawn they drove away breakfastless, and arrived after several hours' drive at the crossing place, which was at a village opposite what is now Marine City, Michigan. They drove into the yard of the tavern where were the soldiers of a party in command of a sergeant, posted there to watch the crossing place, and if possible arrest the \\"rebel Chief\\". Very calmly Tilden watered his horses, and then addressing the sergeant in command as \\"Captain\\", asked if the ice was safe. The sergeant asked whence he came. Tilden replied, truly enough, that he came from London, and he was going with his Aunt and Mother to visit some friends, whose names he mentioned, on the opposite coast of Michigan. The sergeant ordered one of his men to accompany them across the ice. Then they get half way for the rest of the river, the young soldier said that they could easily find their way for the rest of the track, and was about to leave them. Dr. Duncombe handed Charles Tilden fifty cents for the soldier, and while the latter was thanking them, felt very much inclined to send Dr. Duncombe's compliments to the sergeant who had furnished them with a guide, but refrained lest he should spoil the chance of some other unfortunate who might try the same stratagem for evading the blood-hounds of the Family Compact Government. In a few minutes he stood \\"a free man\\" on a free soil.\\" They entered a store to buy some food, and Duncombe careless about preserving his disguise soon attracted attention. It became known that the Canadian Republican, Dr. Duncombe, a crowd gathered. He escaped capture, which in those days would have been certain death. He had a long and prosperous career in the U.S. lay before him. He was included in the general amnesty, and his Buford property was restored to him. Charles Tilden's son lived in possession of a farm of two hundred acres which Dr. Duncombe deeded to him as an acknowledgment of his father's generous friendship.The History of the County Brant, 1883, p.395.

Home, London Free Press, October 13, 1928 Dr. Duncombe was the first known physician in Sacramento, California practicing medicine in 1851. He would later be elected to State Legislature in 1858, but was denied a seat for not being a citizen. He was elected the following year but was denied a seat. It was in 1862 he became a citizen, he took his place in the State Assembly.Dr. Charles Duncombe (B-16-32) Pioneer, Patriot, and Traitor by John Bettencourt The Republic of Canada Almost -Page 96- By Patrick Richard Carstens and Timothy L. Sanfordhttp://www.raidersandrebels.com/2010/02/charles-duncombe-dr-jekyll- becomes-mr.html = Free Banking = Until 1835, all banks in Upper Canada required a legislative charter; this left them subject to political corruption and manipulation, as was the case with the largest of them, the Bank of Upper Canada. The Bank of Upper Canada was controlled by the Family Compact and used by them to control the province's money supply and trade. Reformers tried several legislative strategies, including attempts to incorporate credit unions such as the Farmers' Storehouse company. This came to an end in 1835 when Charles Duncombe produced a \\"Report on Currency\\" for the Legislative Assembly which demonstrated the legality of the Scottish joint-stock bank system in Upper Canada. The difference between the English chartered banks and the Scottish joint stock banks is that the Scottish banks were considered partnerships and hence didn't need a legislated Act in order to operate. The joint stock banks thus lacked limited liability, and every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank's debts to the full extent of their personal property. The chartered banks, in contrast, protected their shareholders with limited liability and hence from major loss; they thus encouraged speculation. The Scottish joint-stock banks followed a \\"hard money policy.\\" They avoided speculative risk because if they failed, their shareholders were responsible for the full loss. Since the banks did not require a legislated charter, many more banks could be founded, and they were more competitive and freer from political influence and corruption. Following Duncombe's report, the Farmers' Bank and the Bank of the People were founded on a joint stock basis, until the Family Compact conspired to make them illegal in 1838. The Bank of the People funded William Lyon Mackenzie newspaper, The Constitution in 1836. Similar issues existed in the United States where the chartered banks were accused of creating a \\"monied aristocracy\\" responsible for the financial panic of 1837-8. The Equal Rights Party (the Locofocos) called for the introduction of the Scottish system, called by them \\"Free Banking\\". The Patriot War has been described as \\"Locofocoism with a Gun.\\" When the Hunters' Lodges held their convention in Cleveland in September 1838, Duncombe presented \\"An address to the Different Lodges on the Subject of a Joint-Stock Company Bank\\" in which he proposed financing the Patriot War with a republican bank. The Bank was established for a short period. Duncombe continued to pursue the idea of joint stock banking after the end of the Patriot War, publishing a lengthy book on the subject: Duncombe‚Äôs Free Banking: An essay on Banking, Currency, Finance, Exchanges and Political Economy (Cleveland: Sanford & Co., 1841). In it, he argued that a democratic state depended upon Free Banking. = California State Assembly = Birds-eye view of Sacramento, ca. 1857 After his activity in the Patriot War, Duncombe moved from Cleveland to Rochester, in 1841. He practised medicine there until he moved to Sacramento County, California in 1849 at the beginning of the California Gold Rush. Although one of the first doctors to arrive in Sacramento, he did not qualify to practise in the state until 1851. He married Lucy Millard of California in 1857. He was elected to the Sacramento city council. In 1859, he was elected to the California State Assembly as one of four members from Sacramento County, but was disqualified because it was argued that he gave up his American citizenship when he allowed himself to be elected to a foreign (Canadian) legislature. He became an American citizen and was elected again in 1863 as one of the county's five representatives. He died in Hicksville, California in 1867 after a severe case of sunstroke and buried in the Masonic Section of the Sacramento Historic City Cemetery in Sacramento, California.

There he saw, during the German occupation of the Netherlands, how the Nazis set up a \\"transition camp\\" for prisoners who were to be sent to concentration camps. The suffering of the victims and the cruelty of the Nazi camp guards, so near his home, influenced him for the rest of his life. After the liberation (1945), he studied art history at the University of Amsterdam.Armando RKD Artists. His first solo exhibition was at the Galerie Le Canard, Amsterdam, in 1954. At this time he also started to write poetry. He was influenced by the CoBrA art group, and made abstract drawings‚Äîwith his left hand, in the dark. He was also influenced by Jean Dubuffet and Jean Fautrier, producing thickly impastoed paintings. In 1958 he was one of the founding members of the Nederlandse Informele Groep (Informelen), with the painters , , Henk Peeters, and others. By 1959 he had joined the Situationist International (SI) and attended their Third conference, held in Munich 17‚Äì20 April 1959. With Anton Alberts, Constant and Har Oudejans he wrote First proclamation of the Dutch Section of the SI. However, he was expelled from the SI in the Spring of 1960, though continuing to contribute to other Situationist publications like the Situationist Times. He also contributed to Podium, Gard Sivik, De Nieuwe Stijl, and Barbarber. He lived partly in Amsterdam, partly in Amersfoort, and until 1989 also in Berlin. Fire at the Armando museum, 2007 Amersfoort, the place of his childhood, hosted a museum devoted to his work. On 22 October 2007 a large fire struck the museum and burned thirteen Armando paintings. At the time of the fire there was also an exhibition with works of painters like Ruisdael, D√ºrer, Seghers and Kiefer, which were all lost, with damages estimated at about three million euros (US$4,000,000). (Source: Dutch TV News NOS, 24 October 2007) A final balance of the damage by the fire was made on Tuesday 20 November 2007. According to a Dutch newsarticle, 63 paintings were lost, 8 were recovered. 6 of the recovered paintings are badly damaged, two are lightly damaged. The new Armando museum: Museum Oud Amelisweerd (MOA) Since 2014 the Armando Collection has been housed in a new home, the Museum Oud Amelisweert near Bunnik (NLD).

The three phases of translation initiation polymerase binds to the DNA strand and moves along until the small ribosomal subunit binds to the DNA. Elongation is initiated when the large subunit attaches and termination end the process of elongation. In molecular biology and genetics, translation is the process in which ribosomes in the cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum synthesize proteins after the process transcription of DNA to RNA in the cell's nucleus. The entire process is called gene expression. In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded in a ribosome, outside the nucleus, to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide. The polypeptide later folds into an active protein and performs its functions in the cell. The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of complementary tRNA anticodon sequences to mRNA codons. The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is \\"read\\" by the ribosome. Translation proceeds in three phases: # Initiation: The ribosome assembles around the target mRNA. The first tRNA is attached at the start codon. # Elongation: The tRNA transfers an amino acid to the tRNA corresponding to the next codon. The ribosome then moves (translocates) to the next mRNA codon to continue the process, creating an amino acid chain. # Termination: When a stop codon is reached, the ribosome releases the polypeptide. In prokaryotes (bacteria), translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the large and small subunits of the ribosome bind to the mRNA. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytosol or across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process called co-translational translocation. In co-translational translocation, the entire ribosome/mRNA complex binds to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the new protein is synthesized and released into the ER; the newly created polypeptide can be stored inside the ER for future vesicle transport and secretion outside the cell, or immediately secreted. Many types of transcribed RNA, such as transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and small nuclear RNA, do not undergo translation into proteins. A number of antibiotics act by inhibiting translation. These include anisomycin, cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, and puromycin. Prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes, and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any harm to a eukaryotic host's cells. Basic mechanisms A ribosome translating a protein that is secreted into the endoplasmic reticulum. tRNAs are colored dark blue. 246x246px The basic process of protein production is addition of one amino acid at a time to the end of a protein. This operation is performed by a ribosome. A ribosome is made up of two subunits, a small subunit and a large subunit. these subunits come together before translation of mRNA into a protein to provide a location for translation to be carried out and a polypeptide to be produced. The choice of amino acid type to add is determined by an mRNA molecule. Each amino acid added is matched to a three nucleotide subsequence of the mRNA. For each such triplet possible, the corresponding amino acid is accepted. The successive amino acids added to the chain are matched to successive nucleotide triplets in the mRNA. In this way the sequence of nucleotides in the template mRNA chain determines the sequence of amino acids in the generated amino acid chain. Addition of an amino acid occurs at the C-terminus of the peptide and thus translation is said to be amino-to-carboxyl directed. The mRNA carries genetic information encoded as a ribonucleotide sequence from the chromosomes to the ribosomes. The ribonucleotides are \\"read\\" by translational machinery in a sequence of nucleotide triplets called codons. Each of those triplets codes for a specific amino acid. The ribosome molecules translate this code to a specific sequence of amino acids. The ribosome is a multisubunit structure containing rRNA and proteins. It is the \\"factory\\" where amino acids are assembled into proteins. tRNAs are small noncoding RNA chains (74‚Äì93 nucleotides) that transport amino acids to the ribosome. tRNAs have a site for amino acid attachment, and a site called an anticodon. The anticodon is an RNA triplet complementary to the mRNA triplet that codes for their cargo amino acid. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (enzymes) catalyze the bonding between specific tRNAs and the amino acids that their anticodon sequences call for. The product of this reaction is an aminoacyl-tRNA. In prokaryotes, this aminoacyl-tRNA is carried to the ribosome by EF-Tu, where mRNA codons are matched through complementary base pairing to specific tRNA anticodons. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that mispair tRNAs with the wrong amino acids can produce mischarged aminoacyl-tRNAs, which can result in inappropriate amino acids at the respective position in protein. This \\"mistranslation\\" of the genetic code naturally occurs at low levels in most organisms, but certain cellular environments cause an increase in permissive mRNA decoding, sometimes to the benefit of the cell. The ribosome has three sites for tRNA to bind. They are the aminoacyl site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P) and the exit site (abbreviated E). With respect to the mRNA, the three sites are oriented 5‚Äô to 3‚Äô E-P-A, because ribosomes move toward the 3' end of mRNA. The A-site binds the incoming tRNA with the complementary codon on the mRNA. The P-site holds the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain. The E-site holds the tRNA without its amino acid. When an aminoacyl-tRNA initially binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, it is in the A site. Then, a peptide bond forms between the amino acid of the tRNA in the A site and the amino acid of the charged tRNA in the P site. The growing polypeptide chain is transferred to the tRNA in the A site. Translocation occurs, moving the tRNA in the P site, now without an amino acid, to the E site; the tRNA that was in the A site, now charged with the polypeptide chain, is moved to the P site. The tRNA in the E site leaves and another aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A site to repeat the process. After the new amino acid is added to the chain, and after the mRNA is released out of the nucleus and into the ribosome's core, the energy provided by the hydrolysis of a GTP bound to the translocase EF-G (in prokaryotes) and eEF-2 (in eukaryotes) moves the ribosome down one codon towards the 3' end. The energy required for translation of proteins is significant. For a protein containing n amino acids, the number of high-energy phosphate bonds required to translate it is 4n-1 . The rate of translation varies; it is significantly higher in prokaryotic cells (up to 17‚Äì21 amino acid residues per second) than in eukaryotic cells (up to 6‚Äì9 amino acid residues per second). Even though the ribosomes are usually considered accurate and processive machines, the translation process is subject to errors that can lead either to the synthesis of erroneous proteins or to the premature abandonment of translation. The rate of error in synthesizing proteins has been estimated to be between 1/105 and 1/103 misincorporated amino acids, depending on the experimental conditions. The rate of premature translation abandonment, instead, has been estimated to be of the order of magnitude of 10‚àí4 events per translated codon. The correct amino acid is covalently bonded to the correct transfer RNA (tRNA) by amino acyl transferases. The amino acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3' OH of the tRNA by an ester bond. When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it, the tRNA is termed \\"charged\\". Initiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to the 5' end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors (IF). In prokaryotes, initiation of protein synthesis involves the recognition of a purine-rich initiation sequence on the mRNA called the Shine-Delgarno sequence. The Shine-Delgarno sequence binds to a complementary pyrimidine-rich sequence on the 3' end of the 16S rRNA part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. The binding of these complementary sequences ensures that the 30S ribosomal subunit is bound to the mRNA and is aligned such that the initiation codon is placed in the 30S portion of the P-site. Once the mRNA and 30S subunit are properly bound, an initiation factor brings the initiator tRNA-amino acid complex, f-Met-tRNA, to the 30S P site. The initiation phase is completed once a 50S subunit joins the 30 subunit, forming an active 70S ribosome. Termination of the polypeptide occurs when the A site of the ribosome is occupied by a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) on the mRNA. tRNA usually cannot recognize or bind to stop codons. Instead, the stop codon induces the binding of a release factor protein. (RF1 & RF2) that prompts the disassembly of the entire ribosome/mRNA complex by the hydrolysis of the polypeptide chain from the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome Drugs or special sequence motifs on the mRNA can change the ribosomal structure so that near-cognate tRNAs are bound to the stop codon instead of the release factors. In such cases of 'translational readthrough', translation continues until the ribosome encounters the next stop codon. The process of translation is highly regulated in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Regulation of translation can impact the global rate of protein synthesis which is closely coupled to the metabolic and proliferative state of a cell. In addition, recent work has revealed that genetic differences and their subsequent expression as mRNAs can also impact translation rate in an RNA-specific manner. Clinical significance Translational control is critical for the development and survival of cancer. Cancer cells must frequently regulate the translation phase of gene expression, though it is not fully understood why translation is targeted over steps like transcription. While cancer cells often have genetically altered translation factors, it is much more common for cancer cells to modify the levels of existing translation factors. Several major oncogenic signaling pathways, including the RAS‚ÄìMAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MYC, and WNT‚ÄìŒ≤-catenin pathways, ultimately reprogram the genome via translation. Cancer cells also control translation to adapt to cellular stress. During stress, the cell translates mRNAs that can mitigate the stress and promote survival. An example of this is the expression of AMPK in various cancers; its activation triggers a cascade that can ultimately allow the cancer to escape apoptosis (programmed cell death) triggered by nutrition deprivation. Future cancer therapies may involve disrupting the translation machinery of the cell to counter the downstream effects of cancer.  Mathematical modeling of translation  thumb500 pxFigure M0.

Figure M1'. The extended model of protein synthesis M1 with explicit presentation of 40S, 60S and initiation factors (IF) binding. The transcription-translation process description, mentioning only the most basic ‚Äùelementary‚Äù processes, consists of: # production of mRNA molecules (including splicing), # initiation of these molecules with help of initiation factors (e.g., the initiation can include the circularization step though it is not universally required), # initiation of translation, recruiting the small ribosomal subunit, # assembly of full ribosomes, # elongation, i.e. movement of ribosomes along mRNA with production of protein, # termination of translation, # degradation of mRNA molecules, # degradation of proteins. The process of protein synthesis and translation is a subject of mathematical modeling for a long time starting from the first detailed kinetic models such as or others taking into account stochastic aspects of translation and using computer simulations. Many chemical kinetics-based models of protein synthesis have been developed and analyzed in the last four decades. Beyond chemical kinetics, various modeling formalisms such as Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP),Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN), Petri Nets and max-plus algebra have been applied to model the detailed kinetics of protein synthesis or some of its stages. A basic model of protein synthesis that took into account all eight 'elementary' processes has been developed, following the paradigm that \\"useful models are simple and extendable\\". The simplest model M0 is represented by the reaction kinetic mechanism (Figure M0). It was generalised to include 40S, 60S and initiation factors (IF) binding (Figure M1'). It was extended further to include effect of microRNA on protein synthesis. Most of models in this hierarchy can be solved analytically. These solutions were used to extract 'kinetic signatures' of different specific mechanisms of synthesis regulation. Genetic code Whereas other aspects such as the 3D structure, called tertiary structure, of protein can only be predicted using sophisticated algorithms, the amino acid sequence, called primary structure, can be determined solely from the nucleic acid sequence with the aid of a translation table. This approach may not give the correct amino acid composition of the protein, in particular if unconventional amino acids such as selenocysteine are incorporated into the protein, which is coded for by a conventional stop codon in combination with a downstream hairpin (SElenoCysteine Insertion Sequence, or SECIS). There are many computer programs capable of translating a DNA/RNA sequence into a protein sequence. Normally this is performed using the Standard Genetic Code, however, few programs can handle all the \\"special\\" cases, such as the use of the alternative initiation codons. For instance, the rare alternative start codon CTG codes for Methionine when used as a start codon, and for Leucine in all other positions.

An was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation in 1962 by the South Korean government, the most prestigious civil decoration in the Republic of Korea, for his efforts for Korean independence. Doosan Encyclopedia Biography =Early accounts= An's parents An was born on 2 September 1879, in Haeju, Hwanghae- do, the first son of An Tae-hun (ÏïàÌÉúÌõà; ÂÆâÊ≥∞Âã≥) and Jo Maria (Jo Seong-nyeo Ï°∞ÏÑ±ÎÖÄ; Ë∂ôÂßìÂ•≥), of the family of the Sunheung-An (ÏàúÌù•ÏïàÏî®; È†ÜËààÂÆâÊ∞è) lineage. His childhood name was (ÏïàÏùëÏπ†; ÂÆâÊáâ‰∏É; ). As a boy, he learned Chinese literature and Western sciences, but was more interested in martial arts and marksmanship. Kim Gu (ÍπÄÍµ¨; Èáë‰πù), future leader of the Korean independence movement who had taken refuge in An Tae-hun's house at the time, wrote that young An Jung-geun was an excellent marksman, liked to read books, and had strong charisma.Kim, G.

While fleeing from the Japanese, An took refuge with a French priest of the Catholic Church in Korea named Wilhelm (Korean name, Hong Seok-gu; ÌôçÏÑùÍµ¨; Ê¥™Èå´‰πù) who baptized and hid him in his church for several months. The priest encouraged An to read the Bible and had a series of discussions with him. He maintained his belief in Catholicism until his death, going to the point of even asking his son to become a priest in his last letter to his wife. At the age of 25, he started a coal business, but devoted himself to education of Korean people after the Eulsa Treaty by establishing private schools in northwestern regions of Korea. He also participated in the National Debt Repayment Movement. In 1907 he exiled himself to Vladivostok to join in with the armed resistance against the Japanese colonial rulers, where he learnt fluent Russian. He was appointed a lieutenant general of an armed Korean resistance group and led several attacks against Japanese forces before his eventual defeat. =Assassination of It≈ç Hirobumi= An Jung-geun in 1906 Ito (second on the left) before being gunned down by An Jung-geun In October 1909, An passed the Imperial Japanese guards at the Harbin Railway Station. It≈ç Hirobumi had come back from negotiating with the Russian representative on the train. An shot It≈ç three times with an FN M1900 pistol on the railway platform. He also shot Kawagami Toshihiko (Â∑ù‰∏ä‰øäÂΩ¶), the Japanese Consul General, Morita Jir≈ç (Ê£ÆÊ≥∞‰∫åÈÉû), a Secretary of Imperial Household Agency, and Tanaka Seitar≈ç (Áî∞‰∏≠Ê∑∏Â§™ÈÉû), an executive of South Manchuria Railway, who were seriously injured. After the shooting, An yelled out for Korean independence in Russian, stating \\"–ö–æ—Ä–µ—è! –£—Ä–∞!\\" (Korea! Hooray!), and waving the Korean flag. Afterwards, An was arrested by Russian guards who held him for two days before turning him over to Japanese colonial authorities. When he heard the news that It≈ç had died, he made the sign of the cross in gratitude. An was quoted as saying, \\"I have ventured to commit a serious crime, offering my life for my country. This is the behavior of a noble-minded patriot.\\" Wilhelm gave last rites to An, ignoring the bishop of Korea's order not to. An insisted that the captors call him by his baptismal name, Thomas. In court, An claimed to be a lieutenant general of the Korean resistance army and demanded to be treated as a prisoner of war and not a suspected criminal. He insisted he did nothing wrong, reciting a list of 15 execution-worthy offenses he believed It≈ç had committed.Kang.(2007, p.131) An mistakenly believed It≈ç had ordered the assassination of Empress Myeongseong, an order which is attributed to Miura Gor≈ç, although Miura Gor≈ç did send a report to It≈ç after the execution. =Imprisonment and death= An's Japanese captors showed sympathy to him. He recorded in his autobiography that the public prosecutor, Mizobuchi Takao, exclaimed \\"From what you have told me, it is clear that you are a righteous man of East Asia. I can't believe a sentence of death will be imposed on a righteous man. There's nothing to worry about.\\" He was also given New Year's delicacies and his calligraphy was highly admired and requested. After six trials, An was sentenced to death by the Japanese colonial court in Ryojun (Port Arthur). An was angered at the sentence, though he expected it. He had hoped to be viewed as a prisoner of war instead of an assassin. On the same day of sentencing at two o'clock in the afternoon, his two brothers Jeong-geun and Gong-geun met with him to deliver their mother's message, \\"Your death is for the sake of your country, and don't ask for your life in a cowardly manner. Your brave death for justice is a final filial regards to your mother.\\" Judge Hirashi, who presided over An's trial, had promised An that a stay of execution for at least a few months would be granted, but Tokyo ordered prompt action. Before his execution, An made two final requests: that the wardens help him finish his essay, \\"On Peace in East Asia\\", and for a set of white silk Korean clothes to die in. The warden granted the second request and resigned shortly afterwards. An requested to be executed as a prisoner of war, by firing squad. But instead it was ordered that he should be hanged as a common criminal. The execution took place in Ryojun, on 26 March 1910. His grave in Lu Shun has not been found.Ê¢ÖÊ≥âÈáéÈå≤ Êº¢Êñá ( 3 ) Views Some historians hold that It≈ç's death resulted in the acceleration of the final stage of the colonization process, but the claim has been disputed by some. 2010 Nocut News article According to Donald Keene, author of Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852‚Äì1912, An Jung-Geun was an admirer of Emperor Meiji of Imperial Japan. One of the 15 charges An leveled against It≈ç was that he had deceived the Emperor of Japan, whom An felt desired peace in East Asia and Korean independence. An requested that Meiji be informed of his reasons for his execution of It≈ç in the hopes that if Meiji understood his reasons, the emperor would realize how mistaken It≈ç's policies were and would rejoice. An also felt sure that most Japanese felt similar hatred for It≈ç, an opinion he formed from talking with Japanese prisoners in Korea. While An was staying in the prison and on the trial, many Japanese prison guards, lawyers and even prosecutors were inspired by An.\\"Research notes of Ippei Wakabayashi\\" Legacy Taegukgi by Ahn Jung-geun longing for the Independence of Korea \\"‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏çËÆÄÊõ∏Âè£‰∏≠ÁîüËçäÊ£ò\\" means \\"Unless reading everyday, thorns grow in the mouth.\\" The assassination of It≈ç by An was praised by Koreans and many Chinese as well, who were struggling against Japanese invasion at the time. Well-known Chinese political leaders such as Yuan Shikai, Sun Yat-sen, and Liang Qichao wrote poems acclaiming An. 2009 Joongang Ilbo Article In the 2010 An Jung-Geun Symposium in Korea, Wada Haruki (ÂíåÁî∞Êò•Ê®π), an activist who once worked at Tokyo University, evaluated An by quoting It≈ç Yukio (‰ºäËó§‰πãÈõÑ), a fellow history scholar in Kyoto University. 2010 Kyunghyang News Article In his text published in 2009, It≈ç Yukio claims that the reign by It≈ç Hirobumi resulted in strong resistance from Koreans as it was considered the first step for annexation of Korea due to the cultural differences, and that An is not to be blamed even if he assassinated It≈ç without understanding It≈ç's ideology (2009, It≈ç). On 26 March 2010, a nationwide centenary tribute to An was held in South Korea, including a ceremony led by the Prime Minister Chung Un-Chan and tribute concerts. = Ancestry = An's family produced many other Korean independence activists. An's cousin An Myeong-Geun (ÏïàÎ™ÖÍ∑º; ÂÆâÊòéÊ†π) attempted to assassinate Terauchi Masatake, the first Japanese Governor-General of Korea (Ï°∞ÏÑ†Ï¥ùÎèÖ; ÊúùÈÆÆÁ∏ΩÁù£) who executed the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty in 1910. He failed, however, and was imprisoned for 15 years; he died in 1926. An's brothers Ahn Jeong-Geun (ÏïàÏ†ïÍ∑º; ÂÆâÂÆöÊ†π) and Ahn Gong-Geun (ÏïàÍ≥µÍ∑º; ÂÆâÊÅ≠Ê†π), as well as An's cousin Ahn Gyeong- Geun (ÏïàÍ≤ΩÍ∑º; ÂÆâÊï¨Ê†π) and nephew Ahn Woo-Saeng (ÏïàÏö∞ÏÉù; ÂÆâÂÅ∂Áîü), joined the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai, China, which led by Kim Gu, and fought against Japan. Ahn Chun-Saeng (ÏïàÏ∂òÏÉù; ÂÆâÊò•Áîü), another nephew of An's, joined the National Revolutionary Army of China, participated in battles against Japanese forces at Shanghai, and joined the Korean Liberation Army in 1940. Later, he became a lieutenant general of the Republic of Korea Army and a member of the National Assembly of South Korea. = Pan-Asianism = An strongly believed in the union of the three great countries in East Asia, China, Korea, and Japan in order to counter and fight off the \\"White Peril\\", namely, Western countries that controlled parts of Asia, and restore East Asian independence. He followed the progress of Japan during the Russo- Japanese War and claimed that he and his compatriots were delighted at hearing of the defeat of one of the agents of the White Peril, but were disappointed that the war ended before Russia was totally subjugated. An felt that with the death of It≈ç, Japan and Korea could become friends because of the many traditions that they shared. He hoped that this friendship, along with China, would become a model for the world to follow. His thoughts on Pan-Asianism were stated in his essay, \\"On Peace in East Asia\\" (Êù±Ê¥ãÂπ≥ÂíåË´ñ; ÎèôÏñëÌèâÌôîÎ°†) that he worked on and left unfinished before his execution.ÏïàÏ§ëÍ∑º ÏùòÏÇ¨Ïùò <ÎèôÏñëÌèâÌôîÎ°†> In this work, An recommends the organization of combined armed forces and the issue of joint banknotes among Korea, Japan, and China. Sasagawa Norikatsu (Á¨πÂ∑ùÁ¥ÄÂãù), a Professor of Law at Meiji University, highly praises An's idea as an equivalent of the European Union and a concept that preceded the concept of United Nations by 10 years. 2010 Segye Ilbo article = Calligraphic works = An is highly renowned for calligraphy works. While he was in prison, many prison guards such as Chiba Toshichi (ÂçÉËëâÂçÅ‰∏É) who respected him, made requests to An for calligraphy works. He left many calligraphy works which were written in the jail of Lushun although he hadn't studied calligraphy formally. He would leave on his calligraphy works a signature of \\"Â§ßÈüìÂúã‰∫∫\\" (Great Korean) and a handprint of his left hand that was missing the last joint of the ring finger, which he had cut off with his comrades in 1909 as a pledge to kill It≈ç. Some of the works were designated as Treasure No. 569 of the Republic of Korea in 1972.An Jung Geun calligraphy, Treasure No. 569 One of his famous works is \\"‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏çËÆÄÊõ∏Âè£‰∏≠ÁîüËçäÊ£ò\\" (ÏùºÏùºÎ∂ÄÎèÖÏÑú Íµ¨Ï§ëÏÉùÌòïÍ∑π; Unless one reads every day, thorns grow in the mouth), a quote from the Analects of Confucius. =Memorial Halls= Memorial halls for An were erected in Seoul in 1970 by the South Korean government and in Harbin by the Chinese government in 2006. 2009 Asian Business Article South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised the idea of erecting a monument for An while meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. Thus another memorial hall honoring An Jung-Geun was opened on Sunday, 19 January 2014 in Harbin. The hall, a 200-square meter room, features photos and memorabilia. Annual activities in memorial of An are held in L√ºshun, where he was imprisoned and executed. According to local sources in China dated on 22 March 2017, the Ahn Jung-geun Memorial Hall located at Harbin Railway Station was recently relocated to a Korean art museum in Harbin City amid China's retaliation over South Korea's deployment of the U.S. THAAD antimissile system. The Memorial Hall has since been reopened in the Harbin Railway Station after renovation work.  Controversies  Historically, the Japanese government has generally deemed An Jung-geun as a terrorist and criminal, while South Korea has upheld An as a national hero. In January 2014, Yoshihide Suga, a Japanese government spokesman, described the Harbin memorial hall honoring An in China as \\"not conducive to building peace and stability\\" between East Asian countries. China, on the other hand has declared that Ahn was a \\"famous anti-Japanese high-minded person\\" while South Korea's foreign ministry stated An was a \\"highly respected figure.\\" In February 2017, South Korean police were criticized for using a picture of An in posters put up in the city of Incheon. The poster warned of terrorism, and many South Korean citizens online criticized the police, asking \\"if it was meant to imply if An was a terrorist\\". A police officer in the Korea Times apologized and clarified that there was no intention to associate An with terrorism, and all posters were taken down. In popular culture The North Korean film An Jung Gun Shoots It≈ç Hirobumi is a dramatized story of the event.DVD in North Korea Books The South Korean film Thomas An Jung-geun (ÌÜ†ÎßàÏä§ ÏïàÏ§ëÍ∑º) is another dramatized story of the event.

Biography  Head was an officer in the corps of Royal Engineers of the British Army from 1811 to 1825; as such he earned a Waterloo Medal. Afterwards, he attempted to set up a mining company in Argentina. He married Julia Valenza Somerville in 1816, and they eventually had four children. Head was born to parents James Roper Mendes Head and Frances Anne Burgess. He was descended from the Spanish Jew Fernando Mendes, who accompanied as her personal physician Catherine of Braganza in 1662 when she came to England to marry Charles II. His grandfather Moses Mendes married Anna Gabriella Head and took on the Head name following the death of his wife's father. Sir Francis Bond Head in 1873, aged 80. In 1834, Head was appointed as an assistant Poor Law Commissioner in Kent. While serving in this capacity, he drew up a document called Plan of a Rural Workhouse for 500 Persons, which established separate areas for males and females but mingled sick and well, young and old, sane and insane. He argued that provisions for the poor should not be superior to those earned by the independent labourer. The rooms, for example, were to hold eight residents in a 15‚Äô x 10‚Äô space, and the diet was to be strictly for subsistence, resulting in the kind of gruel portrayed in the workhouse scenes of Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens. Head was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada in 1835 in an attempt by the British government to appease the reformers in the colony, such as William Lyon Mackenzie, who wanted responsible government. He appointed reformer Robert Baldwin to the Executive Council, but that appointment was opposed by the more radical Mackenzie. In any case, he ignored Baldwin's advice, and Baldwin resigned; the Legislative Assembly of the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada then refused to pass any money bills and so Head dissolved the government. In the subsequent election campaign, he appealed to the United Empire Loyalists of the colony, proclaiming that the reformers were advocating American republicanism. The Conservative party, led by the wealthy landowners known as the \\"Family Compact\\", won the election to the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada. In December 1837, Mackenzie led a brief and bungled rebellion in Toronto. Sir Francis Bond Head later boasted that despite the evidence that poured in from every district in the province, he allowed Mackenzie to prepare a revolt. He further claimed that he encouraged the outbreak by sending all the troops from the province, laying a trap for Mackenzie, despite there being no troops, and the York Militia had been preparing for an attack. Head sent the colonial militia to put down the rebellion, which they did within four days. In response to the rebellion, Britain replaced Head as Lieutenant-Governor with Sir George Arthur and then Lord Durham. Head returned to England and settled down to write books and essays. In later life Head lived at Duppas Hall, overlooking Duppas Hill in Croydon, where he organised protests against the proposed outlawing of horse-riding in the area. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1867. Legacy Several places in Ontario are named for Sir Francis Bond Head: *An unincorporated area northwest of Toronto in the town of Bradford West Gwillimbury, Simcoe County *A cape on Lake Ontario in the municipality of Clarington, Regional Municipality of Durham, to the east of Toronto, which gives its name to a neighbourhood and local park west of the cape and east of the Port of Newcastle harbour. *Three streets in the town of Oakville, Ontario named Francis, Bond, and Head. (Only Bond and Head remain.) *Two streets in the city of St. Catharines, Ontario named 'Bond' and 'Head'. Though both streets are short, they intersect. *The community of Frankford, on the Trent River, was named after Head after he crossed the river there while travelling.

A sapper, also called pioneer or combat engineer, is a combatant or soldier who performs a variety of military engineering duties such as breaching fortifications, demolitions, bridge-building, laying or clearing minefields, preparing field defenses, as well as working on road and airfield construction and repair. They are also trained to serve as infantry personnel in defensive and offensive operations. A sapper's duties are devoted to tasks involving facilitating movement, defence and survival of allied forces and impeding those of enemies. The term \\"sapper\\" is used in the British Army and Commonwealth nations, the Polish Army and the U.S. military. The word \\"sapper\\" comes from the French word sapeur, itself being derived from the verb saper (to undermine, to dig under a wall or building to cause its collapse). Historical origin = Sapping = Soldiers of No 2 Field Company, Bombay Sappers and Miners on duty in China in 1900. The mule carries the tools required for field engineering tasks. A sapper, in the sense first used by the French military, was one who dug trenches to allow besieging forces to advance towards the enemy defensive works and forts, over ground that is under the defenders' musket or artillery fire. This digging was referred to as sapping the enemy fortifications. Saps were excavated by brigades of trained sappers or instructed troops. When an army was defending a fortress with cannons, they had an obvious height and therefore range advantage over the attacker's guns. The attacking army's artillery had to be brought forward, under fire, so as to facilitate effective counter-battery fire. This was achieved by digging what the French termed a sappe (derived from the archaic French word for spade or entrenching tool). Using techniques developed and perfected by Vauban, the sappers began the trench at such an angle so as to avoid enemy fire enfilading the sappe by firing down its length. As they pressed forward, a position was prepared from which a cannon could suppress the defenders on the fort's bastions. The sappers would then change the course of their trench, zig- zagging toward the fortress wall. Each leg brought the attacker's artillery closer until the besieged cannon would be sufficiently suppressed for the attackers to breach the walls. Broadly speaking, sappers were originally experts at demolishing or otherwise overcoming or bypassing fortification systems. = Miner = Ghazni which fell as a result of mining by a mixed contingent of the Bombay and Bengal Sappers during the First Afghan War on 23 July 1839. An additional term applied to sappers of the British Indian Army was \\"miner\\". The native engineer corps were called \\"sappers and miners\\", as for example, the Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners. The term arose from a task done by sappers to further the battle after saps were dug. The saps permitted cannon to be brought into firing range of the besieged fort and its cannon, but often the cannon themselves were unable to breach the fort walls. The engineers would dig a tunnel from the forward-most sap up to and under the fort wall, then place a charge of gunpowder and ignite it, causing a tremendous explosion that would destroy the wall and permit attacking infantry to close with the enemy. This was dangerous work, often lethal to the sappers, and was fiercely resisted by the besieged enemy. Since the two tasks went hand in hand and were done by the same troops, native Indian engineer corps came to be called \\"sappers and miners\\".  Specific usage  = Commonwealth of Nations = Sapper (abbreviated Spr) is the Royal Engineers' equivalent of private. This is also the case within the Indian Army Corps of Engineers, Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers , Royal Canadian Engineers, Royal Australian Engineers,Jobson 2009, p. 96. South African Army Engineer Formation, Jamaica Defence Force Engineer Regiment, and Royal New Zealand Engineers. The term \\"sapper\\" was introduced in 1856 when the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners was amalgamated with the officer corps of the Royal Engineers to form the Corps of Royal Engineers. During the course of the First World War, some Royal Marines also took the rank of Sapper, this was usually found as part of the Royal Marine Divisional Engineers of the Royal Naval Division. = Australia = Jisr Benat Yakub repaired (September 1918) During the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I Australian sappers repaired a bridge at the historic crossing of the Jordan River at Jisr Benat Yakub (also known as Jacob's Ford). Here the retreating Ottoman and German rearguard had blown up the bridge's central arch which was repaired in five hours by sappers attached to the Australian Mounted Division. While the light horse brigades forded the river, continuing the Desert Mounted Corps' advance to Damascus, the sappers worked through the night of 27/28 September 1918, to repair the bridge to enable the division's wheeled vehicles and guns to follow on 28 September.Preston pp. 261‚Äì2Carver 2003 p. 242Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 568 =Canada= In the Canadian Forces, sappers exist both in the regular force and reserve force. The rank of sapper is used instead of private trained to signify completion of the Engineer DP1 course. Canadian sappers have been deployed in many major conflicts in recent history including World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the War in Afghanistan. The roles of a sapper entail: Bridge building with the ACROW, Bailey, or Medium Girder Bridge bridging systems; explosive ordnance disposal; operating the advanced reverse-osmosis water purification unit, used mainly in domestic operations; maintaining roadways and airfields; combat diving; tactical breaching; and erecting and tearing down friendly living spaces. Ultimately, the objective of the sappers is to facilitate the living, moving, and fighting for friendly troops on the battlefield, and denying the same to enemy forces. The motto of the Canadian Military Engineers is Ubique () a motto shared with the Royal Canadian Artillery. The patron saint of combat engineers is Saint Barbara, and 4 December is the corps' day of celebration. = Indian Army = The term \\"sappers\\", in addition to the connotation of rank of engineer private, is used collectively to informally refer to the Engineer Corps as a whole and also forms part of the informal names of the three combat engineer groups, viz. Madras Sappers, Bengal Sappers and the Bombay Sappers. Each of these groups consist of about twenty battalion-sized engineer regiments and additional company-sized minor engineer units. The three sapper groups are descended from the sapper and miner groups of the East India Company and later the British Indian Army of the British Raj. = Israel = In the Israel Defense Forces a sapper (in Hebrew: ◊§◊ú◊°, palas) is the military profession of a combat soldier who went through basic combat engineering training. Most of the sappers are soldiers of the Combat Engineering Corps, but there are also infantry sappers, who are part of the infantry brigades and are organized in engineering companies called ◊§◊ú◊ó◊î\\"◊ü (palchan). These companies are integral part of the infantry brigades. Combat engineering corps sappers are arranged in battalions. Each sapper goes through high level infantry training, which qualifies him as rifleman 06 (◊®◊ï◊ë◊ê◊ô 06). Combat engineering sappers are qualified as \\"sapper 06\\" (◊§◊ú◊° 06). They are skilled in infantry combat, basic sabotage, landmine planting and demining, use of explosives, breaching and opening routes, trench warfare, and operating the IDF Puma combat engineering vehicle. Combat engineering commanders are qualified as \\"sapper 08\\" while combat engineering officers are qualified as \\"sapper 11\\". Both go through additional advance training to gain the skills needed for high level sapper profession. The Israel Police also maintains a bomb disposal specialist unit. All police sappers must graduate from a 10-month training program at the bomb disposal training center in Beit Shemesh, which includes operational exercises, theoretical studies, and fieldwork. = France = Insignia of the military sappers In France, sapper (sapeur) is the title of military combat engineers and firefighters, both civil and military, (sapper-fireman or sapeur-pompier). Military sappers fall under the umbrella of the Engineering Arm or Arme du G√©nie. A related title is pioneer (pionnier), used only in the French Foreign Legion. * Sapper : title of combat engineers in most Engineer Regiments (3rd, 13th, 19th and 31st), except in the French Foreign Legion (1st Foreign Engineer Regiment and 2nd Foreign Engineer Regiment) * Air Sapper (sapeur de l'air) : title of the privates of the 25th Air Engineering Regiment, an Army regiment seconded to the Air Force. * Parachute Sapper (sapeur parachutiste) : title of the privates of the 17th Parachute Engineer Regiment, the combat engineering unit of the 11th Parachute Brigade * Marine Sapper (sapeur de marine) : since 2006, title of the privates of the 6th Engineer Regiment, the combat engineering unit of the 9th Light Armoured Marine Brigade. * Sapper firefighter (sapeur- pompier) : title of the firefighters in the civilian fire services and the Paris Fire Brigade. * Sapper-miner (sapeur-mineur) : since World War Two, combat engineers specialized in demining. History French Imperial Guard sappers, 1810 The French Corps of Engineers was created under the command of Marshall Vauban during the late 17th century. Its members were called sappers if their function was to destroy enemy fortifications by using trenches or sape and miners if they engaged in tunnel warfare or mine. The Corps of the Engineers was suppressed during two short periods (1720-1729 and 1769-1793) and sappers and miners were part of the Artillery regiments. In 1793, the Corps was reorganized into companies of miners and battalions of sappers, each assigned to a particular division. Eventually, as the missions of the Corps grew more diversified, additional titles were used by combat engineers, such as Conductor (sapeur-conducteur) in 1810, entrusted with the logistics of the Corps, Firefighter (sapeur-pompier) in 1810 or telegraph sapper (sapeur-t√©l√©graphiste). In 1814, the companies of miners were integrated into the sapper battalions, themselves organized in Engineers Regiments (r√©giments du g√©nie). In 1875, the distinction between miners and sappers was abolished and all members of the Corps of Engineers were titled sappers-miners, though only sapper was used in common usage. In 1894, the pontonniers or bridgemakers were transferred from the Artillery Corps to the Engineers, thus creating the title sapeurs-pontonniers. In 1909, the Engineering Arm of the Army Staff was entrusted the burgeoning Air Service (A√©rostation militaire), its personal was titled sapper-airman (sapeur- a√©rostier). The titled was disused in 1914 when the Air Service took its independence from the Engineering Arm. Firefighters Sapeurs-pompiers de Paris (Paris Fire Brigade) on parade The first fire company created by Napol√©on I was a military sapper company of the French Imperial Guard, created in 1810. This company was tasked with the protection of the Imperial palaces after the tragic fire of the Austrian embassy in Paris on July 1, 1810. The Paris Fire Service (gardes-pompes), a civilian institution, was re-organized as a military unit in September 1811, becoming the Paris Sappers-Firefighters Battalion. Other cities kept or created civilian firefighters services but used the military ranks and organization of the Paris Battalion. In 1831, National Guard engineers companies became the reserve components of the Fire Services and kept their military organization even after the disappearance of the National Guard in 1852. Sapper-firefighter is the common title of the civilian and Paris firefighters in France, but the other military firefighters units, such as the Marseille Naval Fire Battalion, do not use the sapper title, as they had no military engineers lineage. Pioneers Since the 18th century, every grenadier battalion in the French Army had a small unit of pioneers, sometimes called sappers-pioneers (sapeurs-pionniers). They had the mission to advance under enemy fire in order to destroy the obstacles drawn by the enemy and to clear the way for the rest of the infantry. The danger of such missions resulted in pioneers having short life expectancies. Because of this, the army allowed them certain privileges such as the authorization to wear beards. In addition to their beards and axes, they traditionally wear leather aprons and gloves. The pioneers units disappeared during the mid-20th c. century, their last appearance being the short-lived Pioneers Regiments of 1939‚Äì1944, a military public works service using the older draftees in the army. Only the Foreign Legion kept using a pioneer unit, mainly for representation duty. The current pioneer unit of the Legion reintroduced the symbols of the Napoleonic pioneers : the beard, the axe, the leather apron, the crossed-axes insignia and the leather gloves. If the parades of the Legion are opened by this unit, it is to commemorate the traditional role of the pioneers \\"opening the way\\" for the troops. The pioneer unit is made up for parades of selected men taken in both the Infantry and the Engineers regiments of the Legion. = Greece = In the Hellenic Army, there is the \\"mechanic\\" or \\"Corps of Engineers\\" (ŒºŒ∑œáŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå; michaniko). =Italy= The Italian Army uses the term \\"Guastatori\\" for its combat engineers, \\"Pionieri\\" for its construction engineers, \\"Pontieri\\" for its bridging engineers, and \\"Ferrovieri\\" for its railroad engineers. *2nd Alpine Engineer Regiment *32nd Alpine Engineer Regiment *8th Parachute Assault Engineer Regiment = Portugal = In Portugal, the term \\"sapper\\" is used both in the military and in the civilian environment. In the Portuguese Army, a sapador de engenharia (engineering sapper) is a soldier of the engineer branch that has specialized combat engineer training. A sapador de infantaria (infantry sapper) is a soldier of the infantry branch that has a similar training and who usually serves in the combat support sapper platoon of an infantry battalion. A sapador NBQ (NBC sapper) is an engineer branch soldier specialized in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare. The bombeiros-sapadores (\\"sapper- firefighters\\") are the civil municipal professional firefighters that exist in the main cities of the country. The largest unit of this type is the Regimento de Bombeiros Sapadores (\\"sapper-firefighters regiment\\") maintained by the Lisbon municipal council. The sapadores florestais (forest sappers) are the professionals maintained by the government, local authorities and large private forestry companies, who cleans and maintain forests and prevents and fights forest fires. =Pakistan Army= In the Pakistan Army, sapper officers perform combat and normal engineer duties. The Corps is led by the Engineer- in-Chief who is a Lt Gen. The current Engineer-in-Chief is Lt Gen Khalid Asghar. The Frontier Works Organization, Military Engineering Service and the Survey of Pakistan is part of the corps. Initially part of the Indian Corps of Engineers, it dates back to 1780 but came to its modern form in 1947 following the Independence of Pakistan. Since then it has taken part in all wars including 1965 War, 1971 War and Kargil War. It has completed the Pakistan portion of Karakoram Highway. The corps is taking part in Operation Zarb-e-Azb = United States Army = US combat engineer setting a charge in World War II In the United States Army, sappers are combat engineers who support the front- line infantry, and they have fought in every war in U.S. history. For example, after the Battle of Yorktown, General Washington cited Louis Leb√®gue Duportail, the chief of engineers, for conduct that afforded \\"brilliant proofs of his military genius.\\" Modern-day designation as a sapper is earned as an additional proficiency. The U.S. Army authorizes four skill tabsAR 670-1: Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia U.S. Army, revised: 11 May 2012. for permanent wear above the unit patch on the left shoulder (Army Regulation 670-1 Chapter 29‚Äì13, Sub-Paragraph f). Along with the Sapper Tab, the Special Forces Tab, Ranger Tab, and President's Hundred Tab identify soldiers who have passed a demanding course of military instruction and have demonstrated their competence in particular specialties and skills. To wear the Sapper Tab, a soldier must graduate from the Sapper Leader Course, which is operated by the U.S. Army Engineer School at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. The Sapper Leader Course is a demanding 28-day leadership development course for combat engineers that reinforces critical skills and teaches advanced techniques needed across the army. This course is also designed to build esprit de corps by training soldiers in troop-leading procedures, demolitions (conventional and expedient), and mountaineering operations. The course culminates in an intense field-training exercise that reinforces the use of the battle drills and specialized engineering techniques learned throughout the course. The course is open to enlisted soldiers in the grades of E-4 (P) (in the army, specialists on the list for promotion to sergeant) through E-7, cadets, and officers O-2 (first lieutenant ) and below. The course is primarily for U.S. Army and USMC combat engineers, but may be attended by all service members with an approved waiver. = PAVN and Viet Cong = Sapper formation- PAVN/Viet Cong PAVN (People's Army of Vietnam) and Viet Cong sappers, as they were called by US forces, are better described as commando units. The Vietnamese term ƒë·∫∑c c√¥ng can be literally translated as \\"special task\\". Thousands of specially trained elite fighters served in the PAVN and Viet Cong commando‚Äìsapper units which were organized as independent formations. While not always successful due to lack of appropriate personal weapon types for combat and assault like other special forces, at times they inflicted heavy damage against their enemies. They have been armed with various types of bombs, mines, explosive charges, grenades and even steel-pellet mines which were much more devastating than the U.S. M18 Claymore and are still the main weapons of the ƒë·∫∑c c√¥ng. These elite units served as raiders against American/ARVN troops, and infiltrated spearheads during the final Ho Chi Minh Campaign in 1975, where they seized key road and bridge assets, destroyed installations, attacked command and control nodes located deep inside enemy territory, planted explosives on U.S. water craft, and otherwise helped the PAVN's rapid mobile forces advance. A typical PAVN/VC ƒë·∫∑c c√¥ng organization is shown in the diagram. The raiding force was usually grouped into assault teams, each broken down into several 3‚Äì5 man assault cells. Overall, there were generally four operational echelons.Ott 1975, pp.1‚Äì42. An instance of a successful sapper attack conducted by the Viet Cong was the during the Battle of Fire Base Mary Ann. A small number of sappers, through surprise, conducted a successful attack on a superior US force. The battle was described as a \\"rampage of VC who threw satchels at the command bunker, knifed Americans in their sleep and destroyed all communications equipment. = Ottoman Empire = The Ottoman Empire had an infantry corp named Laƒüƒ±mcƒ±lar Ocaƒüƒ± (Tr:) (literally: Sapper Corps). These infantries were used in most of the Empire's sieges, demolishing enemy fortifications and defences.  Honors  Sapper Island, St. Joseph Channel, Algoma District, Ontario was named in honour of sappers, especially those who graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada.Ontario History, Papers and Records, Vol. X, Ontario Historical Society, 1913. Retrieved 28 October 2010. In fiction In the 1978 song by Australian rock band Cold Chisel, \\"Khe Sanh\\", the narrator (a fictional Australian army Vietnam War veteran) says \\"I left my heart to the sappers round Khe Sanh\\". However, the only sappers or combat engineers present at the historical Battle of Khe Sanh belonged to US, South Vietnamese and (opposing) North Vietnamese units. In the 2008 science-fiction novel The Last Colony, a fictitious \\"sapper field\\" technology is used to disrupt enemy weapons operation.  In popular culture  Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"Sappers\\" (1896)http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_sappers.htm detailed some of the duties of Sappers in the British Army of Victorian times.

Hanns Eisler (6 July 1898 - 6 September 1962) was an Austrian composer (his father was Austrian, and Eisler fought in a Hungarian regiment in World War I). He is best known for composing the national anthem of East Germany, for his long artistic association with Bertolt Brecht, and for the scores he wrote for films. The Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" is named after him. Family background Johannes Eisler was born in Leipzig in Saxony, the son of Rudolf Eisler, a professor of philosophy, and Marie Ida Fischer. His father was Jewish and his mother was Lutheran. In 1901, the family moved to Vienna. His brother, Gerhart, was a Communist journalist, and his sister, Elfriede, was a leader of the German Communist Party in the mid-1920s. After emigrating to America, she turned into an anti-communist, writing books against her former political affiliation, and even testifying against her brothers before the House Un-American Activities Committee. At age 14 Eisler joined a socialist youth group. Early years and Bertolt Brecht Eisler in uniform, 1917. During the Great War, Hanns Eisler served as a front- line soldier in the Austro-Hungarian army and was wounded several times in combat. Returning to Vienna after Austria's defeat, he studied from 1919 to 1923 under Arnold Schoenberg. Eisler was the first of Schoenberg's disciples to compose in the twelve-tone or serial technique. He married Charlotte Demant in 1920; they separated in 1934. In 1925, he moved to Berlin--then a hothouse of experimentation in music, theater, film, art and politics. There he became an active supporter of the Communist Party of Germany and became involved with the November Group. In 1928, he taught at the Marxist Workers' School in Berlin and his son Georg Eisler, who would grow up to become an important painter, was born. His music became increasingly oriented towards political themes and, to Schoenberg's dismay, more \\"popular\\" in style with influences drawn from jazz and cabaret. At the same time, he drew close to Bertolt Brecht, whose own turn towards Marxism happened at about the same time. The collaboration between the two artists lasted for the rest of Brecht's life.Albrecht Betz. Hanns Eisler: Political Musician (1982, Cambridge University Press), p. 230. In 1929, Eisler composed the song cycle Zeitungsausschnitte, Op. 11. The work is dedicated to Margot Hinnenberg- Lefebre.Eisler, Hanns. Zeitungsausschnitte. Hackensack, NJ: Boonin, 1972. Though not written in the twelve-tone technique, it was perhaps the forerunner of a musical art style later known as \\"News Items\\" (or perhaps better characterized as \\"news clippings\\") ‚Äì musical compositions that parodied a newspaper's content and style, or that included lyrics lifted directly from newspapers, leaflets, magazines or other written media of the day. The cycle parodies a newspaper's layout and content, with the songs comprising it given titles similar to headlines. Its content reflects Eisler's socialist leanings, with lyrics memorializing the struggles of ordinary Germans subject to post‚ÄìWorld War I hardships.Thomas, H. Todd. News Items: An Exploratory Study of Journalism in Music. Abilene, Texas: 1992. Eisler wrote music for several Brecht plays, including The Decision (Die Ma√ünahme) (1930), The Mother (1932) and Schweik in the Second World War (1957). They also collaborated on protest songs that celebrated, and contributed to, the political turmoil of Weimar Germany in the early 1930s. Their Solidarity Song became a popular militant anthem sung in street protests and public meetings throughout Europe, and their Ballad of Paragraph 218 was the world's first song protesting laws against abortion. Brecht-Eisler songs of this period tended to look at life from \\"below\\"--from the perspective of prostitutes, hustlers, the unemployed and the working poor. In 1931‚Äì32 he collaborated with Brecht and director Slatan Dudow on the working-class film Kuhle Wampe.Albrecht Betz. Hanns Eisler: Political Musician (1982, Cambridge University Press), pp. 104‚Äì106. In exile After 1933, Eisler's music and Brecht's poetry were banned by the Nazi Party. Both artists went into exile. While Brecht settled in Svendborg, Denmark, Eisler traveled for a number of years, working in Prague, Vienna, Paris, London, Moscow, Spain, Mexico and Denmark. He made two visits to the US, with speaking tours from coast to coast. In 1938, Eisler finally managed to emigrate to the United States with a permanent visa. In New York City, he taught composition at New School for Social Research and wrote experimental chamber and documentary music. In 1942, he moved to Los Angeles where he joined Brecht, who had arrived in California in 1941 after a long trip eastward from Denmark across the Soviet Union and the Pacific Ocean. In the U.S., Eisler composed music for various documentary films and for eight Hollywood film scores, two of which -- Hangmen Also Die! and None but the Lonely Heart -- were nominated for Oscars in 1944 and 1945 respectively. Also working on Hangmen Also Die! was Bertolt Brecht, who wrote the story along with director Fritz Lang. From 1927 to the end of his life, Eisler wrote the music for 40 films, making film music the largest part of his compositions after vocal music for chorus and/or solo voices. On 1 February 1940, he began work on the \\"Research Program on the Relation between Music and Films\\" funded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, which he got with the help of film director Joseph Losey and The New School. This work resulted in the book Composing for the Films which was published in 1947, with Theodor W. Adorno as co-author. In several chamber and choral compositions of this period, Eisler returned to the twelve-tone method he had abandoned in Berlin. His Fourteen Ways of Describing the Rain -- composed for Arnold Schoenberg's 70th birthday celebration -- is considered a masterpiece of the genre. Eisler's works of the 1930s and 1940s included Deutsche Sinfonie (1935‚Äì57)--a choral symphony in eleven movements based on poems by Brecht and Ignazio Silone--and a cycle of art songs published as the Hollywood Songbook (1938‚Äì43). With lyrics by Brecht, Eduard M√∂rike, Friedrich H√∂lderlin and Goethe, it established Eisler's reputation as one of the 20th century's great composers of German lieder. The HUAC investigation Eisler's promising career in the U.S. was interrupted by the Cold War. He was one of the first artists placed on the Hollywood blacklist by the film studio bosses. In two interrogations by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the composer was accused of being \\"the Karl Marx of music\\" and the chief Soviet agent in Hollywood. Among his accusers was his sister Ruth Fischer, who also testified before the Committee that her other brother, Gerhart, was a Communist agent. The Communist press denounced her as a \\"German Trotskyite.\\" Among the works that Eisler composed for the Communist Party was the \\"Comintern March\\", including the words \\"The Comintern calls you / Raise high the Soviet banner / In steeled ranks to battle / Raise sickle and hammer.\\" =His supporters= Eisler's supporters-- including his friend Charlie Chaplin and the composers Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein--organized benefit concerts to raise money for his defense fund, but he was deported early in 1948. Folksinger Woody Guthrie protested the composer's deportation in his lyrics for \\"Eisler on the Go\\"-- recorded fifty years later by Billy Bragg and Wilco on the Mermaid Avenue album (1998). In the song, an introspective Guthrie asked himself what he would do if called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities: \\"I don't know what I'll do / I don't know what I'll do / Eisler's on the come and go / and I don't know what I'll do.\\" =On departing from the U.S.= On 26 March 1948, Eisler and his wife, Lou, departed from LaGuardia Airport and flew to Prague. Before he left, he read the following statement: > I leave this country not without bitterness and infuriation. I could well > understand it when in 1933 the Hitler bandits put a price on my head and > drove me out. They were the evil of the period; I was proud at being driven > out. But I feel heartbroken over being driven out of this beautiful country > in this ridiculous way.http://eislermusic.com/depart.htm In East Germany Eisler returned to Austria, and later moved to East Berlin. In East Germany, he composed the national anthem of the German Democratic Republic, a cycle of cabaret-style songs to satirical poems by Kurt Tucholsky and incidental music for theater, films, television and party celebrations. His most ambitious project of the period was the opera Johannes Faustus on the Faust theme. The libretto, written by Eisler himself, was published in the fall of 1952. It portrayed Faust as an indecisive man who betrayed the cause of the working class by not joining the German Peasants' War. In May 1953, Eisler's libretto was attacked by a major article in Neues Deutschland, the SED organ, which disapproved of the negative depiction of Faust as a renegade and accused the work of being \\"a slap in the face of German national feeling\\" and of having \\"formalistically deformed one of the greatest works of our German poet Goethe\\" (Ulbricht). Eisler's opera project was discussed in three of the bi-weekly meetings \\"Mittwochsgesellschaft\\" [Wednesday club] of a circle of intellectuals under the auspices of the Berlin Academy of Arts beginning on 13 May 1953. The last of these meetings took place on Wednesday, 10 June 1953. graves of honor maintained by the authorities. A week later, the workers' rebellion of 17 June 1953 pushed those debates from the agenda. Eisler fell into a depressive mood, and did not write the music for the opera. In his last work, \\"Ernste Ges√§nge\\" (Serious Songs), written between spring 1961 and August 1962, Eisler attempted to work through his depression, taking up the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with its demise of the Stalin cult, as a sign of hope for a future enabling to \\"live without fear\\". Although he continued to work as a composer and to teach at the East Berlin conservatory, the gap between Eisler and the cultural functionaries of East Germany grew wider in the last decade of his life. During this period, he befriended musician Wolf Biermann and tried to promote him (but in 1976, Biermann would be stripped of his GDR citizenship while on concert tour in West Germany). Eisler collaborated with Brecht until the latter's death in 1956. He never recovered completely from his friend's demise, and his remaining years were marred by depression and declining health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in East Berlin in September 1962, and is buried near Brecht in the Dorotheenstadt cemetery.

He is best known as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Judas Priest, which was formed in 1969 and has received accolades such as the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. He has been noted for his powerful, wide-ranging voice and trademark leather-and-studs image, both of which have become iconic in heavy metal.Daniel Bukszpan (2003). \\"The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal\\" He has also been involved with several side projects, including Fight, Two, and Halford. AllMusic said of Halford, \\"There have been few vocalists in the history of heavy metal whose singing style has been as influential and instantly recognizable... able to effortlessly alternate between a throaty growl and an ear-splitting falsetto.\\" He was ranked at No. 33 on the list of greatest voices in rock by Planet Rock listeners in 2009. He has also been nicknamed \\"Metal God\\" by fans. Career =Early years= Robert John Arthur Halford was born on 25 August 1951 in Sutton Coldfield. He grew up in nearby Walsall, where he was raised on the Beechdale housing estate.Bernard Perusse. Q&A; with Rob Halford . Montreal Gazette, 1 August 2007. His early influences included Little Richard, Janis Joplin, and Robert Plant. =Judas Priest= Halford in 1984 Halford performing with Judas Priest in 2005 Halford was introduced to Judas Priest bassist and co-founder Ian Hill by his sister Sue, who was dating Hill at the time. Halford, a manager of a porn cinema, joined the band as singer, bringing with him drummer John Hinch from his previous band Hiroshima. Halford and Hinch played their first show with Judas Priest in May 1973 at the Townhouse in Wellington. The show was recorded and part of it released in 2019 on the compilation \\"Downer-Rock Asylum\\" on the Audio Archives label. In 1974, he made his recording debut on the band's first album Rocka Rolla. He continued to front Judas Priest throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1990, Halford emerged with all-new tattoos, including a bent Judas Priest cross on his right arm and ring around his other, as well as a few on his shoulders. He also began shaving his head. On the last date of the tour for Painkiller in August 1991 at a show in Toronto, Halford rode onstage on a large Harley-Davidson motorcycle, dressed in motorcycle leathers, as part of the show. The motorcycle malfunctioned and he collided with a half-raised drum riser and fell off of it, breaking his nose in the process. He was left unconscious for a short time while the band was performing the first song. After regaining consciousness, Halford returned and finished the show. He then announced his departure from Judas Priest, and also sued their label, Sony, for restrictive practices. Halford left the band in May 1992. =Fight= Shortly after Halford's departure, he formed the band Fight with Judas Priest drummer Scott Travis, bassist Jack \\"Jay Jay\\" Brown and guitarists Brian Tilse and Russ Parrish. The first album War of Words was released in 1993, followed by the Mutations EP in 1994. A tour took place in support of the album in 1994. The second album A Small Deadly Space was released in 1995, with a tour taking place in support of that album as well. While War of Words was a straightforward, tough and solid metal record, A Small Deadly Space had a grungier sound, making it less appealing to fans who had developed a taste for War of Words. As the band were preparing to being work on the third album, they split-up, thus ending their business with their label Epic Records. A brief reunion with half of the original members took place on 20 December 1997 for a one-off performance before disbanding once again. In a 2015 interview, Halford contemplated Fight's reformation. =2wo= In 1997, Halford collaborated with guitarist John Lowery to form an industrial-influenced project called 2wo. They released their only album Voyeurs in 1998, which was released on Trent Reznor's Nothing Records label. =Halford= In 1999, Halford returned to his metal roots and formed a solo band. The album Resurrection was released in 2000 to critical acclaim. The band embarked on a tour with Iron Maiden and Queensr√øche to support the album. A live album titled Live Insurrrection was released in 2001. It was followed up by the second album Crucible in 2002. In 2010, Halford released a live DVD titled Live in Anaheim and the third studio album Halford IV: Made of Metal. =Reunion with Judas Priest= Halford performing in 2014 Halford's reunion with Judas Priest came about from years of speculation about when he was no longer in the line-up, at least since the release of the Resurrection album, which some critics claimed sounded more like Judas Priest than the band's previous album Jugulator (1997). Halford initially ruled it out, but then reconsidered, stating in 2002 that \\"Gut instinct tells me that at some point it will happen\\".Hoaksey, Mark: \\"Interview with Rob Halford\\", Power Play Issue 35, July 2002. In July 2003, Halford returned to Judas Priest and embarked on a tour in 2004 in celebration of his return. The band released Angel of Retribution in 2005. A world tour accompanied the release and marked the band's 30th anniversary. In 2008, Nostradamus was released. In 2011, Judas Priest embarked upon what was billed as their final world tour as a group, titled the \\"Epitaph\\" tour. Subsequent to the tour's announcement, Halford stated that he would continue to move forward with his solo band. Despite the \\"final tour\\" announcement in 2011, Halford and Judas Priest (minus K. K. Downing, who left the group prior to the Epitaph tour) recorded another album, Redeemer of Souls, which was released in 2014, the album supported by a concert tour. In 2017, Judas Priest began to work on another studio album with Halford. The album Firepower was released 9 March 2018. =Live appearances= Halford often rides a motorcycle onstage Halford performed as the vocalist for Black Sabbath for three shows. He replaced Ronnie James Dio for two nights in November 1992, when Dio elected not to open a show for Ozzy Osbourne. Halford also filled in for Osbourne in Black Sabbath on 26 August 2004 (one day after Halford's 53rd birthday) at an Ozzfest show in Camden, New Jersey, since Osbourne could not perform due to bronchitis. Halford joined Metallica on stage three times where they performed the song \\"Rapid Fire\\"; in 1994 on the last date of the Shit Hits the Sheds Tour, in 2011 at The Fillmore for the band's 30th anniversary celebration and in 2013 at the fifth annual Revolver Golden Gods awards in Los Angeles. Halford joined Pantera on stage twice. The first performance was in 1992 where he sang on the songs \\"Metal Gods\\" and \\"Grinder\\", and again in 1997 where he sang on \\"Grinder\\". Halford joined queercore band Pansy Division on stage in July 1997 to perform the song \\"Breaking the Law\\". Halford joined Babymetal on stage on 18 July 2016 at the Alternative Press Music Awards in Cleveland where they performed a medley of \\"Painkiller\\" and \\"Breaking the Law\\". =Other activities= Halford made an appearance in the 2002 film Spun where he played a retail clerk at a sex shop. In 2006, Halford split with Sanctuary Records and founded Metal God Entertainment to produce and license any future material. All Fight and Halford material were released in remastered format, which also includes DVDs from both bands. In early 2008, Halford expressed a desire in making a black metal album, citing encouragement from former Emperor frontman Ihsahn. Halford provided voice-over for the characters General Lionwhyte and the leader of the Fire Barons on the 2009 video game Br√ºtal Legend. The Baron's appearance and personality is based on Halford. Halford developed the clothing line Metal God Apparel with plans to develop retail sales through 2010. Halford had a brief cameo in a 2010 commercial for Virgin Mobile, where he appeared as a priest. His line in the commercial is \\"Let us pray\\", which is a reference to the song \\"Let Us Prey/Call for the Priest\\" from Judas Priest's 1977 album Sin After Sin.Rob Halford in Virgin Mobile Commercial , Robhalford.com (20 July 2010). Retrieved 21 May 2011. In March 2019, Halford told New Zealand news outlet Stuff that he was working on an autobiography, the idea having been \\"rattling around in my head forever.\\" He said that his principal motivation in writing a book would be \\"to tell your side of the story from the horse's mouth, as opposed to something that has been knocked up by somebody else from a bunch of interviews and so forth.\\" Halford joked that \\"between my early childhood, adolescent years and the place where I'm at now,\\" the result would be a trilogy like The Lord of the Rings. The autobiography, titled Confess, was originally announced to be published in October 2020, but received its official date for 29 September 2020 via Hachette Books. In August 2020, Halford confirmed that he had completed an audiobook version of the publication, to be made available at the same time as the physical release. Personal life =Hobbies= As of 2014, Halford divided his time between homes in the United States and his hometown of Walsall. Halford is able to play several instruments such as guitar, bass, harmonica, keyboards, and drums, though he rarely does so on stage. In an interview with Motor Trend, Halford revealed that he has owned a variety of classic cars, including a 1970s Aston Martin DBS, a Chevrolet Corvette, and a Mercury Cougar. He did not gain his driver's licence until the age of 38.Rob Halford, Judas Priest Lead Singer First Car . Motor Trend. Retrieved 21 May 2011. In 2010, he stated that his main car was a 2006 Cadillac DTS.Rob Halford, Judas Priest Lead Singer Celebrity Drive . Motor Trend. Retrieved 21 May 2011. =Sexuality= In 1998, Halford publicly revealed his homosexuality on MTV. He broke down in tears saying, \\"It's a wonderful moment when you walk out of the closet. Now I've done that and I've freed myself. It's a great feeling for me to finally let go and make this statement‚Äîespecially to The Advocate, because this magazine has brought me so much comfort over the years. Obviously this is just a wonderful day for me.\\" Halford later explained that he did not have a plan or an agenda when coming in to do his interview with MTV. He mainly spoke about and promoted the Voyeurs album he made with ex-Marilyn Manson guitarist John 5, was when he slipped out his sexuality after being asked a question from the studio's producer. He cited it being \\"kind of a big leap forward.\\" At the time Halford revealed his sexuality, he was concerned that he would lose his fanbase as a result. He explained that he cannot return to certain places of the world in fear of lapidation. He described the 1970s and 1980s as \\"incredibly difficult\\", but not counting it as important music-wise. Halford jokingly claimed that he can not be replaced by a straight man, bringing up late Queen vocalist Freddie Mercury, saying that \\"if Freddie hadn't have been gay, Queen would've been a totally different band. But that's a really important part of my life that I have to get down on paper at some point.\\" Halford describes himself as \\"the stately homo of heavy metal\\", and said that his announcement was \\"the greatest thing I could have done for myself.\\" He also explained that he did not announce it sooner due to the fear that it was going to be troublesome for himself. Halford speaks negatively about the discrimination that the LGBT community still faces in some parts of the world. He recalled that his announcement came as a surprise, and questioned if he would've told the members of Judas Priest while he was in the band. Halford said that after he completed his interview, he began to fear negative reactions, but was quickly inundated with messages of support from his colleagues and fans. Halford says that society has not changed as much as he hoped since his announcement, \\"You'd think there would have been some kind of change and people would have moved on after such a long time. Now that I'm moving through my OAP heavy metal years (laughs), I thought a lot of it would be gone by now. And it's a shame. We don't really get to spend a lot of time on this planet together, so there's no point in wasting it being divided.\\" The subject matter of his lyrics had not changed since his coming out and avoided addressing it in Judas Priest's lyrics. However, the song \\"Raw Deal\\" from the 1977 album Sin After Sin speaks about Fire Island. He felt that the lyrics were \\"just too much\\", but was approved by the other members of the band. \\"But you listen to that song, it really is almost like a coming-out experience for me. And it never really registered. [Laughs] It's only been in recent years that people have picked up on that song. That's the one,\\" he said. In Halford's autobiography Confess, he explained that during Judas Priest's British Steel Tour with Iron Maiden in 1980, he once made an attempt to seduce vocalist Paul Di'Anno one night in his hotel room as they carried on getting drunk together, \\"but I was too pissed to try anything, and he was too pissed to even know what I wanted to try. I think that was definitely for the best.\\" =Health= In the Behind the Music documentary series, Halford said that hiding his sexuality during Judas Priest's career caused him a lot of depression and isolation which led to his alcohol and drug abuse. During the making of the band's 1986 album Turbo, Halford struggled with increasing substance abuse and violent feuds with his romantic partner. After the latter committed suicide, he resolved to get clean. He says that he has been clean and sober since entering a rehabilitation facility following a painkiller overdose in 1986, stating that, before that point, he heavily abused drugs and alcohol.The Montreal Gazette (1 August 2007) Q&A; with Rob Halford . Canada.com. Retrieved 21 May 2011. He made an energetic recovery and his live performances during the subsequent Fuel for Life Tour was described as some of his strongest ever. He was born and raised in a Christian household, and said that his upbringing \\"has become more important since I became clean and sober on 6 January 1986. That was 25 years ago and I think that's probably more important to me now, on a daily basis.\\" His sobriety helped improve his live performances. He felt that upon walking up on stage drunk and drugged would cheat the fans and cause disappointment. Halford called upon sufferers to overcome their addiction through people or established organizations. When asked what part sobriety has played in the band's longevity, he responded, \\"Without it? Oh, I'd be dead. Literally, I would be dead.\\" Halford credited the music as support for helping him through his addiction. Despite being clean and sober since 1986, he confessed that he did have the desire to \\"have a drink\\" and \\"have a smoke and do a line. I wish I could do all that, but I can't. I've done all that. I've done all that and it nearly killed me. I wish I could do that because when I'm with my friends and they're having a good time and there's this little devil on your shoulder, 'Just have a quick shot. Do a shot of Jack.'\\" He pointed out to those who are recovering from their abuse about dealing with the \\"little devil on your shoulder or the monkey on your back\\", and that being clean and sober was \\"the greatest gift I was given. It was a gift. I can't do this by myself. There's another source helping. That's just a thrill to share with the music at this point.\\" Halford underwent back surgery in 2013 and umbilical hernia surgery in 2014. Singing style and influences Halford performing at Sauna Open Air in 2011 during Judas Priest's Epitaph World Tour Halford possesses a powerful voice with a wide vocal range which is marked by his high-pitched screams and strong vibrato. However, with age, his lower range has matured and become more powerful. Along with Ronnie James Dio and Bruce Dickinson, Halford is one of the pioneers of the pseudo-operatic vocal style later to be adopted by power metal vocalists and regularly appears near the top in lists of the greatest rock vocalists/front-men of all time. Halford describes himself as \\"a huge Queen fan\\" since they began and saw their very early shows. He has called Freddie Mercury, the late lead singer of the band, his \\"ultimate hero\\" and expressed regret that he never got to know him. As a vocalist, Halford was influenced by Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Janis Joplin and Robert Plant. He was also influenced by the music of Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, David Bowie, King Crimson, the Rolling Stones, John Mayall and Alice Cooper.

Early life Stringfellow was born in the City General Hospital, Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 17 October 1940, to Elsie Bowers and James William Stringfellow, a steelworker who served in the Royal Scots Greys during World War II. He was the eldest of four brothers, the others being Geoffrey, Paul and Terry. The family lived in Andover Street, Pitsmoor, Sheffield, until 1948 when they had moved to Marshall Street, Pitsmoor. Peter Stringfellow attended Pye Bank Church of England Primary School. He failed his 11 plus and so attended Burngreave Secondary School for one year. He then passed the exam for Sheffield Central Technical College and he left three years later at the age of 15 with a 4th grade Technical Diploma. Career When Stringfellow was 13 years old, he worked at a cinema on the Wicker arterial street. His first job after leaving school was as an assistant tie salesman at Austin Reed. After some casual jobs he enrolled as an apprentice in the Merchant Navy, at the age of 16. His merchant navy career lasted two years. On his return to Sheffield, he worked briefly in various jobs. While at Dobson's Furnishings Company he was convicted of selling stolen carpets and served two weeks in Armley Prison, Leeds, in June 1962 and six weeks in Ford Open Prison. After his conviction and imprisonment he was unable to find regular work. This led to his business career running clubs. =Nightclub management= In 1962, Stringfellow rented St Aidan's Church Hall in Sheffield every Friday night, operating the Black Cat Club. Several bands played in the club, such as the Pursuers, Dave Berry and the Cruisers, Johnny Tempest and the Cadillacs and from London, Screaming Lord Sutch, the Savages, Count Lindsay and Gene Vincent. His fortunes changed when The Beatles played on 2 April 1963. The demand for concert tickets was so great that Stringfellow rented a larger venue, the Azena Ballroom in Sheffield. On that night he sent the Beatles a telegram congratulating them on their first album, Please Please Me. In 1963 Stringfellow began another club, the Blue Moon, at St. John's Church Hall in Sheffield. The opening act was the Marauders who had a record in the British top 30. More bands followed such as the Kinks. Other bands that played at the club and who later became famous were Freddie Starr and the Midnighters, the Searchers, Shane Fenton and the Fentones, Wayne Fontana, Long John Baldry and the Hoochie Coochie Men, Rod Stewart and the Soul Agents, Vance Arnold & The Avengers, Dean Marshall and the Deputies. In 1964, Stringfellow opened the highly successful Mojo Club, later renamed the King Mojo Club in Sheffield. During its three and half years of business, many bands played at the club, including The Who, Pink Floyd, The Brian Auger Trinity, The Graham Bond Organisation, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, The Yardbirds, Zoot Money's Big Roll Band, The Hollies, The Merseybeats, the Spencer Davis Group, The Pretty Things, Manfred Mann, The Small Faces, Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience. Other American acts who played in the club included the first Tamla/Motown acts to play in the UK, Ben E. King, Sonny Boy Williamson, Tina Turner, Inez and Charlie Foxx, John Lee Hooker, and Little Stevie Wonder. In 1968, he went into another business venture with Down Broadway, just under the Stylo's shoe shop in the centre of Sheffield. On 4 November 1968 Jethro Tull was the first act to play at Down Broadway and John Peel was booked to play as the Star DJ. Progressive rock group Yes also played at the club. In 1969, Stringfellow acquired the first alcohol licence for another of his clubs called the Penthouse ‚Äì Sheffield. The club only lasted for a year due to trouble with overcrowding and objections from the local police. This prompted him to sell it and move to Leeds. In 1970, he opened Cinderella's in Leeds. This was Stringfellow's first super club, mixing recorded music and live bands. In 1972, Stringfellow acquired a space next door to Cinderella to create another club called Rockafella's. This was the first and last of his super cabaret and super clubs. Comedy duo Mike & Bernie Winters and magician Paul Daniels performed at the club. The two clubs were combined in 1973 and given the name Cinderella Rockafella's, and Stringfellow dropped the cabaret and put in full-time DJs such as Chris Crossley and Peter Tyler. He and his brother, Paul Stringfellow, also served as DJs. In 1976, Stringfellow and his then business partner and brother, Geoffrey Stringfellow, sold the Cinderella Rockafella's to Mecca and moved to Manchester, where they opened the Millionaire Club. There were no live bands in the Millionaire Club. However, the Stringfellows hired named DJs including Peter Tyler and Brett Sinclair. In 1980, he sold the Millionaire Club to Granada Ltd and he then moved with his whole family to London. There he opened Stringfellows Covent Garden. It was an immediate success as a nightclub in London, where celebrities, international film stars, TV personalities, rock stars, models, paparazzi and national newspaper journalists partied for the next 15 years. In 1983, he took over the old cabaret club, Talk of the Town, which had closed. He reopened it with its original name Hippodrome and it became the \\"World's Greatest Disco\\". The Hippodrome introduced its first gay night at the venue under his management.Since 1976 on a Monday and Thursday (in the basement of the London Astoria, Charing Cross Road) a gay night called BANG had been operating, which 15 years later became G-A-Y nightclub. He also started Hippodrome Records and one of his acts to sign was Dusty Springfield who released the single Sometimes Like Butterflies. In 1986, he opened Stringfellow's ‚Äì New York which was frequented by New York celebrities. In 1989, he opened Stringfellow's ‚Äì Miami, and then Stringfellow's ‚Äì Los Angeles in 1990. He sustained huge financial losses due to the American economic recession in 1989. In 1996, Stringfellow's autobiography, King of Clubs, was published by Little, Brown. It was serialised in the Baltimore Sun newspaper and became a best-seller. Adult clubbing In 1990, Stringfellow introduced table dancing to his New York club with a licensing deal with Michael J. Peters. This became Stringfellow's Presents Pure Platinum. In 1996, Cabaret of Angels, a table- side dancing club was opened for three nights a week at Stringfellow's Covent Garden. In 2006, Stringfellow opened his second adult entertainment club named Angels in Wardour Street, Soho. He was the first club owner to gain a fully nude licence from Westminster City Council. In 2009, he criticised the Policing and Crime Act 2009, saying the licensing changes with regards to lap dancing were \\"unnecessary\\" and he would be appealing to the European Court of Human Rights if his current licences were not renewed. In 2012, he was granted the necessary sexual entertainment venue (SEV) Licence for Stringfellow's Covent Garden and Angels Soho, and was able to successfully market Angels as providing rooms for the entertainment \\"in privacy\\" of young women in lingerie. Television Stringfellow first appeared on television as a warm-up act on Ready Steady Go! in 1964. He contributed to numerous programmes, both radio and television, in subsequent decades. He appeared on the celebrity edition of Come Dine with Me, with the first broadcast on 17 September 2008. He also appeared in season 15 episode 1 of Top Gear, which was broadcast on 27 June 2010, where he had to help Jeremy Clarkson when he was stuck in a rolled over Reliant Robin. Personal life He married Norma Williams in 1960. They had a daughter, Karen, who was involved with Stringfellow's businesses for many years and is now a boutique owner in Florida. After Stringfellow and Williams divorced, he married Coral Wright in 1967. They had one son together before divorcing: Scott, a former racecar driver. Helen Benoist Official Website page, 'About Me'. Stringfellow married Bella Wright in 2009. They had a daughter, Rosabella, in 2013 and a son, Angelo, in 2015. Stringfellow had four grandchildren: Taylor, Jaime, Thomas and Isabelle. Stringfellow lived in Gerrards Cross and in Mallorca. He was a donor to the UK Conservative Party, and supported a UKIP candidate in 2012. However he publicly disavowed the Conservative Party in 2018 over Brexit stating that the \\"price is too high\\" and said he would support the Liberal Democrats if the Conservatives' advocacy of leaving the European Union continued. Stringfellow had a cancer scare in 2008, but was healthy until he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in late 2017. He died on 7 June 2018 at the age of 77, at King Edward VII's Hospital in London.

K.\\" Downing Jr. (born 27 October 1951) is an English musician. He is a co-founder and former guitarist of heavy metal band Judas Priest. Early life and career Downing was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire. He was kicked out of his home at age 15 and dropped out of school soon afterwards. In the late 1960s, Downing discovered rock music and the guitar. He is a mostly self-taught guitarist. \\"He was heavily influenced by Jimi Hendrix, whom he was 'very quick to recognise as the future'\\". He was also influenced by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and Eric Clapton. Downing performed on every Judas Priest album from Rocka Rolla to A Touch of Evil: Live. Downing started his first band, a pop band called Stagecoach, between the age of 17 and 18 with his second cousin Brian Badhams on bass guitar (now with The Elkie Brooks Band) and drummer Martin Philips. The trio \\"mainly jammed a few Cream songs and a few 12-bar blues\\". Downing played guitar with the band after winning a coin toss with Badhams \\"in his bedroom to see who would play guitar or bass\\". Prior to joining Judas Priest, Downing attended catering college and worked as trainee chef at the Lyttelton Arms in Hagley. Playing style and technique Downing in 1980 Downing has an aggressive, rock-influenced guitar style featuring solos and dual leads with fellow Judas Priest guitarist Glenn Tipton.Judas Priest Info Pages ‚Äì K.K. ‚Äì Glenn Profile His solos remained of this style for most of his career, but he incorporated various techniques into his playing over the years. As opposed to Tipton, his solos tended to incorporate a more raw, rough-edged sound, making use of techniques such as pinch harmonics, dive bombs, and tremolo picking, and often focusing on speed, technical accuracy and melody. From Stained Class onward, Tipton became increasingly dominant in Judas Priest's songwriting, particularly on the more commercial tracks while Downing's role in the band started to diminish, especially as Tipton's songs comprised the vast majority of the band's live setlists after 1980. In 1978, Tipton began to incorporate the tapping technique into his playing, which Downing began to use as well. By 1990, both Tipton and Downing started to use the complex technique of sweep-picking, which can be notably heard on the title track of their 1990 album Painkiller. They have continuously used these techniques ever since. In Judas Priest's early years, Downing made common use of the wah-wah pedal, but began to limit his use of it in the late 1970s. He had abandoned the use of it by the mid-1980s, but saved it only for live performances of the songs that originally featured it. The only time since then that he began to use it again was in 1996, when vocalist Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens joined the band, and they began to experiment with their music more than before. One of these experimentations was the renewal of wah-wah in Downing's playing, which can be heard on their 1997 album Jugulator. This experimentation was taken further on the 2001 album Demolition, but was abandoned once more when the band's former vocalist, Rob Halford, returned to the band in 2003. However, Downing used a wah-wah pedal on his last few tours with the band. Leaving Judas Priest Downing in 1984 Downing officially left Judas Priest on 20 April 2011, citing \\"an on-going breakdown in working relationships between myself, elements of the band and management for some time.\\" He stated that there were at least \\"21 reasons\\" why he left, but refused to go into specific detail; however, he did express disappointment in the band's live performance and thought it could've been better. Judas Priest had since continued with Richie Faulkner as his replacement. Soon after Glenn Tipton announced his Parkinson's disease diagnosis and his self-imposed retirement from touring in February 2018, Downing said that he was \\"shocked and stunned\\" that he wasn't approached to rejoin Judas Priest and was \\"officially and legally still a member of Judas Priest\\", despite not being present in the band. He felt that he made the right choice to leave when he did and that his time in the band and value in terms of crafting their legacy \\"was and is unappreciated by more than one member\\". He said that the decision of not being approached \\"was not a financial one\\". Faulkner and Halford spoke in regards to his statement. Bassist Ian Hill explained why he wasn't contacted to rejoin Judas Priest and the potential conflicts that would occur if he was brought back in the band. Downing spoke negatively towards Hill's comments. Downing explained why he left Judas Priest, expressed his concerns towards his former bandmates, and his feelings about Faulkner. Faulkner spoke in regards to Downing's comments, with former Judas Priest vocalist Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens speaking in Downing's defense. In the limelight of Downing's comments, Hill said that Downing and the band have \\"parted company\\" musically, explaining that he had not been in contact with him \\"for the last couple of years because we've been so busy. But I think, musically, we've parted ways, really. Probably the less said, the better.\\" =Future= Downing's relationship with Judas Priest isn't \\"overly sweet at the moment. Nothing lasts forever. I started in the late '60s, so certainly guys from that time, we're not going to be around forever. Obviously, we're losing a lot of good friends along the way. It is the way it is.\\" An opportunity existed for him to return to the band, \\"and that has passed on.\\" He expressed uncertainty if there would ever be another opportunity for him to rejoin, but did not dismiss it in the future. Downing explained that if he didn't rejoin Judas Priest, \\"then maybe it's best to just leave it there, really\\", feeling that there would be a different occupation for him, \\"Exactly what I don't know, really.\\" Hill said that there were no plans for him to return in the foreseeable future. Downing had an open interest in having a discussion with his former bandmates in taking part in the band's 50th anniversary celebration in 2020, but was not contacted, expressing doubt that he ever would rejoin Judas Priest again. Downing hoped to make amends with his former bandmates, \\"But it's proved not to be the case, so, obviously, I have to accept that and just move forward.\\" He clarified his comment from an article published by Blabbermouth, and still held hopes for them to reconcile, \\"But to date the band have refused me that opportunity.\\" Halford did not dismiss the possibility for Downing to return to Judas Priest in the future. Downing requested for the members to step in and \\"speak to the press and just make a press release and tell 'em exactly what the deal is\\", and give \\"everybody an insight 'cause people wanna know.\\" He once again expressed an open interest in performing with Judas Priest again if given the opportunity, and also perform with them at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in 2020 if inducted, due to his inclusion in the band's ballot, but was denied the possibility of returning to the band for the 50th-anniversary shows. Downing then made the decision to move forward as a result. Live return After not performing on stage since Judas Priest's 30th-anniversary celebration of the 1980 album British Steel in 2009, Downing made his live return at the 2019 edition of the Bloodstock Open Air festival where he performed with former Manowar guitarist Ross the Boss as they played the songs \\"The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)\\", \\"Heading Out to the Highway\\", \\"Breaking the Law\\" and \\"Running Wild\\". He cited it being \\"a bit of a whirlwind\\" and the perfect way to get reintroduced to the stage. He also said that there was very little time for him to rehearse as some of the band members arrived the same day of their scheduled rehearsal, \\"But we did manage to squeeze an hour or so in the following day.\\" He described the performance as being \\"a jam, really‚Ä¶ And there was quite a bit of improvisation in there. And that's where it is.\\" In a Twitter response from a fan, Richie Faulkner praised Downing's performance upon viewing video footage of him, saying that he \\"looked and sounded great. Good to see the man up on stage where he belongs again.\\" Downing, along with former Judas Priest members Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens and Les Binks, Megadeth bassist David Ellefson and Hostile guitarist A.J. Mills performed a special one-off show in Wolverhampton on 3 November 2019 and played a full set of Judas Priest songs. KK's Priest In January 2020, Downing signed with Explorer1 Music Group, which would pair him with veteran manager Andy Gould, and announced that he would work on brand-new music. He teamed up with Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens, Les Binks, guitarist A.J. Mills and Voodoo Six bassist Tony Newton to form his own band called KK's Priest. They are currently at work on their debut album, and will also make select festival appearances to mark Downing's 50th anniversary of his music career. Downing has recently indicated in interviews that the band would be playing much of the catalog of Tony Mills, whom Downing said \\"is the greatest metal vocalist of our time\\" and that \\"his legacy has been solied by others alleging to have been his friend.\\" Musical side projects Downing contributed guitar work on the song \\"Something Weird\\" on King Diamond's 1989 album Conspiracy. Downing made a guest appearance on Violent Storm's 2005 self-titled debut album, performing on the track \\"War No More\\". He appeared on the 2012 tribute album Who Are You? An All Star Tribute to the Who, which paid tribute to the Who. He performed on the track \\"Eminence Front\\", along with vocalist/bassist John Wetton and keyboardist Derek Sherinian. Downing appeared on former Queensr√øche vocalist Geoff Tate's Queensr√øche-branded 2013 album Frequency Unknown, performing the guitar solo on \\"Running Backwards\\". In 2018, Downing, along with former Judas Priest members Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens and Les Binks, and Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera were featured in a cover version of the song \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\", fronted by guitarist Paul Crook's band Devilstar, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Judas Priest's 1978 album Stained Class. Autobiography On 18 September 2018, Downing published his autobiography titled Heavy Duty: Days and Nights in Judas Priest via Da Capo Press. It was written by Downing himself along with Mark Eglinton. The memoir details everything from \\"the complex personality conflicts, the business screw-ups, the acrimonious relationship with fellow heavy metal band Iron Maiden, as well as how Judas Priest found itself at the epicenter of a storm of parental outrage that targeted heavy metal in the '80s\\", according to the book's synopsis. It also tells about Downing's role in Judas Priest, as well as his decision to leave the band in 2011. It was met with mostly positive reviews. Since its release, Rob Halford said that he has not taken the time to read Downing's autobiography while in production on his own. Homes Downing's first house was a \\"tiny semi in Bloxwich\\". He has lived in Los Angeles and Florida and but no longer owns a home in Spain, but his main abode since 1985 remains Astbury Hall in Shropshire. It is in a very secluded area so he can (as stated in a 2007 interview) \\"really turn up Marshalls really loud\\". Astbury Hall is also home to \\"one of England's finest championship golf courses\\", a course created by Downing himself and where he has held publicised charity events. Sarah Lissimore, his former girlfriend, mounted a legal challenge for half of his Shropshire estate. This was based on his assertion, \\"I'd bet you'd love to be lady of this Manor, wouldn't you?\\" The High Court of Justice rejected the notion that this assertion could give rise to proprietary estoppel in favour of Lissimore. In December 2013, it was announced that Downing would be teaming up with a property development finance provider, and golfer Darren Clarke, to help build luxury residential developments on Downing's Astbury estate. Downing told the Shropshire Star: \\"We have had a fantastic season, things were going really well. We had plans for a hotel that we were doing really well with. Obviously there was a necessity for a funding element. \\"The company took out a short-term mezzanine fund in early August to take us through to March. This was essentially to bring in professional architects and a team from London. Everything was in place as far as we were concerned. \\"Unfortunately about six weeks into the loan we were served a loan termination notice about technical breaches of the agreement. \\"We are at the moment looking to re- finance that loan. We were taken aback that the funder was not more flexible with us as partners. It was put up for sale for ¬£10 million ($13.5 million). Downing maintained that the development was financially stable and viable as he was set to build a luxury holel for the Marriott Autograph collection and had hoped to host The Open Championship on the estate's golf course. Due to the circumstances surrounding his golf resort investment, Downing placed a share of his royalty rights for 136 Judas Priest songs for sale; the catalogue generates nearly ¬£300,000 ($400,000) per year. Joint administrator Alastair Massey called the songs \\"a unique investment opportunity\\" from one of the \\"driving influences\\" of Judas Priest's success. In July 2018, Round Hill Music acquired the royalty rights to Downing's compositions; the catalogue's asking price was at least ¬£10 million ($13.5 million). Downing later explained about the sellings of his estate, his golf course and his royalty rights of 136 Judas Priest songs, \\"I'm in the process now of recovering everything else through the legal channels. I made a few rubbish business moves, but I can't complain really because I did okay. Lots of musicians end up with nothing really, but I had an evaluation on the estate worth in excess of ¬£13 million. Quite a few million pounds' worth of music royalties and other assets as well. I'm suing my lawyers for negligence.\\" In March 2019, Shropshire Council's planning officers set Downing's estate to be transformed into a huge leisure complex including a leisure and spa building, two swimming pools, a farm shop, a function room, restaurant and spa, an outdoor lido pool, tennis courts, bowling greens, a new nine-hole golf course and an 18-hole putting green; with the addition of 300 wooden lodges. Local residents expressed concerns about the impact of the development on the nature of Eardington and added traffic on small nearby roads. The National Trust expressed their own worries of the work on the nearby Dudmaston Hall, but Shropshire Council's planning team decided that there were no grounds on which the development should be refused. Case Officer Richard Fortune said that the report recommending the application was approved, and that the extra traffic on the B4555 would be acceptable. He also noted that it would not generate a significant amount of trips compared to the already existing number of vehicles travelling along the highway. Fortune also said that Shropshire Council as highway authority \\"would need to demonstrate that the B4555 and surrounding highway network do not have the capacity to support a development of this nature. It is not considered a highway objection could be sustained on this basis.\\" The impact of the volume of traffic on some junctions in Bridgnorth, most notably B4555/B4363 and Oldbury Road/Hollybush Road, have raised concerns. The report backing from the council's economic team claimed that the development could bring as much as ¬£15 million ($19 million) of investment into the county. In a statement released from FCFM Group Limited in December 2018, they said that when they announced the plans at the time, they claimed that the development could be worth more than ¬£3.5 million ($4.6 million) a year to the local economy.

Often noted for his complex playing style and classically influenced solos, he is best known as one of the lead guitarists for heavy metal band Judas Priest. Early life and career Tipton in 1984 Tipton was born on 25 October 1947, in Blackheath, Staffordshire, to Olive and Doug Tipton. He attended Olive Hill Primary School when he was about five years old. His brother, Gary, was a guitar player for a local band called the Atlantics. Early on, Tipton was taught to play the piano by his mother. Tipton learned to play guitar at age 19 with his first guitar being a Hofner acoustic guitar. He would then play on a Rickenbacker until he was able to afford a Fender Stratocaster. This guitar would become his main live guitar until it was stolen at a show. Tipton soon bought a black Stratocaster and, later, a Gibson SG afterwards with money he received to replace his old guitar. Both of these guitars can be seen when Judas Priest played on the Old Grey Whistle Test in 1975. Tipton lives in the village of Romsley, Worcestershire, in the West Midlands near Birmingham, England and has a state-of-the-art recording studio built next to his home. During the 1980s he also bought a property in Spain. He is or was married and has two children‚ÄîKarina and Rick‚Äîborn in 1981 and 1986, respectively, both of whom were featured on his solo album Baptizm of Fire. Tipton and former Judas Priest bandmate K.K. Downing are long-time tennis players and also both of them took up golf during an early 1980s American tour with Def Leppard. Tipton's first band was Shave 'Em Dry, with future Starfighters and Ozzy Osbourne drummer Barry Scrannage, which became Merlin, later becoming The Flying Hat Band. This band soon broke up due to management issues. In May 1974, Tipton joined Judas Priest, and coincidentally Scrannage had joined the band Bullion with earlier Judas Priest members Ernest Chataway and Bruno Staphenhill. This was during the recording for Rocka Rolla, so Tipton quickly added his guitar parts to the album. On Sad Wings of Destiny, Tipton showed off more of his guitar work on songs like \\"Tyrant\\", \\"Dreamer Deceiver\\" and \\"Victim of Changes\\". Tipton also presented his own songwriting on the songs \\"Prelude\\", \\"Epitaph\\" and \\"The Ripper\\". He frequently played keyboards on the early albums, although those were no longer featured on any songs after Killing Machine. He is credited with introducing a more metal sound to the band with those songs, as Rocka Rolla was composed of largely blues rock and psychedelic songs left over from the band's former frontman Al Atkins. Although Tipton wrote the lyrics for the songs shortly after joining Judas Priest, producer Rodger Bain rejected putting them on the first album as being not commercial enough. From then onward, Halford and Tipton would be the band's principal songwriters with occasional contributions from Downing. 1980's British Steel was Judas Priest's commercial breakthrough. This album combined the band's trademark heavy metal sound with pop-style song structures and hooks. \\"United\\" and \\"Breaking the Law\\" were some of Judas Priest's first guitar-driven songs not to include any solo sections. Judas Priest quickly shot to rock superstar status during the 1980s with their albums Point of Entry, Screaming for Vengeance, Defenders of the Faith, Turbo and Ram It Down, entering the 1990s with the album Painkiller. Rob Halford left Judas Priest in 1992 and the band then separated. During their split, Tipton wrote material for a solo project he formed in the mid-1990s. His first solo effort was the album Baptizm of Fire, which was released in 1997, followed by Edge of the World in 2006. In 1996, Judas Priest reformed with new vocalist Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens. This new version of the band recorded the albums Jugulator in 1997 and Demolition in 2001. Both of these albums experimented with new sounds that distinguished them from the records with Halford. In 2003, Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford and toured in celebration of his return in 2004. The band released Angel of Retribution in 2005 and Nostradamus in 2008. In 2010, Judas Priest announced their Epitaph World Tour, which was to be the last major world tour, which was also their first tour without original guitarist K. K. Downing, and the first to feature his replacement, Richie Faulkner. The band later retracted this announcement, and released their seventeenth album Redeemer of Souls in July 2014, as well as supporting the album with a world tour. On 12 February 2018, Tipton announced that he would step down from touring when he revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He stated that he was still a member of the band despite his diagnosis and would not rule out future on-stage appearances. Producer and guitarist Andy Sneap replaced him on tour. On 9 March 2018, the eighteenth album Firepower was released. At the 20 March 2018 show in Newark, New Jersey, Tipton joined the band on stage to perform \\"Metal Gods\\", \\"Breaking the Law\\" and \\"Living After Midnight\\", then \\"Victim of Changes\\" and \\"No Surrender\\" on later dates. Prior to the band's performance, he expressed uncertainty regarding his future role in Judas Priest, \\"It's an unanswerable question, really. It's in the lap of the metal gods.\\" After performing on stage with the band, he described it as \\"emotional\\", and being overwhelmed with support from the band members and from fans worldwide, \\"You don‚Äôt like to see a grown man cry, but we did.\\" Tipton did not make any more appearances on the remaining dates of the band's world tour due to his illness, as explained by bassist Ian Hill. Illness On 12 February 2018, Tipton revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, with which he was first diagnosed in 2008, thus ceasing his duties to perform on tour as the disease's progression left him unable to play the more challenging material. Rob Halford said that Tipton rejected the idea of having to be assisted with an additional guitarist backstage on tour for cover on some of his guitar parts or to use backing tracks. He then said that he witnessed first-hand the struggles Tipton experienced during the making of Firepower. Halford later said that Tipton made his decision five days prior to his public announcement, adding that Tipton would be \\"with us in spirit ‚Äî every show, every song\\" on tour, and being overwhelmed by positive support and responses from fans. Bassist Ian Hill explained that Tipton faced a similar situation during rehearsals for the Redeemer of Souls Tour in 2014. At the time of the announcement, he said that Tipton made the decision to step off the stage due to his health, which caused emotional heartache for the band. Tipton said that he was shocked to hear the news of his diagnosis and \\"made me even more determined to fight. I could still play, so I just continued recording and touring.\\" He would later say that he was \\"sort of shocked\\", describing it as \\"a pretty cruel disease.\\" In June 2018, Judas Priest launched the Glenn Tipton Parkinson's Foundation in Tipton's honour, in which they would sell specially designed t-shirts featuring Tipton playing guitar on the front and with the slogan \\"No Surrender\\" on the back with the Judas Priest cross on it. Tipton explains that the foundation would help raise money in hopes of finding a cure for Parkinson's disease. He also says that a new \\"pioneering treatment\\" from his personal specialist would also help treat other sufferers of the disease. Hill said that the band had known for some time that Tipton was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease before his announcement, again recalling the difficulties during the first days of the Redeemer of Souls Tour, but improved as time progressed. He says that Tipton's \\"as good as anyone can be given the situation. Glenn is out with us most of the time, anyway. And when he's feeling well enough he'll get on stage, and I can't promise anything, but he'll get up and do the encores with us.\\" Tipton's daughter, Karina Greenin, took part in an annual marathon in Barcelona to help raise funds for her father's foundation, which exceeded her ¬£3,500 goal. Richie Faulkner recalled that Tipton was diagnosed during the Redeemer of Souls Tour, \\"maybe, actually, a bit before. So, after the 'Epitaph' tour, but before the 'Redeemer Of Souls' tour he got diagnosed, and they told him that he had it for quite a few years before that, but he didn't know. He kept it quiet, which is his business‚Ä¶ He chose to go and check it out and they told him that it was the onset Parkinson's, and he told us. But he was able to do the 'Redeemer Of Souls' tour.\\" He then said that the set had to be slightly changed in order to accommodate him. The band did not perform a few songs on the first part of the tour, but upon their appearance in Australia, they began to perform them due to Tipton's resurgence in his health and managed to successfully perform the entire tour, but stepped down during rehearsals for the Firepower World Tour due to the disease's progression which caused emotional heartbreak for the band. Tipton expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the fans for their support for him, \\"particularly over the past year which has been a tough one for me.....thank you all so much! No surrender!!\\" Faulkner provided an update on Tipton in July 2020, saying that he was still in good spirits, but was \\"going a bit nuts\\" due to the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Playing style Tipton performing in 2005 Tipton is known for his complex, classically influenced solos, and he has a unique guitar-playing technique. Many of his solos are very difficult to transcribe, and his playing is notable for his double lead guitar trades with fellow Judas Priest guitarist K.K. Downing. Tipton's solos have maintained a consistent style for most of his career, but he has continuously incorporated new techniques into his playing over the years as he has developed as a guitarist. The usual arrangement on Judas Priest songs feature riffs and leads by both Tipton and Downing. Starting with Judas Priest's fourth album, Stained Class, Tipton began to dominate the band's songwriting, especially on the more commercial tracks which almost exclusively featured his guitar leads. Following the release of their sixth album, British Steel, most songs in the live set lists were Tipton's. On the whole, his solos feature in almost 60% of Judas Priest's total catalog. In contrast to Downing, Tipton's solos tend to feature a more melodic, legato blues rock sound, making use of harmonic minor scales, Aeolian mode, pentatonic scales, and techniques such as sweep-picking arpeggios, legato picking, tremolo/alternate picking, hammer-ons, and pull-offs; moreover, the solos often showcase both accuracy and aggression. However, like Downing, his playing sometimes emphasizes speed rather than precision, and Tipton has been known to occasionally use pinch harmonics and dive bombs in his solos (for example, on Invader). Tipton also has a trademark 2-strings bend/whammy dive scream for ending the solo, as evident in solos like All Guns Blazing, Heavy Metal, Demonizer, Bullet Train, and Ram It Down. In 1978, Tipton began to incorporate tapping into his playing, which Downing promptly did as well. In the mid-1980s, both guitarists started to use the complex technique of sweep-picking, which can be notably heard on the title track of their 1990 album Painkiller. Both have continuously used these techniques ever since. In 1997, Tipton released his solo album, Baptizm of Fire, featuring a host of well-known musicians including Billy Sheehan, Cozy Powell and Don Airey, among others where he showed his technical guitar playing abilities. =Influences= Tipton quotes : \\"It goes without saying that I love playing and performing heavy metal, and have for most of my career. Going right back though, I've listened to a lot of early blues players, and I think the first band I saw live that really made an impression on me, was The Spencer Davis Group . I remember going to see them play at an all-nighter at Birmingham Town Hall. Steve Winwood was a great all round vocalist, guitarist and keyboard player and I remember trying to learn 'Georgia' on the piano after I had seen them play. They had great songs like 'Keep on Running' and although you could try and categorize them as blues or R&B;, they really had their own sound going for them, mainly due I believe to Steve Winwood\\". Other early influences were Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. \\"I still can't believe where Hendrix came from. OK Seattle maybe but he just suddenly appeared, as if from nowhere, this black guy playing guitar in a way no one had imagined it could be played. He was more than a genius in my eyes, someone very, very special. I loved early Purple and the combined sound of organ and guitar gave them a very powerful sound, again unique at the time. As for Zeppelin, what can you say, 'Whole Lotta Love', 'Communication Breakdown', 'Black Dog', and the epic 'Kashmir' again a unique band with great songs. All these bands formed an impression on me going back to those early days. \\"I liked the early Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer. I thought Peter Green was a great white blues player and song-writer. He not only penned such greats as 'Green Manalishi' and 'Oh Well' but more delicate compositions such as 'Need Your Love So Bad' or 'Albatross' I saw them several times and it was great to watch them perform songs like 'Stop Messin' Around' or songs featuring slide guitar such as 'Dust My Broom'. \\"As I've said before, as a guitar player my main inspiration was Rory Gallagher. I saw him play in Taste many times and he really inspired me, not just musically but also in the amount of energy and feel he put out\\". \\"I've always loved The Rolling Stones. They have so many classic songs such as 'Jumping Jack Flash', 'Honky Tonk Women', 'Sympathy for the Devil', 'Brown Sugar', or their earlier stuff like 'This Could Be The Last Time', 'Paint It, Black', 'It's All Over Now' the list goes on and on. The Stones have great attitude and that rebel quality that's so appealing. I recently saw them at the Isle of Wight festival and they were as good as ever after all these years\\". \\"As do many people, I think The Beatles were a great band. We were all lucky that fate put these guys together in our time. It totally amazes me that they came up with such an abundance of classic songs in such a relatively short amount of time. The Beatles changed everything. To start with they were the first band to write their own material. They were so prolific and the endless melodies they invented will live forever\\". Tipton is a big fan of soundtrack music, something that is evident in listening to Judas Priest's metal opera Nostradamus. \\"I love people like Hans Zimmer,\\" Tipton told Attention Deficit Delirium. \\"Some of the stuff that they do is incredible.\\" (He's a big fan of the Gladiator soundtrack.) \\"One day when I'm good enough to, I wouldn't even call it a film score, but do music for film, I'd like that opportunity. It would be really exciting for me to do. Whether that will happen or not, I'm not sure. I would certainly welcome the opportunity to do something like that as long as it were something that I liked or had respect for visually.\\" Equipment Judas Priest performing at Sauna Open Air in 2011. Tipton (far right) is playing on his signature Hamer model. =Tone= Glenn's tone is produced by playing humbucker-equipped guitars. Compared to Downing's tone, Glenn's tone is warmer, with more bass and lower mids. This lets both guitarists play the same parts yet remain distinct in the mix. Tipton's \\"classic sound\\" on albums like British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance, and Stained Class was obtained using 50 watt, non- master Marshall heads with EL34 output tubes, and a Range Master treble boost ‚Äì a device also used by Brian May of Queen. During this period, Glenn also employed a MXR Distortion +, Phase 100, and digital delays, as well as an old Maestro Echoplex. In the late 1980s, around the time of the Turbo album, Priest began incorporating guitar synths. Starting with the comeback album Jugulator, Glenn switched to Rocktron preamps, the Rocktron Intellifex for effects, and Crate heads and cabs. Tipton used SGs and a Stratocaster with two DiMarzio Super Distortion humbuckers as his main instruments until the mid 80s when he started using various Hamer guitars including some signature models, which were used almost exclusively in live performances until 2009 when the Stratocaster and one of the SGs was brought out of retirement for the British Steel 30th anniversary tour. Most of his guitars are equipped with Kahler tremolos. Glenn uses standard-light (10‚Äì46) gauge strings produced by Ernie Ball and thin picks. Throughout his career, Glenn has used many tunings, most frequently standard tuning (almost all of the songs written before Rob Halford left the band were originally in E-standard). Ever since Rob Halford rejoined Judas Priest, both Glenn and KK have used E-flat tuning during live shows, while still using standard tuning extensively on studio albums. =Guitars= Tipton has used numerous guitars over the years. These include a 1960s Fender Stratocaster up until about 1978. During the period from 1978 to 1979, he used a black Gibson Les Paul Custom, and he started using a modified CBS-era Fender Stratocaster with Dimarzio Super-Distortion (humbucking) pickups. For the Screaming for Vengeance tour, he added a chrome pickguard. For this tour, he also played a Gibson SG Special that he spray-painted black himself. The SG also had a chrome pickguard and stock PAF humbuckers. Around 1984, he switched to a Hamer Phantom GT model, which was fitted with one EMG humbucker, a Kahler tremolo, and one volume pot. A signature model of this was developed and sold to public from 1984 to 1986. Tipton still uses this guitar model, but now with Seymour Duncan Blackouts active pickups. In 2009, Tipton took his Fender Stratocaster and Gibson SG Special out of retirement for the British Steel 30th Anniversary tour. As of late 2015, he is now officially endorsing ESP guitars, with his own signature model, the GT-600, which is part of ESP's LTD series of guitars and in terms of shape is modeled after ESP's Viper series of guitars. He has also used various guitars over the years *ESP LTD GT-600 - using currently *Fender Telecaster ‚Äì For studio use *ESP Eclipse acoustic ‚Äì For stage use *Ibanez 7621 seven-string guitar ‚Äì In the studio for Demolition (Possibly used for the song \\"In Between\\") *Gibson Explorer ‚Äì Could be seen on the Classic Albums: British Steel documentary and was used sparingly during the Nostradamus tour *Legends custom-built acrylic Jaguar-shaped guitar ‚Äì Tipton jokingly admitted that he wanted to make a lamp out of it, but liked the tone of it and was used for recording Demolition), *Roland G-707 synth guitar ‚Äì was mostly used in the studio, used a Hamer Phantom GT with a Roland Hex pickup for stage use =Amplification= Tipton has almost exclusively used Marshall Amplifiers for live performances. Tipton used Regular Vintage 50 and 100 Watt Marshall heads without a master volume until 1982, when the JCM 800 head was developed. The JCM 800 was used by Tipton and fellow Judas Priest guitarist K.K. Downing for many years. During the Jugulator and Demolition era, Tipton was endorsed by Crate amplifiers, using their Blue Voodoo heads in the studio, home, and when touring. He would drop this endorsement during the 2004 reunion tour for live performances switching to a large rack unit with multiple preamps and effects processors with a Marshall 9100 power amp. In 2008, Tipton began using ENGL amps. Of the brand, he comments, \\"ENGL is the first ampline that I have ever used that not only has balls, but attitude, right out of the box\\". When he first used Engl amps, he played through the ENGL Midi Tube Preamp E 580 and the ENGL Tube Poweramp E 850/50. For the Epitaph tour, he switched to using ENGL Invaders that are modified to use 6L6 power tubes. Glenn uses for his home studio in England (and primary practice amp) the generation 1: Crate Blue Voodoo BV 120H all tube, all American head with the blue tolex (not the black or red tolex of later generations). This amp is seen in several of his demonstration videos and guitar collection tour videos online and caused a run on this amp by fans forcing the prices to rise rapidly in the used market for shrinking supply of the amp (due to its age and limited production run) ...this phenomenon is not unlike the fan run situation on the small marshall amps (5005) used by Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top. =Effects= During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tipton used a Pete Cornish custom pedalboard with an overdrive unit, flanger, MXR distortion unit, MXR Phase 100, MXR digital delay, MXR 12-band EQ, Maestro Echoplex, line boosters between each effect to preserve the signal from input to output, and a Rangemaster-based custom treble boost connected to the bass channel of Marshall 50 and 100 watt heads with no master volume. Around the time of the reunion with Rob Halford, Tipton only used a modified Crybaby 535Q Wah, Digitech Tone Driver, DigiTech Main Squeeze, and a Yamaha midi board controlling other effects and sounds in a rack unit. Since the beginning of the 2008 world tour, Glenn has gone back to mostly using a rack system, sans the current use of Engl amp heads. He currently uses a Korg rack tuner, Furman power unit, Dunlop Custom Shop Rackmounted Crybaby, Rocktron Intellifex and Yamaha SPX-90 multi-effects units, and a dbx 166A compressor and noise gate. =Guitar rig and signal flow= A detailed gear diagram of Glen Tipton's 2004 Judas Priest guitar rig is well-documented.Cooper, Adam (2004). \\"Glen Tipton's 2004 Judas Priest Guitar Rig\\" .

It is the second installment in the Mad Max film series, with Mel Gibson reprising his role as \\"Mad\\" Max Rockatansky. The film's tale of a community of settlers who moved to defend themselves against a roving band of marauders follows an archetypical \\"Western\\" frontier movie motif, as does Max's role as a hardened man who rediscovers his humanity when he decides to help the settlers. Filming took place in locations around Broken Hill, in the outback of New South Wales.Mad Max 2 / The Road Warrior Filming Locations. Madmaxmovies.com. Retrieved on 18 November 2011. Mad Max 2 was released on 24 December 1981, and received wide critical acclaim. Observers praised the visuals and Gibson's role. Noteworthy elements of the film also include cinematographer Dean Semler's widescreen photography of Australia's vast desert landscapes, the sparing use of dialogue, costume designer Norma Moriceau's punky mohawked bikers wearing leather bondage gear, its fast-paced, tightly edited battle and chase scenes, and Brian May's musical score. The film's post-apocalyptic and punk aesthetics popularised the genre in film and fiction writing. It was also a box office success, being the highest-grossing Australian film worldwide. It won the Best International Film from six nominations at the Saturn Award ceremony, including: Best Director for Miller; Best Actor for Gibson; Best Supporting Actor for Bruce Spence; Best Writing for Miller, Hayes and Hannant; and Best Costume for Norma Moriceau. Mad Max 2 became a cult film, with fan clubs and \\"road warrior\\"-themed activities continuing into the 21st century, and is now widely hailed to be one of the greatest action movies of all time, as well as one of the greatest sequels ever made. The film was preceded by Mad Max in 1979 and followed by Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome in 1985 and Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015. Plot Following a global war and the collapse of civilization after the Earth's oil supplies were nearly exhausted, barbaric anarchy has become the world's everyday law. Haunted by the death of his family, former policeman Max Rockatansky now roams the desert wilderness of a post-apocalyptic Australia in a scarred, black, supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special. Scavenging for food and petrol, Max's only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a sawn-off shotgun with scarce ammunition. After driving off a gang led by the unhinged biker warrior Wez, and taking petrol from one of their wrecked vehicles, Max finds a nearby gyrocopter and decides to collect its fuel. The gyrocopter is boobytrapped, but Max overpowers the pilot hiding nearby, sparing his life upon being told of a small oil refinery nearby in the wasteland. However, upon arriving, Max finds the compound under siege by the Marauders, a motley gang of racers and motorcyclists of which Wez is a member. The Marauders' leader, a large disfigured man called \\"Lord Humungus\\", has his gang swarm the complex daily, believing that the compound contains some kind of petrol reserves or even a small refinery. Biding his time, Max makes his move when a group of settlers attempt to break out of the compound to find a means to take the fuel tank out of the complex. With the others captured and subjected to torture, rape and death, Max rescues the remaining survivor and offers to get him back to the complex in return for a tank of petrol. The man dies shortly from his wound after Max returns him, and the settlers' leader Papagallo reneges on the deal. The settlers are on the verge of killing Max when the Marauders return and, despite the death of Wez's partner by the metal boomerang of a feral child living within the complex, Humungus offers the settlers safe passage from the territory in exchange for the fuel supply. Max offers another deal to Papagallo: he will procure a semi- truck for the settlers to haul their tanker if they give Max his freedom and as much fuel as he can carry. The settlers accept, but keep his car until he returns. That night, Max sneaks out on foot with the Feral Kid's help. He again encounters the Gyro Captain and forces him to help make the journey to the truck, a Mack semi which Max discovered after his initial encounter with Wez. With aerial support, Max drives the semi through the Marauders' encampment into the compound with a livid Humungus reinitiating the siege. Though the settlers want Max to escape with them to a beach, Max opts to collect his petrol and leave. However, while attempting to break through the siege, Max is seriously wounded and his car wrecked after being run off the road by Wez in Lord Humungus's nitrous oxide-equipped car. One of the Marauders kills Max's dog with a crossbow before Toady's attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special's tanks triggers the car's self-destruct, which kills both Marauders during the explosion. Max is left for dead, but the Gyro Captain rescues him and flies him back to the compound. Despite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired and now armored truck with the fuel tanker. He leaves the compound, accompanied by the Feral Kid with Papagallo and several of the settlers in armored vehicles to provide protection. Lord Humungus and most of his warriors pursue the tanker, leaving the remaining settlers free to flee the compound in a ramshackle caravan, rigging the compound to explode. After Papagallo and the defenders are killed during the chase, and the Gyro Captain shot down, Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone against the Marauders as Wez boards the truck to kill the two of them. However, the semi's head-on collision with Humungus' car kills both him and Wez as the out-of-control truck rolls off the road while the surviving Marauders leave. As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he sees not oil, but sand, leaking from the tank, revealing it to be a decoy which allowed the other settlers to escape with the fuel in oil drums hidden inside their vehicles. With Papagallo dead, the Gyro Captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast, where they establish the \\"Great Northern Tribe\\". The Feral Kid (as an adult and the Northern Tribe's new leader) is revealed as the film's narrator, reminiscing about the Road Warrior, who departed for parts unknown, and now lives on only in legend. Cast * Mel Gibson as Max, a former member of the Australian highway patrol called the Main Force Patrol (MFP). However, after a biker gang kills his family, he leaves the force and hunts down and kills all of the gang members. The trauma transforms him into the embittered, \\"burnt out... shell of a man\\". The narration describes him as ‚Äúthe Road Warrior, the man we called Max‚Äù, who despite his acerbic nature, elects to assist the settlers in their plan. However once his part is complete, he becomes a drifter once again, choosing not to follow them north. * Bruce Spence as the Gyro Captain, a wanderer who looks for fuel and supplies. However, instead of driving a car, the Captain flies in a ramshackle old gyrocopter powered by a VW air-cooled engine. He, too, decides to throw in his lot with the settlers, and help defend their compound. Time's reviewer Richard Corliss called the Captain \\"a deranged parody of the World War I aerial ace: scarecrow skinny, gaily clad, sporting a James Coburn smile with advanced caries\\"; despite his quirks, however, the Captain proves to be wily and courageous. After the death of Pappagallo, the Gyro Captain succeeds him as the leader of the settlers. * Mike Preston as Pappagallo, the idealistic leader of the settlers in the barricaded oil refinery. Even though the settlers' compound is besieged by a violent gang, Pappagallo \\"...carries the weight of his predicament with swaggering dignity.\\" * Max Phipps as the Toadie, the gang crier. He is an unkempt, bespectacled man. He wears a decorated mink stole as a hat and has many automobile badges and hood ornaments on his clothes. His behaviour with Lord Humungus and Wez make him a classic sycophant. Toadie takes pleasure in physically abusing helpless prisoners, but the gang has little respect for him. * Vernon Wells as Wez, a mohawked, leather-clad biker who serves as Lord Humungus' lieutenant in the gang. Vincent Canby, the New York Times reviewer, called the Wez character the \\"most evil of The Humungus's followers...[a] huge brute who rides around on his bike, snarling psychotically.\\" In the same Danny Peary interview, Miller states the characters of Wez and Max are near mirror images of each other, with each being chained by the leaders of their respective camps, and who both find themselves spurred on by the death of a loved one somewhere in their past, in Wez's case the relatively recent death of The Golden Youth at the hand of the Feral Kid. In 2011, Empire magazine listed Wez as the greatest movie henchman of all time.Top 10 Movie Henchmen. Empireonline.com. Retrieved on 18 November 2011. * Emil Minty as the Feral Kid, a boy who lives in the wasteland near the refinery settlement. He speaks only in growls and grunts. The boy wears shorts and boots made from hide, and defends himself with a lethal metal boomerang which he can catch using an improvised mail glove. The narration of the opening and closing sequences, provided by Harold Baigent, proves in the closing sequence to be that of the Feral Kid, grown to adulthood by then, and remembering the circumstances of his youthful encounter with \\"Mad\\" Max. * Kjell Nilsson as The Humungus, the violent yet charismatic and articulate leader of a \\"vicious gang of post- holocaust, motorcycle-riding vandals\\" who \\"loot, rape, and kill the few remaining wasteland dwellers\\".

Production =Development= Following the release of Mad Max, director George Miller received a number of offers from Hollywood, including one to direct First Blood. However, Miller instead decided to pursue a rock and roll movie under the working title of Roxanne. After working with writer Terry Hayes on the novelization of Mad Max, Miller and Hayes teamed up to write Roxanne in Los Angeles but the script was ultimately shelved. Miller then became more intrigued with the idea of returning to the world of Mad Max, as a larger budget would allow him to be more ambitious. \\"Making Mad Max was a very unhappy experience for me,\\" said Miller. \\"There was strong pressure to make a sequel, and I felt we could do a better job with a second movie.\\" Inspired by Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces and the work of Carl Jung, Miller recruited Hayes to join the production as a scriptwriter. Brian Hannant also came on board as co-writer and second unit director. Miller says that he was greatly influenced by the films of Akira Kurosawa. =Filming= Filming took place in the desert surrounding the remote mining town of Broken Hill, New South Wales. Principal photography took place over the course of twelve weeks in the winter of 1981 near Broken Hill. Scenes were shot at the Pinnacles, where the set of the compound was situated. The scene where the Pursuit Special rolls over and explodes was shot at Menindee Road on the Mundi Mundi Plains just outside Broken Hill. The original cut of the film was more bloody and violent, but it was cut down heavily by Australian censors. Entire scenes and sequences were deleted completely or edited to receive an \\"M\\" rating. When it was submitted to the MPAA in the United States, two additional scenes (Wez pulling an arrow out of his arm and a close-up shot of him pulling a boomerang out of his dead boyfriend's head) were shortened. Although there is a version of the film that includes the scenes trimmed down for the MPAA, no version without previous cuts exists. =Music= The musical score for Mad Max 2 was composed and conducted by Australian composer Brian May, who had previously composed the music for the first film. A soundtrack album was released in 1982 by Var√®se Sarabande. Release The film was a commercial success, grossing double Mad Maxs Australian record A$5.4 million, with a gross of A$10.8 million in Australia.Film Victoria ‚Äì Australian Films at the Australian Box Office Retrieved 19 March 2012 Despite beating Mad Maxs record, it wasn't the highest-grossing Australian film of the year in Australia, with Gallipoli grossing A$11.7 million. Renamed The Road Warrior in the United States, it also outperformed Mad Max there with a gross of US$23.6 million, earning theatrical rentals of $11 million. When Mad Max was released in 1980 in the United States, it did not receive a proper release from its distributor, American International Pictures. AIP was in the final stages of a change of ownership after being bought by Filmways, Inc. a year earlier. AIP's problems affected the release of the film and its box office in the US. Warner Bros. decided to release Mad Max 2 in the United States, but they recognised that the first film was not popular in North America. Although the original Mad Max was becoming popular through cable channel showings, Warner Bros. decided to change the name of its sequel to The Road Warrior. The advertising for the film, including print ads, trailers, and TV commercials, did not refer to the Max character at all, and all shied away from the fact that the film was a sequel. For the majority of viewers, their first inkling of Road Warrior being a sequel to Mad Max was when they saw the black and white, archival footage from the previous film during the prologue. Vestron Video capitalized by releasing Mad Max on video and subtitling it \\"the thrilling predecessor to The Road Warrior.\\" Outside of the US (including Australia), the film earned rentals of $25 million, for a worldwide total of $36 million making it the highest-grossing Australian film worldwide. =Critical reception= Mad Max 2 received positive reviews and is regarded by many critics as one of the best films of 1981. The film holds a 93% rating based on 45 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.43/10 and with the consensus, \\"The Road Warrior is everything a bigger-budgeted Mad Max sequel should be: bigger, faster, louder, but definitely not dumber.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praised its \\"skillful filmmaking,\\" and called it \\"a film of pure action, of kinetic energy\\", which is \\"one of the most relentlessly aggressive movies ever made\\". While Ebert pointed out that the film does not develop its \\"vision of a violent future world ... with characters and dialogue\\", and uses only the \\"barest possible bones of a plot\\", he praised its action sequences. Ebert called the climactic chase sequence \\"unbelievably well-sustained\\" and states that the \\"special effects and stunts...are spectacular\\", creating a \\"frightening, sometimes disgusting, and (if the truth be told) exhilarating\\" effect. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, \\"Never has a film's vision of the post-nuclear-holocaust world seemed quite as desolate and as brutal, or as action-packed and sometimes as funny as in George Miller's apocalyptic The Road Warrior, an extravagant film fantasy that looks like a sadomasochistic comic book come to life\\". In his review for Newsweek, Charles Michener praised Mel Gibson's \\"easy, unswaggering masculinity\\", saying that \\"[his] hint of Down Under humor may be quintessentially Australian but is also the stuff of an international male star\\". Gary Arnold, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, \\"While he seems to let triumph slip out of his grasp, Miller is still a prodigious talent, capable of a scenic and emotional amplitude that recalls the most stirring attributes in great action directors like Kurosawa, Peckinpah and Leone\\". Pauline Kael called Mad Max 2 a \\"mutant\\" film that was \\"...sprung from virtually all action genres\\", creating \\"...one continuous spurt of energy\\" by using \\"jangly, fast editing\\". However, Kael criticized director George Miller's \\"attempt to tap into the universal concept of the hero\\", stating that this attempt \\"makes the film joyless\\", \\"sappy\\", and \\"sentimental\\". The film's depiction of a post-apocalyptic future was widely copied by other filmmakers and in science fiction novels, to the point that its gritty \\"junkyard society of the future look...is almost taken for granted in the modern science-fiction action film.\\" The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction says that Mad Max 2, \\"with all its comic-strip energy and vividness...is exploitation cinema at its most inventive.\\" Richard Scheib called Mad Max 2 \\"one of the few occasions where a sequel makes a dramatic improvement in quality over its predecessor.\\" He said that the film is a \\"kinetic comic-book of a film,\\" an \\"exhilarating non-stop rollercoaster ride of a film that contains some of the most exciting stunts and car crashes ever put on screen.\\" Scheib stated that the film transforms the \\"post-holocaust landscape into the equivalent of a Western frontier,\\" such that \\"Mel Gibson's Max could just as easily be Clint Eastwood's tight-lipped Man With No Name\\" helping \\"decent frightened folk\\" from the \\"marauding Redskins\\". Christopher John reviewed Road Warrior in Ares Magazine #13 and commented that \\"Its taut scripting, exceptional performances, and pulse-pounding pacing, which leaves an audience breathless, combined to make it one of the best SF films of the year. It also has the courage to show what the face of death really looks like. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Max is hard, bitter and realistic; he is neither hero nor coward, but a man caught up in a mad future which he confronts unafraid.\\" =Awards= The film received much recognition from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films. It won the Saturn Award for Best International Film. It received additional nominations for Best Director, Best Writing, and Best Costume Design. Mel Gibson and Bruce Spence received nods for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. George Miller won the Grand Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival. Mad Max 2 was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and was awarded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association award for Best Foreign Film. The film was also recognised by the Australian Film Institute, winning awards for best direction, costume design, editing, production design and sound. It received additional nominations for the cinematography and musical score. Despite receiving the most nominations and wins, it was not nominated for Best Film. =Legacy= The Mad Max series of films, with their emphasis on dystopian, apocalyptic, and post-apocalyptic themes and imagery, have inspired some artists to recreate the look and feel of some aspects of the series in their work. As well, fan clubs and \\"road warrior\\"-themed activities continue into the 21st century. In 2008, Mad Max 2 was selected by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. Similarly, The New York Times placed the film on its Best 1000 Movies Ever list. Entertainment Weekly ranked Mad Max 2 93rd on their 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list in 1999, 41st on their updated All-Time 100 Greatest Films in 2013 list, and the character Mad Max as 11th on their list of The All Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture. In 2016, James Charisma of Playboy ranked the film #11 on a list of 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than the Originals. The film has a permanent legacy in the small town of Silverton, which is 25 kilometres from Broken Hill in New South Wales, Australia. A museum dedicated to Mad Max 2 was established in 2010 by Adrian and Linda Bennett, who developed the museum after moving to Silverton and building a collection of Mad Max props and memorabilia.

Biography Hill learned how to play the double bass from his father, a bass player for local jazz acts. His father died when he was fifteen. In 1970, together with schoolmate K. K. Downing, Hill formed heavy metal band Judas Priest. He has been playing bass with the band ever since, and is the only original member continuously in the band from the beginning, following Downing's departure in 2011. During the early years of the band, he played bass by finger-picking, but has since preferred to play with a pick. Hill is responsible for bringing Rob Halford into Judas Priest. The two met while Hill was dating Halford's sister and mentioned that he needed a new vocalist for his band. Halford accepted, leaving his previous band Hiroshima, and brought along drummer John Hinch, who would later be dropped by the band after one album due to \\"musical inadequacy\\", according to Judas Priest's website.  Musical equipment  In the early years of Judas Priest, Hill played a 1970s Fender Jazz Bass, switching to Hamer in the mid-1980s. Since the late 1980s, Hill has played Spector basses. Spector currently produce an Ian Hill signature bass guitar, based on Hill's NS-2 and fitted with a narrower neck, with an optional tuning of BEAD. He plays using a nylon flatpick of 0.75 mm thickness. While Hill has used a wide range of different amplifiers through his career, he has been using SWR products since the late 1990s.

During the Jugulator and Demolition recording sessions, Hill used a 5 string Spector bass to access the lower registers needed through the use of down tuned guitars by Tipton and Downing. Personal life Hill married Rob Halford's sister, Sue, in 1976 and they divorced in 1984. Together they have a son, Alex, who was born in 1980.

When Hill was asked about his reaction to the 2001 film Rock Star, which was originally inspired by the real-life story of Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens, a singer in a Judas Priest tribute band who was chosen to replace singer Rob Halford when he left the band, in an interview with PopMatters magazine, Hill responded \\"Well, it was a true work of fiction, you know? When we heard about the production company were going to make a movie based, as far as we knew, about Ripper joining the band we offered our help. We said 'If there's anything you want to know, talk to us at the time.' And certainly our communication was cut off and that was it and they went off on their own tangent.\\" Hill added \\"I mean, I quite enjoyed the movie. [laughs] It was entertaining, you know?\\" Hill was quoted as saying \\"It had nothing to do with Rob Halford, Ripper Owens and Judas Priest, it's got nothing to do with that, whatsoever. It was fiction. Apart from the fact that 'Local Boy Makes Good'? That was the only true aspect of the movie.\\" Hill was quick to add \\"I watched it once. I don't have the urge to watch it again.

Select a particular edition (title) for more data at that level, such as a front cover image or linked contents Cook spent time in the United States Navy and later worked his way through college. Cook began to write in earnest while working for General Motors at an auto assembly plant in a job which was \\"hard to learn, but [involved] almost no mental effort\\", writing as many as three books per year. Cook wrote The Black Company, a novel published by Tor Fantasy in May 1984. It began a gritty fantasy series of the same name (or Chronicles of the Black Company) following an elite mercenary unit through several decades of its history. As of 2016, it comprises the novels published in three subseries 1984‚Äì85, 1989‚Äì90, and 1996‚Äì2000, plus recent short fiction. It has become something of a cult classic, especially among current and former members of the military. When asked about the series' popularity among soldiers, Cook replied: \\"The characters act like the guys actually behave. It doesn't glorify war; it's just people getting on with the job. The characters are real soldiers. They're not soldiers as imagined by people who've never been in the service. That's why service guys like it.\\" Cook is also known for his Garrett P.I. series, which tells the haphazard adventures of hardboiled detective Garrett, and his Dread Empire series.

He first gained attention as the lead singer of Judas Priest and then Iced Earth. He took the nickname \\"Ripper\\" from the Judas Priest song \\"The Ripper\\" during his time in the tribute band \\"British Steel\\". Early life Owens was born on September 13, 1967, in Akron, Ohio. He graduated from Kenmore High School in 1985. Career =Brainicide and Winter's Bane/British Steel= Owens began his musical career as the singer for Brainicide, a thrash metal band based in his home town of Akron, Ohio that had also been known as Dammage, Inc. He recorded 3 demo tapes with them before the band split in 1989. Prior to joining Judas Priest in 1996, Owens fronted a band called Winter's Bane, with whom he recorded an album called Heart of a Killer in 1993. He was most prominent in his role as the frontman of Judas Priest tribute band British Steel, named after the Judas Priest album, although the bands Winter's Bane and British Steel were actually one and the same. The band would often open their shows as Winter's Bane in order to introduce the audience to their original material. After finishing their original set, they would then take a break, which included a wardrobe change to emulate the subject of their tribute, Judas Priest. Winter's Bane sound engineer Ken Reffner would come out from behind the soundboard, adding a fifth member to the stage. Reffner can be seen playing the part of K. K. Downing with British Steel in the Judas Priest episode of VH1's Behind the Music. =Judas Priest= Owens (center) with Judas Priest in 2002 Owens made headlines in 1996 when he went from being a fan of the metal act Judas Priest to being their lead singer, replacing Rob Halford. Despite numerous rumors that Halford would reunite with Priest, Owens recorded two studio albums with his childhood heroes, as well as two live albums and a 2002 DVD release. Owens also helped write one Judas Priest song, \\"What's My Name?\\", which was a bonus track on Demolition. With Judas Priest, he was nominated once for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1999, with the song \\"Bullet Train\\" from the album Jugulator, but lost to Metallica's \\"Better than You\\". Rock Star The movie Rock Star (2001), about a tribute band singer who is asked to join the band he has tried to imitate, was loosely based on Owens' career. Judas Priest disavowed the movie after they were denied creative control in the screenplay and script. For example, in Rock Star the band throws out their original singer while on tour and replaces him a few days later; while in real life, Rob Halford was not thrown out, but left Judas Priest, four years before he was replaced. Owens said of the movie, \\"They fabricated things and decided to pull away from my story and make their own because I guess mine was too normal. There's no telling what they put in there. If I could sue, I would.\\" =Iced Earth and Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force= Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford in 2003. Owens seized opportunity when, that same year, vocalist Matt Barlow quit Iced Earth. Iced Earth's first album with Owens, The Glorious Burden, came out in early 2004. While singing with Judas Priest, Owens had toured with Iced Earth (and Anthrax) in 2001, but the tour was cut short. In 2006, Owens also reunited with his former Winter's Bane colleague Dennis Hayes in a band called Beyond Fear. The self-titled debut album from his new band was released in May of that year. Hayes would join Iced Earth as well in 2007 after bassist James \\"Bo\\" Wallace left due to family health issues. Owens' stay in Iced Earth was short, however, as on December 11, 2007, guitarist Jon Schaffer announced that Owens would be leaving the band; Matt Barlow had been invited to return to the line-up after heavy feedback from fans. On February 26, 2008, it was announced that Owens would be the new lead singer for Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force, replacing Doogie White. Owens quit Malmsteen's band in 2012, saying there were conflicts in show dates between his solo band and Yngwie's touring, but that he would be open to the possibility of working with him again. In May 2009, Owens released his first solo album, Play My Game. The album featured many prominent metal musicians. A European tour followed in 2010, accompanied by musicians Anders Buaas (guitar), Jon Vegard Naess (guitar), Are Gogstad (bass), and Henrik \\"Rick\\" Hagan (drums). =Charred Walls of the Damned, HAIL! and Dio Disciples= Owens in 2009 Owens now fronts a new project called Charred Walls of the Damned, a band founded in 2009 by Richard Christy, radio personality on The Howard Stern Show and former drummer for Iced Earth and Death. The origin of the band's name was explained on May 20, 2009. It derives from a series of radio prank calls Christy made to a Christian radio station. In response to the pranks they received, the host described how he prays for them, thus \\"saving their soul to be saved by God's grace...not in the devil's hell where you'd be putting your nails in the charred walls of the damned\\". The band features Christy on drums and Owens on vocals, along with Steve DiGiorgio (bass guitar) and Jason Suecof (lead guitar). The band's debut self-titled album was released on February 2, 2010 through Metal Blade Records. Owens is also a member of a cover band called HAIL!. HAIL!'s rotating cast of members include Owens, Andreas Kisser, Paul Bostaph, David Ellefson, Mike Portnoy, Jimmy DeGrasso, and Roy Mayorga. Owens, DeGrasso, Ellefson, and Kisser formed the band in late 2008. They toured Europe in 2009, June 2010, and came together to perform at a benefit for Deftones bassist Chi Cheng in 2010. The lineup consisted of Owens, Portnoy, Mark Anthony of the Letter Black, Phil Demmel of Machine Head, and Ellefson. HAIL! is on their second European tour with the lineup Andreas Kisser, Owens, Paul Bostaph, and James LoMenzo. Due to the death of previously announced bassist Paul Gray, LoMenzo agreed on one day's notice to fly to Portugal for the Rock in Rio festival where HAIL! was scheduled to perform on May 30, 2010. In early 2011, Owens also joined Dio Disciples, which features former Dio members. =Other projects= Other music projects of Owens include Project Rock with Keri Kelli, Rudy Sarzo, James Kottak, and Teddy Zig Zag. Owens owned \\"Ripper's Rock House\\", a sports eatery, restaurant and entertainment venue, in Akron, Ohio. In August 2015, Bar Rescue filmed and transformed the bar into \\"Tim Owens' Traveler's Tavern\\" The venue closed permanently in September 2016. He was also the owner of \\"Ripper Owens Tap House\\", the predecessor to \\"Ripper's Rock House\\", in Akron's Firestone Park neighborhood. In 2015, Owens recorded music for the fictional band Witches' Lips for the heavy metal horror film Hairmetal Shotgun Zombie Massacre: The Movie. He recorded and wrote the lyrics with guitarist Marzi Montazeri of Philip H. Anselmo and The Illegals. Ted Kirkpatrick, drummer and songwriter for the Christian metal band Tourniquet, announced on July 25, 2018, that Owens would be doing lead vocals for all the songs (except the title track \\"Gazing at Medusa\\") on their next album. The album, Gazing at Medusa, was released on October 16, 2018.

This allows for highly customized window handling such as web browser windows opening full-screen without borders on a secondary monitor, a default terminal emulator window displaying full-screen at the desktop level, and all dialog box windows under a certain size opening on the lower right corner of the main monitor while larger ones are centered. Sawfish uses a Lisp-like scripting language, rep, for all of its code and configuration, making it particularly easy to customize, or program many kinds of behavior, responding to window creation, deletion, or any other changes. There is a GUI configuration utility for users who do not wish to edit configuration files directly.  History  Sawfish was first called Sawmill.

It is located immediately west of Stellarton and about four kilometres southwest of New Glasgow, the major town in the area. History Originally called Acadian Village, the name Westville was chosen because the community was west of the Albion Mines (now Stellarton). Westville has a long history of coal mining dating back to 1864 when coal was first discovered. The opening of the Acadia Mine followed in 1866. Westville, along with Stellarton, was once home to a thriving coal mining industry. At its peak, during World War I, Westville boasted three underground workings; the Black Diamond, the Acadia, and the Drummond. Westville was the site of the Drummond Mine explosion on May 13, 1873. The last underground mine, the Drummond pit, closed in the 1970s. Extensive open-pit mining on the Drummond and Acadia sites was carried out throughout the 1980s and 1990s, by Pioneer Coal Limited of Antigonish, Nova Scotia. In the early 1900s Westville also boasted the largest natural ice skating rink east of Montreal. Today the miner's monument at Acadia Park honoring those touched by the town's mining disasters, and a community centre is all that remains of its proud coal mining heritage. The war memorial was sculpted by the renowned Emanuel Hahn. Like many coal towns Westville was a hotbed of sports. Baseball was very popular among the miners. One of the Westville baseball teams was crowned Maritime champion in 1927 and the legendary Babe Ruth visited the town in 1936 and hit a ball over the centre field fence. The town also sponsored championship cricket, lacrosse, football and hockey teams.  Demographics  Train bridge on Alma rd. In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Westville recorded a population of 3,628 living in 1,586 of its 1,698 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 3,798. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.  Amenities  The Westville post office was built sometime between 1904 and 1916. While mainly a bedroom community, Westville's Main Street features banks, shops, restaurants and other amenities. A Nova Scotia highway rest stop was opened at the end of Cowan Street off exit 21 of Highway 104, part of the Trans-Canada Highway. One of the largest Canada Day celebrations in Atlantic Canada takes place in Westville. The five-day event includes a county fair, street parade, and annual guest bands from around the world.

The indigenous inhabitants of what's now known as the Island of Montreal called it Skowanoti, meaning \\"River behind the island\\". Geography Flowing west to east, the Rivi√®re des Prairies bisects the Hochelaga Archipelago and originates in the Lake of Two Mountains. It flows on either side of √éle Bizard (part of Montreal), then divides the Island of Montreal (Montreal) to the south from √éle J√©sus (Laval) to the north, after which it flows into the St. Lawrence River at the eastern tip of the Island of Montreal. The river contains a large number of islands, including √éle Bizard, the √éles Laval (√éle Bigras, √éle Pariseau, √éle Verte and √éle Ronde) belonging to Laval, and √éle de la Visitation, a nature park belonging to Montreal. There are also islands named √éle Mercier, √éle M√©nard, √éle Jasmin, √éle Barwick, √éle de Roxboro, √éle aux Chats, √éle Paton, √éle Perry, √éle Lapierre, √éle Boutin, √éle Rochon and √éle Gagn√©.

Whenever there is significant rainfall on the island of Montreal, household sewage is mixed with the city street rainwater and discharged untreated into the river. This sewage turns the river into essentially an open sewer. The sewage problem was reported in the year 1911., and a need to purify Montreal sewage in 1935.

From Bing maps, many of the sewage output locations can be seen on the river shoreline. The solution to the visible pollution (plastic bags, toilet paper, condoms) that accumulates on the shoreline is to use a type of a screen at all the storm drains and outlets that expel the rainwater-garbage mixture into the river.

As marshals became trusted members of the courts of Medieval Europe, the title grew in reputation. During the last few centuries, it has been used for elevated offices, such as in military rank and civilian law enforcement. Etymology \\"Marshal\\" is an ancient loanword from Norman French (cf. modern French mar√©chal), which in turn is borrowed from Old Frankish *marhskalk (=\\"stable boy, keeper, servant\\"), being still evident in Middle Dutch maerscalc, marscal, and in modern Dutch maarschalk (=\\"military chief commander\\"; the meaning influenced by the French use). It is cognate with Old High German mar(ah)-scalc \\"id.\\", modern German (Feld-)Marschall (=\\"military chief commander\\"; the meaning again influenced by the French use). It originally and literally meant \\"horse servant\\", from Germanic *marha- \\"horse\\" (cf. English mare and modern German M√§hre, meaning \\"horse of bad quality\\") and *skalk- \\"servant\\" (cf. Old Engl. scealc \\"servant, soldier\\" and outdated German Schalk, meaning \\"high-ranking servant\\").Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch, Leipzig 1854‚Äì1960, Vol. 12 Col. 1673 Online-Version This \\"horse servant\\" origin is retained in the current French name for farrier: mar√©chal- ferrant. The late Roman and Byzantine title of comes stabuli (\\"count of the stables\\") was a calque of the Germanic, which became Old French con(n)estable and modern conn√©table, and, borrowed from the Old French, the English word \\"constable\\". Finally, in Byzantium, a marshal with elevated authority, notably a borderlands military command, was also known as an exarch. Military In many countries, the rank of marshal, cf. field marshal, is the highest army rank, outranking other general officers. The equivalent navy rank is often admiral of the fleet or grand admiral. Marshals are typically, but not exclusively, appointed only in wartime. In many countries, especially in Europe, the special symbol of a marshal is a baton, and their insignia often incorporate batons. In some countries, the term \\"marshal\\" is used instead of \\"general\\" in the higher air force ranks. The four highest Royal Air Force ranks are marshal of the Royal Air Force, air chief marshal, air marshal and air vice marshal (although the first named, which has generally been suspended as a peacetime rank, is the only one which can properly be considered a marshal). The five-star rank of marshal of the Air Force is used by some Commonwealth and Middle Eastern air forces. In the French Army and most National Armies modeled upon the French system, mar√©chal des logis (\\"marshal- of-lodgings\\") is a cavalry term equivalent to sergeant. Some historical rulers have used special \\"marshal\\" titles to reward certain subjects. Though not strictly military ranks, these honorary titles have been exclusively bestowed upon successful military leaders, such as the famous grand marshal of Ayacucho Antonio Jos√© de Sucre. Most famous are the Marshals of France (Mar√©chaux de France), not least under Napol√©on I. Another such title was that of Reichsmarschall, bestowed upon Hermann G√∂ring by Adolf Hitler, although it was never a regular title as it had been \\"invented\\" for G√∂ring who was the only titleholder in history. In England during the First Barons' War the title \\"Marshal of the Army of God and Holy Church\\" was bestowed upon Robert Fitzwalter by election. Both the Soviet Union and Russia have army general as well as \\"marshal\\" in their rank system, the latter being largely an honorary rank. =Marshal ranks by country= The following articles discuss the rank of marshal as used by specific countries: *Feldmarschall and Feldmarschalleutnant (Austro-Hungarian Empire) * Marshal of Bolivia * Marshal (Brazil) * Marshal (Bulgaria) * Rigsmarsk (Denmark) * Marshal of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) * Marshal of Finland * France ** Marshal of France (includes Marshal of the Empire, both equivalent to a six-star general) ** Marshal-of-Lodgings (equivalent to sergeant) * German Empire (Deutsches Kaiserreich 1871‚Äì1918; and also in Nazi Germany 1933‚Äì1945) ** Generalfeldmarschall (\\"General Field Marshal\\") * Japan ** Sh≈çgun (initially equivalent to marshal, but in later periods, hereditary military dictator) * Italy ** Marshal of Italy ** Marshal (Italy) ‚Äì a warrant officer rank * Land marshal of the Livonian Order * Marshal of the Mongolian People's Republic * Marshal (Mozambique) * Marshal of the air force (New Zealand) * Marshal of Paraguay * Marshal of Peru * Marsza≈Çek Polski (Poland) * Marshal (Portugal) * Mare»ôal (Romania) * Field Marshal (Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia) * Marshal of the Russian Federation (Russian Federation) * The Soviet Union had three marshals ranks (from highest to lowest): ** Marshal of the Soviet Union ** Chief marshal of the branch was used in five Soviet military branches: the air force, artillery, armoured troops, engineer troops, and signal troops. ** Marshal of the branch was used in five Soviet military branches ‚Äì the air force, artillery, armoured troops, engineer troops, and signal troops. Marshal of the branch is considered equivalent to the rank general of the army, which was used in the infantry and the marines. * Mare≈üal (Turkey) * Field marshal, marshal of the Royal Air Force (United Kingdom) * Marshal of Venezuela * Marshal of Yugoslavia (SFR Yugoslavia) See also: * Mariscal and the upper condestable (Spanish language countries) =Marshal equivalents= These ranks are considered the equivalent to a marshal: * Chom Phon (Thailand) * General of the army, fleet admiral and general of the Air Force (United States) * Arteshbod (Iran) * Mushir (Arab countries) * Protostrator (in Frankish Greece, deriving from the Byzantine Empire, likewise deriving from the post of \\"stable-master\\") * Stratarches (modern Greece) * Vojvoda (Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia) * Vrhovnik (Croatia) * Wonsu (North Korea and South Korea) * Yuan Shuai (modern China) * Sima (ancient China) * Gensui (Japan) * Nguy√™n so√°i (Vietnam) * ·ûü·üÅ·ûì·û∂·ûî·üí·ûö·ûò·ûª·ûÅ (Marshal or Field Marshal) or ·ûì·û∂·ûô·ûß·ûè·üí·ûè·ûò·ûü·üÅ·ûì·û∏·ûô·üç·ûï·ûª·ûè·ûõ·üÅ·ûÅ (General of the Army) (Cambodia) =Military police= The name is also applied to the leader of military police organizations. *Provost marshal ‚Äì a term used in many countries *Provost Marshal General ‚Äì head of the military police in the United States Ceremonial and protocol Usually in monarchies, one or several of the senior dignitaries wear the title of Marshal or a compound such as Court Marshal (not related to court martial, therefore usually called Marshal of the Court to prevent confusion) or more rarely Grand Marshal. The function of the Marshal of the Court varies according to national tradition, but frequently he is the chief of staff of the monarch's household (meaning the palace and other domains). Often, the charge includes also the honorary privilege as chief of the protocol to announce formally the arrival of VIP guests at audiences, state dinners, and conferences in the monarch's premises. This office was often made hereditary in the high nobility, e.g., the English Earl Marshal, or the Scots Earl Marischal. Civilian The term is also used in more ordinary contexts, such as modern pageantry; for example, the grand marshal of a parade is often an honored guest or dignitary. In the United States, many colleges and universities have marshals. In some cases, there is a single \\"faculty marshal,\\" appointed to the post on a more or less permanent basis. In other cases, there are one or several faculty marshals, and often one or several student marshals appointed for a single occasion. In all cases, the post is one of honor given to a senior faculty member or outstanding student, and the functions are generally limited to leading processions or parts of processions during commencement exercises, academic convocations, encaenia and similar events. These marshals often carry maces, staffs or wands of office. A chief usher at a large wedding is sometimes called a wedding marshal. In addition to coordinating other ushers in attending guests, the wedding marshal may be a messenger between parties to signal the impending start of the service or communicate delays. In a church wedding, particularly a nuptial mass, these functions may be assumed by a verger. The wedding marshal is a position of honor and trust, often filled by a close friend or relative. Political =Dignitaries of Poland= Apart from its military uses, the Polish word marsza≈Çek (marshal) also refers to certain political offices: *Marsza≈Çek Sejmu and Marsza≈Çek Senatu: the respective speakers of the lower house (Sejm) and upper house (Senate) of Poland's parliament, usually nominated by the governing party or coalition; *Marsza≈Çek Wojew√≥dztwa (voivodeship marshal): since 1999, the leader of the executive of a voivodeship (one of Poland's 16 provinces), elected by the regional assembly (sejmik), and co-existing with the government-appointed voivode (governor). =Demonstration marshal= Demonstration marshals, also called stewards, are used by the organizers of large or controversial demonstrations, rallies and protests, to help ensure the safety of the participants.Belyaeva et al. (2007) Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly, published by OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. Alternative version Bryan, Dominic The Anthropology of Ritual: Monitoring and Stewarding Demonstrations in Northern Ireland, Anthropology in Action, Volume 13, Numbers 1‚Äì2, January 2006, pp.22‚Äì31(10) They are especially important for preventing infiltration by agents provocateurs. Sports =Racing and other competitions= In motorsports, such as auto racing, motorcycle racing, and rallying, the track marshals wave the racing flags and assist crashed or broken-down vehicles and their drivers, while pit marshals watch over the procedures in the pits, and fire marshals assist in the event of a fire on the track or in the pit. The FIA provides general rules and recommendations on marshalling. In the 1977 South African Grand Prix, 1977 Japanese Grand Prix, 2000 Italian Grand Prix, 2001 Australian Grand Prix, and 2013 Canadian Grand Prix, track marshals were victims of fatal accidents. In some organized competitions, such as the endurance competition \\"Tough Guy,\\" officials seeing to the observance of the rules are styled marshals. In road running races, in particular, course marshals enforce rules of competition and assist runners as needed. Games The marshal is the highest playing piece in the board game Stratego. Law enforcement The word Mar√©chauss√©e derives from the French word Mar√©chal (plural Mar√©chaux), which was the second highest military charge in feudal France after Conn√©table (Constable), the military Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armed Forces until 1627, when the charge of Constable was abolished. The Constable and the Marshals had also jurisdictional powers, at first only over members of the armed forces. The additional conferring of police powers led to the creation of the \\"Corps of the Mar√©chauss√©e\\" (\\"Marshalcy\\"; the forerunner of the modern Gendarmerie) and to an Ancien R√©gime Court of Justice called the \\"Tribunal of the Constable and the Marshals of France\\" which was competent for judging military personnel and civilians alike in cases of petty violations of the law. The term Mar√©chauss√©e was also used for the Continental Army's military police during the American Revolution. In the present-day Netherlands, the Koninklijke Marechaussee (\\"Royal Marshalcy\\") is a national military police force with civilian competences, similar to the French Gendarmerie nationale. United States In the United States, marshal is used particularly for various types of law enforcement officers. =Federal marshals= The federal court system in the United States is organized into 94 federal judicial districts, each with a court (and one or several judges), a United States Attorney with assistants such as prosecutors and government lawyers, and one marshal, appointed by the president, in charge of federal law enforcement. The courts are part of the independent judicial branch of the government, while the marshals and U.S. attorneys are part of the Department of Justice in the executive branch. In actual practice, the U.S. marshal for the district primarily oversees court security, and has a unit of appointed deputies and special deputies. (Other law enforcement operations and the federal prison system are handled by a variety of federal police agencies.) The United States Marshals Service is a professional, civil service unit of federal police, part of the system of marshals, made up of career law enforcement personnel rather than the appointed district marshals. The U.S. Marshals Service assists with court security and prisoner transport, asset forfeiture, serves arrest warrants and seeks fugitives. The Federal Air Marshal Service is a separate armed federal law enforcement service employed to protect commercial airliners from the threat of aircraft hijacking. These air marshals work for the Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. Supreme Court maintains its own, separate Marshal of the United States Supreme Court, who also controls the U.S. Supreme Court Police, a security police service answerable to the court itself, rather than to the president or attorney general. It handles security for the Supreme Court building and for the justices personally, and undertakes whatever other missions the court may require or assign. =State and local marshals= In many U.S. states, marshals can be found acting at the state, local or municipal level; marshals can be court bailiffs or process servers, or even fully sworn police officers. In some states, they may be sworn peace officers, however their job is, in certain cases, entirely civil rather than criminal law enforcement. In other states, some communities maintain a Town or City Marshal who is responsible for all general law enforcement within the respective jurisdiction, as well as court duties, while others are strictly court officers. This is especially true in communities with both police and marshals. The position of Marshal vastly differs from state to state. At least one local railroad servicing company's part-time public safety staff, which are both fire and police trained, is supervised by a chief marshal. American Old West (for example, Arizona Territory and Texas of the 1880s): Marshals, usually called town marshals or city marshals (since the larger cities were often punctilious about their titles), were appointed or elected police officers of small communities, with powers and duties similar to those of a police chief; these powers generally ended at the border of the community. By contrast, federal marshals (U.S. marshals) worked in a larger territory, especially in pioneer country, and this area could potentially overlap with the state or territorial office of county sheriff (who then, as now, policed communities, as well as areas between communities). The word marshal is still used in this sense, especially in the American Southwest. (See List of Western lawmen.) Town or city marshal is still the name for the head officer of some community police forces. Arizona: Cities and towns decide whether to appoint or elect a marshal, or have the board, council, or city manager hire a chief of police as the top criminal law enforcement official for their jurisdiction (as in the town of Tombstone). Marshals are elected by the trustees to serve a fixed term, and chiefs of police can be fired at will by whomever hired them, just like any other employee. California: Several urban counties (including Los Angeles, San Bernardino County, California, and San Diego) once maintained separate county marshal's offices, which served as court officers similar to U.S. marshals or constables, but mainly for the municipal court system. This system was abolished by state law in 2000, when the sheriffs of those counties announced that those counties' marshals would be absorbed into their departments. Therefore, many have been merged into or taken over by the local county sheriff's office, with the exceptions of Shasta County and Trinity County both located in Northern California. As of 2010, the marshal of San Benito County has been disbanded as an independent organization, with its employees becoming part of the sheriff's office. California also has fire marshals and deputy fire marshals, who may work for the State of California Fire Marshal's Office, or various county, city or special districts throughout the state. Fire marshals and deputy fire marshals are full-time sworn peace officers throughout the state, with powers of arrest statewide under section 830.37 of the California Penal Code. Their responsibilities include fire and arson investigation, bomb and explosives investigation, general law enforcement, as well as enforcement of the fire code. Colorado: Cities, towns and villages decide whether to appoint or elect a marshal, or have the board, council, or city manager hire a chief of police as the top criminal law enforcement for their jurisdiction. Marshals are elected by the trustees to serve a fixed term, and chiefs of police can be fired at will by whoever hired them, just like any other employee. Connecticut: In 2000, Connecticut eliminated the county sheriff system, and replaced it with two types of marshals. State marshals operate out of the executive branch of state government. They are sworn peace officers who perform a wide range of duties, including service of process, seizing money and property under court order, evictions, serving tax warrants, and arresting individuals on bench warrants. Judicial marshals are employed by the judicial branch. They are sworn peace officers who perform court security and transport detainees to and from court. Georgia: The marshal is a commissioned armed and uniformed law enforcement officer of the county state courts which have jurisdiction over civil matters and state ordinances. In the Atlanta metro counties, marshal's offices enforce evictions, foreclosures, subpoenas, civil forfeitures, judgements, seizure, liens, repossession, and garnishment. With a few exceptions, elsewhere in Georgia, the sheriff's office is responsible for enforcement of these duties, with some sheriffs' offices having an assigned unit or personnel for these duties. Indiana: Indiana Town Marshals are fully-sworn, ILEA certified police officers who act as the chief police officer of a town. General police terms in Indiana vary by what local government one works for; for example: counties have Sheriff's/deputies, cities have Police Departments/Officers and Towns have Marshals/deputies. In Indiana, a town is managed by a council without an elected mayor, whereas a city has a mayor and, thus, a city police department. Marshals are responsible for all law enforcement in their respective town, and their primary duties are the enforcement of local and state laws or ordinances as well as code enforcement. The Town Marshal may also be the town's humane law enforcement officer. Town marshals are fully sworn state certified police officers though the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy, having law enforcement authority statewide; therefore, it is not at all uncommon for Town Marshals to be seen outside of their bailiwicks assisting other police agencies. Some town marshal agencies in Indiana can be quite large. A Town Marshal can appoint any number of unpaid deputy town marshals or reserve officers who may exercise full police powers in the state. Indiana Town Marshals are authorized to enforce not only city/town code, but also county ordinances; this differs from city police departments where a city police officer may only enforce city code or a sheriff's deputy, who may only enforce county code. Indiana Code recognizes Town Marshals as Police Officers, therefore it is very common for Indiana Town Marshal's Offices to go simply by \\"Police Department\\" . Under Indiana Code IC36-5-7 the marshal is described as \\"the chief police officer of the town and has the powers of other law enforcement officers in executing the orders of the legislative body and enforcing laws. The marshal or his deputy: # shall serve all process directed to him by the town court or legislative body; # shall arrest without process all persons who commit an offense within his view, take them before a court having jurisdiction, and detain them in custody until the cause of the arrest has been investigated; # shall suppress breaches of the peace; # may, if necessary, call the power of the town to his aid; # may execute search warrants and arrest warrants; and # may pursue and jail persons who commit an offense.\\" Maine: The State Marshal Service provides physical security and law enforcement duties to the judicial system, as well as protection of all state judges. Deputy marshals are fully sworn state law enforcement officers with statewide authority. Missouri: There are two types of marshal: :State marshals provide physical security and law enforcement duties to the judicial system, as well as protection of all state judges. Deputy marshals are fully sworn state law enforcement officers with statewide authority. :City marshals, at the local level in the State of Missouri, are elected chief law enforcement officers of a city. They have the same police powers as a regular police officer within the city limits. The amount of training to be a city marshal is far less than a regular municipal police officer; as such, a marshal's jurisdiction is strictly limited to the city limits of the city to which they are elected. Even if they witness a violation of the law in their city, they cannot pursue a person who flees beyond the city limits. The position of city marshal is rare in the state of Missouri and is only found in very small rural cities that do not have the budget to maintain a police department. NevadaCity of Las Vegas Deputy City Marshals units parked just outside of the Fremont Street Experience. :City marshals and deputy city marshals have, by law, the same authority as a municipal (village, town, or city) police officer. However, those municipalities, such as Las Vegas, that have both a police force as well as a city marshal's office, often utilize the police as the general law enforcement agency of the municipality, while court security and process service is provided by the city marshal's office. In municipalities that do not have a police department, the city marshal's office sometimes serves as the agency that provides general law enforcement services to residents. ::Las Vegas has two types of marshal: :::Municipal court marshals who serve the municipal court by serving warrants and subpoenas and to make arrests for offenses under the jurisdiction of the municipal court; and to maintain order in the court and escort personnel to court and jail.http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/files/Hiring_Standard_For_Law_Enforcement_Positions_CLV.pdf :::City marshals who provide law enforcement services to city employees, residents and tourists utilizing city facilities located within the city limits, specifically those located on property owned, leased, operated or otherwise under the control of the city of Las Vegas.

Conducting security and safety evaluations requested by city departments at various facilities, buildings and workplaces. ::Henderson has Marshals as well: ::Municipal Court Marshals work for the courts by serving warrants and to make arrests for offenses under the jurisdiction of the municipal court; and to maintain order in the court and escort personnel to court and jail. New York: There are two levels of marshals: :City marshals are the elected chief law enforcement officers of a city or town. They have the same police powers as a regular police officer within the city limits. The amount of training to be a city marshal is far less than for a regular municipal police officer; as such a marshal's jurisdiction is strictly limited to the city limits of the city to which they are elected.

The position of city marshal is rare in the State of New York and is now only found in very small rural cities that do not have the budget to maintain a police department. :New York City Marshals are appointed by the Mayor of New York City to five-year terms, but receive no salary from the city. The city's statutes specify that no more than 83 city marshals shall be appointed by a mayor. Marshals primarily enforce orders from civil court cases, including collecting on judgments, towing, seizing utility meters and carrying out evictions. Marshals collectively perform approximately 25,000 evictions per year. They are regulated by the NYC Department of Investigation but, unlike the city sheriff, they are not city employees. Marshals collect fees, which are set by statute, from private litigants when they are called on to enforce judgments, and they also retain five percent of any money they collect on judgments. City marshals may, depending on the court order brought to them by the winning litigant, seize money, movable property (for instance, inventory from a business), vehicles; as is the case with unpaid parking tickets, and return possession of rental premises to the landlord, (also known as eviction), and more. On an annual basis city marshals must pay the City of New York $1,500 plus 4.5 percent of the fees they receive for collecting judgments. Ohio: The term village marshal has been used for the same function, often filled without colleagues, directly under the mayor. Texas: City marshals and deputy city marshals have, by law, the same authority as a municipal (village, town, or city) police officer. However, municipalities (like Fort Worth), that have both a police force as well as a city marshal's office, often utilize the police as the general law enforcement agency of the municipality, while court security and process service is provided by the city marshal's office. In municipalities that do not have a police department, the city marshal's office sometimes serves as the agency that provides general law enforcement services to residents. Washington state: The city of Seattle employs marshals in their municipal court, with the senior officer holding the title of chief marshal and the subordinate officers known as deputy marshals. Seattle Marshals provide court security and law enforcement services within the court. They handle arrests of out-of-custody defendants within the courthouse and transport in custody defendants to and from court hearings.http://www.seattle.gov/courts/about/seattle-municipal-court-marshals --security The King County Sheriff's Office (county seat in Seattle) also employs court marshals, which is a unit under the sheriff's office. In the Old-West themed town of Winthrop, the municipal police force is headed by a town marshal, consistent with the Old West restoration of the buildings and tourist attractions. Wisconsin: The duty of a marshal, that he or she generally speaking, occupies the same relation to the governmental affairs of the municipality as the sheriff does to the county. United Kingdom =England= City Marshal of the City of London, on duty at the Lord Mayor's Show. The hereditary title of \\"marshal\\" at one time designated the head of household security for the King of England. William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, served four kings in this office, ultimately becoming one of the most powerful men in Europe; by the time he died in 1219, people throughout Europe (not just England) referred to William Marshal simply as \\"the marshal\\". The office of hereditary Marshal (or Earl Marshal) thus evolved into that of a Great Officer of State. The task of maintaining law and order within the King's Court then devolved upon the office of Knight Marshal (established in 1236). Together with his officers, the King's (or Queen's) Marshalmen, the Knight Marshal continued to have restricted powers of arrest within a radius of the sovereign's palace until 1846, when the office was abolished. In 1595, Queen Elizabeth I issued letters patent giving powers to a marshal to maintain order within the City of London. Later, an under-marshal and six city marshalmen were appointed to assist the marshal in his duties. As a result of the Police Acts of 1829 and 1839, the marshal's role changed significantly. , one city marshal, currently Colonel Billy King-Harman, CBE, still acts as peacekeeper to the Lord Mayor of London, leading processions and representing the Lord Mayor at all Entries of Troops (challenging and then escorting those few regiments entitled to march though the City of London). =Scotland= The office of \\"marischal of Scotland\\" (marascallus Scotie or marscallus Scotie) had been held heritably by the senior member of the Keith family since Hervey de Keith, who held the office of marischal under Malcolm IV and William I. The descendant of Herveus, Sir Robert de Keith (d. 1332), was confirmed in the office of \\"Great Marischal of Scotland\\" by Robert Bruce around 1324. Robert de Keith's great-grandson, William, was raised to the peerage as Earl Marischal by James II in about 1458. The peerage died out when George Keith, the 10th Earl, forfeited it by joining the Jacobite Rising of 1715. The marischal was to serve as custodian of the Royal Regalia of Scotland, and protect the king's person when attending parliament. The former duty was fulfilled by the 7th Earl during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, who hid the Royal Regalia at Dunnottar Castle. The role of regulation of heraldry carried out by the English Earl Marshal is carried out in Scotland by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The separate office of Knight Marischal was first created for the Scottish coronation of Charles I in 1633. The office is not heritable, although it has been held by members of the Keith family. France Foch, circa 1920. In France, the Mar√©chauss√©e (\\"Marshalcy\\") was the forerunner of the French Gendarmerie. A military corps having such duties was first created in 1337, placed under the command of the Constable of France (the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armed Forces), and named the Conn√©tablie. In 1627 after the abolition of the title of Conn√©table, it was put under the command of the \\"Marshals of France,\\" and renamed the Mar√©chauss√©e. Its main mission was to protect the roads from highwaymen. The Mar√©chauss√©e was a mounted military police force organised and equipped along military lines. The force wore uniforms similar to those of the dragoons of the regular army and carried the same muskets and sabres. While its existence ensured the relative safety of French rural districts and roads, the Mar√©chauss√©e was regarded in contemporary England (which had no effective police force of any nature) as a symbol of foreign tyranny. In 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, the Mar√©chauss√©e numbered 3,660 men divided into small detachments called brigades. By law dated 16 February 1791, this force was renamed the Gendarmerie Nationale, though at first its personnel remained unchanged. Later many of them died under the guillotine, especially the members of the nobility. The new designation \\"Gendarmerie\\" was derived from the term gens d'armes (gentlemen/people at arms) who were originally heavy cavalry regiments (called at first Ordonnances royales) which were part of the King's household, the equivalent of the English \\"Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms\\". The title \\"Marshal of France\\" is a Dignit√© d'√âtat (\\"State Dignity\\") in the contemporary French Republic, not strictly speaking a military rank. It is granted to generals for exceptional achievements, especially in times of war or national crisis. However, the Marshal of France was one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France during the Ancien R√©gime and Bourbon Restoration and one of the Great Dignitaries of the Empire during the First French Empire (when the title was not \\"Marshal of France\\" but \\"Marshal of the Empire\\") A Marshal of France displays seven stars and is equivalent to a six star general in armies of other countries. The marshal also receives a baton, a blue cylinder with stars, formerly fleurs-de-lis during the monarchy and Eagles during the First French Empire. It has the Latin inscription: Terror belli, decus pacis, which means \\"terror in war, ornament in peace\\". The position in the French Navy (Marine nationale) equivalent to the \\"Marshal of France\\" is called Amiral de France (\\"Admiral of France\\"). The title has not been conferred since 1869. Theoretically, the equivalent title in the French Air Force is G√©n√©ral de France (\\"General of France\\"), but it has never been conferred to anyone yet. Six Marshals of France have been given the even more prestigious rank of \\"Marshal General of the King's Armies and Camps\\": Biron, Lesdigui√®res, Turenne, Villars, Saxe, and Soult. This rank and title no longer exists in present-day republican France. Netherlands In the Netherlands, the Koninklijke Marechaussee are the gendarmerie force created by King William I to replace the French gendarmerie on October 26, 1814. The word gendarmerie had gained a negative connotation, so William called the new force \\"marechauss√©e\\" (an alternate French word for gendarmerie). At that time, the marechaussee was part of the army (landmacht). The marechaussee performed police duties for the army, as well as civilian police work as a part of the national police (rijkspolitie). The marechaussee formed the only police force in many small cities like Venlo, especially in the southern provinces of Limburg and North Brabant. As of 1998, the marechaussee is a separate branch of the Dutch military, and is assigned both military and civilian police tasks.

Safety factors are often calculated using detailed analysis because comprehensive testing is impractical on many projects, such as bridges and buildings, but the structure's ability to carry a load must be determined to a reasonable accuracy. Many systems are intentionally built much stronger than needed for normal usage to allow for emergency situations, unexpected loads, misuse, or degradation (reliability).  Definition  There are two definitions for the factor of safety (FoS): #The ratio of a structure's absolute strength (structural capability) to actual applied load; this is a measure of the reliability of a particular design. This is a calculated value, and is sometimes referred to, for the sake of clarity, as a realized factor of safety. #A constant required value, imposed by law, standard, specification, contract or custom, to which a structure must conform or exceed. This can be referred to as a design factor, design factor of safety or required factor of safety. The realized factor of safety must be greater than the required design factor of safety. However, between various industries and engineering groups usage is inconsistent and confusing; it is important to be aware of which definition(s) are being used. The cause of much confusion is that various reference books and standards agencies use the factor of safety definitions and terms differently. Design codes and structural and mechanical engineering textbooks often use \\"Factor of Safety\\" to mean the fraction of total structural capability over that needed and are realized factor of safetyYoung, W.: Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain, 6th edition. McGraw-Hill, 1989.Shigley, J and Mischke, C: Standard Handbook of Machine Design, page 2-15. McGraw-Hill, 1986.ASME BTH-1: Design of Below-the-Hook Lifting Devices, Section 1-5, ASME, 2005. (first use). Many undergraduate Strength of Materials books use \\"Factor of Safety\\" as a constant value intended as a minimum target for designBeer, F and Johnson, R: Mechanics of Materials, second edition. McGraw-Hill,1992.Timoshenko, S: Strength of Materials, Volume 1. Krieger, 1958.Buchanan, G: Mechanics of Materials, Page 55. Holt, Reinhart, and Watson,1988. (second use).  Calculation  There are several ways to compare the factor of safety for structures. All the different calculations fundamentally measure the same thing: how much extra load beyond what is intended a structure will actually take (or be required to withstand). The difference between the methods is the way in which the values are calculated and compared. Safety factor values can be thought of as a standardized way for comparing strength and reliability between systems. The use of a factor of safety does not imply that an item, structure, or design is \\"safe\\". Many quality assurance, engineering design, manufacturing, installation, and end- use factors may influence whether or not something is safe in any particular situation. = Design factor and safety factor = The difference between the safety factor and design factor (design safety factor) is as follows: The safety factor, or yield stress, is how much the designed part actually will be able to withstand (first \\"use\\" from above). The design factor, or working stress, is what the item is required to be able to withstand (second \\"use\\"). The design factor is defined for an application (generally provided in advance and often set by regulatory building codes or policy) and is not an actual calculation, the safety factor is a ratio of maximum strength to intended load for the actual item that was designed. > :\\\\text{Factor of Safety}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{yield stress}}{\\\\text{working stress}} > *Design load being the maximum load the part should ever see in service. By this definition, a structure with a FOS of exactly 1 will support only the design load and no more. Any additional load will cause the structure to fail. A structure with a FOS of 2 will fail at twice the design load. = Margin of safety = Many government agencies and industries (such as aerospace) require the use of a margin of safety (MoS or M.S.) to describe the ratio of the strength of the structure to the requirements. There are two separate definitions for the margin of safety so care is needed to determine which is being used for a given application. One usage of M.S. is as a measure of capability like FoS. The other usage of M.S. is as a measure of satisfying design requirements (requirement verification). Margin of safety can be conceptualized (along with the reserve factor explained below) to represent how much of the structure's total capability is held \\"in reserve\\" during loading. M.S. as a measure of structural capability: This definition of margin of safety commonly seen in textbooksBurr, A and Cheatham, J: Mechanical Design and Analysis, 2nd edition, section 5.2. Prentice-Hall, 1995.Juvinall, R: Stress, Strain, and Strength, section 14.13, Page 295. McGraw-Hill, 1967. describes what additional load beyond the design load a part can withstand before failing. In effect, this is a measure of excess capability. If the margin is 0, the part will not take any additional load before it fails, if it is negative the part will fail before reaching its design load in service. If the margin is 1, it can withstand one additional load of equal force to the maximum load it was designed to support (i.e. twice the design load). > :\\\\text{Margin of Safety}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Failure Load}}{\\\\text{Design Load}}-1 > :\\\\text{Margin of Safety}={\\\\text{Factor of Safety}}-1 M.S. as a measure of requirement verification: Many agencies and organizations such as NASANASA-STD-5001: Structural Design and Test Factors for Spaceflight Hardware, section 3. NASA, 2008. and AIAAAIAA S-110: Space Systems - Structures, Structural Components, and Structural Assemblies, section 4.2. AIAA, 2005. define the margin of safety including the design factor, in other words, the margin of safety is calculated after applying the design factor. In the case of a margin of 0, the part is at exactly the required strength (the safety factor would equal the design factor). If there is a part with a required design factor of 3 and a margin of 1, the part would have a safety factor of 6 (capable of supporting two loads equal to its design factor of 3, supporting six times the design load before failure). A margin of 0 would mean the part would pass with a safety factor of 3. If the margin is less than 0 in this definition, although the part will not necessarily fail, the design requirement has not been met. A convenience of this usage is that for all applications, a margin of 0 or higher is passing, one does not need to know application details or compare against requirements, just glancing at the margin calculation tells whether the design passes or not. This is helpful for oversight and reviewing on projects with various integrated components, as different components may have various design factors involved and the margin calculation helps prevent confusion. > > Design Safety Factor = [Provided as requirement] > :\\\\text{Margin of Safety}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Failure Load}}{\\\\text{Design Load √ó > Design Safety Factor}}-1 :\\\\text{Margin of Safety}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Realized > Factor of Safety}}{\\\\text{Design Safety Factor}}-1 For a successful design, the Realized Safety Factor must always equal or exceed the Design Safety Factor so the Margin of Safety is greater than or equal to zero. The Margin of Safety is sometimes, but infrequently, used as a percentage, i.e., a 0.50 M.S is equivalent to a 50% M.S. When a design satisfies this test it is said to have a \\"positive margin,\\" and, conversely, a ‚Äúnegative margin‚Äù when it does not. In the field of Nuclear Safety (as implemented at U.S. government owned facilities) the Margin of Safety has been defined as a quantity that may not be reduced without review by the controlling government office. The U.S. Department of Energy publishes DOE G 424.1-1, \\"Implementation Guide for Use in Addressing Unreviewed Safety Question Requirements\\" as a guide for determining how to identify and determine whether a margin of safety will be reduced by a proposed change. The guide develops and applies the concept of a qualitative margin of safety that may not be explicit or quantifiable, yet can be evaluated conceptually to determine whether an increase or decrease will occur with a proposed change. This approach becomes important when examining designs with large or undefined (historical) margins and those that depend on 'soft' controls such as programmatic limits or requirements. The commercial U.S. nuclear industry utilized a similar concept in evaluating planned changes until 2001, when 10 CFR 50.59 was revised to capture and apply the information available in facility-specific risk analyses and other quantitative risk management tools. = Reserve factor = A measure of strength frequently used in Europe is the 'Reserve Factor (RF)'. With the strength and applied loads expressed in the same units, the Reserve Factor is defined in one of two ways, depending on the industry: > RF = Proof Strength / Proof Load > RF = Ultimate Strength / Ultimate Load The applied loads have many factors, including factors of safety applied.  Yield and ultimate calculations  For ductile materials (e.g. most metals), it is often required that the factor of safety be checked against both yield and ultimate strengths. The yield calculation will determine the safety factor until the part starts to deform plastically. The ultimate calculation will determine the safety factor until failure. On brittle materials these values are often so close as to be indistinguishable, so is it usually acceptable to only calculate the ultimate safety factor.  Choosing design factors  Appropriate design factors are based on several considerations, such as the accuracy of predictions on the imposed loads, strength, wear estimates, and the environmental effects to which the product will be exposed in service; the consequences of engineering failure; and the cost of over-engineering the component to achieve that factor of safety. For example, components whose failure could result in substantial financial loss, serious injury, or death may use a safety factor of four or higher (often ten). Non-critical components generally might have a design factor of two. Risk analysis, failure mode and effects analysis, and other tools are commonly used. Design factors for specific applications are often mandated by law, policy, or industry standards. Buildings commonly use a factor of safety of 2.0 for each structural member. The value for buildings is relatively low because the loads are well understood and most structures are redundant. Pressure vessels use 3.5 to 4.0, automobiles use 3.0, and aircraft and spacecraft use 1.2 to 3.0 depending on the application and materials. Ductile, metallic materials tend to use the lower value while brittle materials use the higher values. The field of aerospace engineering uses generally lower design factors because the costs associated with structural weight are high (i.e. an aircraft with an overall safety factor of 5 would probably be too heavy to get off the ground). This low design factor is why aerospace parts and materials are subject to very stringent quality control and strict preventative maintenance schedules to help ensure reliability. A usually applied Safety Factor is 1.5, but for pressurized fuselage it is 2.0, and for main landing gear structures it is often 1.25.Burr, A and Cheatham, J: Mechanical Design and Analysis, 2nd edition, section 5.2. Prentice-Hall, 1995. In some cases it is impractical or impossible for a part to meet the \\"standard\\" design factor. The penalties (mass or otherwise) for meeting the requirement would prevent the system from being viable (such as in the case of aircraft or spacecraft). In these cases, it is sometimes determined to allow a component to meet a lower than normal safety factor, often referred to as \\"waiving\\" the requirement. Doing this often brings with it extra detailed analysis or quality control verifications to assure the part will perform as desired, as it will be loaded closer to its limits. For loading that is cyclical, repetitive, or fluctuating, it is important to consider the possibility of metal fatigue when choosing factor of safety. A cyclic load well below a material's yield strength can cause failure if it is repeated through enough cycles. According to Elishakoff Elishakoff, I. Safety factors and reliability: friends or foes?, Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004Elishakoff, I., Interrelation between safety factors and reliability, NASA/CR-2001-211309, 2001 the notion of factor of safety in engineering context was apparently first introduced in 1729 by Bernard Forest de B√©lidor (1698-1761) de B√©lidor, Bernard Forest, La science des ing√©nieurs, dans la conduite des travaux de fortification et d'architecture civile, Paris: Chez Claude Jombert 1729 who was a French engineer working in hydraulics, mathematics, civil, and military engineering.

History  The Krahn arrived in an area of Liberia previously known as the \\"Grain Coast\\" as part of early 16th-century migrations from the northeast and what is now Ivory Coast. This migration occurred due to pressure on local populations resulting from the emigration of tribes from western Sudan after the decline of medieval empires, as well as an increase in regional tribal wars. At the time, the African slave trade was becoming more prominent within Liberia. Although some Kru tribes faced capture by Westerners, it was more common for the Krahn and other coastal peoples in Liberia to serve as local traders, brokering deals within the Western slave market. Many Kru committed suicide rather than face enslavement. = Liberian Civil Wars = During the late 1970s, Liberia faced a heated civil unrest in which opposition to the Americo-Liberian and Tolbert government led to a military coup, organized in part by indigenous tribal members. The tension culminated in coupe on April 12, 1980, in which Master Sergeant Samuel Kanyon Doe, a member of the Krahn ethnic group and leader of the group involved in the coup, seized power, becoming Liberia's first native leader and head of state. With a Krahn leader serving as a key political figure, the once disparaged Krahn were now more prominently included in Liberia's governing body. This rise in status led many Krahn speakers to move to the capital, Monrovia. Doe began showing favoritism to the Krahn, particularly to those from his own tribal group. These measures included appointing members of the Krahn's ethnic kin from Ivory Coast, known more commonly as the Wee, to the Executive Mansion Guard, as well as taking steps to prevent non-Krahn individuals from reaching key government positions. By 1985, Doe's response to his opposition created a large \\"anti-Doe\\" contingent. In December 1989, exiles and local recruits began organizing military groups, resulting in another civil war against Doe and his Krahn supporters. As this war progressed, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) began attacking Krahn civilians in Nimba and Grand Gedeh counties, destroying entire communities as they moved through the country. By mid-1990 the war had escalated, prompting foreign intervention. Doe was kidnapped and executed by opposition forces. Following the removal of the Doe regime and the continuation of the civil war, Krahn refugees began fleeing from Liberia to Ivory Coast, some taking the Krahn language with them. Although Doe was removed from power in 1990, the civil war did not officially end until 1996, at which time Charles Taylor ran for the presidency, winning the 1997 general election amid much controversy. Because of their opposition to Taylor and their affiliation with the previous regime and with rebel groups like ULIMO, Taylor initiated a crackdown against the Krahn. In 1998, Taylor attempted to murder one of his political opponents, the former warlord Roosevelt Johnson, causing clashes in Monrovia, during and after which hundreds of Krahn were massacred and hundreds more fled Liberia. This event was one of the factors that led to the outbreak of the Second Liberian Civil War. In 2003, members of the Krahn tribe founded a rebel group, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), opposing Taylor. The group disbanded as part of the peace agreement at the end of the second civil war. = Recent history = The stability that followed the civil war has allowed the Krahn to resettle throughout the country. Present-day Krahn are typically found in Nimba, Grand Gedeh, and Sinoe counties, as well as Ivory Coast.  Culture  Liberia's Krahn were originally hunters, fishermen and farmers, traditionally focusing on rice and cassava production. Slow or failing development of regions with many Krahn settlers led many of the younger Krahn generations to migrate to areas such as Monrovia. The Wee in Ivory Coast were hunters, fishermen and farmers as well, though they tended to focus more heavily on crops such as \\"rice, yams, taro, manioc, maize, and bananas.\\" Like the Krahn in Liberia, the Wee traditions of hunting and farming have become unsustainable, and in more recent years many have taken work in diamond camps and on rubber plantations. = Early political structures = Face mask on exhibit at the Indianapolis Museum of Art Early Krahn political organizations were traditionally decentralized in both Liberia and Ivory Coast. The tribes often lacked a central governing power, instead turning to a village \\"headman\\" who rose to a position of social esteem through skill, hard work, and luck in hunting and farming. These individuals often formed councils consisting of young warriors for protection and village elders to serve as consultants in village affairs. This governing group would broker trades with neighboring tribes, as well as make important decisions for the tribe members. Within these tribal groups, it was not uncommon for ceremonial ceremonial face masks to serve dual roles in rituals and politics. These masks were often modeled after animals and were utilized in community mediations. They may also have been a means of implementing social control in the years prior to adoption of Western laws during the colonial period. = Religion = A Krahn mask on exhibit at the National Museum of African Art in Washington, DC Many Krahn people believe that objects have spirits or souls (animism). The Wee of Ivory Coast also believe that the natural world is made up of \\"bush spirits.\\" These spirits are part of the world untouched by man, and the Wee believe that keeping these spirits appeased is vital to the health of the tribe. Whenever new land requires cultivating for fields or expansion, or when tribesmen needed to venture outside the village, it becomes necessary to make offerings to the spirits. It is further believed that the bush spirits take corporeal form in order to interact with the villagers and participate in ceremonies. The Wee believe that the bush spirits can communicate with humans through dreams, often demanding ceremonial masks be created in their honor in either male or female form. These masks then serve a variety of functions, ranging from ritual ceremonies, entertainment, and focal points in moral stories to judicial and political controls. Typically, female masks are viewed as less imposing and more beautiful than male masks and are in turn used more for ritual and entertainment purposes, while the male masks are often more ferocious-looking and used in sociopolitical contexts. All Wee masks are believed to deflect sorcery, and many undergo shifts in their primary function during their lifetime. Language The Krahn language is one of the Kru languages in the Niger‚ÄìCongo language family. Although many Kru-speaking tribes have adopted English as their second language, recent studies have shown that Kru is still spoken by many Liberians. Within the Kru languages there are several subcategories, with Eastern and Western Kru offering the first significant division of tribal language breakdowns. Krahn falls under the Western Kru, Wee subgroup. Some scholars further denote a difference between Eastern and Western Krahn, with Eastern variations typically spoken in northeast Liberia and Western Krahn spoken throughout Grand Gedeh County and Ivory Coast. As of 1993, there were approximately 47,000 Eastern Krahn speakers within Liberia, with an additional 47,800 Western Krahn speakers in Liberia and 12,200 in Ivory Coast.

She was one of 13 frigates authorized by the Continental Congress on 13 December 1775, laid down in 1776 at Fells Point, Maryland, by George Wells, launched that August, and commissioned in the spring of 1777, Captain James Nicholson in command. The newly commissioned frigate's first orders directed her to attempt a run through the strong British naval blockade at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay and then if successful, to head south to the West Indies and cruise in search of English merchantmen. However, her first sortie failed, as did four subsequent attempts to get to sea which she made in May, October, November, and December 1777. These successive failures frustrated Virginia's restive crew, and many deserted to join the numerous privateers scattered about the wharves of nearby Baltimore. By early January 1778, the desertions had become so numerous that Virginia was unable to leave the docks. This situation prompted a series of ugly exchanges between Capt. Nicholson, his executive officer Lt. Joshua Barney, and the governor of Maryland Thomas Johnson. New recruits were finally procured through the auspices of the Maritime Committee of the Continental Congress, enabling Virginia to attempt another run past the blockade in mid- January. This latest dash went smoothly until sighted Virginia near the Chesapeake capes. The British frigate pursued the Americans back towards Baltimore. Virginia tied up behind a water battery and chain stretched across the northwest branch of the Patapsco River, Md., between Whetstone Point and later Lazaretto Point, where she took on board 20 more seamen. Later that month, when Capt. Nicholson again tried to run the blockade, he sent Lt. Barney ahead in the schooner Dolphin to reconnoiter the positions of the British warships. Dolphin sighted a large patrol vessel in Tangier Sound but outran her. Before meeting with Virginia, the schooner recaptured a Baltimore sloop taken earlier. On the basis of Lt. Barney's report, Capt. Nicholson decided to abandon this latest attempt to get to sea and returned to Baltimore. Virginia lay at anchor at Baltimore for two months repairing and reprovisioning. During this time, Barney was dispatched to York, Pennsylvania, to explain Virginia's predicament to the Maritime Committee; and he returned in March with orders to make another attempt to get by the British as soon as possible. Awaiting Barney upon his arrival back in Baltimore were a letter of thanks from the Royal Navy for his kind treatment of Dolphin's prisoners and a large English cheese. Virginia left Baltimore late in March in obedience to the Maritime Committee's orders. Nicholson's plans called for Virginia to sail first to Annapolis, to pick up a bay pilot promised by Governor Johnson. Completing this, the frigate and pilot vessel weighed anchor off Annapolis on 30 March and proceeded down the bay, plotting a night passage into the Atlantic. However, early on the morning of 31 March, Virginia grounded with a tremendous crash on the so-called Middle Ground between the capes, opposite the city of Hampton, Virginia. With a strong wind blowing astern, the surf pounded the frigate and forced her over. Her rudder snapped before she could be cleared and was soon lost. Once in the channel, Virginia was anchored and repairs begun. At dawn, lookouts spotted Emerald and her fellow frigate approaching from seaward though Virginia's guns remained undamaged, Capt. Nicholson ordered his barge broken out and went ashore with the ship's papers. Later that morning, the American frigate surrendered to Capt. Caldwell of Emerald. A Congressional court of inquiry into the fiasco cleared Capt. Nicholson of blame, and all the officers of the unlucky frigate saw action later during the Revolution. Virginia herself was soon repaired and eventually purchased by the Royal Navy for use as the 32-gun frigate HMS Virginia. She was placed in service along the American coast and participated in the Penobscot Expedition of 1779 and the capture of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1780. At the end of the war she was condemned and sold.

Onset may be rapid or gradual. Symptoms typically include those of cardiogenic shock including shortness of breath, weakness, lightheadedness, and cough. Other symptoms may relate to the underlying cause. Common causes of cardiac tamponade include cancer, kidney failure, chest trauma, myocardial infarction, and pericarditis. Other causes include connective tissues diseases, hypothyroidism, aortic rupture, autoimmune disease, and complications of cardiac surgery. In Africa, tuberculosis is a relatively common cause. Diagnosis may be suspected based on low blood pressure, jugular venous distension, or quiet heart sounds (together known as Beck's triad). A pericardial rub may be present in cases due to inflammation. The diagnosis may be further supported by specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, chest X-ray, or an ultrasound of the heart. If fluid increases slowly the pericardial sac can expand to contain more than 2 liters; however, if the increase is rapid, as little as 200 mL can result in tamponade. Tamponade is a medical emergency. When it results in symptoms, drainage is necessary. This can be done by pericardiocentesis, surgery to create a pericardial window, or a pericardiectomy. Drainage may also be necessary to rule out infection or cancer. Other treatments may include the use of dobutamine or in those with low blood volume, intravenous fluids. Those with few symptoms and no worrisome features can often be closely followed. The frequency of tamponade is unclear. One estimate from the United States places it at 2 per 10,000 per year. Signs and symptoms Onset may be rapid (acute) or more gradual (subacute). Signs of cardiac tamponade typically include those of cardiogenic shock including shortness of breath, weakness, lightheadedness, and cough. Other symptoms may relate to the underlying cause. Other general signs of shock (such as fast heart rate, shortness of breath and decreasing level of consciousness) may also occur. However, some of these signs may not be present in certain cases. A fast heart rate, although expected, may be absent in people with uremia and hypothyroidism. Causes Cardiac tamponade is caused by a large or uncontrolled pericardial effusion, i.e. the buildup of fluid inside the pericardium. This commonly occurs as a result of chest trauma (both blunt and penetrating), but can also be caused by myocardial infarction, myocardial rupture, cancer, uremia, pericarditis, or cardiac surgery, and rarely occurs during retrograde aortic dissection, or while the person is taking anticoagulant therapy. The effusion can occur rapidly (as in the case of trauma or myocardial rupture), or over a more gradual period of time (as in cancer). The fluid involved is often blood, but pus is also found in some circumstances. =Surgery= One of the most common settings for cardiac tamponade is in the first 7 days after heart surgery. After heart surgery, chest tubes are placed to drain blood. These chest tubes, however, are prone to clot formation. When a chest tube becomes occluded or clogged, the blood that should be drained can accumulate around the heart, leading to tamponade. Pathophysiology Hemopericardium, wherein the pericardium becomes filled with blood, is one cause of cardiac tamponade. The outer layer of the heart is made of fibrous tissue which does not easily stretch, so once fluid begins to enter the pericardial space, pressure starts to increase. If fluid continues to accumulate, each successive diastolic period leads to less blood entering the ventricles. Eventually, increasing pressure on the heart forces the septum to bend in towards the left ventricle, leading to a decrease in stroke volume. This causes the development of obstructive shock, which if left untreated may lead to cardiac arrest (often presenting as pulseless electrical activity).  Diagnosis  An ultrasound of the heart showing cardiac tamponade. The three classic signs, known as Beck's triad, are low blood pressure, jugular-venous distension, and muffled heart sounds. Other signs may include pulsus paradoxus (a drop of at least 10 mmHg in arterial blood pressure with inspiration), and ST segment changes on the electrocardiogram, which may also show low voltage QRS complexes. =Medical imaging= Tamponade can often be diagnosed radiographically. Echocardiography, which is the diagnostic test of choice, often demonstrates an enlarged pericardium or collapsed ventricles. A large cardiac tamponade will show as an enlarged globular-shaped heart on chest x-ray. During inspiration, the negative pressure in the thoracic cavity will cause increased pressure into the right ventricle. This increased pressure in the right ventricle will cause the interventricular septum to bulge towards the left ventricle, leading to decreased filling of the left ventricle. At the same time, right ventricle volume is markedly diminished and sometimes it can collapse. =Differential diagnosis= Initial diagnosis of cardiac tamponade can be challenging, as there is a broad differential diagnosis. The differential includes possible diagnoses based on symptoms, time course, mechanism of injury, patient history. Rapid onset cardiac tamponade may also appear similary to pleural effusions, shock, pulmonary embolism, and tension pneumothorax. If symptoms appeared more gradually, the differential diagnosis includes acute heart failure. In a person with trauma presenting with pulseless electrical activity in the absence of hypovolemia and tension pneumothorax, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade.American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (2007). Advanced Trauma Life Support for Doctors, 7th Edition. Chicago: American College of Surgeons In addition to the diagnostic complications afforded by the wide-ranging differential diagnosis for chest pain, diagnosis can be additionally complicated by the fact that people will often be weak or faint at presentation. For instance, a fast rate of breathing and difficulty breathing on exertion that progresses to air hunger at rest can be a key diagnostic symptom, but it may not be possible to obtain such information from people who are unconscious or who have convulsions at presentation. Treatment =Pre-hospital care= Initial treatment given will usually be supportive in nature, for example administration of oxygen, and monitoring. There is little care that can be provided pre-hospital other than general treatment for shock. Some teams have performed an emergency thoracotomy to release clotting in the pericardium caused by a penetrating chest injury. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is the key to survival with tamponade. Some pre-hospital providers will have facilities to provide pericardiocentesis, which can be life-saving. If the person has already suffered a cardiac arrest, pericardiocentesis alone cannot ensure survival, and so rapid evacuation to a hospital is usually the more appropriate course of action. =Hospital management= Initial management in hospital is by pericardiocentesis. This involves the insertion of a needle through the skin and into the pericardium and aspirating fluid under ultrasound guidance preferably. This can be done laterally through the intercostal spaces, usually the fifth, or as a subxiphoid approach. A left parasternal approach begins 3 to 5 cm left of the sternum to avoid the left internal mammary artery, in the 5th intercostal space.Synovitz C.K., Brown E.J. (2011). Chapter 37. Pericardiocentesis. In Tintinalli J.E., Stapczynski J, Ma O, Cline D.M., Cydulka R.K., Meckler G.D., T (Eds), Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, 7e. Retrieved September 19, 2014 from . Often, a cannula is left in place during resuscitation following initial drainage so that the procedure can be performed again if the need arises. If facilities are available, an emergency pericardial window may be performed instead, during which the pericardium is cut open to allow fluid to drain. Following stabilization of the person, surgery is provided to seal the source of the bleed and mend the pericardium. Following heart surgery, the amount of chest tube drainage is monitored. If the drainage volume drops off, and the blood pressure goes down, this can suggest a tamponade due to chest tube clogging. In that case, the person is taken back to the operating room for an emergency reoperation. If aggressive treatment is offered immediately and no complications arise (shock, AMI or arrhythmia, heart failure, aneurysm, carditis, embolism, or rupture), or they are dealt with quickly and fully contained, then adequate survival is still a distinct possibility. Epidemiology The frequency of tamponade is unclear. One estimate from the United States places it at 2 per 10,000 per year. It is estimated to occur in 2% of those with stab or gunshot wounds to the chest.

This 400 ton 'merchant' ship, then named the Lyon, with 32 gun emplacements, was fitted with 24 cannons and was built by Bourmaud. The number of cannons attracted the attention of the local maritime authorities, who notified the Minister of Marine. Having been paid through a Paris banker, Jean Peltier denied any other use apart from trade, and, on 3 November 1777, indicated in the deed of purchase that there was \\"absolutely no foreign involvement\\" and that the ship would be commanded by a Frenchman, Barth√©l√©my Corvaisier, on the voyage to Santo Domingo. Even though suspicions had not completely disappeared, fortunately French intentions towards the USA had changed and Jean Peltier was encouraged to hasten the preparation of the ship. On 12 February 1778, the Lyon joined the Duc de Choiseul and the Brume in Saint Nazaire to then sail to the Quiberon Bay, where the escort of La Motte-Picquet was waiting to accompany them the 900 km to the United States. However disagreements with Samuel Nicholson led to the departure of a large number of the French crew, including Nicolas Baudin, and the embarkation of 102 American 'passengers'. An agreement was signed between Jonathan Williams and Nicholson and Corvaisier stepped down. Nicholson took command and renamed the ship the Deane. On 14 February the crew was present at the 13 gun salute by John Paul Jones fired from the 'Ranger' and the 9 gun salute in response from La Motte-Picquet, in recognition of the American nation. And brought to the United States in May 1778 to be prepared for sea. She was named Hague in 1782, and was taken out of commission in 1783. Career Under the command of Captain Samuel Nicholson of the Continental Navy, Deane sailed from Boston 14 January 1779 with for a cruise in the West Indies. She returned to Philadelphia 17 April with one prize, the armed ship Viper. On 29 July she joined with and two ships of the Virginia Navy guarding a convoy of merchantmen out to sea and continuing on for a five-week cruise which netted eight prizes, including four privateers, the packet Sandwich, and the sloop-of-war . The frigates arrived at Boston 6 September with 250 prisoners after one of the most notable cruises of the Continental Navy. During the winter and early spring of 1781 Deane cruised with and in the West Indies. In May, Lloyd's List reported that the rebel frigates Dean and Protector had captured John, Ashburner, master, from Lancaster to St. Kitts, and a ship sailing from Glasgow to Jamaica with 90-0 barrels of beef and a quantity of dry goods, and had taken them into Martinique.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ1263. Deane again cruised with Confederacy and Saratoga in the West Indies in 1782, capturing four prizes. In April 1782 she captured the cutter .Demerliac (1996), p.89, #590. After two more cruises in the Caribbean, one in September 1782 and the other in 1783, she was renamed Hague in September 1782 (perhaps because of false accusation against Deane that was current at the time). Fate Deane was taken out of commission in 1783 at Boston.

It corresponds to military camouflage for these parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., multi-spectral camouflage). Development of modern stealth technologies in the United States began in 1958, where earlier attempts to prevent radar tracking of its U-2 spy planes during the Cold War by the Soviet Union had been unsuccessful.Cadirci, S. \\"RF Stealth (or Low Observable) and Counter- RF Stealth Technologies: Implications of Counter- RF Stealth Solutions for Turkish Air Force .\\" Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey California, Ph.D. Thesis. March 2009. Accessed 6 October 2009. Designers turned to developing a specific shape for planes that tended to reduce detection by redirecting electromagnetic radiation waves from radars. Radiation-absorbent material was also tested and made to reduce or block radar signals that reflect off the surfaces of aircraft. Such changes to shape and surface composition comprise stealth technology as currently used on the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit \\"Stealth Bomber\\". The concept of stealth is to operate or hide while giving enemy forces no indication as to the presence of friendly forces. This concept was first explored through camouflage to make an object's appearance blend into the visual background. As the potency of detection and interception technologies (radar, infrared search and tracking, surface-to-air missiles, etc.) have increased, so too has the extent to which the design and operation of military personnel and vehicles have been affected in response. Some military uniforms are treated with chemicals to reduce their infrared signature. A modern stealth vehicle is designed from the outset to have a chosen spectral signature. The degree of stealth embodied in a given design is chosen according to the projected threats of detection. History Camouflage to aid or avoid predation predates humanity, and hunters have been using vegetation to conceal themselves perhaps as long as people have been hunting. The earliest application of camouflage in warfare is impossible to ascertain. Methods for visual concealment in war were documented by Sun Tzu in his book The Art of War in the 5th century BC, and by Frontinus in his work Strategemata in the 1st century AD. In England, irregular units of gamekeepers in the 17th century were the first to adopt drab colours (common in 16th century Irish units) as a form of camouflage, following examples from the continent. During World War I, the Germans experimented with the use of Cellon (Cellulose acetate), a transparent covering material, in an attempt to reduce the visibility of military aircraft. Single examples of the Fokker E.III Eindecker fighter monoplane, the Albatros C.I two-seat observation biplane, and the Linke-Hofmann R.I prototype heavy bomber were covered with Cellon. However, sunlight glinting from the material made the aircraft even more visible. Cellon was also found to degrade quickly from both sunlight and in- flight temperature changes, so the effort to make transparent aircraft ceased. In 1916, the British modified a small SS class airship for the purpose of night-time reconnaissance over German lines on the Western Front. Fitted with a silenced engine and a black gas bag, the craft was both invisible and inaudible from the ground but several night-time flights over German-held territory produced little useful intelligence and the idea was dropped. Diffused-lighting camouflage, a shipborne form of counter-illumination camouflage, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy from 1941 to 1943. The concept was followed up for aircraft by the Americans and the British: in 1945 a Grumman Avenger with Yehudi lights reached from a ship before being sighted. This ability was rendered obsolete by radar. The U-boat U-480 may have been the first stealth submarine. It featured an anechoic tile rubber coating, one layer of which contained circular air pockets to defeat ASDIC sonar. Radar- absorbent paints and materials of rubber and semiconductor composites (codenames: Sumpf, Schornsteinfeger) were used by the Kriegsmarine on submarines in World War II. Tests showed they were effective in reducing radar signatures at both short (centimetres) and long (1.5 metre) wavelengths. In 1956 the CIA began attempts to reduce the radar cross-section (RCS) of the U-2 spyplane. Three systems were developed, Trapeze, a series of wires and ferrite beads around the planform of the aircraft, a covering material with PCB circuitry embedded in it, and radar-absorbent paint. These were deployed in the field on the so-called dirty birds but results were disappointing, the weight and drag increases were not worth any reduction in detection rates. More successful was applying camouflage to the originally bare metal aircraft; a deep blue was found to be most effective. The weight of this cost 250 ft in maximum altitude, but made the aircraft harder for interceptors to see. In 1958, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency requested funding for a reconnaissance aircraft to replace the existing U-2 spy planes, and Lockheed secured contractual rights to produce it. \\"Kelly\\" Johnson and his team at Lockheed's Skunk Works were assigned to produce the A-12 (or OXCART), which operated at high altitude of 70,000 to 80,000 ft and speed of Mach 3.2 to avoid radar detection. Various plane shapes designed to reduce radar detection were developed in earlier prototypes, named A-1 to A-11. The A-12 included a number of stealthy features including special fuel to reduce the signature of the exhaust plume, canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall finish in radar-absorbent paint. In 1960, the USAF reduced the radar cross-section of a Ryan Q-2C Firebee drone. This was achieved through specially designed screens over the air intake, and radiation-absorbent material on the fuselage, and radar-absorbent paint. During the 1970s the U.S. Department of Defense launched project Lockheed Have Blue, with the aim of developing a stealth fighter. There was fierce bidding between Lockheed and Northrop to secure the multibillion-dollar contract. Lockheed incorporated into its bid a text written by the Soviet-Russian physicist Pyotr Ufimtsev from 1962, titled Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction, Soviet Radio, Moscow, 1962. In 1971 this book was translated into English with the same title by U.S. Air Force, Foreign Technology Division.National Air Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 1971. Technical Report AD 733203, Defense Technical Information Center of USA, Cameron Station, Alexandria, VA, 22304-6145, USA The theory played a critical role in the design of American stealth-aircraft F-117 and B-2.Browne, M.W. \\"Two rival designers led the way to stealthy warplanes\\", New York Times, Sci. Times Sec., May 14, 1991.Browne, M.W. \\"Lockheed credits Soviet theory in design of F-117\\", Aviation Week Space Technology p. 27, December 1991.Rich, Ben and L. Janos, Skunk Works, Little Brown, Boston, 1994. Equations outlined in the paper quantified how a plane's shape would affect its detectability by radar, termed radar cross-section (RCS). This was applied by Lockheed in computer simulation to design a novel shape they called the \\"Hopeless Diamond\\", a wordplay on the Hope Diamond, securing contractual rights to produce the F-117 Nighthawk starting in 1975. In 1977 Lockheed produced two 60% scale models under the Have Blue contract. The Have Blue program was a stealth technology demonstrator that lasted from 1976 to 1979. The Northrop Grumman Tacit Blue also played a part in the development of composite material and curvilinear surfaces, low observables, fly-by-wire, and other stealth technology innovations. The success of Have Blue led the Air Force to create the Senior Trend program which developed the F-117. Principles Stealth technology (or LO for low observability) is not one technology. It is a set of technologies, used in combinations, that can greatly reduce the distances at which a person or vehicle can be detected; more so radar cross-section reductions, but also acoustic, thermal, and other aspects. Radar cross- section (RCS) reductions Almost since the invention of radar, various methods have been tried to minimize detection. Rapid development of radar during World War II led to equally rapid development of numerous counter radar measures during the period; a notable example of this was the use of chaff. Modern methods include Radar jamming and deception. The term stealth in reference to reduced radar signature aircraft became popular during the late eighties when the Lockheed Martin F-117 stealth fighter became widely known. The first large scale (and public) use of the F-117 was during the Gulf War in 1991. However, F-117A stealth fighters were used for the first time in combat during Operation Just Cause, the United States invasion of Panama in 1989. =Vehicle shape= Aircraft The F-35 Lightning II offers better stealthy features (such as this landing gear door) than prior American multi- role fighters, such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon The possibility of designing aircraft in such a manner as to reduce their radar cross-section was recognized in the late 1930s, when the first radar tracking systems were employed, and it has been known since at least the 1960s that aircraft shape makes a significant difference in detectability. The Avro Vulcan, a British bomber of the 1960s, had a remarkably small appearance on radar despite its large size, and occasionally disappeared from radar screens entirely. It is now known that it had a fortuitously stealthy shape apart from the vertical element of the tail. Despite being designed before a low radar cross-section (RCS) and other stealth factors were ever a consideration,Sweetman, Bill. \\"The Bomber that radar cannot see.\\" New Scientist, 4 March 1982. a Royal Aircraft Establishment technical note of 1957 stated that of all the aircraft so far studied, the Vulcan appeared by far the simplest radar echoing object, due to its shape: only one or two components contributing significantly to the echo at any aspect (one of them being the vertical stabilizer, which is especially relevant for side aspect RCS), compared with three or more on most other types.Dawson 1957, p. 3. While writing about radar systems, authors Simon Kingsley and Shaun Quegan singled out the Vulcan's shape as acting to reduce the RCS.Kingsley and Quegan 1999, p. 293. In contrast, the Tupolev 95 Russian long-range bomber (NATO reporting name 'Bear') was conspicuous on radar. It is now known that propellers and jet turbine blades produce a bright radar image; the Bear has four pairs of large (5.6 meter diameter) contra-rotating propellers. Another important factor is internal construction. Some stealth aircraft have skin that is radar transparent or absorbing, behind which are structures termed reentrant triangles. Radar waves penetrating the skin get trapped in these structures, reflecting off the internal faces and losing energy. This method was first used on the Blackbird series: A-12, YF-12A, Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. The most efficient way to reflect radar waves back to the emitting radar is with orthogonal metal plates, forming a corner reflector consisting of either a dihedral (two plates) or a trihedral (three orthogonal plates). This configuration occurs in the tail of a conventional aircraft, where the vertical and horizontal components of the tail are set at right angles. Stealth aircraft such as the F-117 use a different arrangement, tilting the tail surfaces to reduce corner reflections formed between them. A more radical method is to omit the tail, as in the B-2 Spirit. The B-2's clean, low-drag flying wing configuration gives it exceptional range and reduces its radar profile.Croddy and Wirtz 2005, pp. 341‚Äì342.Siuru 1993, pp. 114‚Äì115. The flying wing design most closely resembles a so-called infinite flat plate (as vertical control surfaces dramatically increase RCS), the perfect stealth shape, as it would have no angles to reflect back radar waves. YF-23 S-duct engine air intake conceals engine from probing radar waves In addition to altering the tail, stealth design must bury the engines within the wing or fuselage, or in some cases where stealth is applied to an extant aircraft, install baffles in the air intakes, so that the compressor blades are not visible to radar. A stealthy shape must be devoid of complex bumps or protrusions of any kind, meaning that weapons, fuel tanks, and other stores must not be carried externally. Any stealthy vehicle becomes un-stealthy when a door or hatch opens. Parallel alignment of edges or even surfaces is also often used in stealth designs. The technique involves using a small number of edge orientations in the shape of the structure. For example, on the F-22A Raptor, the leading edges of the wing and the tail planes are set at the same angle. Other smaller structures, such as the air intake bypass doors and the air refueling aperture, also use the same angles. The effect of this is to return a narrow radar signal in a very specific direction away from the radar emitter rather than returning a diffuse signal detectable at many angles. The effect is sometimes called \\"glitter\\" after the very brief signal seen when the reflected beam passes across a detector. It can be difficult for the radar operator to distinguish between a glitter event and a digital glitch in the processing system. Stealth airframes sometimes display distinctive serrations on some exposed edges, such as the engine ports. The YF-23 has such serrations on the exhaust ports. This is another example in the parallel alignment of features, this time on the external airframe. The shaping requirements detracted greatly from the F-117's aerodynamic properties. It is inherently unstable, and cannot be flown without a fly-by-wire control system. Similarly, coating the cockpit canopy with a thin film transparent conductor (vapor- deposited gold or indium tin oxide) helps to reduce the aircraft's radar profile, because radar waves would normally enter the cockpit, reflect off objects (the inside of a cockpit has a complex shape, with a pilot helmet alone forming a sizeable return), and possibly return to the radar, but the conductive coating creates a controlled shape that deflects the incoming radar waves away from the radar. The coating is thin enough that it has no adverse effect on pilot vision. K32 HMS Helsingborg, a stealth ship Ships Ships have also adopted similar methods. Though the earlier Arleigh Burke- class destroyer incorporated some signature-reduction features. the Norwegian Skjold-class corvette was the first coastal defence and the French La Fayette- class frigate the first ocean-going stealth ship to enter service. Other examples are the Taiwanese Tuo Chiang stealth corvette, German Sachsen-class frigates, the Swedish Visby-class corvette, the USS San Antonio amphibious transport dock, and most modern warship designs. =Materials= Non- metallic airframe Dielectric composite materials are more transparent to radar, whereas electrically conductive materials such as metals and carbon fibers reflect electromagnetic energy incident on the material's surface. Composites may also contain ferrites to optimize the dielectric and magnetic properties of a material for its application. Radar-absorbent material Skin of B-2 bomber Radiation-absorbent material (RAM), often as paints, are used especially on the edges of metal surfaces. While the material and thickness of RAM coatings can vary, the way they work is the same: absorb radiated energy from a ground or air based radar station into the coating and convert it to heat rather than reflect it back.http://www.researchinventy.com/papers/v3i12/D0312015019.pdf Current technologies include dielectric composites and metal fibers containing ferrite isotopes. Paint comprises depositing pyramid like colonies on the reflecting superficies with the gaps filled with ferrite-based RAM. The pyramidal structure deflects the incident radar energy in the maze of RAM. One commonly used material is called iron ball paint. It contains microscopic iron spheres that resonate in tune with incoming radio waves and dissipate most of their energy as heat, leaving little to reflect back to detectors. FSS are planar periodic structures that behave like filters to electromagnetic energy. The considered frequency selective surfaces are composed of conducting patch elements pasted on the ferrite layer. FSS are used for filtration and microwave absorption. =Radar stealth countermeasures and limits= Low- frequency radar Shaping offers far fewer stealth advantages against low- frequency radar. If the radar wavelength is roughly twice the size of the target, a half-wave resonance effect can still generate a significant return. However, low-frequency radar is limited by lack of available frequencies (many are heavily used by other systems), by lack of accuracy of the diffraction- limited systems given their long wavelengths, and by the radar's size, making it difficult to transport. A long-wave radar may detect a target and roughly locate it, but not provide enough information to identify it, target it with weapons, or even to guide a fighter to it.Maj. Gen. Carlsons briefing on Stealth Fighters, Tuesday, April 20, 1999 Multiple emitters Much of the stealth comes in directions different than a direct return. Thus, detection can be better achieved if emitters are separate from receivers. One emitter separate from one receiver is termed bistatic radar; one or more emitters separate from more than one receiver is termed multistatic radar. Proposals exist to use reflections from emitters such as civilian radio transmitters, including cellular telephone radio towers.MIT's \\"The Tech ‚Äì online edition\\" article Detection of the B-2 Stealth Bomber and a Brief History on \\"Stealth\\" by Tao Yue published November 30, 2001 in (Volume 121, Issue 63) Moore's law By Moore's law the processing power behind radar systems is rising over time. This will eventually erode the ability of physical stealth to hide vehicles.Global Opposition Movement Challenges JSFThe Naval Institute guide to world naval weapon systems By Norman Friedman, Introduction page x Ship wakes and spray Synthetic aperture sidescan radars can be used to detect the location and heading of ships from their wake patterns. These are detectable from orbit. When a ship moves through a seaway it throws up a cloud of spray which can be detected by radar.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271464016_Radar_backscattering_from_sea_foam_and_spray Acoustics Acoustic stealth plays a primary role for submarines and ground vehicles. Submarines use extensive rubber mountings to isolate, damp, and avoid mechanical noises that can reveal locations to underwater passive sonar arrays. Early stealth observation aircraft used slow-turning propellers to avoid being heard by enemy troops below. Stealth aircraft that stay subsonic can avoid being tracked by sonic boom. The presence of supersonic and jet- powered stealth aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird indicates that acoustic signature is not always a major driver in aircraft design, as the Blackbird relied more on its very high speed and altitude. One method to reduce helicopter rotor noise is modulated blade spacing. Standard rotor blades are evenly spaced, and produce greater noise at a given frequency and its harmonics. Using varied spacing between the blades spreads the noise or acoustic signature of the rotor over a greater range of frequencies. Visibility The simplest technology is visual camouflage; the use of paint or other materials to color and break up the lines of a vehicle or person. Most stealth aircraft use matte paint and dark colors, and operate only at night. Lately, interest in daylight Stealth (especially by the USAF) has emphasized the use of gray paint in disruptive schemes, and it is assumed that Yehudi lights could be used in the future to hide the airframe (against the background of the sky, including at night, aircraft of any colour appear dark) or as a sort of active camouflage. The original B-2 design had wing tanks for a contrail-inhibiting chemical, alleged by some to be chlorofluorosulfonic acid,Aeronautics.ru (Dead link) but this was replaced in the final design with a contrail sensor that alerts the pilot when he should change altitude and mission planning also considers altitudes where the probability of their formation is minimized. In space, mirrored surfaces can be employed to reflect views of empty space toward known or suspected observers; this approach is compatible with several radar stealth schemes. Careful control of the orientation of the satellite relative to the observers is essential, and mistakes can lead to detectability enhancement rather than the desired reduction. Infrared An exhaust plume contributes a significant infrared signature. One means to reduce IR signature is to have a non-circular tail pipe (a slit shape) to minimize the exhaust cross sectional area and maximize the mixing of hot exhaust with cool ambient air (see Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk). Often, cool air is deliberately injected into the exhaust flow to boost this process (see Ryan AQM-91 Firefly and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit). The Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law shows how this results in less energy (Thermal radiation in infrared spectrum) being released and thus reduces the heat signature. In some aircraft, the jet exhaust is vented above the wing surface to shield it from observers below, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, and the unstealthy Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. To achieve infrared stealth, the exhaust gas is cooled to the temperatures where the brightest wavelengths it radiates are absorbed by atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor, greatly reducing the infrared visibility of the exhaust plume. Another way to reduce the exhaust temperature is to circulate coolant fluids such as fuel inside the exhaust pipe, where the fuel tanks serve as heat sinks cooled by the flow of air along the wings. Ground combat includes the use of both active and passive infrared sensors. Thus, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) ground combat uniform requirements document specifies infrared reflective quality standards. Reducing radio frequency (RF) emissions In addition to reducing infrared and acoustic emissions, a stealth vehicle must avoid radiating any other detectable energy, such as from onboard radars, communications systems, or RF leakage from electronics enclosures. The F-117 uses passive infrared and low light level television sensor systems to aim its weapons and the F-22 Raptor has an advanced LPI radar which can illuminate enemy aircraft without triggering a radar warning receiver response. Measuring The size of a target's image on radar is measured by the radar cross section or RCS, often represented by the symbol œÉ and expressed in square meters. This does not equal geometric area. A perfectly conducting sphere of projected cross sectional area 1 m2 (i.e. a diameter of 1.13 m) will have an RCS of 1 m2. Note that for radar wavelengths much less than the diameter of the sphere, RCS is independent of frequency. Conversely, a square flat plate of area 1 m2 will have an RCS of œÉ=4œÄ A2 / Œª2 (where A=area, Œª=wavelength), or 13,982 m2 at 10 GHz if the radar is perpendicular to the flat surface. At off-normal incident angles, energy is reflected away from the receiver, reducing the RCS. Modern stealth aircraft are said to have an RCS comparable with small birds or large insects,F-22 Raptor Stealth GlobalSecurity.org though this varies widely depending on aircraft and radar. If the RCS was directly related to the target's cross-sectional area, the only way to reduce it would be to make the physical profile smaller. Rather, by reflecting much of the radiation away or by absorbing it, the target achieves a smaller radar cross section.Bill Sweetman, Unconventional Weapon: What we learned about stealth technology from the combat career of the F-117, Smithsonian Air & Space Magazine, 01 January 2008 Tactics Stealthy strike aircraft such as the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, are usually used against heavily defended enemy sites such as Command and control centers or surface- to-air missile (SAM) batteries. Enemy radar will cover the airspace around these sites with overlapping coverage, making undetected entry by conventional aircraft nearly impossible. Stealthy aircraft can also be detected, but only at short ranges around the radars; for a stealthy aircraft there are substantial gaps in the radar coverage. Thus a stealthy aircraft flying an appropriate route can remain undetected by radar. Even if a stealth aircraft is detected, fire-control radars operating in C, X and Ku bands cannot paint (for missile guidance) low observable (LO) jets except at very close ranges. Many ground-based radars exploit Doppler filter to improve sensitivity to objects having a radial velocity component relative to the radar. Mission planners use their knowledge of enemy radar locations and the RCS pattern of the aircraft to design a flight path that minimizes radial speed while presenting the lowest-RCS aspects of the aircraft to the threat radar. To be able to fly these \\"safe\\" routes, it is necessary to understand an enemy's radar coverage (see electronic intelligence). Airborne or mobile radar systems such as AWACS can complicate tactical strategy for stealth operation. Research After the invention of metasurfaces, the conventional means of reducing RCS have been improved significantly.A. Y. Modi; M. A. Alyahya; C. A. Balanis; C. R. Birtcher, \\"Metasurface-Based Method for Broadband RCS Reduction of Dihedral Corner Reflectors with Multiple Bounces,\\" in IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, vol.67, no.12, pp. -, Dec. 2019. As mentioned earlier, the primary objective in purpose shaping is to redirect scattered waves away from the backscattered direction, which is usually the source. However, it compromises the performance in terms of aerodynamics. One feasible solution, which has extensively been explored in recent time, is to use metasurfaces which can redirect scattered waves without altering the geometry of a target. Such metasurfaces can primarily be classified in two categories: (i) Checkerboard metasurfaces, (ii) Gradient index metasurfaces. Similarly, negative index metamaterials are artificial structures for which refractive index has a negative value for some frequency range, such as in microwave, infrared, or possibly optical. These offer another way to reduce detectability, and may provide electromagnetic near-invisibility in designed wavelengths. Plasma stealth is a phenomenon proposed to use ionized gas, termed a plasma, to reduce RCS of vehicles. Interactions between electromagnetic radiation and ionized gas have been studied extensively for many purposes, including concealing vehicles from radar. Various methods might form a layer or cloud of plasma around a vehicle to deflect or absorb radar, from simpler electrostatic to radio frequency (RF) more complex laser discharges, but these may be difficult in practice. Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of aircraft flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of lower RCS for stealth, via simpler geometries and lower complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer or no moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and lower mass, cost (up to 50% less), drag (up to 15% less during use) and, inertia (for faster, stronger control response to change vehicle orientation to reduce detection). Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics. In flexible wings, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow. Adaptive compliant wings are a military and commercial effort. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing was a US Air Force, Boeing, and NASA effort. In fluidics, fluid injection is being researched for use in aircraft to control direction, in two ways: circulation control and thrust vectoring. In both, larger more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller, simpler fluidic systems, in which larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. Moving mechanical control surfaces cause an important part of aircraft radar cross-section. Omitting mechanical control surfaces can reduce radar returns. BAE Systems has tested two fluidically controlled unmanned aircraft, one starting in 2010 named Demon, and another starting in 2017 named MAGMA, with the University of Manchester. In circulation control, near the trailing edges of wings, aircraft flight control systems are replaced by slots which emit fluid flows.

(; ; 24 May 1940 ‚Äì 28 January 1996) was a Russian-American poet and essayist. Born in Leningrad in 1940, Brodsky ran afoul of Soviet authorities and was expelled (\\"strongly advised\\" to emigrate) from the Soviet Union in 1972, settling in the United States with the help of W. H. Auden and other supporters. He taught thereafter at Mount Holyoke College, and at universities including Yale, Columbia, Cambridge, and Michigan. Brodsky was awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Literature \\"for an all-embracing authorship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity\\". He was appointed United States Poet Laureate in 1991. According to Professor Andrey Ranchin of Moscow State University: ‚ÄúBrodsky is the only modern Russian poet whose body of work has already been awarded the honorary title of a canonized classic... Brodsky's literary canonization is an exceptional phenomenon.

He was a descendant of a prominent and ancient rabbinic family, Schorr (Shor).Finding Our Fathers: A Guidebook to Jewish Genealogy By Dan Rottenberg His direct male-line ancestor is Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor. His father, Aleksandr Brodsky, was a professional photographer in the Soviet Navy, and his mother, Maria Volpert Brodskaya, was a professional interpreter whose work often helped to support the family. They lived in communal apartments, in poverty, marginalized by their Jewish status.Cole, Henri \\"Brodsky, Joseph\\". The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English. Ian Hamilton. Oxford University Press, 1996. In early childhood Brodsky survived the Siege of Leningrad where he and his parents nearly died of starvation; one aunt did die of hunger. He later suffered from various health problems caused by the siege. Brodsky commented that many of his teachers were anti-Semitic and that he felt like a dissident from an early age. He noted \\"I began to despise Lenin, even when I was in the first grade, not so much because of his political philosophy or practice ... but because of his omnipresent images.\\" As a young student, Brodsky was \\"an unruly child\\" known for his misbehavior during classes. At fifteen, Brodsky left school and tried to enter the School of Submariners without success. He went on to work as a milling machine operator. Later, having decided to become a physician, he worked at the morgue at the Kresty Prison, cutting and sewing bodies. He subsequently held a variety of jobs in hospitals, in a ship's boiler room, and on geological expeditions. At the same time, Brodsky engaged in a program of self-education. He learned Polish so he could translate the works of Polish poets such as Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, and English so that he could translate John Donne. On the way, he acquired a deep interest in classical philosophy, religion, mythology, and English and American poetry. Career and family =Early career= In 1955, Brodsky began writing his own poetry and producing literary translations. He circulated them in secret, and some were published by the underground journal, Sintaksis (Syntax). His writings were apolitical. By 1958 he was already well known in literary circles for his poems \\"The Jewish cemetery near Leningrad\\" and \\"Pilgrims\\". Asked when he first felt called to poetry, he recollected, \\"In 1959, in Yakutsk, when walking in that terrible city, I went into a bookstore. I snagged a copy of poems by Baratynsky. I had nothing to read. So I read that book and finally understood what I had to do in life. Or got very excited, at least. So in a way, Evgeny Abramovich Baratynsky is sort of responsible.\\" His friend, Ludmila Shtern, recalled working with Brodsky on an irrigation project in his \\"geological period\\" (working as a geologist's assistant): \\"We bounced around the Leningrad Province examining kilometers of canals, checking their embankments, which looked terrible. They were falling down, coming apart, had all sorts of strange things growing in them... It was during these trips, however, that I was privileged to hear the poems \\"The Hills\\" and \\"You Will Gallop in the Dark\\". Brodsky read them aloud to me between two train cars as we were going towards Tikhvin.\\"Shtern, Ludmila (2004). Brodsky: A Personal Memoir. Baskerville Publishers, p. 63. In 1960, the young Brodsky met Anna Akhmatova, one of the leading poets of the silver age. She encouraged his work, and would go on to become his mentor. In 1962, in Leningrad, Anna Akhmatova introduced him to the artist Marina Basmanova, a young painter from an established artistic family who was drawing Akhmatova's portrait. The two started a relationship; however, Brodsky's then close friend and fellow poet, Dmitri Bobyshev, was in love with Basmanova. As Bobyshev began to pursue the woman, immediately, the authorities began to pursue Brodsky; Bobyshev was widely held responsible for denouncing him. Brodsky dedicated much love poetry to Marina Basmanova: =Denunciation= In 1963, Brodsky's poetry was denounced by a Leningrad newspaper as \\"pornographic and anti-Soviet\\". His papers were confiscated, he was interrogated, twice put in a mental institution and then arrested. He was charged with social parasitism by the Soviet authorities in a trial in 1964, finding that his series of odd jobs and role as a poet were not a sufficient contribution to society.Cissie Dore Hill (trans.)Remembering Joseph Brodsky . Hoover Institution They called him \\"a pseudo-poet in velveteen trousers\\" who failed to fulfill his \\"constitutional duty to work honestly for the good of the motherland\\". The trial judge asked, \\"Who has recognized you as a poet? Who has enrolled you in the ranks of poets?\\" ‚Äì \\"No one\\", Brodsky replied, \\"Who enrolled me in the ranks of the human race?\\" Brodsky was not yet 24. Plaque marking where Brodsky stayed in Vilnius For his \\"parasitism\\" Brodsky was sentenced to five years hard labor and served 18 months on a farm in the village of Norenskaya, in the Archangelsk region, 350 miles from Leningrad. He rented his own small cottage, and although it was without plumbing or central heating, having one's own, private space was taken to be a great luxury at the time. Basmanova, Bobyshev, and Brodsky's mother, among others, visited. He wrote on his typewriter, chopped wood, hauled manure, and at night read his anthologies of English and American poetry, including a lot of W. H. Auden and Robert Frost. Brodsky's close friend and biographer Lev Loseff writes that while confinement in the mental hospital and the trial were miserable experiences, the 18 months in the Arctic were among the best times of Brodsky's life. Brodsky's mentor, Anna Akhmatova, laughed at the KGB's shortsightedness. \\"What a biography they're fashioning for our red- haired friend!\\", she said. \\"It's as if he'd hired them to do it on purpose.\\" Brodsky's sentence was commuted in 1965 after protests by prominent Soviet and foreign cultural figures, including Evgeny Evtushenko, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Jean-Paul Sartre as well as Akhmatova.Natalia Zhdanova, \\"Timelessness: Water Frees Time from Time Itself\\" , Neva News, 1 August 2007. Brodsky became a cause c√©l√®bre in the West also, when a secret transcription of trial minutes was smuggled out of the country, making him a symbol of artistic resistance in a totalitarian society, much like his mentor, Akhmatova. The suitcase with which Brodsky left his homeland, on June 4, 1972, carrying a typewriter, two bottles of vodka, and a collection of poems by John Donne - today displayed in the Anna Akhmatova Museum, Saint Petersburg His son, Andrei, was born on 8 October 1967, and Basmanova broke off the relationship. Andrei was registered under Basmanova's surname because Brodsky did not want his son to suffer from the political attacks that he endured.Russian writers since 1980, Volume 285 of Dictionary of literary biography. Editors Marina Balina, Mark Naumovich LipovetÔ∏†sÔ∏°kiƒ≠. Gale publishers (2004), p. 28 Marina Basmanova was threatened by the Soviet authorities, which prevented her from marrying Brodsky or joining him when he was exiled from the country. After the birth of their son, Brodsky continued to dedicate love poetry to Basmanova. In 1989, Brodsky wrote his last poem to \\"M.B.\\", describing himself remembering their life in Leningrad: Brodsky returned to Leningrad in December 1965 and continued to write over the next seven years, many of his works being translated into German, French, and English and published abroad. Verses and Poems was published by Inter-Language Literary Associates in Washington in 1965, Elegy to John Donne and Other Poems was published in London in 1967 by Longmans Green, and A Stop in the Desert was issued in 1970 by Chekhov Publishing in New York. Only four of his poems were published in Leningrad anthologies in 1966 and 1967, most of his work appearing outside the Soviet Union or circulated in secret (samizdat) until 1987. Persecuted for his poetry and his Jewish heritage, he was denied permission to travel. In 1972, while Brodsky was being considered for exile, the authorities consulted mental health expert Andrei Snezhnevsky, a key proponent of the notorious pseudo-medical diagnosis of \\"paranoid reformist delusion\\". This political tool allowed the state to lock up dissenters in psychiatric institutions indefinitely. Without examining him personally, Snezhnevsky diagnosed Brodsky as having \\"sluggishly progressing schizophrenia\\", concluding that he was \\"not a valuable person at all and may be let go\\". In 1971, Brodsky was invited twice to emigrate to Israel. When called to the Ministry of the Interior in 1972 and asked why he had not accepted, he stated that he wished to stay in the country. Within ten days officials broke into his apartment, took his papers, and on 4 June 1972, put him on a plane for Vienna, Austria. He never returned to Russia and never saw Basmanova again. Brodsky later wrote \\"The Last Judgement is the Last Judgement, but a human being who spent his life in Russia, has to be, without any hesitation, placed into Paradise.\\"D. Smirnov-Sadovsky, Song from Underground, Booklet of the Festival \\"Masterpieces of the Russian Underground\\", Lincoln Center, New York, USA, January 2003, pp. 16-19Song from Underground, Wikilivres In Austria, he met Carl Ray Proffer and Auden, who facilitated Brodsky's transit to the United States and proved influential to Brodsky's career. Proffer, of the University of Michigan and one of the co- founders of Ardis Publishers, became Brodsky's Russian publisher from this point on. Recalling his landing in Vienna, Brodsky commented, > I knew I was leaving my country for good, but for where, I had no idea > whatsoever. One thing which was quite clear was that I didn't want to go to > Israel... I never even believed that they'd allow me to go. I never believed > they would put me on a plane, and when they did I didn't know whether the > plane would go east or west... I didn't want to be hounded by what was left > of the Soviet Security Service in England. So I came to the States.Haven > (2006) p84 Although the poet was invited back after the fall of the Soviet Union, Brodsky never returned to his country.Loseff, Lev (2010) Joseph Brodsky: A Literary Life, Yale University Press (New Haven, CT) = United States = Brodsky teaching at University of Michigan, c. 1972 After a short stay in Vienna, Brodsky settled in Ann Arbor, with the help of poets Auden and Proffer, and became poet-in-residence at the University of Michigan for a year. Brodsky went on to become a visiting professor at Queens College (1973‚Äì74), Smith College, Columbia University, and Cambridge University, later returning to the University of Michigan (1974‚Äì80). He was the Andrew Mellon Professor of Literature and Five College Professor of Literature at Mount Holyoke College, brought there by poet and historian Peter Viereck.Profile at Mount Holyoke College In 1978, Brodsky was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters at Yale University, and on 23 May 1979, he was inducted as a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He moved to New York's Greenwich Village in 1980 and in 1981 received the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation \\"genius\\" award. He was also a recipient of The International Center in New York Award of Excellence. In 1986, his collection of essays, Less Than One, won the National Book Critics Award for Criticism and he was given an honorary doctorate of literature from Oxford University. In 1987, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, the fifth Russian-born writer to do so. In an interview he was asked: \\"You are an American citizen who is receiving the Prize for Russian-language poetry. Who are you, an American or a Russian?\\" \\"I'm Jewish; a Russian poet, an English essayist ‚Äì and, of course, an American citizen\\", he responded.Gross, Irena. \\"A Jewish Boy with a Head Full of Russian Rhymes\\". Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies 45th Annual Convention, Boston Marriott Copley Place, Boston, MA. Abstract The Academy stated that they had awarded the prize for his \\"all-embracing authorship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity\\". It also called his writing \\"rich and intensely vital\\", characterized by \\"great breadth in time and space\\". It was \\"a big step for me, a small step for mankind\\", he joked. The prize coincided with the first legal publication in Russia of Brodsky's poetry as an exil√©. Plaque in honour of Brodsky in Venice In 1991, Brodsky became Poet Laureate of the United States. The Librarian of Congress said that Brodsky had \\"the open-ended interest of American life that immigrants have. This is a reminder that so much of American creativity is from people not born in America.\\" His inauguration address was printed in Poetry Review. Brodsky held an honorary degree from the University of Silesia in Poland and was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science. In 1995, Gleb Uspensky, a senior editor at the Russian publishing house, Vagrius, asked Brodsky to return to Russia for a tour, but he could not agree. For the last ten years of his life, Brodsky was under considerable pressure from those that regarded him as a \\"fortune maker\\". He was a greatly honored professor, was on first name terms with the heads of many large publishing houses, and connected to the significant figures of American literary life. His friend Ludmila Shtern wrote that many Russian intellectuals in both Russia and America assumed his influence was unlimited, that a nod from him could secure them a book contract, a teaching post or a grant, that it was in his gift to assure a glittering career. A helping hand or a rejection of a petition for help could create a storm in Russian literary circles, which Shtern suggests became very personal at times. His position as a lauded √©migr√© and Nobel Prize winner won him enemies and stoked resentment, the politics of which, she writes, made him feel \\"deathly tired\\" of it all toward the end.Stern (2004) p. 305 Cimitero di San Michele, Venice, Veneto, Italy In 1990, while teaching literature in France, Brodsky married a young student, Maria Sozzani, who has a Russian- Italian background; they had one daughter, Anna Brodsky, born in 1993. Marina Basmanova lived in fear of the Soviet authorities until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991; only after this was their son Andrei Basmanov allowed to join his father in New York. In the 1990s, Brodsky invited Andrei to visit him in New York for three months and they maintained a father-son relationship until Brodsky's death. Andrei married in the 1990s and had three children, all of whom were recognized and supported by Brodsky as his grandchildren; Marina Basmanova, Andrei, and Brodsky's grandchildren all live in Saint Petersburg. Andrei gave readings of his father's poetry in a documentary about Brodsky. The film contains Brodsky's poems dedicated to Marina Basmanova and written between 1961 and 1982.Brodsky, Joseph. \\"New Stances\\" Ardis, 1983, USA Brodsky died of a heart attack aged 55, at his apartment in Brooklyn Heights, a neighborhood of Brooklyn, a borough of New York City, on January 28, 1996. He had had open-heart surgery in 1979 and later two bypass operations, remaining in frail health following that time. He was buried in a non-Catholic section of the Isola di San Michele cemetery in Venice, Italy, also the resting place of Ezra Pound and Igor Stravinsky. In 1997, a plaque was placed on his former house in St. Petersburg, with his portrait in relief and the words \\"In this house from 1940 to 1972 lived the great Russian poet, Iosif Aleksandrovich Brodsky\\".Stern (2004) p. 330 Brodsky's close friend, the Nobel laureate Derek Walcott, memorialized him in his collection The Prodigal, in 2004. Work Brodsky is perhaps most known for his poetry collections, A Part of Speech (1977) and To Urania (1988), and the essay collection, Less Than One (1986), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. Other notable works include the play, Marbles (1989), and Watermark (1992), a prose meditation on Venice. Throughout his career he wrote in Russian and English, self-translating and working with eminent poet-translators. =Themes and forms= In his introduction to Brodsky's Selected Poems (New York and Harmondsworth, 1973), W. H. Auden described Brodsky as a traditionalist lyric poet fascinated by \\"encounters with nature, ... reflections upon the human condition, death, and the meaning of existence\\". He drew on wide-ranging themes, from Mexican and Caribbean literature to Roman poetry, mixing \\"the physical and the metaphysical, place and ideas about place, now and the past and the future\\". Critic Dinah Birch suggests that Brodsky's \\" first volume of poetry in English, Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems (1973), shows that although his strength was a distinctive kind of dry, meditative soliloquy, he was immensely versatile and technically accomplished in a number of forms.\\"\\"Brodsky, Joseph\\" The Oxford Companion to English Literature. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press. To Urania: Selected Poems 1965‚Äì1985 collected translations of older work with new work written during his American exile and reflect on themes of memory, home, and loss. His two essay collections consist of critical studies of such poets as Osip Mandelshtam, W. H. Auden, Thomas Hardy, Rainer Maria Rilke and Robert Frost, sketches of his own life, and those of contemporaries such as Akhmatova, Nadezhda Mandelshtam, and Stephen Spender. A recurring theme in Brodsky's writing is the relationship between the poet and society. In particular, Brodsky emphasized the power of literature to affect its audience positively and to develop the language and culture in which it is situated. He suggested that the Western literary tradition was in part responsible for the world having overcome the catastrophes of the twentieth century, such as Nazism, Communism, and two World Wars. During his term as Poet Laureate, Brodsky promoted the idea of bringing the Anglo-American poetic heritage to a wider American audience by distributing free poetry anthologies to the public through a government-sponsored program. Librarian of Congress James Billington wrote, > Joseph had difficulty understanding why poetry did not draw the large > audiences in the United States that it did in Russia. He was proud of > becoming an American citizen in 1977 (the Soviets having made him stateless > upon his expulsion in 1972) and valued the freedoms that life in the United > States provided. But he regarded poetry as \\"language's highest degree of > maturity\\", and wanted everyone to be susceptible to it. As Poet Laureate, he > suggested that inexpensive anthologies of the best American poets be made > available in hotels and airports, hospitals and supermarkets. He thought > that people who are restless or fearful or lonely or weary might pick up > poetry and discover unexpectedly that others had experienced these emotions > before and had used them to celebrate life rather than escape from it. > Joseph's idea was picked up, and thousands of such books have in fact been > placed where people may come across them out of need or curiosity. This passion for promoting the seriousness and importance of poetry comes through in Brodsky's opening remarks as the U.S. Poet Laureate in October 1991. He said, \\"By failing to read or listen to poets, society dooms itself to inferior modes of articulation, those of the politician, the salesman or the charlatan. ... In other words, it forfeits its own evolutionary potential. For what distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom is precisely the gift of speech. ... Poetry is not a form of entertainment and in a certain sense not even a form of art, but it is our anthropological, genetic goal, our evolutionary, linguistic beacon.\\" This sentiment is echoed throughout his work. In interview with Sven Birkerts in 1979, Brodsky reflected: > In the works of the better poets you get the sensation that they're not > talking to people any more, or to some seraphical creature. What they're > doing is simply talking back to the language itself, as beauty, sensuality, > wisdom, irony, those aspects of language of which the poet is a clear > mirror. Poetry is not an art or a branch of art, it's something more. If > what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is > the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological, indeed genetic, > goal. Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as \\"a read\\", commits an > anthropological crime, in the first place, against himself.Dingle, Carol > (2003) Memorable Quotations: Jewish Writers of the Past p. 22 =Influences= Librarian of Congress Dr James Billington, wrote > He was the favored prot√©g√© of the great lady of Petersburg, Anna Akhmatova, > and to hear him read her poems in Russian in the Library of Congress was an > experience to make one's hair stand on end even if one did not understand > the Russian language. Joseph Brodsky was the embodiment of the hopes not > only of Anna Akhmatova, the last of the great Petersburg poets from the > beginning of the century, but also Nadezhda Mandelstam, the widow of another > great martyred poet Osip Mandelstam.

The Caxtonian Vol. 4 April 2007, p. 2 Journal of the Caxton > Club Accessed 2010-10-21 Brodsky also was deeply influenced by the English metaphysical poets from John Donne to Auden. Many works were dedicated to other writers such as Tomas Venclova, Octavio Paz, Robert Lowell, Derek Walcott, and Benedetta Craveri. Brodsky's work is seen to have been vitally enhanced by the work of renowned translators. A Part of Speech (New York and Oxford, 1980), his second major collection in English, includes translations by Anthony Hecht, Howard Moss, Derek Walcott, and Richard Wilbur. Critic and poet Henri Cole notes that Brodsky's \\"own translations have been criticized for turgidness, lacking a native sense of musicality.\\" Awards and honors *1978 ‚Äì Honorary degree of Doctor of Letters, Yale University *1979 ‚Äì Fellowship of American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters *1981 ‚Äì John D. and Catherine T.

In insects, crustaceans, and the extinct trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions of the creature's body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments. The human thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain. Etymology The word thorax comes from the Greek Œ∏œéœÅŒ±Œæ thorax \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\"Œ∏œéœÅŒ±Œæ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library via . Human thorax =Structure= In humans and other hominids, the thorax is the chest region of the body between the neck and the abdomen, along with its internal organs and other contents. It is mostly protected and supported by the rib cage, spine, and shoulder girdle. Contents An X-ray of a human chest area, with some structures labeled The contents of the thorax include the heart and lungs (and the thymus gland); the (major and minor pectoral muscles, trapezius muscles, and neck muscle); and internal structures such as the diaphragm, the esophagus, the trachea, and a part of the sternum known as the xiphoid process). Arteries and veins are also contained ‚Äì (aorta, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and the pulmonary artery); bones (the shoulder socket containing the upper part of the humerus, the scapula, sternum, thoracic portion of the spine, collarbone, and the rib cage and floating ribs). External structures are the skin and nipples. The chest In the human body, the region of the thorax between the neck and diaphragm in the front of the body is called the chest. The corresponding area in an animal can also be referred to as the chest. The shape of the chest does not correspond to that part of the thoracic skeleton that encloses the heart and lungs. All the breadth of the shoulders is due to the shoulder girdle, and contains the axillae and the heads of the humeri. In the middle line the suprasternal notch is seen above, while about three fingers' breadth below it a transverse ridge can be felt, which is known as the sternal angle and this marks the junction between the manubrium and body of the sternum. Level with this line the second ribs join the sternum, and when these are found the lower ribs can often be counted. At the lower part of the sternum, where the seventh or last true ribs join it, the ensiform cartilage begins, and above this there is often a depression known as the pit of the stomach. Bones The bones of the thorax, called the \\"thoracic skeleton\\" is a component of the axial skeleton. It consists of the ribs and sternum. The ribs of the thorax are numbered in ascending order from 1-12. 11 & 12 are known as floating ribs because they have no anterior attachment point in particular the cartilage attached to the sternum, as 1-7 are, and therefore are termed \\"floating\\". Whereas ribs 8-10 are termed false ribs as their costal cartilage articulates with the costal cartilage of the rib above. Anatomical landmarks The anatomy of the chest can also be described through the use of anatomical landmarks. The nipple in the male is situated in front of the fourth rib or a little below; vertically it lies a little external to a line drawn down from the middle of the clavicle; in the female it is not so constant. A little below it the lower limit of the great pectoral muscle is seen running upward and outward to the axilla; in the female this is obscured by the breast, which extends from the second to the sixth rib vertically and from the edge of the sternum to the mid-axillary line laterally. The female nipple is surrounded for half an inch by a more or less pigmented disc, the areola. The apex of a normal heart is in the fifth left intercostal space, three and a half inches from the mid-line. =Clinical significance= High-resolution computed tomographs of a normal thorax, taken in the axial, coronal and sagittal planes, respectively. This type of investigation can be used for detecting both acute and chronic changes in the lung parenchyma. Different types of diseases or conditions that affect the chest include pleurisy, flail chest, atelectasis, and the most common condition, chest pain. These conditions can be hereditary or caused by birth defects or trauma. Any condition that lowers the ability to either breathe deeply or to cough is considered a chest disease or condition. Injury Injury to the chest (also referred to as chest trauma, thoracic injury, or thoracic trauma) results in up to ¬º of all deaths due to trauma in the United States.Shahani, Rohit, MD. (2005). Penetrating Chest Trauma. eMedicine. Retrieved 2005-02-05. The major pathophysiologies encountered in blunt chest trauma involve derangements in the flow of air, blood, or both in combination. Sepsis due to leakage of alimentary tract contents, as in esophageal perforations, also must be considered. Blunt trauma commonly results in chest wall injuries (e.g., rib fractures). The pain associated with these injuries can make breathing difficult, and this may compromise ventilation. Direct lung injuries, such as pulmonary contusions (see the image below), are frequently associated with major chest trauma and may impair ventilation by a similar mechanism. Pain Chest pain can be the result of multiple issues, including respiratory problems, digestive issues, and musculoskeletal complications. The pain can trigger cardiac issues as well. Not all pain that is felt is associated with the heart, but it should not be taken lightly either. Symptoms can be different depending on the cause of the pain.Chest Diseases Retrieved on 2010-1-26 While cardiac issues cause feelings of sudden pressure in the chest or a crushing pain in the back, neck, and arms, pain that is felt due to noncardiac issues gives a burning feeling along the digestive tract or pain when deep breaths are attempted. Different people feel pains differently for the same condition. Only a patient truly knows if the symptoms are mild or serious. Chest pain may be a symptom of myocardial infarctions ('heart attack'). If this condition is present in the body, discomfort will be felt in the chest that is similar to a heavy weight placed on the body. Sweating, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and irregular heartbeat may also be experienced. If a heart attack occurs, the bulk of the damage is caused during the first six hours, so getting the proper treatment as quickly as possible is important. Some people, especially those who are elderly or have diabetes, may not have typical chest pain but may have many of the other symptoms of a heart attack. It is important that these patients and their caregivers have a good understanding of heart attack symptoms. =Non- cardiac causes of chest pain= Just like with a heart attack, not all chest pain is suffered because of a condition involving the heart. Chest wall pain can be experienced after an increase in activity. Persons who add exercise to their daily routine generally feel this type of pain at the beginning. It is important to monitor the pain to ensure that it is not a sign of something more serious. Pain can also be experienced in persons who have an upper respiratory infection. This virus is also accompanied by a fever and cough. Shingles is another viral infection that can give symptoms of chest or rib pain before a rash develops. Injuries to the rib cage or sternum is also a common cause of chest pain. It is generally felt when deep breaths are taken or during a cough. Atelectasis Another non cardiac cause of chest pain is atelectasis. It is a condition that suffered when a portion of the lung collapses from being airless. When bronchial tubes are blocked, this condition develops and causes patients to feel shortness of breath. The most common cause of atelectasis is when a bronchi that extends from the windpipe is blocked and traps air. The blockage may be caused by something inside the bronchus, such as a plug of mucus, a tumour, or an inhaled foreign object such as a coin, piece of food, or a toy.Atelectasis Lung and Airway Disorders. Retrieved on 2010-1-26 It is possible for something outside of the bronchus to cause the blockage. Pneumothorax Pneumothorax is the condition where air or gas can build up in the pleural space. It can occur without a known cause or as the result of a lung disease or acute lung injury.Pleurisy Lung Diseases. Retrieved on 2010-1-26 The size of the pneumothorax changes as air or gas builds up, so a medical procedure can release the pressure with a needle. If it is untreated, blood flow can be interrupted and cause a drop in blood pressure known as tension pneumothorax. It is possible for smaller cases to clear up on their own. Symptoms of this condition are often felt only on one side of the lung or as a shortness of breath. Other animals =In tetrapods= In mammals, the thorax is the region of the body formed by the sternum, the thoracic vertebrae, and the ribs. It extends from the neck to the diaphragm, and does not include the upper limbs. The heart and the lungs reside in the thoracic cavity, as well as many blood vessels. The inner organs are protected by the rib cage and the sternum. Thoracic vertebrae are also distinguished in birds, but not in reptiles. =In arthropods= In insects, crustaceans, and the extinct trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions of the creature's body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments. It is the area where the wings and legs attach in insects, or an area of multiple articulating plates in trilobites. In most insects, the thorax itself is composed of three segments; the prothorax, the mesothorax, and the metathorax. In extant insects, the prothorax never has wings, though legs are always present in adults; wings (when present) are restricted to at least the mesothorax, and typically also the metathorax, though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments. In the Apocritan Hymenoptera, the first abdominal segment is fused to the metathorax, where it forms a structure known as the propodeum. Accordingly, in these insects, the functional thorax is composed of four segments, and is therefore typically called the mesosoma to distinguish it from the \\"thorax\\" of other insects. Each thoracic segment in an insect is further subdivided into various parts, the most significant of which are the dorsal portion (the notum), the lateral portion (the pleuron; one on each side), and the ventral portion (the sternum). In some insects, each of these parts is composed of one to several independent exoskeletal plates with membrane between them (called sclerites), though in many cases the sclerites are fused to various degrees.

It is used in certain speculative hypotheses, such as on the construction of traversable wormholes and the Alcubierre drive. Currently, the closest known real representative of such exotic matter is a region of negative pressure density produced by the Casimir effect. General relativity describes gravity and the laws of motion for both positive and negative energy particles, hence negative mass, but does not include the other fundamental forces. On the other hand, the Standard Model describes elementary particles and the other fundamental forces, but it does not include gravity. A unified theory that explicitly includes gravity along with the other fundamental forces may be needed for a better understanding of the concept of negative mass. In December 2018, astrophysicist Jamie Farnes from the University of Oxford proposed a \\"dark fluid\\" theory, related, in part, to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses, presented earlier by Albert Einstein, that may help better understand, in a testable manner, the considerable amounts of unknown dark matter and dark energy in the cosmos. In general relativity Negative mass is any region of space in which for some observers the mass density is measured to be negative. This could occur due to a region of space in which the stress component of the Einstein stress‚Äìenergy tensor is larger in magnitude than the mass density. All of these are violations of one or another variant of the positive energy condition of Einstein's general theory of relativity; however, the positive energy condition is not a required condition for the mathematical consistency of the theory. =Inertial versus gravitational mass= In considering negative mass, it is important to consider which of these concepts of mass are negative. Ever since Newton first formulated his theory of gravity, there have been at least three conceptually distinct quantities called mass: *inertial mass - the mass m that appears in Newton's second law of motion, F = m a *\\"active\\" gravitational mass - the mass that produces a gravitational field that other masses respond to *\\"passive\\" gravitational mass - the mass that responds to an external gravitational field by accelerating. The law of conservation of momentum requires that active and passive gravitational mass be identical. Einstein's equivalence principle postulates that inertial mass must equal passive gravitational mass, and all experimental evidence to date has found these are, indeed, always the same. In most analyses of negative mass, it is assumed that the equivalence principle and conservation of momentum continue to apply, and therefore all three forms of mass are still the same, leading to the study of \\"negative mass\\". But the equivalence principle is simply an observational fact, and is not necessarily valid. If such a distinction is made, a \\"negative mass\\" can be of three kinds: whether the inertial mass is negative, the gravitational mass, or both. In his 4th- prize essay for the 1951 Gravity Research Foundation competition, Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger considered the possibility of negative mass and how it would behave under gravitational and other forces. In 1957, following Luttinger's idea, Hermann Bondi suggested in a paper in Reviews of Modern Physics that mass might be negative as well as positive. He pointed out that this does not entail a logical contradiction, as long as all three forms of mass are negative, but that the assumption of negative mass involves some counter- intuitive form of motion. For example, an object with negative inertial mass would be expected to accelerate in the opposite direction to that in which it was pushed (non-gravitationally). There have been several other analyses of negative mass, such as the studies conducted by R. M. Price, however none addressed the question of what kind of energy and momentum would be necessary to describe non-singular negative mass. Indeed, the Schwarzschild solution for negative mass parameter has a naked singularity at a fixed spatial position. The question that immediately comes up is, would it not be possible to smooth out the singularity with some kind of negative mass density. The answer is yes, but not with energy and momentum that satisfies the dominant energy condition. This is because if the energy and momentum satisfies the dominant energy condition within a spacetime that is asymptotically flat, which would be the case of smoothing out the singular negative mass Schwarzschild solution, then it must satisfy the positive energy theorem, i.e. its ADM mass must be positive, which is of course not the case. However, it was noticed by Bellet√™te and Paranjape that since the positive energy theorem does not apply to asymptotic de Sitter spacetime, it would actually be possible to smooth out, with energy‚Äìmomentum that does satisfy the dominant energy condition, the singularity of the corresponding exact solution of negative mass Schwarzschild‚Äìde Sitter, which is the singular, exact solution of Einstein's equations with cosmological constant. In a subsequent article, Mbarek and Paranjape showed that it is in fact possible to obtain the required deformation through the introduction of the energy‚Äìmomentum of a perfect fluid. =Runaway motion= Although no particles are known to have negative mass, physicists (primarily Hermann Bondi in 1957, William B. Bonnor in 1964 and 1989, then Robert L. Forward) have been able to describe some of the anticipated properties such particles may have. Assuming that all three concepts of mass are equivalent according to the equivalence principle, the gravitational interactions between masses of arbitrary sign can be explored, based on the Newtonian approximation of the Einstein field equations. The interaction laws are then:In yellow, the \\"preposterous\\" runaway motion of positive and negative masses described by Bondi and Bonnor. * Positive mass attracts both other positive masses and negative masses. * Negative mass repels both other negative masses and positive masses. For two positive masses, nothing changes and there is a gravitational pull on each other causing an attraction. Two negative masses would repel because of their negative inertial masses. For different signs however, there is a push that repels the positive mass from the negative mass, and a pull that attracts the negative mass towards the positive one at the same time. Hence Bondi pointed out that two objects of equal and opposite mass would produce a constant acceleration of the system towards the positive-mass object, an effect called \\"runaway motion\\" by Bonnor who disregarded its physical existence, stating: Such a couple of objects would accelerate without limit (except relativistic one); however, the total mass, momentum and energy of the system would remain zero. This behavior is completely inconsistent with a common-sense approach and the expected behavior of \\"normal\\" matter. Thomas Gold even hinted that the runaway linear motion could be used in a perpetual motion machine if converted as a circular motion: But Forward showed that the phenomenon is mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation laws. If the masses are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, then the momentum of the system remains zero if they both travel together and accelerate together, no matter what their speed: :p_\\\\mathrm{sys} = mv + (-m)v = \\\\big(m+(-m)\\\\big)v = 0\\\\times v = 0. And equivalently for the kinetic energy: :E_\\\\mathrm{k,sys} = \\\\tfrac12 mv^2 + \\\\tfrac12(-m)v^2 = \\\\tfrac12\\\\big(m+(-m)\\\\big)v^2 = \\\\tfrac12(0)v^2 = 0 However, this is perhaps not exactly valid if the energy in the gravitational field is taken into account. Forward extended Bondi's analysis to additional cases, and showed that even if the two masses and are not the same, the conservation laws remain unbroken. This is true even when relativistic effects are considered, so long as inertial mass, not rest mass, is equal to gravitational mass. This behaviour can produce bizarre results: for instance, a gas containing a mixture of positive and negative matter particles will have the positive matter portion increase in temperature without bound. However, the negative matter portion gains negative temperature at the same rate, again balancing out. Geoffrey A. Landis pointed out other implications of Forward's analysis, including noting that although negative mass particles would repel each other gravitationally, the electrostatic force would be attractive for like charges and repulsive for opposite charges. Forward used the properties of negative-mass matter to create the concept of diametric drive, a design for spacecraft propulsion using negative mass that requires no energy input and no reaction mass to achieve arbitrarily high acceleration. Forward also coined a term, \\"nullification\\", to describe what happens when ordinary matter and negative matter meet: they are expected to be able to cancel out or nullify each other's existence. An interaction between equal quantities of positive mass matter (hence of positive energy ) and negative mass matter (of negative energy ) would release no energy, but because the only configuration of such particles that has zero momentum (both particles moving with the same velocity in the same direction) does not produce a collision, such interactions would leave a surplus of momentum. =Bimetric solution for the runaway motion paradox= In green, gravitational interactions in bimetric theories which differ from those elaborated by Bondi and Bonnor, solving the runaway paradox. Through bimetric Newtonian approximation, Jean-Pierre Petit proposed a solution for the runaway motion paradox in which: * Like masses attract (positive mass attracts positive mass, negative mass attracts negative mass). * Unlike masses repel (positive mass and negative mass repel each other). Although the mathematics is not trivial, the dynamic of the system can be presented using the following simplification (from the positive mass point of view): A possible interpretation of the bimetric solution from the positive mass point of view: in transparent blue is the force experienced by each mass, in opaque blue is how the latter reacts to it. * Two positive masses exert a force on each other that points inward and both masses will react to it by accelerating inward (i.e., the gravitation law we are familiar with) * Two negative masses exert a force on each other that points outward, but both masses, being negative, will react to it by accelerating inward (the final effect will be indistinguishable from the Newton's law we are familiar with) * Between a positive and a negative mass, the positive mass exerts a force on the negative mass that points inward, but the negative mass will react to it by accelerating outward; on the other side, the negative mass exerts a force on the positive mass that points outward and this reacts to it accordingly by accelerating outward; the final result will appear as a symmetric repulsive force between the two opposite masses (an ‚Äúanti-Newton's law‚Äù) Those laws are different to the laws described by Bondi and Bonnor, and solve the runaway paradox. To do this, they refer to the Janus cosmological model developed by Petit, where gravitation could be described by a bimetric model which would extend general relativity. Improved in 2015 to justify the acceleration of the expansion of the universe, the 2014 (and 22 November 2016) version of the model was criticized by the physicist Thibault Damour in a 4 January 2019 analysis, which demonstrated internal inconsistency in the model.Damour quotes two Petit's publications dated 2014 on which he made his analysis. Moreover, he also used various documents, including ‚ÄúLe Mod√®le Cosmologique Janus, 22 novembre 2016‚Äù (The Janus cosmological model, 22 November 2016). Exact quote in French \\"Les √©quations de base qui d√©finissent ‚Äúle mod√®le Janus‚Äù (d‚Äôapr√®s les r√©f√©rences cit√©es ci-dessus, compl√©t√©es par, notamment, la page 39 du document ‚ÄúLe Mod√®le Cosmologique Janus, 22 novembre 2016‚Äù)\\". Since then, further changes have been made to the model, in an article published later in January 2019. Petit's work on this subject did not have much resonance among cosmologists. Nevertheless, independent studies of bimetric gravity with positive and negative masses led to the same conclusions regarding the laws of gravity. Consequently, NASA is considering the implications of negative mass for faster than light propulsion and/or wormholes (or equivalent). Arrow of time and energy inversion = In quantum mechanics = In quantum mechanics, the time reversal operator is complex, and can either be unitary or antiunitary. In quantum field theory, T has been arbitrarily chosen to be antiunitary for the purpose of avoiding the existence of negative energy states: On the contrary, if the time reversal operator is chosen to be unitary (in conjunction with a unitary parity operator) in relativistic quantum mechanics, unitary PT-symmetry produces energy (and mass) inversion. = In dynamical systems theory = In group theoretical approach to dynamical systems analysis, the time reversal operator is real, and time reversal produces energy (and mass) inversion. In 1970, Jean-Marie Souriau demonstrated, using Kirillov's orbit method and the coadjoint representation of the full dynamical Poincar√© group, i.e. the group action on the dual space of its Lie algebra (or Lie coalgebra), that reversing the arrow of time is equal to reversing the energy of a particle (hence its mass, if the particle has one). In general relativity, the universe is described as a Riemannian manifold associated to a metric tensor solution of Einstein's field equations. In such a framework, the runaway motion forbids the existence of negative matter. Some bimetric theories of the universe propose that two parallel universes with an opposite arrow of time may exist instead of one, linked together by the Big Bang and interacting only through gravitation. translation in The universe is then described as a manifold associated to two Riemannian metrics (one with positive mass matter and the other with negative mass matter). According to group theory, the matter of the conjugated metric would appear to the matter of the other metric as having opposite mass and arrow of time (though its proper time would remain positive). The coupled metrics have their own geodesics and are solutions of two coupled field equations. The negative matter of the coupled metric, interacting with the matter of the other metric via gravity, could be an alternative candidate for the explanation of dark matter, dark energy, cosmic inflation and an accelerating universe. In Gauss's law of gravity In electromagnetism, one can derive the energy density of a field from Gauss's law, assuming the curl of the field is 0. Performing the same calculation using Gauss's law for gravity produces a negative energy density for a gravitational field. Gravitational interaction of antimatter The overwhelming consensus among physicists is that antimatter has positive mass and should be affected by gravity just like normal matter. Direct experiments on neutral antihydrogen have not been sensitive enough to detect any difference between the gravitational interaction of antimatter, compared to normal matter. Bubble chamber experiments provide further evidence that antiparticles have the same inertial mass as their normal counterparts. In these experiments, the chamber is subjected to a constant magnetic field that causes charged particles to travel in helical paths, the radius and direction of which correspond to the ratio of electric charge to inertial mass. Particle‚Äìantiparticle pairs are seen to travel in helices with opposite directions but identical radii, implying that the ratios differ only in sign; but this does not indicate whether it is the charge or the inertial mass that is inverted. However, particle‚Äìantiparticle pairs are observed to electrically attract one another. This behavior implies that both have positive inertial mass and opposite charges; if the reverse were true, then the particle with positive inertial mass would be repelled from its antiparticle partner. Experimentation Physicist Peter Engels and a team of colleagues at Washington State University reported the observation of negative mass behavior in rubidium atoms. On 10 April 2017, Engels team created negative effective mass by reducing the temperature of rubidium atoms to near absolute zero, generating a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate. By using a laser-trap, the team were able to reverse the spin of some of the rubidium atoms in this state, and observed that once released from the trap, the atoms expanded and displayed properties of negative mass, in particular accelerating towards a pushing force instead of away from it. This work was co-authored by experimentalists M. Amin Khamehchi and Maren Mossman, and by theorists Michael McNeil Forbes, Thomas Busch, Yongping Zhang, and Khalid Hossain. This kind of negative effective mass is analogous to the well-known apparent negative effective mass of electrons in the upper part of the dispersion bands in solids. However, neither case is negative mass for the purposes of the stress‚Äìenergy tensor. Some recent work with metamaterials suggests that some as-yet-undiscovered composite of superconductors, metamaterials and normal matter could exhibit signs of negative effective mass in much the same way as low temperature alloys melt at below the melting point of their components or some semiconductors have negative differential resistance. In quantum mechanics In 1928, Paul Dirac's theory of elementary particles, now part of the Standard Model, already included negative solutions. The Standard Model is a generalization of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and negative mass is already built into the theory. Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever pointed out that the quantum mechanics of the Casimir effect can be used to produce a locally mass-negative region of space‚Äìtime. In this article, and subsequent work by others, they showed that negative matter could be used to stabilize a wormhole. Cramer et al. argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by negative-mass loops of cosmic string. Stephen Hawking has argued that negative energy is a necessary condition for the creation of a closed timelike curve by manipulation of gravitational fields within a finite region of space; this implies, for example, that a finite Tipler cylinder cannot be used as a time machine. =Schr√∂dinger equation= For energy eigenstates of the Schr√∂dinger equation, the wavefunction is wavelike wherever the particle's energy is greater than the local potential, and exponential-like (evanescent) wherever it is less. Naively, this would imply kinetic energy is negative in evanescent regions (to cancel the local potential). However, kinetic energy is an operator in quantum mechanics, and its expectation value is always positive, summing with the expectation value of the potential energy to yield the energy eigenvalue. For wavefunctions of particles with zero rest mass (such as photons), this means that any evanescent portions of the wavefunction would be associated with a local negative mass‚Äìenergy. However, the Schr√∂dinger equation does not apply to massless particles; instead the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation is required. In special relativity One can achieve a negative mass independent of negative energy. According to mass‚Äìenergy equivalence, mass is in proportion to energy and the coefficient of proportionality is . Actually, is still equivalent to although the coefficient is another constant such as . In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a negative energy because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say, :\\\\begin{align} E&=-mc^2>0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ m&= -\\\\frac{E}{c^2}<0 \\\\end{align} Under the circumstances, :dE=F\\\\,ds=\\\\frac{dp}{dt}\\\\,ds=\\\\frac{ds}{dt}\\\\,dp=v\\\\,dp=v\\\\,d(mv) and so, :\\\\begin{align} -c^2\\\\,dm&=v\\\\,d(mv) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -c^2(2m)\\\\,dm&=2mv\\\\,d(mv) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -c^2\\\\,d(m^2)&=d(m^2v^2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -m^2c^2&=m^2v^2+C \\\\end{align} When , :C=-m_0^2c^2 Consequently, :\\\\begin{align} -m^2c^2&=m^2v^2-m_0^2c^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ m&=\\\\frac{m_0}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\\\end{align} where is invariant mass and invariant energy equals . The squared mass is still positive and the particle can be stable. From the above relation, :p=mv= \\\\frac{m_0 v}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}<0 The negative momentum is applied to explain negative refraction, the inverse Doppler effect and the reverse Cherenkov effect observed in a negative index metamaterial. The radiation pressure in the metamaterial is also negative because the force is defined as . Negative pressure exists in dark energy too. Using these above equations, the energy‚Äìmomentum relation should be :E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4 Substituting the Planck‚ÄìEinstein relation and de Broglie's , we obtain the following dispersion relation :\\\\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \\\\omega_\\\\mathrm{p}^2\\\\,, \\\\quad \\\\left(E_0=\\\\hbar\\\\omega_\\\\mathrm{p}=-m_0c^2>0\\\\right) when the wave consists of a stream of particles whose energy‚Äìmomentum relation is E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4 (wave‚Äìparticle duality) and can be excited in a negative index metamaterial. The velocity of such a particle is equal to :v=c\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\omega_\\\\mathrm{p}^2}{\\\\omega^2}-1} and range is from zero to infinity :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\omega_\\\\mathrm{p}^2}{\\\\omega^2}&<2\\\\,, \\\\quad\\\\mbox{when }v2\\\\,, \\\\quad\\\\mbox{when }v>c \\\\end{align} Moreover, the kinetic energy is also negative :\\\\begin{align} E_\\\\mathrm{k} &= E-E_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-mc^2-\\\\left(-m_0 c^2\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\frac{m_0c^2}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} + m_0 c^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= m_0 c^2 \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\\\right)<0\\\\,, \\\\quad \\\\left(\\\\mbox{where }m_0<0\\\\right) \\\\end{align} In fact, negative kinetic energy exists in some models to describe dark energy (phantom energy) whose pressure is negative. In this way, the negative mass of exotic matter is now associated with negative momentum, negative pressure, negative kinetic energy and faster-than-light phenomena.

The Korean War (25 June 1950 ‚Äì 27 July 1953) was significant in the fact that it was the first war in which the newly independent United States Air Force was involved. It was the first time U.S. jet aircraft entered into battle. Air Force F-86 Sabre jets took control of the skies, as American fighter pilots bested Soviet-built MiG-15 fighters in combat against aircraft, Soviet tactics, and, on some occasions, Soviet pilots of the Soviet 64th Fighter Aviation Corps. World War II-era prop-driven P-51D Mustangs were pressed into the ground-air support role, and large formations of B-29 Superfortresses flew for the last time on strategic bombardment missions. The Korean War also saw the first large-scale use of rotary-wing helicopters. The US suffered 4,055 service personnel killed and 2,714 aircraft lostKOREAN AIR BATTLES. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. with the USAF suffering 1,841 battle casualties, of which 1,180 were killed in action. Overview Shaped in World War II by an increasing concentration on the strategic role of attacking an enemy's homeland, the Air Force now faced a conflict almost entirely tactical in character and limited as to how and where airpower could be applied. 100px The Far East Air Forces Fifth Air Force was the command and control organization for USAF forces engaged in combat. Its units were located in Korea and Japan. Fighter and troop carrier wings from Tactical Air Command and federalized Air National Guard units from the United States deployed to the Far East and reinforced FEAF units engaged in combat. These tactical units conducted interdiction strikes on supply lines, attacked dams that irrigated North Korea's rice crops and flew missions in close support of United Nations ground forces. AT-6 Mosquitoes, trainers used as airborne controllers, provided communication links between ground troops and supporting aircraft. Although President Truman wasn't willing to risk extensive use of the U.S. bomber force, which was being used as a deterrent for possible Soviet aggression in Europe, a few groups of Strategic Air Command aging B-29 Superfortress bombers that were not part of the nuclear strike force were released for combat over the skies of Korea. Many of these B-29s were war- weary and brought out of five years of storage. These bombers wreaked havoc on North Korean military installations, government centers and transportation networks. Like the rest of the American military establishment, the Air Force was in no way prepared for battle at the western rim of the Pacific. Yet despite these limitations, the Air Force responded quickly and effectively, proving in many ways the utility of airpower in modern war. With virtually no warning, the Air Force injected itself into the war in the first critical week. It transported troops and equipment from Japan to Korea, evacuated American nationals, provided significant intelligence through aerial reconnaissance, and most importantly helped to slow the North Korean advance so that the United Nations forces could construct a defensive position on the peninsula. Effects Korea marked the end of the line for major use of prop- driven combat aircraft of the active-duty USAF and brought in the jet age in real terms. All F-82 Twin Mustangs had been removed from the theater by 1952 and F-51D Mustang strength had been cut in Korea from 190 to 65. First generation straight-winged F-80C Shooting Star and F-84E/G Thunderjet jet aircraft were shown inadequate against the Soviet MiG-15s. However, the swept- wing F-86 Sabre took control of the skies, bringing an entire new generation of swept-wing aircraft into the USAF arsenal in the 1950s. The exception to the jet revolution was the specialized use of various counterinsurgency aircraft (A-1 Skyraider, A-26A Invader) by the 56th Special Operations Wing which were flown over Laos during the Vietnam War. (The F-51D/H Mustang was used by some ANG units in the Air Defense role, but by 1957 it was out of the inventory). With the end of fighting in Korea, President Eisenhower, who had taken office in January 1953, called for a \\"new look\\" at national defense. The result: a greater reliance on nuclear weapons and air power to deter war. His administration chose to invest in the Air Force, especially Strategic Air Command. The nuclear arms race shifted into high gear. The Air Force retired nearly all of its propeller-driven B-29/B-50s and they were replaced by new Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft. By 1955 the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress would be entering the inventory in substantial numbers, as the prop-driven B-36s were phased out of heavy bombardment units rapidly. Organization During World War II, The Group, each with three or four flying squadrons, was the basic combat element of the Army Air Forces. This organization changed in 1947 when the new United States Air Forces adopted the wing-base plan. Each combat group then active received a controlling parent wing of the same number and nomenclature. The new wing also controlled three additional groups with the same number to operate the airbase, maintain the aircraft and provide medical care at the base. When combat forces began to fight the war in Korea, the USAF units did so in various organizational forms. In some cases, the combat arm of the wing plus a portion of the wing's supporting personnel deployed to the Korean theater, leaving the rest of the wing to operate the home base, to which the group returned after its tour of combat ended. Early in the war, some combat group deployed and operated under other wings, including temporary four-digit wings. In December 1950, those groups' aligned (same number) parent wing moved on paper from their previous bases and replaced the temporary wing in combat. The personnel of the temporary wing's headquarters were reassigned to the headquarters of its replacement. In 1951, the Strategic Air Command began to eliminate its combat group by reducing the group headquarters token strength and attaching the flying squadrons directly to the wing; therefore, wings replaced the medium bombardment groups attached to Far East Air Forces (FEAF) Bomber Command for combat. The groups were either inactivated or reduced in strength to one officer and one enlisted. In most case, the personnel assigned to the group headquarters were simply reassigned to the wing headquarters which had moved on paper to the location of the headquarters. Most other combat organization in-theater continued to operate with both wing and group headquarters or with group headquarters only. In a few cases, individual squadron, such as the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, were directly controlled by an organization higher than either wing or group level. Aircraft of the Korean War =Fighters= Types employed * North American F-51D Mustang F-51Ds, though obsolete as fighters, were better suited to the small airstrips of Korea than were the F-80s and F-82s based in Japan. Japan-based F-51Ds were immediately transferred to Korea and pressed into service in an attempt to halt the rapid North Korean advance. They were called on to carry the brunt of air support missions during these difficult early days of the war, since the jet aircraft of the day did not have enough endurance to permit sufficient loiter time over the target. Although their primary mission was close support, USAF Mustangs did manage to shoot down a few North Korean Yaks when these aircraft made their infrequent appearances. When Mustangs were jumped by Chinese-piloted MiG-15 jet fighters, however, they were faced with an opponent with a far superior performance. When this happened, there was little the Mustangs could do save to try to turn inside the MiGs, hit the deck, and run for home. When the Mustangs were used for ground attack, their performance was less of a concern than their ability to carry a load. A substantial number were fitted with rockets and bombs. The Mustangs were instrumental in halting the North Korean advance, giving United Nations forces enough time to build up sufficient strength to be able to go over onto the offensive. RF-51s were used for reconnaissance. * Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star The Shooting Star was operated extensively in Korea with the F-80C being instrumental in quickly gaining and maintaining air superiority over the Korean battlefield, rapidly clearing the skies of any North Korean aircraft that dared to venture into the air. The first jet versus jet aircraft battle took place on 8 November 1950 in which an F-80 shot down a MiG-15. However, the straight-wing F-80s were inferior in performance to the MiGs and were soon replaced in the air superiority role by the swept-wing F-86 Sabre. When sufficient Sabres were in operation, the Shooting Star was assigned to ground attack missions, primarily for low-level rocket, bomb, and napalm attacks on fixed targets. The Shooting Stars were superseded by later types as the Korean War proceeded. By the time of the armistice agreement of 27 July 1953, the only Shooting Stars still flying combat missions in Korea were RF-80As being used for reconnaissance. * Lockheed F-94B Starfire Because it carried a highly secret airborne radar system, the F-94s were at first not permitted to fly deep into enemy territory. Ironically, the F-94 radar was not very effective on night missions against MiGs. However, mounting losses of B-29 bombers following the Chinese and North Korean development of night interception tactics finally led to the lifting of this restriction in January 1953. * North American F-82F/G Twin Mustang Based in Japan, the F-82s were among the first USAF aircraft to operate over Korea. They were the only fighter aircraft available with the range to cover the entire Korean peninsula from bases in Japan. The first three North Korean airplanes destroyed by US forces were shot down by F-82s on 27 June 1950. However, the F-82 played a secondary role in Korea as compared with its distinguished predecessor, the single-engined F-51. The Twin Mustang saw extensive service in Korea initially for counterair and ground attack work, but their importance as night fighters caused them to be used mostly for defense purposes. 1951 was the last full year of F-82 operations in Korea, as a shortage of spare parts limited their operations along with them being replaced by the jet-powered F-94 Starfire. Twin Mustangs destroyed 20 enemy aircraft, four in the air and 16 on the ground during the conflict. By summer 1952, the last surviving Korean War veteran F-82s were withdrawn from combat. * Republic F-84D/E Thunderjet The F-84 arrived in Korea in December 1950. Initially assigned to B-29 escort duties, however, the straight-winged F-84E was much too slow to match the swept-wing MiG-15, and MiGs were often able to slip through the escort screen and make successful attacks on B-29s. The F-84s soon gained fame in ground attack operations. F-84s were used to attack enemy airfields and even large targets like irrigation dams. The F-84 gained renown for daily attacks with bombs, rockets, and napalm on enemy railroads, bridges, supply depots, and troop concentrations. Perhaps the two most spectacular Thunderjet operations of the Korean War were the attacks on Toksan Dam about north of Pyongyang, and the Chasan Dam, a few miles to the east. The resulting floods extensively damaged rice fields, buildings, bridges, and roads. Most importantly, 2 main rail lines were disabled for several days. While unable to cope with the MiG-15 at high altitude, they were more effective at medium or low altitudes and scored several kills. RF-84s were used for reconnaissance. * North American F-86A/E/F Sabre The F-86 Sabre survived many initial teething problems to become the premier USAF fighter of the Korean War. By the end of hostilities, Saber pilots claimed 792 MiGs shot down, with a loss of only 78 Sabres-a victory ratio of 10-to-1. Later models of the F-86 were more powerful and used both for air-to- air and ground support. The RF-86 was used for reconnaissance.

Many aircraft were retrieved from postwar storage and refurbished. At least 16 B-29s were shot down over North Korea, and as many as 48 were lost in crash landings or written off because of heavy damage after returning to base. When the Korean War ended on 27 July 1953, the B-29s had flown over 21,000 sorties, nearly 167,000 tons of bombs had been dropped, and 34 B-29s had been lost in combat (16 to fighters, four to flak, and fourteen to other causes). B-29 gunners had accounted for 34 Communist fighters (16 of these being MiG-15s) probably destroyed another 17 (all MiG-15s) and damaged 11 (all MiG-15s). Losses were less than 1 per 1000 sorties. The bombers were also used as reconnaissance (RB-29), weather (WB-29), and rescue aircraft (SB-29). * Douglas B-26B/C Invader When the North Korean army invaded the South on 25 June 1950, the USAF was critically short of light bombers. The B-26 Invaders in Japan proved to be invaluable in the night interdiction role, and it fell to the B-26 to fly the first and the last bombing missions of the Korean War. Their first mission was on 28 June 1950 when they attacked railroads supplying enemy forces. Their first attack against North Korea was on 29 June, when they bombed Pyongyang Air Base, the main airfield in Pyongyang. The Invaders flew some 60,000 sorties and were credited with the destruction of 38,500 vehicles, 3,700 railway cars, and 406 locomotives. The B-26 had the honor of flying the last combat sortie of the Korean War, when, 24 minutes before the Armistice Agreement went into effect on 27 July 1953 a B-26 of the 3rd BW dropped the last bombs of the Korean war. The bombers were also used for reconnaissance, as RB-26s. File:B-29s-korea.jpgFormation of B-29s over the daytime skies of North Korea.

During the advance and later the retreat of U.N. forces into and out of North Korea that fall and winter of 1950, the RF-51 performed many deep penetrations for armed reconnaissance far north of the battle zone into what would become known as \\"MiG Alley.\\" They were among the first Mustangs to be hunted by MiG-15s; it was only the fact that the unit pilots were experienced Second World War combat veterans that they were able to avoid losses in those combats. The Air Force began exchanging their RF-51Ds for RF-80As in the fall of 1952. By the end of the Korean War all had been taken out of the inventory. * RF-80A Shooting Star 66 production P-80A fighters were converted by Lockheed into reconnaissance aircraft and given the designation RF-80A-15-LO. The RF-80A proved itself in combat during the Korean War and took part in numerous sorties over North Korea as well as sorties along the border with North Korea and China, near the Yalu River. * RF-86A/F Sabre In 1953, several F-86Fs were fitted a suite of photo-reconnaissance cameras at the Tsuiki REMCO facility in Japan, in a project code-named *Haymaker*. All armament, radars, and gunsights were removed, and a camera suite fitted. In spite of the success of the RF-86 in combat, the USAF opted for the Republic RF-84F Thunderflash as its next-generation tactical reconnaissance aircraft. * Boeing RB/SB-17G Flying Fortress The Boeing B-17 was adapted for photographic mapping by having its bombing equipment deleted and replaced by photographic equipment. Some cameras were installed in the nose and in the aft fuselage as well. The RB-17G was operated in the Korean theater by the 6204th Photo Mapping Flight for three months in 1950 before being replaced. The 3rd Air Rescue Group used the SB-17G which was a B-17 modified to carry a lifeboat under the fuselage for air/sea rescue. SB-17s operating in Korean waters were refitted with cheek, waist, and tail guns for defensive purposes. * RB-29 Superfortress Nearly 120 B-29s were converted to the reconnaissance configuration and redesignated as RB-29s. The RB-29s were assigned to the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, which like other SAC units played a crucial role during the Korean War. * Boeing RB-50A Superfortress In November 1950, MiG-15s jumped a flak-damaged 91st SRS RB-29 near the Yalu river. In the ensuing aerial battle, the RB-29 rear gunner shot down one of the MiGs ‚Äì the first MiG-15 shot down by a B-29 gunner. The RB-29 limped back to Johnson AB, Japan and five crewmen were killed when it crashed during landing. The immediate answer to the vulnerabilities of the RB-29's was the modified RB-50A, being an uprated version of the B-29. The RB-50As operated out of Yokota AB, Japan, and was assigned to USAF's 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron. * North American RB-45C Tornado The Tornado was the first USAF four-jet bomber, and although the B-45 was available for combat in Korea, it was the RB-45 reconnaissance version that was used. First flown in April 1950, the Tornados managed to outrun and outmaneuver MiG's on numerous occasions, however they too eventually became targets. Many of these early missions were escorted by fighter aircraft and an eventual shift was made to night operations. The RB-45 operated out of Yokota AB Japan with the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron along with the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing in Korea. * Convair RB-36D Peacemaker The Peacemaker was used for strategic reconnaissance. In late 1952, six RB-36's were sent to Yokota Air Base, Japan with the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron to fly high altitude reconnaissance over Manchuria. In addition to bomb damage assessment, targeting and aerial photography for Far East Air Forces, the 91st conducted ELINT (Electronic Signals Intelligence) and \\"ferret\\" missions to probe Soviet air defenses in theater and give an indication of just where the holes were in Soviet radar coverage. The 91st SRS conducted the first ferret missions ever conducted by the USAF.

During the Korean War, the C-47s hauled supplies, dropped paratroopers, evacuated the wounded, and pumped out flares to light the way for night bombing attacks. * Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar The C-119 Flying Boxcar (officially called C-119 Packet) was used extensively in the Korean War. Despite logistics problems that kept monthly flying time averages low, the C-119 worked well in Korea, In addition to airlifting supplies, the C-119s performed other tasks. For example, during Operation SNOWBALL in the fall of 1951, the 315th Air Division used the aircraft to drop napalm-filled 55-gallon drums on enemy troops. The C-119's greatest feat during the Korean War, however, was a mission to aid the retreat of United States Marine Corps and Army troops from Chosin in December 1950. Air Force C-119 \\"Flying Boxcars\\" dropped supplies to the US Marines, but on 7 and 8 December the Chinese closed the sack by blowing the bridge across an otherwise impassible -wide gorge south of Koto-ri. Without help, the Marines would be forced to leave behind their heavy equipment and make it out on foot, a trek many of the wounded and frostbitten would not survive. Air Force C-119s again answered the call and dropped eight two-ton spans of a treadway bridge for Marine engineers, who kept the column moving by bridging the gap under intense fire. * Douglas C-54 Skymaster A C-54 was the first USAF aircraft destroyed in the Korean War; one of the transports on the ground at Kimpo Airfield was strafed by North Korean aircraft on 25 June 1950. It was a Military Air Transport Service workhorse throughout the war. * Curtiss C-46 Commando The World War II C-46 saw additional service during the Korean War being designed to carry troops or equipment and filled an airlift role in Korea, supplying everything from aircraft engines, ammunition, medical supplies, rations, and fresh fruit. The outbreak of the Korean War caught the US unprepared and scrambling for resources. C-46s were pulled out of mothballs or even bought back from commercial operators, and put into round-the-clock use with the USAF Combat Cargo Command. The C-46 was also used to spray insecticide over some parts of South Korea and to drop psychological warfare leaflets over North Korea. * Douglas C-124 Globemaster II Performed heavy lift cargo operations to and from Korea. On 27 September 1951, a C-124A began FEAF-hosted service tests labeled Operation PELICAN. In a little over one month, the aircraft flew 26 missions between Japan and Korea, carrying an average load of 34,000 pounds, double the amount carried on the C-54. In one mission in 1951, a C-124 airlifted a record 167 patients from Pusan in South Korea. Unfortunately, because of the weight of the aircraft, it was limited to only four airstrips in Korea. A heavy-duty runway was constructed at Seoul Municipal Airport in October 1952, but logistical difficulties kept the C-124 from fulfilling its airlift potential. C-124s were used by the 374th Troop Carrier Wing and the 801st Medical Air Evacuation Squadron .

Consequently, the Fifth Air Force modified its command structure only to meet immediate needs. When the time came to move tactical air units to Korean airfields, Fifth Air Force did not deploy its permanent wings because they were heavily committed to the air defense of Japan. Instead, it utilized temporary air base squadrons and air base units to support tactical units in Korea. By August, the situation called for larger organizations with greater allotments of personnel and equipment, and Fifth Air Force set up five temporary tactical support wings to support the combat groups. Formed to assist in the projection of force to Korea, these temporary wings provided facilities, administration, services, and operational control for assigned and attached combat units. The task was formidable, for the installations the wings controlled were usually \\"bare base\\" operations with no amenities and only marginally serviceable airfields. Logistically, poor roads and rail lines, limited port facilities, and overextended airlift hampered the wings. Organizationally, they were without regular status, such as authorization for personnel and equipment or for promotions. Even with these handicaps and hardships, the tactical support wings performed valiantly. They worked hard to make combat airfields operable and to provide the support and control combat units needed. They struggled to keep pace with the dynamically changing battle lines, opening new bases and forward operating locations as needed. Their success bought time for the Fifth Air Force to reorganize, and on 1 December 1950, regular wings replaced them. * 6002d Tactical Support Wing Organized effective 1 August 1950, at Taegu #1 AB (K-2), to support the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. Forced to withdraw with its tactical units to Ashiya AB, Japan, on 8 August, it returned to Korea on 5 September and advanced to Pyongyang on 22 November. It retreated to Suwon AB (K-13) on 30 November, where it was replaced on 1 December 1950, by the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing. * 6131st Tactical Support Wing Organized effective 8 August 1950, at Pohang AB (K-3), to support the 8th Fighter-Bomber Group, the wing moved to Suwon AB on 7 October and to Kimpo AB (K-14) on 28 October. On 25 November, it advanced to Pyongyang AB (K-23), where it was replaced by the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing effective 1 December 1950. * 6133d Tactical Support Wing This wing organized 12 August 1950 at Iwakuni AB, Japan, to support the 3d Bombardment Group and was replaced by the 3d Bombardment Wing on 1 December. * 6149th Tactical Support Wing Organized 5 September 1950 at Taegu AB (K-2) to support the 49th Fighter- Bomber Group, this wing was replaced by the 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing effective 1 December. * 6150th Tactical Support Wing Organized 5 September 1950 at Tsuiki AB, Japan, to support the 35th Fighter- Interceptor Group, the wing moved to Pohang AB (K-3) on 5 October and to Yonpo AB (K-27) on 27 November, where it was replaced by the 35th Fighter- Interceptor Wing on 1 December. Source for unit history: Far East Air Force Korean airfields (K-sites) During the Korean War, the large number of locations used for bases and the similarity of some geographical names prompted the Air Force to use alphanumeric identifiers for bases in addition to their proper designations.

The family contains five genera and 18 species. The family is closely related to the puffbirds, another Neotropical family, and the two families are often separated into their own order, Galbuliformes, separate from the Piciformes. They are principally birds of low-altitude woodlands and forests, and particularly of forest edge and canopy. Taxonomy The placement of the combined puffbird and jacamar lineage was in question, with some bone and muscle features suggesting they may be more closely related to the Coraciiformes. However, analysis of nuclear DNA in a 2003 study placed them as sister group to the rest of the Piciformes, also showing that the groups had developed zygodactyl feet before separating. Per Ericson and colleagues, in analysing genomic DNA, confirmed that puffbirds and jacamars were sister groups and their place in Piciformes. Description The jacamars are small to medium-sized perching birds, in length and weighing . They are elegant, glossy birds with long bills and tails. In appearance and behaviour they resemble the Old World bee-eaters, as most aerial insectivores tend to have short, wide bills rather than long, thin ones. The legs are short and weak, and the feet are zygodactylic (two forward-pointing toes, two backward-pointing). Their plumage is often bright and highly iridescent, although it is quite dull in a few species. There are minor differences in plumage based on sex, males often having a white patch on the breast.Tobias, J.; Z√ºchner T. & T.A. de Melo J√∫nior (2002) \\"Family Galbulidae (Jacamars)\\". in del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Sargatal, J. (editors). (2002). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 7: Jacamars to Woodpeckers. Lynx Edicions. Behaviour =Diet and feeding= Jacamars are insectivores, taking a variety of insect prey (many specialize on butterflies and moths) by hawking in the air. Birds sit in favoured perches and sally towards the prey when it is close enough. Only the great jacamar varies from the rest of the family, taking prey by gleaning and occasionally taking small lizards and spiders. =Breeding= The breeding systems of jacamars have not been studied in depth. They are thought to generally be monogamous, although a few species are thought to engage in cooperative breeding sometimes, with several adults sharing duties. The family nests in holes either in the soil or in arboreal termite mounds. Ground-nesting species usually nest in the banks of rivers (or, more recently, roads), although if these are not available they will nest in the soil held by the roots of fallen trees. Bank-nesting jacamars can sometimes be loosely colonial. Clutch sizes are between one and four eggs, and usually more than one. Both parents participate in incubation. Little is known about the incubation times of most species, but it lasts for between 19‚Äì26 days in the rufous-tailed jacamar. Chicks are born with down feathers, unique among the piciformes.

The turbine consists of a number of curved aerofoil blades mounted on a rotating shaft or framework. The curvature of the blades allows the blade to be stressed only in tension at high rotating speeds. There are several closely related wind turbines that use straight blades. This design of the turbine was patented by Georges Jean Marie Darrieus, a French aeronautical engineer; filing for the patent was October 1, 1926. There are major difficulties in protecting the Darrieus turbine from extreme wind conditions and in making it self-starting. Method of operation Fig. 2: A very large Darrieus wind turbine on the Gasp√© peninsula, Quebec, Canada Savonius generator used in Taiwan How the Darrieus wind turbine works In the original versions of the Darrieus design, the aerofoils are arranged so that they are symmetrical and have zero rigging angle, that is, the angle that the aerofoils are set relative to the structure on which they are mounted. This arrangement is equally effective no matter which direction the wind is blowing‚Äîin contrast to the conventional type, which must be rotated to face into the wind. When the Darrieus rotor is spinning, the aerofoils are moving forward through the air in a circular path. Relative to the blade, this oncoming airflow is added vectorially to the wind, so that the resultant airflow creates a varying small positive angle of attack to the blade. This generates a net force pointing obliquely forwards along a certain 'line-of-action'. This force can be projected inwards past the turbine axis at a certain distance, giving a positive torque to the shaft, thus helping it to rotate in the direction it is already travelling in. The aerodynamic principles which rotate the rotor are equivalent to that in autogiros, and normal helicopters in autorotation. As the aerofoil moves around the back of the apparatus, the angle of attack changes to the opposite sign, but the generated force is still obliquely in the direction of rotation, because the wings are symmetrical and the rigging angle is zero. The rotor spins at a rate unrelated to the windspeed, and usually many times faster. The energy arising from the torque and speed may be extracted and converted into useful power by using an electrical generator. The aeronautical terms lift and drag are, strictly speaking, forces across and along the approaching net relative airflow respectively, so they are not useful here. We really want to know the tangential force pulling the blade around, and the radial force acting against the bearings. When the rotor is stationary, no net rotational force arises, even if the wind speed rises quite high‚Äîthe rotor must already be spinning to generate torque. Thus the design is not normally self-starting. Under rare conditions, Darrieus rotors can self-start, so some form of brake is required to hold it when stopped. One problem with the design is that the angle of attack changes as the turbine spins, so each blade generates its maximum torque at two points on its cycle (front and back of the turbine). This leads to a sinusoidal (pulsing) power cycle that complicates design. In particular, almost all Darrieus turbines have resonant modes where, at a particular rotational speed, the pulsing is at a natural frequency of the blades that can cause them to (eventually) break. For this reason, most Darrieus turbines have mechanical brakes or other speed control devices to keep the turbine from spinning at these speeds for any lengthy period of time. Another problem arises because the majority of the mass of the rotating mechanism is at the periphery rather than at the hub, as it is with a propeller. This leads to very high centrifugal stresses on the mechanism, which must be stronger and heavier than otherwise to withstand them. One common approach to minimise this is to curve the wings into an \\"egg-beater\\" shape (this is called a \\"troposkein\\" shape, derived from the Greek for \\"the shape of a spun rope\\") such that they are self-supporting and do not require such heavy supports and mountings. See. Fig. 1. In this configuration, the Darrieus design is theoretically less expensive than a conventional type, as most of the stress is in the blades which torque against the generator located at the bottom of the turbine. The only forces that need to be balanced out vertically are the compression load due to the blades flexing outward (thus attempting to \\"squeeze\\" the tower), and the wind force trying to blow the whole turbine over, half of which is transmitted to the bottom and the other half of which can easily be offset with guy wires. By contrast, a conventional design has all of the force of the wind attempting to push the tower over at the top, where the main bearing is located. Additionally, one cannot easily use guy wires to offset this load, because the propeller spins both above and below the top of the tower. Thus the conventional design requires a strong tower that grows dramatically with the size of the propeller. Modern designs can compensate most tower loads of that variable speed and variable pitch. In overall comparison, while there are some advantages in Darrieus design there are many more disadvantages, especially with bigger machines in the MW class. The Darrieus design uses much more expensive material in blades while most of the blade is too close to the ground to give any real power. Traditional designs assume that the wing tip is at least 40 m from ground at lowest point to maximize energy production and lifetime. So far there is no known material (not even carbon fiber) which can meet cyclic load requirements.  Giromills  Fig 3: A Giromill-type wind turbine MUCE turbines installed atop the Marine Board Building in Hobart, Australia Darrieus's 1927 patent also covered practically any possible arrangement using vertical airfoils. One of the more common types is the H-rotor, S. Brusca, R. Lanzafame, M. Messina. \\"Design of a vertical-axis wind turbine: how the aspect ratio affects the turbine‚Äôs performance\\". 2014\\\\. Mats Wahl. \\"Designing an H-rotor type Wind Turbine for Operation on Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station\\". 2007\\\\. H-rotor picture (page22) also called the Giromill or H-bar design, in which the long \\"egg beater\\" blades of the common Darrieus design are replaced with straight vertical blade sections attached to the central tower with horizontal supports. This design is used by Shanghai based MUCE.  Cycloturbines  Another variation of the Giromill is the Cycloturbine, in which each blade is mounted so that it can rotate around its own vertical axis. This allows the blades to be \\"pitched\\" so that they always have some angle of attack relative to the wind. The main advantage to this design is that the torque generated remains almost constant over a fairly wide angle, so a Cycloturbine with three or four blades has a fairly constant torque. Over this range of angles, the torque itself is near the maximum possible, meaning that the system also generates more power. The Cycloturbine also has the advantage of being able to self-start, by pitching the \\"downwind moving\\" blade flat to the wind to generate drag and start the turbine spinning at a low speed. On the downside, the blade pitching mechanism is complex and generally heavy, and some sort of wind-direction sensor needs to be added in order to pitch the blades properly. Helical blades A helical Darrieus turbine at Hartnell College. The blades of a Darrieus turbine can be canted into a helix, e.g. three blades and a helical twist of 60 degrees. The original designer of the helical turbine is Ulrich Stampa (Germany patent DE2948060A1, 1979). A. Gorlov proposed a similar design in 1995 (Gorlov's water turbines). Since the wind pulls each blade around on both the windward and leeward sides of the turbine, this feature spreads the torque evenly over the entire revolution, thus preventing destructive pulsations. This design is used by the Turby, Urban Green Energy, Enessere, Aerotecture and Quiet Revolution brands of wind turbine. Active lift turbine Fig 5: Active lift turbine - Axial and normal force. Fig 6: Active lift turbine - Crank rod system. The relative speed creates a force on the blade. This force can be decomposed into an axial and normal force (Fig. 5). In the case of a Darrieus turbine, the axial force associated with the radius creates a torque and the normal force creates on the arm a stress alternately for each half turn, a compression stress and an extension stress. With a crank rod system (Fig. 6), the principle of the Active Lift Turbine is to transform this alternative constraint into an additional energy recovery.Lecanu, Pierre normandajc and Breard, Joel and Mouaze, Dominique, Simplified theory of an active lift turbine with controlled displacement, 15 Apr 2016Lecanu, Pierre normandajc and Breard, Joel and Mouaze, Dominique, Operating principle of an active lift turbine with controlled displacement, Jul 2018 References External links *US patent 1,835,018 *Cranfield University press release on novel-configuration vertical-axis wind turbine for offshore generation * Brief introduction to the theory of Darrieus wind turbines Category:Vertical axis wind turbines Category:French inventions Category:20th-century inventions fr:√âolienne#Axe vertical ","title":"Darrieus wind turbine"},{"id":"262625","text":"Chinua Achebe (; born Albert Chin·ª•al·ª•m·ªçg·ª• Achebe, 16 November 1930 ‚Äì 21 March 2013) was a Nigerian novelist, poet, professor, and critic.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 6. His first novel Things Fall Apart (1958), often considered his masterpiece,Franklin, Ruth. \\"After Empire: Chinua Achebe and the Great African Novel\\". The New Yorker, 26 May 2008. Retrieved 7 December 2010. is the most widely read book in modern African literature.Ogbaa, p. xv. Raised by his parents in the Igbo town of Ogidi in southeastern Nigeria, Achebe excelled at school and won a scholarship to study medicine, but changed his studies to English literature at University College (now the University of Ibadan). He became fascinated with world religions and traditional African cultures, and began writing stories as a university student. After graduation, he worked for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) and soon moved to the metropolis of Lagos. He gained worldwide attention for his novel Things Fall Apart in the late 1950s; his later novels include No Longer at Ease (1960), Arrow of God (1964), A Man of the People (1966), and Anthills of the Savannah (1987). Achebe wrote his novels in English and defended the use of English, a \\"language of colonisers\\", in African literature. In 1975, his lecture \\"An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness\\" featured a criticism of Joseph Conrad as \\"a thoroughgoing racist\\"; it was later published in The Massachusetts Review amid some controversy. When the region of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a supporter of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador for the people of the new nation. The civil war that took place over the territory, commonly known as the Nigerian Civil War, ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took its toll, he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U.S. in 1990, after a car crash left him partially disabled. A titled Igbo chief himself, Achebe focuses his novels on the traditions of Igbo society, the effect of Christian influences, and the clash of Western and traditional African values during and after the colonial era. His style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories, proverbs, and oratory. He also published a large number of short stories, children's books, and essay collections. Upon Achebe's return to the United States in 1990, he began an eighteen-year tenure at Bard College as the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature. From 2009 until his death, he served as David and Marianna Fisher University Professor and Professor of Africana Studies at Brown University. Biography =Early life= Achebe was born Albert Chinualumogu Achebe in the Igbo village of Ogidi on 16 November 1930, to Isaiah Okafo Achebe, a teacher and evangelist, and Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam, a leader among church women and vegetable farmer,Chinua Achebe and the Politics of Narration: Envisioning Language, Thomas Jay Lynn, Palgrave Macmillan, 2017, p. 12 daughter of a blacksmith from Awka.Encyclopaedia of Postcolonial Studies, ed. John C. Hawley, Emmanuel S. Nelson, Greenwood Press, 2001, p. 3 Isaiah Achebe was the nephew of Udoh Osinyi, a leader in Ogidi with a \\"reputation for tolerance\\"; orphaned as a young man, Isaiah was an early Ogidi convert to Christianity.Chinua Achebe and the Politics of Narration: Envisioning Language, Thomas Jay Lynn, Palgrave Macmillan, 2017, p. 12 Achebe's parents stood at a crossroads of traditional culture and Christian influence; this made a significant impact on the children, especially Chinualumogu. Achebe's parents were converts to the Protestant Church Mission Society (CMS) in Nigeria.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 3. Isaiah Achebe stopped practicing the religion of his ancestors, but he respected its traditions. Achebe's unabbreviated name, Chinualumogu (\\"May God fight on my behalf\\"),Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 7. was a prayer for divine protection and stability.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 7. The Achebe family had five other surviving children, named in a similar fusion of traditional words relating to their new religion: Frank Okwuofu, John Chukwuemeka Ifeanyichukwu, Zinobia Uzoma, Augustine Ndubisi, and Grace Nwanneka. After the youngest daughter was born, the family moved to Isaiah Achebe's ancestral town of Ogidi, in what is now the state of Anambra. linguistic groups. Achebe's homeland, the Igbo region (archaically spelt Ibo), lies in the central south. Storytelling was a mainstay of the Igbo tradition and an integral part of the community. Achebe's mother and sister Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books ‚Äì including a prose adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of The Pilgrim's Progress (1678).Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 8.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 16. Chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the frequent masquerade ceremonies, which he recreated later in his novels and stories.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 10‚Äì11. Education In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School, in the Akpakaogwe region of Ogidi.Chinua Achebe, Teacher of Light: A Biography, Tijan M. Sallah, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Africa World Press, 2003, p. 31Chinua Achebe and the Politics of Narration: Envisioning Language, Thomas Jay Lynn, Palgrave Macmillan, 2017, p. 12 Despite his protests, he spent a week in the religious class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence.Ezenwa- Ohaeto, p. 11. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 14. He also attended Sunday school every week and the special services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart (1958).Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 12.Achebe 1994, pp. 146‚Äì147. University Street in Ibadan, 2007 In 1948, in preparation for independence, Nigeria's first university opened.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 34‚Äì36. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine. It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After reading Joyce Cary's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons that he decided to become a writer. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist as a sign of the author's cultural ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is shot.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 44. He abandoned the study of medicine and changed to English, history, and theology.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 37. Because he switched his field, however, he lost his scholarship and had to pay tuition fees. He received a government bursary, and his family also donated money ‚Äì his older brother Augustine gave up money for a trip home from his job as a civil servant so Chinua could continue his studies.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 38. From its inception, the university had a strong Arts faculty; it includes many famous writers amongst its alumni. These include Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, poet and playwright John Pepper Clark, and poet Christopher Okigbo.July, p. 64; Laurence, p. viii. Elechi Amadi is also another famous writer who studied at the university in the 1950s, although he was in the faculty of sciences. In 1950 Achebe wrote a piece for the University Herald entitled \\"Polar Undergraduate\\", his debut as an author. It used irony and humour to celebrate the intellectual vigour of his classmates.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 39. He followed this with other essays and letters about philosophy and freedom in academia, some of which were published in another campus magazine, The Bug.Ezenwa- Ohaeto, p. 40. He served as the Herald's editor during the 1951‚Äì52 school year.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 46. While at the university, Achebe wrote his first short story, \\"In a Village Church\\", which combines details of life in rural Nigeria with Christian institutions and icons, a style which appears in many of his later works.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 42. Other short stories he wrote during his time at Ibadan (including \\"The Old Order in Conflict with the New\\" and \\"Dead Men's Path\\") examine conflicts between tradition and modernity, with an eye toward dialogue and understanding on both sides.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 49. When a professor named Geoffrey Parrinder arrived at the university to teach comparative religion, Achebe began to explore the fields of Christian history and African traditional religions.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 43. After the final examinations at Ibadan in 1953, Achebe was awarded a second-class degree.Chinua Achebe: A Biography, Ezenwa-Ohaeto, James Currey Ltd (Oxford), Indiana University Press (Bloomington & Indianapolis), 1997, p. 50 Rattled by not receiving the highest level, he was uncertain how to proceed after graduation. He returned to his hometown of Ogidi to sort through his options.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 50‚Äì52. =Teaching and producing= While he meditated on his possible career paths, Achebe was visited by a friend from the university, who convinced him to apply for an English teaching position at the Merchants of Light school at Oba. It was a ramshackle institution with a crumbling infrastructure and a meagre library; the school was built on what the residents called \\"bad bush\\" ‚Äì a section of land thought to be tainted by unfriendly spirits.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 53. Later, in Things Fall Apart, Achebe describes a similar area called the \\"evil forest\\", where the Christian missionaries are given a place to build their church.Achebe (1994). The \\"evil forest\\" is a place where twins (considered an abomination by the community) are thrown away to die. When the Christian missionaries persevere despite their location, they are able to convince some in the community that the superstition is unwarranted. As a teacher he urged his students to read extensively and be original in their work.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 55. The students did not have access to the newspapers he had read as a student, so Achebe made his own available in the classroom. He taught in Oba for four months, but when an opportunity arose in 1954 to work for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS), he left the school and moved to Lagos.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 56.

This helped him master the subtle nuances between written and spoken language, a skill that helped him later to write realistic dialogue.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 57. The city of Lagos also made a significant impression on him. A huge conurbation, the city teemed with recent migrants from the rural villages. Achebe revelled in the social and political activity around him and later drew upon his experiences when describing the city in his 1960 novel No Longer at Ease.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 58. While in Lagos, Achebe started work on a novel. This was challenging, since very little African fiction had been written in English, although Amos Tutuola's Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) and Cyprian Ekwensi's People of the City (1954) were notable exceptions. While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe worked hard to develop his own style, even as he pioneered the creation of the Nigerian novel itself.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 62. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 60. Also in 1956 he was selected at the Staff School run by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). His first trip outside Nigeria was an opportunity to advance his technical production skills, and to solicit feedback on his novel (which was later split into two books). In London, he met a novelist named Gilbert Phelps, to whom he offered the manuscript. Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe if he could show it to his editor and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed more work. =Things Fall Apart= Back in Nigeria, Achebe set to work revising and editing his novel (now titled Things Fall Apart, after a line in the poem \\"The Second Coming\\" by W. B. Yeats). He cut away the second and third sections of the book, leaving only the story of a yam farmer named Okonkwo who lives during the colonization of Nigeria. He added sections, improved various chapters, and restructured the prose. By 1957, he had sculpted it to his liking, and took advantage of an advertisement offering a typing service. He sent his only copy of his handwritten manuscript (along with the ¬£22 fee) to the London company. After he waited several months without receiving any communication from the typing service, Achebe began to worry. His boss at the NBS, Angela Beattie, was going to London for her annual leave; he asked her to visit the company. She did, and angrily demanded to know why the manuscript was lying ignored in the corner of the office. The company quickly sent a typed copy to Achebe. Beattie's intervention was crucial for his ability to continue as a writer. Had the novel been lost, he later said, \\"I would have been so discouraged that I would probably have given up altogether.\\"Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 63. A spiral stack of the 1994 Anchor Books edition of Things Fall Apart In 1958, Achebe sent his novel to the agent recommended by Gilbert Phelps in London. It was sent to several publishing houses; some rejected it immediately, claiming that fiction from African writers had no market potential.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 65. Finally it reached the office of Heinemann, where executives hesitated until an educational adviser, Donald MacRae, just back in England after a trip through West Africa, read the book and forced the company's hand with his succinct report: \\"This is the best novel I have read since the war\\".Hill, Alan (1991). Quoted in Petersen, reprinted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 65. Heinemann published 2,000 hardcover copies of Things Fall Apart on 17 June 1958. According to Alan Hill, employed by the publisher at the time, the company did not \\"touch a word of it\\" in preparation for release.Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 65. The book was received well by the British press, and received positive reviews from critic Walter Allen and novelist Angus Wilson. Three days after publication, The Times Literary Supplement wrote that the book \\"genuinely succeeds in presenting tribal life from the inside\\". The Observer called it \\"an excellent novel\\", and the literary magazine Time and Tide said that \\"Mr. Achebe's style is a model for aspirants\\".Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 65‚Äì66. Initial reception in Nigeria was mixed. When Hill tried to promote the book in West Africa, he was met with scepticism and ridicule. The faculty at the University of Ibadan was amused at the thought of a worthwhile novel being written by an alumnus.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 68. Others were more supportive; one review in the magazine Black Orpheus said: \\"The book as a whole creates for the reader such a vivid picture of Igbo life that the plot and characters are little more than symbols representing a way of life lost irrevocably within living memory.\\"Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 69. In the book, Okonkwo, the protagonist, struggles with the legacy of his father ‚Äì a shiftless debtor fond of playing the flute ‚Äì as well as the complications and contradictions that arise when white missionaries arrive in his village of Umuofia.Achebe 1994, p. 4. Exploring the terrain of cultural conflict, particularly the encounter between Igbo tradition and Christian doctrine, Achebe returns to the themes of his earlier stories, which grew from his own background. Things Fall Apart went on to become one of the most important books in African literature.Booker, p. xvii. Selling over 20 million copies around the world, it was translated into 57 languages, making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time. The book, in recognition of its universality, appears in the Bokklubben World Library collection \\"proposed by one hundred writers from fifty-four different countries, compiled and organized in 2002 by the Norwegian Book Club. This list endeavors to reflect world literature, with books from all countries, cultures, and time periods.\\" The book is also included in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica's list of \\"12 Novels Considered the 'Greatest Book Ever Written'\\". Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has described the work as \\"the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character, rather than portraying the African as an exotic, as the white man would see him.\\" =Marriage and family= In the same year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was promoted at the NBS and put in charge of the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 67‚Äì68. Achebe and Okoli grew closer in the following years, and on 10 September 1961 they were married in the Chapel of Resurrection on the campus of the University of Ibadan.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 85. Christie Achebe has described their marriage as one of trust and mutual understanding; some tension arose early in their union, due to conflicts about attention and communication. However, as their relationship matured, husband and wife made efforts to adapt to one another.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 86. Their first child, a daughter named Chinelo, was born on 11 July 1962. They had a son, Ikechukwu, on 3 December 1964, and another boy named Chidi, on 24 May 1967. When the children began attending school in Lagos, their parents became worried about the world view ‚Äì especially with regard to race ‚Äì expressed at the school, especially through the mostly white teachers and books that presented a prejudiced view of African life.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 105. In 1966, Achebe published his first children's book, Chike and the River, to address some of these concerns.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 112. After the Biafran War, the Achebes had another daughter on 7 March 1970, named Nwando. When asked about his family Achebe stated: \\"There are few things more important than my family.\\"Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 155. =No Longer at Ease and fellowship travels= In 1960, while they were still dating, Achebe dedicated to Christie Okoli his second novel, No Longer at Ease, about a civil servant who is embroiled in the corruption of Lagos. The protagonist is Obi, grandson of Things Fall Apart's main character, Okonkwo.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 77. Drawing on his time in the city, Achebe writes about Obi's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation on the threshold of Nigerian independence. Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family, its clan, his home village, and larger society. He is crushed by these forces (like his grandfather before him) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture, Achebe demonstrated in his second novel an ability to depict modern Nigerian life.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 78. A map of the distribution of people using the Swahili language Later that year, Achebe was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship for six months of travel, which he called \\"the first important perk of my writing career\\";Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 79. Achebe set out for a tour of East Africa. One month after Nigeria achieved its independence, he travelled to Kenya, where he was required to complete an immigration form by checking a box indicating his ethnicity: European, Asiatic, Arab, or Other. Shocked and dismayed at being forced into an \\"Other\\" identity, he found the situation \\"almost funny\\" and took an extra form as a souvenir.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 79. Continuing to Tanganyika and Zanzibar (now united in Tanzania), he was frustrated by the paternalistic attitude he observed among non-African hotel clerks and social elites.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 80. Achebe also found in his travels that Swahili was gaining prominence as a major African language. Radio programs were broadcast in Swahili, and its use was widespread in the countries he visited. Nevertheless, he also found an \\"apathy\\" among the people toward literature written in Swahili.Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 81. He met the poet Sheikh Shaaban Robert, who complained of the difficulty he had faced in trying to publish his Swahili-language work.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 81. In Northern Rhodesia (now called Zambia), Achebe found himself sitting in a whites-only section of a bus to Victoria Falls. Interrogated by the ticket taker as to why he was sitting in the front, he replied, \\"if you must know I come from Nigeria, and there we sit where we like in the bus.\\"Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 83. Upon reaching the waterfall, he was cheered by the black travellers from the bus, but he was saddened by their being unable to resist the policy of segregation at the time.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 83. Two years later, Achebe again left Nigeria, this time as part of a Fellowship for Creative Artists awarded by UNESCO. He travelled to the United States and Brazil. He met with a number of writers from the US, including novelists Ralph Ellison and Arthur Miller.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 97. In Brazil, he met with several other authors, with whom he discussed the complications of writing in Portuguese. Achebe worried that the vibrant literature of the nation would be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 98. =Voice of Nigeria and African Writers Series= Once he returned to Nigeria, Achebe was promoted at the NBS to the position of Director of External Broadcasting. One of his first duties was to help create the Voice of Nigeria network. The station broadcast its first transmission on New Year's Day 1962, and worked to maintain an objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 87‚Äì88. This objectivity was put to the test when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa declared a state of emergency in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties. Achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 89. In 1962 he attended an executive conference of African writers in English at the Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda. He met with important literary figures from around the continent and the world, including Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor, Nigerian playwright and poet Wole Soyinka, and US poet-author Langston Hughes. Among the topics of discussion was an attempt to determine whether the term African literature ought to include work from the diaspora, or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself. Achebe indicated that it was not \\"a very significant question\\",Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 89. and that scholars would do well to wait until a body of work were large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 89‚Äì90. Achebe selected the novel Weep Not, Child by Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o as one of the first titles of Heinemann's African Writers Series. While at Makerere, Achebe was asked to read a novel written by a student (James Ngugi, later known as Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o) called Weep Not, Child. Impressed, he sent it to Alan Hill at Heinemann, which published it two years later to coincide with its paperback line of books from African writers. Hill indicated this was to remedy a situation where British publishers \\"regarded West Africa only as a place where you sold books.\\" Achebe was chosen to be General Editor of the African Writers Series, which became a significant force in bringing postcolonial literature from Africa to the rest of the world,Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 90‚Äì92. and he continued in that role until 1972.Bello-Kano, Ibrahim (3 April 2013), \\"Chinua Achebe: A non-romantic view\\" , Pambazuka News, Issue 624. As these works became more widely available, reviews and essays about African literature ‚Äì especially from Europe ‚Äì began to flourish. Bristling against the commentary flooding his home country, Achebe published an essay entitled \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\" in the December 1962 issue of Nigeria Magazine. In it, he distinguished between the hostile critic (entirely negative), the amazed critic (entirely positive), and the conscious critic (who seeks a balance). He lashed out at those who critiqued African writers from the outside, saying: \\"no man can understand another whose language he does not speak (and 'language' here does not mean simply words, but a man's entire world view).\\"Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 94. In September 1964 he attended the Commonwealth Literature conference at the University of Leeds, presenting his essay \\"The Novelist as Teacher\\".Brendon Nicholls, \\"Chinua Achebe at Leeds: When the Great Share the Good\\", Leeds African Studies Bulletin 73 (2011). =Arrow of God= Achebe's third book, Arrow of God, was published in 1964. Like its predecessors, it explores the intersections of Igbo tradition and European Christianity. Set in the village of Umuaro at the start of the twentieth century, the novel tells the story of Ezeulu, a Chief Priest of Ulu. Shocked by the power of British intervention in the area, he orders his son to learn the foreigners' secret. Ezeulu is consumed by the resulting tragedy.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 98‚Äì99. The idea for the novel came in 1959, when Achebe heard the story of a Chief Priest being imprisoned by a District Officer.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 70. He drew further inspiration a year later when he viewed a collection of Igbo objects excavated from the area by archaeologist Thurstan Shaw; Achebe was startled by the cultural sophistication of the artifacts. When an acquaintance showed him a series of papers from colonial officers (not unlike the fictional Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger referenced at the end of Things Fall Apart), Achebe combined these strands of history and began work on Arrow of God in earnest.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 75. Like Achebe's previous works, Arrow was roundly praised by critics.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 99. A revised edition was published in 1974 to correct what Achebe called \\"certain structural weaknesses\\".Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 187. In a letter written to Achebe, the US writer John Updike expressed his surprised admiration for the sudden downfall of Arrow of Gods protagonist. He praised the author's courage to write \\"an ending few Western novelists would have contrived\\".Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 105. Achebe responded by suggesting that the individualistic hero was rare in African literature, given its roots in communal living and the degree to which characters are \\"subject to non-human forces in the universe\\".Quoted in Ezenwa- Ohaeto, p. 106. =A Man of the People= A Man of the People was published in 1966. A bleak satire set in an unnamed African state which has just attained independence, the novel follows a teacher named Odili Samalu from the village of Anata who opposes a corrupt Minister of Culture named Nanga for his Parliament seat. Upon reading an advance copy of the novel, Achebe's friend John Pepper Clark declared: \\"Chinua, I know you are a prophet. Everything in this book has happened except a military coup!\\"Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 109. Soon afterward, Nigerian Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu seized control of the northern region of the country as part of a larger coup attempt. Commanders in other areas failed, and the plot was answered by a military crackdown. A massacre of three thousand people from the eastern region living in the north occurred soon afterwards, and stories of other attacks on Igbo Nigerians began to filter into Lagos.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 115. The ending of his novel had brought Achebe to the attention of military personnel, who suspected him of having foreknowledge of the coup. When he received word of the pursuit, he sent his wife (who was pregnant) and children on a squalid boat through a series of unseen creeks to the Eastern stronghold of Port Harcourt. They arrived safely, but Christie suffered a miscarriage at the journey's end. Chinua rejoined them soon afterwards in Ogidi. These cities were safe from military incursion because they were in the southeast, part of the region which would later secede.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 117. Once the family had resettled in Enugu, Achebe and his friend Christopher Okigbo started a publishing house called Citadel Press, to improve the quality and increase the quantity of literature available to younger readers. One of its first submissions was a story called How the Dog was Domesticated, which Achebe revised and rewrote, turning it into a complex allegory for the country's political tumult. Its final title was How the Leopard Got His Claws.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 125. Years later a Nigerian intelligence officer told Achebe, \\"of all the things that came out of Biafra, that book was most important.\\"Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 154. Map of the Biafra secession =Nigeria-Biafra War= In May 1967, the southeastern region of Nigeria broke away to form the Republic of Biafra; in July the Nigerian military attacked to suppress what it considered an unlawful rebellion. Achebe's colleague, Christopher Okigbo, who had become a close friend of the family (especially of Achebe's son, young Ikechukwu), volunteered to join the secessionist army while simultaneously working at the press. Achebe's house was bombed one afternoon; Christie had taken the children to visit her sick mother, so the only victims were his books and papers. The Achebe family narrowly escaped disaster several times during the war. Five days later, Christopher Okigbo was killed on the war's front line.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 124‚Äì129. Achebe was shaken considerably by the loss; in 1971 he wrote \\"Dirge for Okigbo\\", originally in the Igbo language but later translated to English.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 129. As the war intensified, the Achebe family was forced to leave Enugu for the Biafran capital of Aba. As the turmoil closed in, he continued to write, but most of his creative work during the war took the form of poetry. The shorter format was a consequence of living in a war zone. \\"I can write poetry,\\" he said, \\"something short, intense more in keeping with my mood ... All this is creating in the context of our struggle.\\"Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 149. Many of these poems were collected in his 1971 book Beware, Soul Brother. One of his most famous, \\"Refugee Mother and Child\\", spoke to the suffering and loss that surrounded him. Dedicated to the promise of Biafra, he accepted a request to serve as foreign ambassador, refusing an invitation from the Program of African Studies at Northwestern University in the US. Achebe traveled to many cities in Europe, including London, where he continued his work with the African Writers Series project at Heinemann.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 129‚Äì133. During the war, relations between writers in Nigeria and Biafra were strained. Achebe and John Pepper Clark had a tense confrontation in London over their respective support for opposing sides of the conflict. Achebe demanded that the publisher withdraw the dedication of A Man of the People he had given to Clark. Years later, their friendship healed and the dedication was restored.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 134. Meanwhile, their contemporary Wole Soyinka was imprisoned for meeting with Biafran officials, and spent two years in jail. Speaking in 1968, Achebe said: \\"I find the Nigerian situation untenable. If I had been a Nigerian, I think I would have been in the same situation as Wole Soyinka is ‚Äì in prison.\\"Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 137. The Nigerian government, under the leadership of General Yakubu Gowon, was backed by the British government; the two nations enjoyed a vigorous trade partnership.Yousaf, p. 88. Addressing the causes of the war in 1968, Achebe lashed out at the Nigerian political and military forces that had forced Biafra to secede. He framed the conflict in terms of the country's colonial past. The writer in Nigeria, he said, \\"found that the independence his country was supposed to have won was totally without content ... The old white master was still in power. He had got himself a bunch of black stooges to do his dirty work for a commission.\\" Flag of the Republic of Biafra Conditions in Biafra worsened as the war continued. In September 1968, the city of Aba fell to the Nigerian military and Achebe once again moved his family, this time to Umuahia, where the Biafran government had also relocated. He was chosen to chair the newly formed National Guidance Committee, charged with the task of drafting principles and ideas for the post-war era.Ezenwa- Ohaeto, pp. 138‚Äì140. In 1969, the group completed a document entitled The Principles of the Biafran Revolution, later released as The Ahiara Declaration.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 146. In October of the same year, Achebe joined writers Cyprian Ekwensi and Gabriel Okara for a tour of the United States to raise awareness about the dire situation in Biafra. They visited thirty college campuses and conducted countless interviews. While in the southern US, Achebe learned for the first time of the Igbo Landing, a true story of a group of Igbo captives who drowned themselves in 1803 ‚Äì rather than endure the brutality of slavery ‚Äì after surviving through the Middle Passage.Ezenwa- Ohaeto, p. 150.Powell, Timothy B. (2004). \\"Ebos Landing\\". The New Georgia Encyclopedia. Although the group was well received by students and faculty, Achebe was \\"shocked\\" by the harsh racist attitude toward Africa he saw in the US. At the end of the tour, he said that \\"world policy is absolutely ruthless and unfeeling\\".Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 150. The beginning of 1970 saw the end of the state of Biafra. On 12 January, the military surrendered to Nigeria, and Achebe returned with his family to Ogidi, where their home had been destroyed. He took a job at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka and immersed himself once again in academia. He was unable to accept invitations to other countries, however, because the Nigerian government revoked his passport due to his support for Biafra.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 158‚Äì160. =Postwar academia= After the war, Achebe helped start two magazines: the literary journal Okike, a forum for African art, fiction, and poetry; and Nsukkascope, an internal publication of the University (motto: \\"Devastating, Fearless, Brutal and True\\").Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 162. Achebe and the Okike committee later established another cultural magazine, Uwa Ndi Igbo, to showcase the indigenous stories and oral traditions of the Igbo community.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 225. In February 1972 he released Girls at War, a collection of short stories ranging in time from his undergraduate days to the recent bloodshed. It was the 100th book in Heinemann's African Writers Series.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 166. The University of Massachusetts Amherst at night The University of Massachusetts Amherst offered Achebe a professorship later that year, and the family moved to the United States. Their youngest daughter was displeased with her nursery school, and the family soon learned that her frustration involved language. Achebe helped her face the \\"alien experience\\" (as he called it) by telling her stories during the car trips to and from school.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 174. As he presented his lessons to a wide variety of students (he taught only one class, to a large audience), he began to study the perceptions of Africa in Western scholarship: \\"Africa is not like anywhere else they know ... there are no real people in the Dark Continent, only forces operating; and people don't speak any language you can understand, they just grunt, too busy jumping up and down in a frenzy\\".Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 174. Criticism of Conrad Achebe expanded this criticism when he presented a Chancellor's Lecture at Amherst on 18 February 1975, 'An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\"'. Decrying Joseph Conrad as \\"a bloody racist\\",Achebe (1989), p. 8. Achebe asserted that Conrad's famous novel dehumanises Africans, rendering Africa as \\"a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril.\\"Achebe (1989), pp. 1‚Äì20. Achebe also discussed a quotation from Albert Schweitzer, a 1952 Nobel Peace Prize laureate: \\"That extraordinary missionary, Albert Schweitzer, who sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in Europe for a life of service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about, epitomizes the ambivalence. In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being.\\"Achebe (1989), p. 7. Some were surprised that Achebe would challenge a man honoured in the West for his \\"reverence for life\\". Schweitzer, Albert (1936). \\"Reverence for Life\\" . Online at Association Internationale Albert Schweitzer . The lecture caused a storm of controversy, even at the reception immediately following his talk. Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: \\"How dare you!\\",Quoted in Ezenwa- Ohaeto, p. 191. and stormed away. Another suggested that Achebe had \\"no sense of humour\\", but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: \\"I now realize that I had never really read Heart of Darkness although I have taught it for years.\\"Achebe (1989), p. x. Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 191‚Äì192. The first comprehensive rebuttal of Achebe's critique was published in 1983 by British critic Cedric Watts. His essay \\"A Bloody Racist: About Achebe's View of Conrad\\" defends Heart of Darkness as an anti-imperialist novel, suggesting that \\"part of its greatness lies in the power of its criticisms of racial prejudice.\\"Watts, Cedric (1983). \\"A Bloody Racist: About Achebe's View of Conrad\\". The Yearbook of English Studies Vol. 13, pp. 196‚Äì209. Palestinian‚ÄìAmerican theorist Edward Said agreed in his book Culture and Imperialism that Conrad criticised imperialism, but added: \\"As a creature of his time, Conrad could not grant the natives their freedom, despite his severe critique of the imperialism that enslaved them\\".Quoted in Atkinson, William (1 January 2004), \\"Bound in Blackwood's: The Imperialism of 'The Heart of Darkness' in Its Immediate Context\\". Twentieth Century Literature Vol. 50, No. 4, p. 368. Building on Watts and Said, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that \\"underneath the first layer of straightforward opposition ... we find an underlying mimetic continuity between Conrad's colonial image of Africa [in Heart of Darkness] and Achebe's postcolonial representation\\" in Things Fall Apart.Lawtoo, Nidesh (2013). \\"A Picture of Africa: Frenzy, Counternarrative, Mimesis.\\" Modern Fictions Studies 59.1, pp. 26‚Äì52. Achebe's criticism has become a mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay was included in the 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of \\"the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book ...\\"Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 259. Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism \\"into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe.\\"Tredell, p. 71. Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: \\"It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it ‚Äì with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works.\\" Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled \\"'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate\\": \\"Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And if it were not for what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction.\\"Siegel, Robert (15 October 2009), \\"Chinua Achebe: 'Heart Of Darkness' Is Inappropriate\\", NPR. Retrieved 19 July 2010. =Retirement and politics= When he returned to the University of Nigeria in 1976, he hoped to accomplish three goals: finish the novel he had been writing, renew the native publication of Okike, and further his study of Igbo culture. He also showed that he would not restrict his criticism to European targets. In an August 1976 interview, he lashed out at the archetypal Nigerian intellectual, who is divorced from the intellect \\"but for two things: status and stomach. And if there's any danger that he might suffer official displeasure or lose his job, he would prefer to turn a blind eye to what is happening around him.\\"Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 197. In October 1979, Achebe was awarded the first-ever Nigerian National Merit Award.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 211. In 1980 he met James Baldwin at a conference held by the African Literature Association in Gainesville, Florida, USA. The writers ‚Äì with similar political perspectives, beliefs about language, and faith in the liberating potential of literature ‚Äì were eager to meet one another. Baldwin said: \\"It's very important that we should meet each other, finally, if I must say so, after something like 400 years.\\"Quoted in Ezenwa- Ohaeto, p. 214. In 1982, Achebe retired from the University of Nigeria. He devoted more time to editing Okike and became active with the left-leaning People's Redemption Party (PRP). In 1983, he became the party's deputy national vice-president. He published a book called The Trouble with Nigeria to coincide with the upcoming elections. On the first page, Achebe says bluntly: \\"the Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility and to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership.\\"Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 228. The elections that followed were marked by violence and charges of fraud. Asked whether he thought Nigerian politics had changed since A Man of the People, Achebe replied: \\"I think, if anything, the Nigerian politician has deteriorated.\\"Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 229. After the elections, he engaged in a heated argument ‚Äì which almost became a fistfight ‚Äì with Bakin Zuwo, the newly elected governor of Kano State. He left the PRP and afterwards kept his distance from political parties, expressing his sadness at the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 231‚Äì232. He spent most of the 1980s delivering speeches, attending conferences, and working on his sixth novel. He also continued winning awards and collecting honorary degrees.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 235‚Äì249. In 1986 he was elected president-general of the Ogidi Town Union; he reluctantly accepted and began a three-year term. In the same year, he stepped down as editor of Okike.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 251. =Anthills and paralysis= In 1987 Achebe released his fifth novel, Anthills of the Savannah, about a military coup in the fictional West African nation of Kangan. A finalist for the Booker Prize, the novel was hailed in the Financial Times: \\"in a powerful fusion of myth, legend and modern styles, Achebe has written a book which is wise, exciting and essential, a powerful antidote to the cynical commentators from 'overseas' who see nothing ever new out of Africa.\\"Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 253. An opinion piece in the magazine West Africa said the book deserved to win the Booker Prize, and that Achebe was \\"a writer who has long deserved the recognition that has already been accorded him by his sales figures.\\" The prize went instead to Penelope Lively's novel Moon Tiger. Stone Row at the centre of the Bard College campus On 22 March 1990, Achebe was riding in a car to Lagos when an axle collapsed and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but the weight of the vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair for the rest of his life.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 278‚Äì279. Soon afterwards, Achebe became the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York; he held the position for more than fifteen years.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 280. In 1999, Achebe was awarded the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. In the autumn of 2009 he joined the Brown University faculty as the David and Marianna Fisher University Professor of Africana Studies. =Later in his life as a publisher= In October 2005, the London Financial Times reported that Achebe was planning to write a novella for the Canongate Myth Series, a series of short novels in which ancient myths from myriad cultures are reimagined and rewritten by contemporary authors.Gurria- Quintana, Angel (28 October 2005). \\"Myth understood\\", Financial Times. Retrieved 7 November 2007. In June 2007, Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize.\\"Nigeria author wins Booker honour\\" (13 June 2007). BBC News. Retrieved 23 September 2007. The judging panel included US critic Elaine Showalter, who said he \\"illuminated the path for writers around the world seeking new words and forms for new realities and societies\\"; The Booker Prize Foundation (13 June 2007). \\"The father of modern African writing, wins 2007 Man Booker International Prize\\" . Retrieved 11 October 2007. and South African writer Nadine Gordimer, who said Achebe has achieved \\"what one of his characters brilliantly defines as the writer's purpose: 'a new-found utterance' for the capture of life's complexity\\". In 2010, Achebe was awarded The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize for $300,000, one of the richest prizes for the arts. In October 2012, Achebe's publishers, Penguin Books, released There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra. Publication immediately caused a stir and re-opened the discussion about the Nigerian Civil War. It would prove to be the last publication during his lifetime. Fondly called the \\"father of African literature\\",Frederick, Ben (22 March 2013), \\"Chinua Achebe is remembered as the 'father of modern African literature'\\", The Christian Science Monitor. Achebe died after a short illness on 21 March 2013 in Boston, United States. An unidentified source close to the family said that he was ill for a while and had been hospitalised in the city. Penguin publishing director said: \\"...we are all desolate to hear of his death.\\" The New York Times described him in his obituary as \\"one of Africa's most widely read novelists and one of the continent's towering men of letters\\". The BBC wrote that he was \\"revered throughout the world for his depiction of life in Africa\\". He was laid to rest in his hometown in Ogidi, Anambra State. Style =Oral tradition= The style of Achebe's fiction draws heavily on the oral tradition of the Igbo people.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 66. He weaves folk tales into the fabric of his stories, illuminating community values in both the content and the form of the storytelling. The tale about the Earth and Sky in Things Fall Apart, for example, emphasises the interdependency of the masculine and the feminine. Although Nwoye enjoys hearing his mother tell the tale, Okonkwo's dislike for it is evidence of his imbalance.Gera, pp. 24‚Äì25. Later, Nwoye avoids beatings from his father by pretending to dislike such \\"women's stories\\".Achebe (1994), p. 54. Another hallmark of Achebe's style is the use of proverbs, which often illustrate the values of the rural Igbo tradition. He sprinkles them throughout the narratives, repeating points made in conversation. Critic Anjali Gera notes that the use of proverbs in Arrow of God \\"serves to create through an echo effect the judgement of a community upon an individual violation.\\"Gera, p. 32. The use of such repetition in Achebe's urban novels, No Longer at Ease and A Man of the People, is less pronounced. For Achebe, however, proverbs and folk stories are not the sum total of the oral Igbo tradition. In combining philosophical thought and public performance into the use of oratory (\\"Okwu Oka\\" ‚Äì \\"speech artistry\\" ‚Äì in the Igbo phrase), his characters exhibit what he called \\"a matter of individual excellence ... part of Igbo culture.\\"Quoted in Egejuru, p. 394. In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo's friend Obierika voices the most impassioned oratory, crystallising the events and their significance for the village. Nwaka in Arrow of God also exhibits a mastery of oratory, albeit for malicious ends.Egejuru, pp. 395‚Äì396. Achebe frequently includes folk songs and descriptions of dancing in his work. Obi, the protagonist of No Longer at Ease, is at one point met by women singing a \\"Song of the Heart\\", which Achebe gives in both Igbo and English: \\"Is everyone here? / (Hele ee he ee he)\\"Quoted in Gera, p. 25. In Things Fall Apart, ceremonial dancing and the singing of folk songs reflect the realities of Igbo tradition. The elderly Uchendu, attempting to shake Okonkwo out of his self- pity, refers to a song sung after the death of a woman: \\"For whom is it well, for whom is it well? There is no one for whom it is well.\\"Achebe (1994), p. 135. This song contrasts with the \\"gay and rollicking tunes of evangelism\\" sung later by the white missionaries.Achebe (1994), p. 146. Achebe's short stories are not as widely studied as his novels, and Achebe himself did not consider them a major part of his work. In the preface for Girls at War and Other Stories, he writes: \\"A dozen pieces in twenty years must be accounted a pretty lean harvest by any reckoning.\\"Quoted in Feuser, Willfried F. (2001). \\"Nothing Puzzles God!\\": Chinua Achebe's Civil War Stories\\", No Condition Is Permanent: Nigerian Writing and the Struggle for Democracy (Holger G. Ehling and Claus-Peter Holste-von Mutius, eds). Amsterdam and New York: Editions Rodopi, p. 65. Like his novels, the short stories are heavily influenced by the oral tradition. And like the folktales they follow, the stories often have morals emphasising the importance of cultural traditions.Ogede, Ode (1 January 2001). \\"Oral Tradition and Modern Storytelling: Revisiting Chinua Achebe's Short Stories\\". International Fiction Review Vol. 28, Issue 1/2, pp. 67‚Äì77. . =Use of English= As the decolonisation process unfolded in the 1950s, a debate about choice of language erupted and pursued authors around the world; Achebe was no exception. Indeed, because of his subject matter and insistence on a non-colonial narrative, he found his novels and decisions interrogated with extreme scrutiny ‚Äì particularly with regard to his use of English. One school of thought, championed by Kenyan writer Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, urged the use of indigenous African languages. English and other European languages, he said in 1986, were \\"part of the neo-colonial structures that repress progressive ideas\\".Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 246. Achebe chose to write in English. In his essay \\"The African Writer and the English Language\\", he discusses how the process of colonialism ‚Äì for all its ills ‚Äì provided colonised people from varying linguistic backgrounds \\"a language with which to talk to one another\\". As his purpose is to communicate with readers across Nigeria, he uses \\"the one central language enjoying nationwide currency\\".Achebe (1975), pp. 77‚Äì78. Using English also allowed his books to be read in the colonial ruling nations.Ogbaa, p. 192. Still, Achebe recognises the shortcomings of what Audre Lorde called \\"the master's tools\\". In another essay he notes: In another essay, he refers to James Baldwin's struggle to use the English language to accurately represent his experience, and his realisation that he needed to take control of the language and expand it.Mezu, p. 23. The Nigerian poet and novelist Gabriel Okara likens the process of language-expansion to the evolution of jazz music in the United States.Okara (1991), p. 17. Achebe's novels laid a formidable groundwork for this process. By altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into a distinctly African style.Azohu, p. 413. In some spots this takes the form of repetition of an Igbo idea in standard English parlance; elsewhere it appears as narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences.Azohu, pp. 415‚Äì419. Themes Achebe's novels approach a variety of themes. In his early writing, a depiction of the Igbo culture itself is paramount. Critic Nahem Yousaf highlights the importance of these depictions: \\"Around the tragic stories of Okonkwo and Ezeulu, Achebe sets about textualising Igbo cultural identity\\".Yousaf, p. 37. The portrayal of indigenous life is not simply a matter of literary background, he adds: \\"Achebe seeks to produce the effect of a precolonial reality as an Igbo-centric response to a Eurocentrically constructed imperial 'reality' \\".Yousaf, p. 38. Certain elements of Achebe's depiction of Igbo life in Things Fall Apart match those in Olaudah Equiano's autobiographical Narrative. Responding to charges that Equiano was not actually born in Africa, Achebe wrote in 1975: \\"Equiano was an Igbo, I believe, from the village of Iseke in the Orlu division of Nigeria\\".Mezu, pp. 164‚Äì207. A 1901 stamp from southern Colonial Nigeria =Culture and colonialism= A prevalent theme in Achebe's novels is the intersection of African tradition (particularly Igbo varieties) and modernity, especially as embodied by European colonialism. The village of Umuofia in Things Fall Apart, for example, is violently shaken with internal divisions when the white Christian missionaries arrive. Nigerian English professor Ernest N. Emenyonu describes the colonial experience in the novel as \\"the systematic emasculation of the entire culture\\".Emenyonu, p. 84. Achebe later embodied this tension between African tradition and Western influence in the figure of Sam Okoli, the president of Kangan in Anthills of the Savannah. Distanced from the myths and tales of the community by his Westernised education, he does not have the capacity for reconnection shown by the character Beatrice.Gera, p. 71. The colonial impact on the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often affected by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude.Nnolim, p. 173. The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise clash with the traditions of the Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision-making.Emenyonu, p. 86. The standard Achebean ending results in the destruction of an individual and, by synecdoche, the downfall of the community. Odili's descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in A Man of the People, for example, is symbolic of the post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere.Mezu, pp. 104‚Äì118. Even with the emphasis on colonialism, however, Achebe's tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, as represented by Sophocles and Shakespeare.Niven, pp. 46‚Äì47. Still, Achebe seeks to portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability. In 1972, he said: \\"I never will take the stand that the Old must win or that the New must win. The point is that no single truth satisfied me‚Äîand this is well founded in the Igbo world view. No single man can be correct all the time, no single idea can be totally correct.\\"Quoted in Lindfors, pp. 101‚Äì102. His perspective is reflected in the words of Ikem, a character in Anthills of the Savannah: \\"whatever you are is never enough; you must find a way to accept something, however small, from the other to make you whole and to save you from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism.\\"Quoted in Mezu, p. 132. And in a 1996 interview, Achebe said: \\"Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things ... Evil is never all evil; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness.\\"Mezu, p. 229. =Masculinity and femininity= The gender roles of men and women, as well as societies' conceptions of the associated concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly.Mezu, p. 24. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success.Udumukwu, p. 202 As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control 'his' women is inextricably connected to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranchised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society.Mezu, pp. 27‚Äì28. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers.Corely, p. 204. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity.Bestman, p. 156 Womanism is \\"an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women\\" that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women. As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably from the work of African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe's women some agency and prominence. In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo's furious manhood overpowers everything \\"feminine\\" in his life, including his own conscience. For example, when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son, he asks himself: \\"When did you become a shivering old woman?\\"Achebe (1994), p. 65. It is also argued that one's chi, or personal god, is the 'mother within'.Bestman, p. 167 This understanding further demonstrates how Okonkwo's hypermasculinity corrupts his conscience, as his contempt for his own mother and other women prevents him from being in harmony with his chi. He views all things feminine as distasteful, in part because they remind him of his father's laziness and cowardice.Yousaf, p. 44. His father was considered an agbala‚Äîa word that refers to a man without title, but is also synonymous with 'woman'. Thus, Okonkwo not only regrets his father's lack of success, but attributes it to a lack of masculinity. Okonkwo's feminization of all things lacking success or power is a common theme throughout the novel. His obsession with maleness is fueled by an intense fear of femaleness, which he expresses through physical and verbal abuse of his wives, his violence towards his community, his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough, and his wish that his daughter Ezinma had been born a boy. The women in the novel, meanwhile, are obedient, quiet, and absent from positions of authority ‚Äì despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership.Bicknell, p. 266. The author cites a study by Kemene Okonjo, \\"The Dual-Sex Political System in Operation: Igbo Women and Community Politics in Midwestern Nigeria\\", in Nancy J. Hafkin and Edna G. Bay (eds), Women in Africa. Nevertheless, the need for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani, the earth goddess, and the extended discussion of \\"Nneka\\" (\\"Mother is supreme\\") in chapter fourteen.Bicknell, pp. 266‚Äì267. Ekwefi's perseverance and love for Ezinma, despite her many miscarriages, is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood, which is typically defined by motherhood.Bestman, p. 162. Okonkwo's defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos.Mezu, p. 214. Some have also argued that all of Okonkwo's failures are tied to his contempt and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life‚Äîhis wives, his children, and his own mother. Achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point, saying that \\"I want to sort of scream that Things Fall Apart is on the side of women ... And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women; that all his problems, all the things he did wrong, can be seen as offenses against the feminine.\\"Thompson, Bob (9 March 2008). \\"Things Fall Into Place\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved March 2008. Indeed, it is argued that Okonkwo's violent and vehement anti-women position is the exception, not the norm, within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society.Bestman, p. 160. Still, post-colonial African writing is intensely male-centred, a phenomenon that is not alleviated by the frequent trope of the African woman as the \\"embodiment of the male writer's vision for the new Africa\\".Jeyifo, p. 885. It is argued that even when women and their lives are more centrally depicted in literature, the male writer continues to be the visionary while the woman is the \\"sign\\" of changes to come. Achebe's first central female character in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power.Bicknell, p. 271. Although the final stages of the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities.Bicknell, p. 276. Influence and legacy Achebe has been called \\"the father of modern African writing\\" and Africa's greatest storyteller,\\" Chinua Achebe, The Economist and many books and essays have been written about his work over the past fifty years. In 1992 he became the first living writer to be represented in the Everyman's Library collection published by Alfred A. Knopf.Ezenwa- Ohaeto, p. 285. His 60th birthday was celebrated at the University of Nigeria by \\"an international Who's Who in African Literature\\". One observer noted: \\"Nothing like it had ever happened before in African literature anywhere on the continent.\\"Emenyonu (1996), p. vi. Achebe provided a \\"blueprint\\" for African writers of succeeding generations. In 1982, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Kent. At the ceremony, professor Robert Gibson said that the Nigerian writer \\"is now revered as Master by the younger generation of African writers and it is to him they regularly turn for counsel and inspiration.\\"Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 224. Even outside of Africa, his impact resonates strongly in literary circles. Novelist Margaret Atwood called him \\"a magical writer ‚Äì one of the greatest of the twentieth century\\". Poet Maya Angelou lauded Things Fall Apart as a book wherein \\"all readers meet their brothers, sisters, parents and friends and themselves along Nigerian roads\\".Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 283. Nelson Mandela, recalling his time as a political prisoner, once referred to Achebe as a writer \\"in whose company the prison walls fell down\\",Jaggi, Maya (14 June 2007). \\"The unseen literary world\\". The Guardian. Online at Guardian Unlimited. Retrieved 19 September 2007. and that his work Things Fall Apart inspired him to continue the struggle to end apartheid. Nobel laureate Toni Morrison has noted that Achebe's work inspired her to become a writer and \\"sparked her love affair with African literature\\". Achebe was the recipient of over 30 honorary degrees from universities in England, Scotland, Canada, South Africa, Nigeria and the United States, including Dartmouth College, Harvard, and Brown University. He was awarded the Commonwealth Poetry Prize, an Honorary Fellowship of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1982), a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2002), the Nigerian National Order of Merit (Nigeria's highest honour for academic work), the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade,\\"Chinua Achebe\\", Penguin Random House. the Man Booker International Prize 2007 and the 2010 Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize. He was appointed Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Population Fund in 1999.

Never a perfect consensus, it nevertheless resulted in an extended period of relative peace and stability in Europe following the Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars which had consumed the continent since the 1790s. It consisted of two phases, the first from 1815 to the early 1860s, and the second from the early 1880s to 1914. The first phase of the Concert of Europe, known as the Congress System or the Vienna System after the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì15), was dominated by the five Great Powers of Europe: Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain. Initially envisioning regular Congresses among the Great Powers to resolve potential disputes, in practice, Congresses were held on an ad hoc basis and were generally successful in preventing or localizing conflicts. The more conservative members of the Concert of Europe, members of the Holy Alliance (Russia, Austria, and Prussia), used the system to oppose revolutionary and liberal movements and weaken the forces of nationalism. The Concert faced a major challenge in the Revolutions of 1848 which sought national independence, national unity, and liberal and democratic reforms. The 1848 revolutions were ultimately checked without major territorial changes. However, the age of nationalism ultimately brought the first phase of the Concert to an end, as it was unable to prevent the wars leading to the unification of Italy (by Piedmont-Sardinia) and Germany (by Prussia) in 1871 which remade the maps of Europe. Following German Unification, German chancellor Otto von Bismarck sought to revive the Concert of Europe to protect Germany's gains and secure it's leading role in European affairs. The revitalized Concert included Austria (now Austria-Hungary), France, Italy, Russia, and Britain, with Germany as the driving continental power. The second phase oversaw a further period of relative peace and stability from 1871-1914, and facilitated the growth of European colonial and imperial control without war between the Great Powers in Africa and Asia. Ultimately, the Concert of Europe ended with the outbreak of World War I in 1914 when the Concert proved ultimately unable to handle the collapse of Ottoman power in the Balkans, hardening of the alliance system into two firm camps (the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente), and the feeling among many civilian and military leaders on both sides that a war was inevitable or even desirable.  Overview  Prince Metternich, Austrian chancellor and foreign minister, as well as an influential leader in the Concert of Europe The Concert of Europe describes the geopolitical order in Europe from 1814‚Äì1914, during which the Great Powers tended to act in concert to avoid wars and revolutions and generally maintain the territorial and political status quo. Particularly in the early years of the Concert, the Concert was maintained through the Congress System ‚Äì sometimes called the Vienna System - which was a series of Congresses among the Great Powers to resolve disputes or respond to new issues. The Concert of Europe is typically viewed in two distinct phases: the first from 1814 to through the early 1860s, and the second from the 1880s to 1914. The first phase, particularly before the Revolutions of 1848 is sometimes known as the Age of Metternich, due to the influence of the Austrian chancellor's conservatism and the dominance of Austria within the German Confederation, or as the European Restoration, because of the reactionary efforts of the Congress of Vienna to restore Europe to its state before the French Revolution. The final failure of the Concert of Europe in the First World War and was driven by various factors including rival alliances and the rise of nationalism. The Congress-focused approach to international affairs continued to be influential in the later League of Nations, the United Nations, the Group of Seven and other multi-lateral summits and organizations. The Concert of Europe arose from the coalitions which fought against revolutionary and Napoleonic France. The Great Powers of Austria, Prussia, Russia and the Great Britain, had combined with a number of minor powers to defeat Napoleon for the final time in the Hundred Days. In the wake of this victory, these four great powers formalized their partnership in the Quadruple Alliance. In time, the France under the Bourbon Restoration was established as a fifth member of the Concert, after the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the occupation of France and established the Quintuple Alliance. The Ottoman Empire was later admitted to the Concert of Europe in 1856 with the Treaty of Paris following the Crimean War recognized and guaranteed Ottoman territory.  Origins  The idea of a European federation had been already raised by figures such as Gottfried Leibniz and Lord Grenville. The Concert of Europe, as developed by Metternich, drew upon their ideas and the notion of a balance of power in international relations, so that the ambitions of each Great Power would be restrained by the others: > The Concert of Europe, as it began to be called at the time, had ... a > reality in international law, which derived from the final Act of the Vienna > Congress, which stipulated that the boundaries established in 1815 could not > be altered without the consent of its eight signatories. = French Revolution = The Concert of Europe was very much a response to the French Revolution. From the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792 to the exile of Napoleon to Saint Helena in 1815, Europe had been almost constantly at war. All the European powers were short of the funds, materiel, and manpower necessary for further fighting and therefore sought structures to avoid new conflicts. The military conquests of France had resulted in the spread of liberalism throughout much of the continent, including the adoption of the reforms such as the Napoleonic Code. Having seen how the French Revolution had begun with calls for fairly mild reforms but had quickly led to radical democratic reforms and attacks on the aristocracy, the Concert of Europe also sought to tamp down on liberal and democratic movements across the continent. Finally, the French Revolution also provided a model for nationalist movements and both sides in the Napoleonic Wars had sought to exploit nationalist sentiment when convenient to their war aims. For example, the French supported the nationalist rising in Ireland against the British in 1798 and revived hopes of a Polish state by establishing the Duchy of Warsaw in ethnically Polish lands which helped fight the Prussians, Russians, and Austrians. The Allies supported nationalist movements in Spain and Germany to reduce support for the French-supported governments there. Along with the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France, the Concert of Europe was in many ways an effort to return as far as possible to the status quo of Europe prior to 1789.  First phase  The first phase of the Concert of Europe is typically described as beginning in 1814 with the Congress of Vienna, and ending in the early 1860s with the Prussian and Austrian invasion of Denmark. This first phase included numerous congresses, including the Congress of Paris in 1856 which some scholars argue represented the apex of the Concert of Europe in its ending of the Crimean War. At first, the leading personalities of the system were British foreign secretary Lord Castlereagh, Austrian chancellor and foreign minister Klemens von Metternich, and Emperor Alexander I of Russia. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord of France was largely responsible for quickly returning the country to its place alongside the other major powers in international diplomacy. = The Holy Alliance within the Concert= The Kingdom of Prussia, and the Austrian and Russian empires, formed the Holy Alliance on 26 September 1815, with the express intent of preserving Christian social values and traditional monarchism. Only three notable princes did not sign: Pope Pius VII (it was not Catholic enough), Sultan Mahmud II of the Ottoman Empire (too Christian), and the British Prince Regent because his government was a constitutional monarchy with a more liberal political philosophy and did not wish to pledge itself to the policing of continental Europe. Britain did ratify the Quadruple Alliance, signed on 20 November 1815, the same day as the Second Treaty of Paris was signed, which later became the Quintuple Alliance when France joined in 1818. Shortly thereafter, the Quadruple Alliance became the Quintuple Alliance when France joined with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. There has been much debate between historians as to which treaty was more influential in the development of international relations in Europe in the two decades following the end of the Napoleonic Wars. In the opinion of historian Tim Chapman the differences are somewhat academic, as the powers were not bound by the terms of the treaties and many of them intentionally broke the terms if it suited them. The Holy Alliance was the brainchild of Tsar Alexander I. It gained a lot of support because most European monarchs did not wish to offend the Tsar by refusing to sign it, and as it bound monarchs personally rather than their governments, it was easy to ignore once signed. In the opinion of Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary at the time of its inception, the Holy Alliance was \\"a piece of sublime mysticism and nonsense\\". Nevertheless, its influence was more long lasting than its contemporary critics expected and was revived in the 1820s as a tool of repression when Britain and France refused to embroil themselves in certain continental matters. The Quadruple Alliance, by contrast, was a standard treaty, and the Great Powers did not invite any minor allies to sign it. The primary objective was to bind the signatories to support the terms of the Second Treaty of Paris for 20 years. It included a provision for the High Contracting Parties to \\"renew their meeting at fixed periods...for the purpose of consulting on their common interests\\" which were the \\"prosperity of the Nations, and the maintenance of peace in Europe\\". However, the wording Article VI of the treaty did not specify what these \\"fixed periods\\" were to be and there were no provisions in the treaty for a permanent commission to arrange and organise the conferences. This meant that instead of meeting at \\"fixed periods\\" the meetings were arranged on an ad hoc basis, to address specific threats or disputes.  Second phase  The second phase of the Concert of Europe is typically described as beginning in the early 1880s and ending in 1914 with the outbreak of World War I. The second phase saw a further period of peace between the Great Powers and a revival of the conference system for the resolution of disputes. This period was dominated by issues related to colonialism, particularly the Scramble for Africa. However, a number of factors led to the hardening of alliances into two camps, the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the rival Triple Entente (France, Russia, and Great Britain), rather than the flexible balance of power system with each Power viewing all others as rivals. In addition, the growth of colonial and imperial power around the world and the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and North Africa meant the Concert's goal of territorial and political stability was harder to achieve, eventually leading to the outbreak of war.  Congresses  = 1814 Congress of Vienna = The Concert of Europe began with the 1814-1815 Congress of Vienna, which was designed to bring together the \\"major powers\\" of the time in order to stabilize the geopolitics of Europe after the defeat of Napoleon in 1813‚Äì1814, and contain France's power after the war following the French Revolution. The Congress of Vienna took place from November 1814 to June 1815 in Vienna, Austria, and brought together representatives from over 200 European polities. The Congress of Vienna created a new international world order which was based on two main ideologies: restoring and safeguarding power balancing in Europe; and collective responsibility for peace and stability in Europe among the \\"great powers\\". = 1818 Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle = The 1818 Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle formed the Quintuple Alliance by adding France to the Quadruple Alliance, which had comprised Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. The ability for this to happen was given by Article V of the Quadruple Alliance, and resulted in ending the occupation of France. = 1820 Congress of Troppau = The 1820 Congress of Troppau was held in Troppau, Austria by the Great Powers of the Quintuple Alliance (Russia, Prussia, Austria, France, and Great Britain) to discuss and put down the Napoleonic Revolution in Naples that caused King Ferdinand I to agree to a constitutional monarchy - which was seen by Prussia and Austria as a threat of liberalism. Other powers present at this Congress include Spain, Naples, and Sicily. At this Congress, the Troppau Protocol was signed, which stated that if States which have undergone a change of government due to a revolution threaten other States, then they are ipso facto no longer members of the European Alliance if their exclusion will help to maintain legal order and stability. Furthermore, the Powers of the Alliance would also be bound to peacefully or by means of war bring the excluded State back into the Alliance. = 1821 Congress of Laibach = The 1821 Congress of Laibach took place in Laibach (now Ljubljana, Slovenia), between the powers of the Holy Alliance (Russia, Prussia, and Austria) in order to discuss the Austrian invasion and occupation of Naples in order to put down the Napoleonic Revolution. Other powers present at this Congress include Naples, Sicily, Great Britain, and France. The Congress of Laibach represented beginning tensions within the Concert of Europe, between the Eastern powers of Russia, Prussia, and Austria, versus the Western powers of Britain and France. = 1822 Congress of Verona = The 1822 Congress of Verona took place in Verona, Italy, between the powers of the Quintuple Alliance (Russia, Prussia, Austria, France, and Great Britain), along with Spain, Sicily, and Naples. This Congress dealt with the question of Spanish revolution of 1820; Russia, Prussia, and Austria agreed to support France's planned intervention in Spain, while Great Britain opposed it. This Congress also looked to deal with the Greek revolution against Turkey, but due to the opposition of Great Britain and Austria to Russian intervention in the Balkans, the Congress of Verona did not end up working on this issue. = 1830 London Conference = The 1830‚Äì1832 London Conference took place in London, Great Britain, between the powers of Great Britain, France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands. This Conference dealt with the question of the Belgian‚ÄìDutch conflict, which was caused by the 1830 Belgian Revolution where Belgium separated from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Austria, Prussia, and Russia saw Belgium's separation as an event that could negatively impact that Congress system, and worked to convince Belgium to return to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. On the other hand, Great Britain and France both supported Belgium's revolution, and were able to achieve recognition of Belgium from the Conference party members. = 1856 Congress of Paris = = 1878 Congress of Berlin =  Decline  = First phase = The fall of the first phase of the Concert of Europe can be attributed largely to the failure of a ceasefire in 1864 over the issue of Prussia's and Austria's invasion of Denmark in the Second Schleswig War. Austria and Prussia both opposed negotiation settlement attempts, driving a wedge in the geopolitics of the Concert of Europe. While various Congresses and Conferences took place between the early 1860s when the first phase fell, and the early 1880s when the second phase began, the cooperative nature of the Concert was significantly less present during this time of conflict. = Second phase = The fall of the second phase of the Concert of Europe can be attributed largely to the rival alliance systems ‚Äì the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and Great Britain) ‚Äì which formed a rift in the European States. These rival alliances threatened the underlying nature of the Concert, which relied on ad hoc alliances to respond to a given situation. The crisis of July 1914 ‚Äì the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo which lit the fuse on Balkan tensions ‚Äì catalyzed the collapse of the Concert of Europe for good, and marked the start of the first World War. = Role of nationalism = Nationalism played a role in the fall of both the first and second phases of the Concert of Europe, and was generally on the rise around the world before the start of the first World War; nationalism is seen by some scholars as a driving factor in the creation of the first World War. Particularly with the fall of the first phase, the rise of nationalism was in almost direct opposition to the core cooperative functions of the Concert, and resulted in States who were no longer well constrained by the Congress system. The outbreak of conflict - namely in the Balkans after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand - highlighted the final failure of the Concert of Europe, in that it was no longer able to constrain State national interests in order to maintain a cooperative international front.

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed.) Houghton- Mifflin Company. 2004. Retrieved March 03, 2008. Orthodoxy within Christianity is a spectrum wherein different Churches accept different forms of creeds and councils. Such difference of opinions has occurred due to the language and cultural barriers that the Church Fathers had to face when expressing a theological opinion. The Eastern Orthodox Churches adheres to the orthodoxy portrayed in the first seven ecumenical councils, while the Oriental Orthodox Churches finds their Orthodoxy in the first three ecumenical councils. In some English-speaking countries, Jews who adhere to all the traditions and commandments as legislated in the Talmud are often called Orthodox Jews. Religions =Buddhism= The historical Buddha was known to denounce mere attachment to scriptures or dogmatic principles, as it was mentioned in the Kalama Sutta. Moreover, the Theravada school of Buddhism follows strict adherence to the PƒÅli Canon (tripi·π≠aka) and the commentaries such as the Visuddhimagga. Hence, the Theravada school came to be considered the most orthodox of all Buddhist schools, as it is known to be highly conservative especially within the discipline and practice of the Vinaya. =Christianity= The Greek Cross, flanked by the Greek letters \\"ICXC NIKA\\" which means \\"JESUS CHRIST PREVAILS\\". In classical Christian usage, the term orthodox refers to the set of doctrines which were believed by the early Christians. A series of ecumenical councils were held over a period of several centuries to try to formalize these doctrines. The most significant of these early decisions was that between the Homoousian doctrine of Athanasius and Eustathius (which became Trinitarianism) and the Heteroousian doctrine of Arius and Eusebius (Arianism). The Homoousian doctrine, which defined Jesus as both God and man with the canons of the 431 Council of Ephesus, won out in the Church and was referred to as orthodoxy in most Christian contexts, since this was the viewpoint of previous Christian Church Fathers and was reaffirmed at these councils. (The minority of nontrinitarian Christians object to this terminology.) Following the 1054 Great Schism, both the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church continued to consider themselves uniquely orthodox and catholic. Augustine wrote in On True Religion: \\"Religion is to be sought‚Ä¶only among those who are called Catholic or orthodox Christians, that is, guardians of truth and followers of right.\\" Over time, the Western Church gradually identified with the \\"Catholic\\" label, and people of Western Europe gradually associated the \\"Orthodox\\" label with the Eastern Church (in some languages the \\"Catholic\\" label is not necessarily identified with the Western Church). This was in note of the fact that both Catholic and Orthodox were in use as ecclesiastical adjectives as early as the 2nd and 4th centuries respectively. Much earlier, the earliest Oriental Orthodox Churches had split from Chalcedonian Christianity after the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451), because of several christological differences. Since then, Oriental Orthodox Churches are maintaining the orthodox designation as a symbol of their theological traditions. =Hinduism= Orthodoxy does not exist in Hinduism, as the word Hindu itself collectively refers to the various beliefs of people who lived beyond the Sindhu river of the Indus Valley Civilization. It is a synthesis of the accepted teachings of each of thousands of gurus, who others equate to prophets, and has no founder, no authority or command, but recommendations. The term most equivalent to orthodoxy at best has the meaning of \\"commonly accepted\\" traditions rather than the usual meaning of \\"conforming to a doctrine\\", for example, what people of middle eastern faiths attempt to equate as doctrine in Hindu philosophies is Sanatana Dharma, but which at best can be translated to mean \\"ageless traditions\\", hence denoting that they are accepted not through doctrine and force but through multi-generational tests of adoption and retention based on circumstantial attrition through millennia. =Islam= Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as \\"orthodox Islam\\". However, other scholars of Islam, such as John Burton believe that there is no such thing as \\"orthodox Islam.\\"Burton, John. 1996. An Introduction to the Hadith. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. p. 201: \\"Sunni: Of or pertaining sunna, especially the Sunna of the Prophet. Used in conscious opposition to Shi'a, Shi'√≠. There being no ecclesia or centralized magisterium, the translation 'orthodox' is inappropriate. To the Muslim 'unorthodox' implies heretical, mubtadi, from bid'a, the contrary of sunna, and so 'innovation'.\\" =Judaism= Orthodox Judaism is a collective term for the traditionalist branches of Judaism, which seek to fully maintain the received Jewish beliefs and observances and which coalesced in opposition to the various challenges of modernity and secularization. Theologically, it is chiefly defined by regarding the Torah, both Written and Oral, as literally revealed by God on biblical Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since. The movement advocates a strict observance of halakha (Jewish Law), which is to be interpreted only according to received methods due to its divine character. Orthodoxy considers halakha as eternal and beyond historical influence, being applied differently to changing circumstances but basically unchangeable in itself. Orthodox Judaism is not a centralized denomination. Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained and the exact limits of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate. Very roughly, it may be divided between Haredi Judaism, which is more conservative and reclusive, and Modern Orthodox Judaism, which is relatively open to outer society. Each of those is itself formed of independent streams. They are almost uniformly exclusionist, regarding Orthodoxy as the only authentic form of Judaism and rejecting all non-Orthodox interpretations as illegitimate. =Others= Kemetic Orthodoxy is a denomination of Kemetism, a reform reconstruction of Egyptian polytheism for modern followers. It claims to derive a spiritual lineage from the Ancient Egyptian religion. There are organizations of Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery) which characterize the religion as Orthodoxy, and by other terms. Non- religious contexts Outside the context of religion, the term orthodoxy is often used to refer to any commonly held belief or set of beliefs in some field, in particular when these tenets, possibly referred to as \\"dogmas\\", are being challenged. In this sense, the term has a mildly pejorative connotation. Among various \\"orthodoxies\\" in distinctive fields, the most commonly used terms are: * Political orthodoxy * Social orthodoxy * Economic orthodoxy * Scientific orthodoxy * Artistic orthodoxy The terms orthodox and orthodoxy are also used more broadly to refer to things other than ideas and beliefs. A new and unusual way of solving a problem could be referred to as unorthodox, while a common and 'normal' way of solving a problem would be referred to as orthodox. Related concepts Orthodoxy is opposed to heterodoxy ('other teaching') or heresy. People who deviate from orthodoxy by professing a doctrine considered to be false are called heretics, while those who, perhaps without professing heretical beliefs, break from the perceived main body of believers are called schismatics. The term employed sometimes depends on the aspect most in view: if one is addressing corporate unity, the emphasis may be on schism; if one is addressing doctrinal coherence, the emphasis may be on heresy. A deviation lighter than heresy is commonly called error, in the sense of not being grave enough to cause total estrangement, while yet seriously affecting communion. Sometimes error is also used to cover both full heresies and minor errors. Doctrine or practices not regarded as essential to faith, with which Christians can legitimately disagree, are known as adiaphora. The concept of orthodoxy is prevalent in many forms of organized monotheism. However, orthodox belief is not usually overly emphasized in polytheistic or animist religions, in which there is often little or no concept of dogma, and varied interpretations of doctrine and theology are tolerated and sometimes even encouraged within certain contexts. Syncretism, for example, plays a much wider role in non-monotheistic (and particularly, non-scriptural) religion. The prevailing governing norm within polytheism is often orthopraxy ('right practice') rather than the \\"right belief\\" of orthodoxy.

It was developed within the Open Grid Forum, which was called the Global Grid Forum (GGF) at the time, around 2002 to 2006. Description OGSA is a distributed interaction and computing architecture based around services, assuring interoperability on heterogeneous systems so that different types of resources can communicate and share information. OGSA is based on several other Web service technologies, such as the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), but it aims to be largely independent of transport-level handling of data. OGSA has been described as a refinement of a Web services architecture, specifically designed to support grid requirements.An Analysis of The Open Grid Services Architecture The concept of OGSA is derived from work presented in the 2002 Globus Alliance paper \\"The Physiology of the Grid\\" by Ian Foster, Carl Kesselman, Jeffrey M. Nick, and Steven Tuecke. It was developed by GGF working groups which resulted in a document, entitled The Open Grid Services Architecture, Version 1.5 in 2006. The GGF published some use case scenarios.OGSA Tier 1 Use Case Draft Document According to the \\"Defining the Grid: A Roadmap for OGSA Standards v 1.0\\", OGSA is:Defining the Grid: A Roadmap for OGSA Standards v 1.0 * An architectural process in which the GGF's OGSA Working Group collects requirements and maintains a set of informational documents that describe the architecture; * A set of normative specifications and profiles that document the precise requirements for a conforming hardware or software component; * Software components that adhere to the OGSA specifications and profiles, enabling deployment of grid solutions that are interoperable even though they may be based on implementations from multiple sources. The Open Grid Services Architecture, Version 1.5 described these capabilities: * Infrastructure services * Execution Management services * Data services * Resource Management services * Security services * Self-management services * Information services In late 2006 an updated version of OGSA and several associated documents were published, including the first of several planned normative documents, \\"Open Grid Services Architecture Glossary of Terms, Version 1.5\\".Open Grid Services Architecture Glossary of Terms, Version 1.5 The Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) is related to OGSA, as it was originally intended to form the basic ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù layer for OGSA.

The school was so called after Cyrene, the birthplace of Aristippus. It was one of the earliest Socratic schools. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain (as it did for Epicurus), but positively enjoyable sensations. Of these, momentary pleasures, especially physical ones, are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. They did, however, recognize the value of social obligation and that pleasure could be gained from altruistic behaviour. The school died out within a century and was replaced by the philosophy of Epicureanism.  History of the school  The history of the Cyrenaic school begins with Aristippus of Cyrene, who was born around 435 BCE. He came to Athens as a young man and became a pupil of Socrates. We have only limited knowledge of his movements after the execution of Socrates in 399 BCE, although he is said to have lived for a time in the court of Dionysius of Syracuse. It is uncertain precisely which doctrines ascribed to the Cyrenaic school were formulated by Aristippus. Diogenes La√´rtius, based on the authority of Sotion and Panaetius, provided a long list of books said to have been written by Aristippus. However, Diogenes also wrote that Sosicrates had stated that Aristippus had written nothing.Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 84f Among Aristippus' pupils was his daughter, Arete of Cyrene, who passed on his teachings to her own son Aristippus the Younger. It was he, according to Aristocles,Aristocles ap. Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, xiv. 18 who turned the teachings of his grandfather into a comprehensive system. At the least, however, it can be said that the foundations of Cyrenaic philosophy were ideas originated by the elder Aristippus. After the time of the younger Aristippus, the school broke up into different factions, represented by Anniceris, Hegesias, and Theodorus, who all developed rival interpretations of Cyrenaic doctrines, many of which were responses to the new system of hedonistic philosophy laid down by Epicurus. By the middle of the 3rd century BC, the Cyrenaic school was obsolete; Epicureanism had successfully beaten its Cyrenaic rivals by offering a system which was more sophisticated.  Philosophy  The Cyrenaics were hedonists and held that pleasure was the supreme good in life, especially physical pleasure, which they thought more intense and more desirable than mental pleasures. Pleasure is the only good in life and pain is the only evil. Socrates had held that virtue was the only human good, but he had also accepted a limited role for its utilitarian side, allowing pleasure to be a secondary goal of moral action. Aristippus and his followers seized upon this, and made pleasure the sole final goal of life, denying that virtue had any intrinsic value. = Epistemology = The Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical theory of knowledge. They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth. They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate sense-experiences (for instance, that I am having a sweet sensation now) but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations (for instance, that the honey is sweet). They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like. All knowledge is of one's own immediate sensation. These sensations are motions which are purely subjective, and are painful, indifferent or pleasant, according as they are violent, tranquil or gentle. Further they are entirely individual, and can in no way be described as being of the world objectively. Feeling, therefore, is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct. Our ways of being affected are alone knowable. Thus the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure. = Ethics = Cyrenaicism deduces a single, universal aim for all people which is pleasure. Furthermore, all feeling is momentary and homogeneous. It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind. Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect; the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures, being more simple and more intense, were preferable. Momentary pleasure, preferably of a physical kind, is the only good for humans. However some actions which give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life. Regard should be paid to law and custom, because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own, violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others. Likewise, friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide. Thus the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behavior. Like many of the leading modern utilitarians, they combined with their psychological distrust of popular judgments of right and wrong, and their firm conviction that all such distinctions are based solely on law and convention, the equally unwavering principle that the wise person who would pursue pleasure logically must abstain from that which is usually thought wrong or unjust. This idea, which occupies a prominent position in systems like those of Jeremy Bentham, Volney, and even William Paley, was clearly of prime importance to the Cyrenaics. = Later Cyrenaics = The later Cyrenaics, Anniceris, Hegesias, and Theodorus, all developed variations on the standard Cyrenaic doctrine. For Anniceris, pleasure is achieved through individual acts of gratification which are sought for the pleasure that they produce, but Anniceris laid great emphasis on the love of family, country, friendship and gratitude, which provide pleasure even when they demand sacrifice. Hegesias believed that happiness is impossible to achieve, and hence the goal of life becomes the avoidance of pain and sorrow. Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery are all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain. For Hegesias, Cyrenaic hedonism was simply the least irrational strategy for dealing with the pains of life. For Theodorus, the goal of life is mental pleasure not bodily pleasure, and he placed greater emphasis on the need for moderation and justice. He was also famous for being an atheist. To some extent these philosophers were all trying to meet the challenge laid down by Epicureanism, and the success of Epicurus was in developing a system of philosophy which would prove to be more comprehensive and sophisticated than its rivals'. The philosophy of the Cyrenaics around the time of Hegesias of Cyrene evolved in a way that has similarities with Skepticism, Epicurianism and also Buddhism.Berenice II and the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt, Dee L. Clayman, Oxford University Press, 2014, p.33 In fact, there are striking similarities with the tenets of Buddhism, in particular the Four Noble Truths and the concept of Dukkha or \\"suffering\\". Coincidentally, the rulers of Cyrene around the time Hegesias flourished, the Ptolemaic king of Egypt Ptolemy II Philadelphus and from 276 BC the independent king Magas of Cyrene, are both claimed to have been recipients of Buddhist missionaries from the Indian king Ashoka according to the latter's Edicts.Ashoka: The Search for India's Lost Emperor, Charles Allen, Hachette UK, 2012, p.117Berenice II Euergetis: Essays in Early Hellenistic Queenship, Branko van Oppen de Ruiter, Springer, 2016, p.22 It is therefore sometimes thought that Hegesias may have been directly influenced by Buddhist teachings through contacts with the alleged missionaries sent to his rulers in the 3rd century BC.Historical Dictionary of Ancient Greek Philosophy, Anthony Preus, Rowman & Littlefield, 2015, p.184 See also *Existential nihilism *Pleasure principle (psychology) *Charvaka  Notes   Citations   References   *  Further reading  * Diogenes Laertius (1925).

Set at Harvard mainly during the Reagan administration, the plot and all the characters that appear in the story are entirely fictitious. Plot summary The book chronicles the rise to fame of one Montgomery Marvin, a professor of economics who, as an academic teacher, keeps a low profile but who nevertheless is given tenure quite early in his career. While outwardly concerning himself with unspectacular research focusing on \\"Mathematical Paradigms in an Approach to Refrigerator Pricing\\" (which is also the title of his Ph.D. thesis), Marvin's extracurricular activities centre on becoming very rich in a very short time. For that purpose, Marvin has devised a new formula‚Äîa stock forecasting model by means of which he and his wife can cash in on people's euphoria, greed and, as they call it, dementia. Eventually, while everyone loses money in the wake of the \\"Black Monday\\" stock market crash of October 19, 1987, the Marvins gain an awful lot. (See also Michael Milken and leveraged buyout.) They decide to spend their money wisely, according to their liberal agenda. Intent on strictly observing the code of business ethics, they start to make use of the \\"positive power of wealth\\" and embark on a life of philanthropy. They fund a number of chairs in peace studies to be established at, of all places, military academies. They also secure legislation by which companies are required to label their products according to the percentage of female executives employed by them. After they have launched several of their projects, their operations are increasingly considered un-American and officially put under surveillance. But whatever will happen - Marvin knows that he will be able to nourish his family, as he has been accorded tenure. A Tenured Professor was republished as paperback by Houghton Mifflin in 2001 ().

They are the only family with more than two species in which every species is threatened (all three are listed as vulnerable).

While the latter is certainly incorrect, there is some indication that they might indeed be closer (though not very close) to the Columbiformes. The purported gruiforms kagu and sunbittern (and possibly the extinct adzebills too) might also be not-too-distant relatives. These latter taxa, remarkably, were all only tentatively placed in the Gruiformes, and are apparently all of Gondwanan origin; like the mesites, the kagu and sunbittern are among the rather few birds possessing powder down. Still, the data hinting at a possible relationship between the \\"odd gruiforms\\" (and possibly pigeons) is by no means robust enough to draw a firm conclusion. (Fain & Houde 2004) Arguably, they might be considered an order of their own (Mesitornithiformes) as has on occasion been done in the past, but unlike with the hoatzin, little phylogenetic research has yet been conducted on mesites. The DNA study of Hackett et al. (2008) suggested that the mesites are a sister group of the doves, somewhat more distantly related to the sandgrouse, tropicbirds, grebes, and flamingos, within the proposed \\"Metaves\\" clade.A Phylogenomic Study of Birds Reveals Their Evolutionary History, Shannon J.

The brown and white-breasted mesites forage on the ground, gleaning insects from the leaves and under them, as well as low vegetation. The subdesert mesite uses its long bill to probe in the soil. Other birds, such as drongos and flycatchers, will follow mesites to catch any insects they flush and miss. Mesites are vocal birds, with calls similar to passerine song, used for territorial defence. Two or three white eggs are laid in a stick-nest located in a bush or low branch. The Mesitornis species are monogamous; Monias benschi is polygamous and unlike the other two shows significant sexual dichromatism.

Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90¬∞ or slightly greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs‚Äîor other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn‚Äîstrong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades). The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90¬∞ or lesser angle. Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g. in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces, chairs may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics. Chairs vary in design. An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat; a recliner is upholstered and under its seat is a mechanism that allows one to lower the chair's back and raise into place a fold-out footrest; a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat. Etymology Chair comes from the early 13th-century English word chaere, from Old French chaiere (\\"chair, seat, throne\\"), from Latin cathedra (\\"seat\\").  History  Five three-legged chairs around a low-legged table from Sliven 19th Century Lifestyle Museum Early 20th-century armchair made in eastern Australia, with strong heraldic embellishment The chair has been used since antiquity, although for many centuries it was a symbolic article of state and dignity rather than an article for ordinary use. \\"The chair\\" is still used as the emblem of authority in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom and Canada, and in many other settings. In keeping with this historical connotation of the \\"chair\\" as the symbol of authority, committees, boards of directors, and academic departments all have a 'chairman' or 'chair'. Endowed professorships are referred to as chairs. It was not until the 16th century that chairs became common. Until then, people sat on chests, benches, and stools, which were the ordinary seats of everyday life. The number of chairs which have survived from an earlier date is exceedingly limited; most examples are of ecclesiastical, seigneurial or feudal origin. Chairs were in existence since at least the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt (c. 3100 BC). They were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today's chairs ‚Äì chair seats were sometimes only high. In ancient Egypt chairs appear to have been of great richness and splendor. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly materials, magnificent patterns and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives. Generally speaking, the higher ranked an individual was, the taller and more sumptuous was the chair he sat on and the greater the honor. On state occasions the pharaoh sat on a throne, often with a little footstool in front of it. The average Egyptian family seldom had chairs, and if they did, it was usually only the master of the household who sat on a chair. Among the better off, the chairs might be painted to look like the ornate inlaid and carved chairs of the rich, but the craftsmanship was usually poor. Monobloc chair is a lightweight stackable polypropylene chair, usually white in colour, often described as the world's most common plastic chair. The earliest images of chairs in China are from sixth-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs at that time was rare. It wasn't until the twelfth century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Christian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is no longer common to sit at floor level.Kieschnick, John. The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture, Princeton University Press, 2003, pp. 222‚Äì248. In Europe, it was owing in great measure to the Renaissance that the chair ceased to be a privilege of state and became a standard item of furniture for anyone who could afford to buy it. Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily came into general use. Almost at once the chair began to change every few years to reflect the fashions of the day. Thomas Edward Bowdich visited the main Palace of the Ashanti Empire in 1819, and observed chairs engrossed with gold in the empire. In the 1880s, chairs became more common in American households and usually there was a chair provided for every family member to sit down to dinner. By the 1830s, factory-manufactured ‚Äúfancy chairs‚Äù like those by Sears. Roebuck, and Co. allowed families to purchase machined sets. With the Industrial Revolution, chairs became much more available. The Sacco chair, designed in 1968, is now the basis of bean bag chairs The 20th century saw an increasing use of technology in chair construction with such things as all-metal folding chairs, metal-legged chairs, the Slumber Chair, moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs. The recliner became a popular form, at least in part due to radio and television. The modern movement of the 1960s produced new forms of chairs: the butterfly chair (originally called the Hardoy chair), bean bags, and the egg-shaped pod chair that turns. It also introduced the first mass-produced plastic chairs such as the Bofinger chair in 1966. Technological advances led to molded plywood and wood laminate chairs, as well as chairs made of leather or polymers. Mechanical technology incorporated into the chair enabled adjustable chairs, especially for office use. Motors embedded in the chair resulted in massage chairs.  Materials  Metal chairs in the Tuileries Garden, Paris, France Chairs can be made from wood, metal, or other strong materials, like stone or acrylic. In some cases, multiple materials are used to construct a chair; for example, the legs and frame may be made from metal and the seat and back may be made from plastic. Chairs may have hard surfaces of wood, metal, plastic, or other materials, or some or all of these hard surfaces may be covered with upholstery or padding. The design may be made of porous materials, or be drilled with holes for decoration; a low back or gaps can provide ventilation. The back may extend above the height of the occupant's head, which can optionally contain a headrest. Chairs can also be made from more creative materials, such as recycled materials like cutlery and wooden play bricks, pencils, plumbing tubes, rope, corrugated cardboard, and PVC pipe. In rare cases, chairs are made out of unusual materials, especially as a form of art or experimentation. Raimonds Cirulis, a Latvian interior designer, created a volcanic hanging chair that is a handmade out of volcanic rock. Peter Brenner, a Dutch-born German designer, has created a chair made from lollipop sugar ‚Äì of confectioners' sugar.  Design and ergonomics  S Chair, designed by Verner Panton The difference between leg room and seat pitch Chair design considers intended usage, ergonomics (how comfortable it is for the occupant), as well as non-ergonomic functional requirements such as size, stacking ability, folding ability, weight, durability, stain resistance, and artistic design. Intended usage determines the desired seating position. \\"Task chairs\\", or any chair intended for people to work at a desk or table, including dining chairs, can only recline very slightly; otherwise the occupant is too far away from the desk or table. Dental chairs are necessarily reclined. Easy chairs for watching television or movies are somewhere in between depending on the height of the screen. Ergonomic design distributes the weight of the occupant to various parts of the body. A seat that is higher results in dangling feet and increased pressure on the underside of the knees (\\"popliteal fold\\"). It may also result in no weight on the feet which means more weight elsewhere. A lower seat may shift too much weight to the \\"seat bones\\" (\\"ischial tuberosities\\"). A reclining seat and back will shift weight to the occupant's back. This may be more comfortable for some in reducing weight on the seat area, but may be problematic for others who have bad backs. In general, if the occupant is supposed to sit for a long time, weight needs to be taken off the seat area and thus \\"easy\\" chairs intended for long periods of sitting are generally at least slightly reclined. However, reclining may not be suitable for chairs intended for work or eating at table. The back of the chair will support some of the weight of the occupant, reducing the weight on other parts of the body. In general, backrests come in three heights: Lower back backrests support only the lumbar region. Shoulder height backrests support the entire back and shoulders. Headrests support the head as well and are important in vehicles for preventing \\"whiplash\\" neck injuries in rear-end collisions where the head is jerked back suddenly. Reclining chairs typically have at least shoulder-height backrests to shift weight to the shoulders instead of just the lower back. Some chairs have foot rests. Around 15% of women and 2% of men need foot rests, even at the chair height. A stool or other simple chair may have a simple straight or curved bar near the bottom for the sitter to place their feet on. Some chairs have two curved bands of wood (also known as rockers) attached to the bottom of the legs. They are called rocking chairs. The type of chair popular in western Hubei, China: with a fairly low seat and the back inclined at about 45 degrees from the vertical A kneeling chair adds an additional body part, the knees, to support the weight of the body. A sit- stand chair distributes most of the weight of the occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported in the back of the seat, padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees. There may be cases where padding is not desirable, such as chairs that are intended primarily for outdoor use. Where padding is not desirable, contouring may be used instead. A contoured seat pan attempts to distribute weight without padding. By matching the shape of the occupant's buttocks, weight is distributed and maximum pressure is reduced. Churchchairs Actual chair dimensions are determined by measurements of the human body or anthropometric measurements. The two most relevant anthropometric measurement for chair design is the popliteal height and buttock popliteal length. For someone seated, the popliteal height is the distance from the underside of the foot to the underside of the thigh at the knees. It is sometimes called the \\"stool height\\". The term \\"sitting height\\" is reserved for the height to the top of the head when seated. For American men, the median popliteal height is and for American women it is . The popliteal height, after adjusting for heels, clothing and other issues, is used to determine the height of the chair seat. Mass-produced chairs are typically high. For someone seated, the buttock popliteal length is the horizontal distance from the back most part of the buttocks to the back of the lower leg. This anthropometric measurement is used to determine the seat depth. Mass-produced chairs are typically deep. Additional anthropometric measurements may be relevant to designing a chair. Research has shown that the best seated posture is a reclined posture of 100¬∞‚Äì110¬∞.Hedge, chapter 1.3.3 Hip breadth is used for chair width and armrest width. Elbow rest height is used to determine the height of the armrests. The buttock-knee length is used to determine \\"leg room\\" between rows of chairs. \\"Seat pitch\\" is the distance between rows of seats. In some airplanes and stadiums the leg room (the seat pitch less the thickness of the seat at thigh level) is so small that it is sometimes insufficient for the average person. For adjustable chairs, such as an office chair, the aforementioned principles are applied in adjusting the chair to the individual occupant. Caster wheels are attached to the feet of chairs to give more mobility. Gas springs are attached to the body of the chair in order to give height adjustment and more comfort to the user. = Armrests = Eames Lounge chair and ottoman Italian design chair \\"Stile'900\\", by Arnaldo dell'Ira, 1938 A chair may or may not have armrests; chairs with armrests are termed \\"armchairs\\". In French, a distinction is made between fauteuil and chaise, the terms for chairs with and without armrests, respectively. In Germany, an armchair was once called a Krankensessel, or sick-chair, because it was intended for people who were too ill to stand or sit without extra support. If present, armrests will support part of the body weight through the arms if the arms are resting on the armrests. Armrests further have the function of making entry and exit from the chair easier (but from the side it becomes more difficult). Armrests should support the forearm and not the sensitive elbow area. Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the chair back, but is missing in the elbow area. Cockfighting chair The curiously named cockfighting chair has nothing to do with that sport . It is properly a library or study chair. It has two broad armrests extending from the back to form a yolk. Designed for use with a desk, it is broad in front but curving inward to embrace the user. , The seat was shaped so that a reader could easily sit astride, facing the desk at the back of the chair and resting his arms on the ends of the yoke. Despite its popular name (th origin of which is obscure) a sketch made in 1741 by Lancaster firm founded by Robert Gillow (1703-1772) indicates its original design purpose.Crab Tree Farm Collections catalogue Cockfighting chair Enclopedia Britannica  Seats  Polypropylene (molded plastic) seats and stainless steel legs in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This type of material is very useful in seaside areas. Chair seats vary widely in construction and may or may not match construction of the chair's back (backrest). Some systems include: * Center seats where a solid material forms the chair seat ** Solid wood, may or may not be shaped to human contours ** Wood slats, often seen on outdoor chairs ** Padded leather, generally a flat wood base covered in padding and contained in soft leather ** Stuffed fabric, similar to padded leather ** Metal seats of solid or open design ** Molded plastic ** Stone, often marble * Open center seats where a soft material is attached to the tops of chair legs or between stretchers to form the seat ** Wicker, woven to provide a surface with give to it ** Leather, may be tooled with a design ** Fabric, simple covering without support ** Tape, wide fabric tape woven into seat, seen in lawn chairs and some old chairs ** Caning, ** Rush, wrapped from rush, heavy paper, strong grasses, or hand twisted while wrapped with cattails to form the seat, usually in a pattern of four trapezoids meeting in the center, and on rare occasions, in elaborate patterns ** Reed, ** Rawhide ** Splint, ash, oak or hickory strips are woven ** Metal, Metal mesh or wire woven to form seat  Standards and specifications  Highly decorated carved-back chairs in Mexico Design considerations for chairs have been codified into standards. ISO 9241, \\"Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) ‚Äì Part 5: Workstation layout and postural requirements\\", is the most common one for modern chair design. There are multiple specific standards for different types of chairs. Dental chairs are specified by ISO 6875. Bean bag chairs are specified by ANSI standard ASTM F1912-98. ISO 7174 specifies stability of rocking and tilting chairs. ASTM F1858-98 specifies plastic lawn chairs. ASTM E1822-02b defines the combustibility of chairs when they are stacked. The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) defines ANSI/BIFMA X5.1 (titled: General-Purpose Office Chairs ‚Äì Tests) for testing of commercial-grade chairs. It specifies things like: * chair back strength of * chair stability if weight is transferred completely to the front or back legs * leg strength of applied from the bottom of the leg * seat strength of dropped from above the seat * seat cycle strength of 100,000 repetitions of dropped from above the seat The specification further defines heavier \\"proof\\" loads that chairs must withstand. Under these higher loads, the chair may be damaged, but it must not fail catastrophically. Large institutions that make bulk purchases will reference these standards within their own even more detailed criteria for purchase. Governments will often issue standards for purchases by government agencies (e.g. Canada's Canadian General Standards Board CAN/CGSB 44.15M on \\"Straight Stacking Chair, Steel\\" or CAN/CGSB 44.232-2002 on \\"Task Chairs for Office Work with Visual Display Terminal\\"). Chairs may be rated by the length of time that they may be used comfortably ‚Äì an 8-hour chair, a 24-hour chair, and so on. Such chairs are specified for tasks which require extended periods of sitting, such as for receptionists or supervisors of a control panel.  Accessories  AISI 304 stainless steel laboratory chair with gas springs and caster wheels, a specific type of chair for a work environment In place of a built-in footrest, some chairs come with a matching ottoman. An ottoman is a short stool that is intended to be used as a footrest but can sometimes be used as a stool. If matched to a glider chair, the ottoman may be mounted on swing arms so that the ottoman rocks back and forth with the main glider. A chair cover is a temporary fabric cover for a side chair. They are typically rented for formal events such as wedding receptions to increase the attractiveness of the chairs and decor. The chair covers may come with decorative chair ties, a ribbon to be tied as a bow behind the chair. Covers for sofas and couches are also available for homes with small children and pets. In the second half of the 20th century, some people used custom clear plastic covers for expensive sofas and chairs to protect them. Chair pads are cushions for chairs. They contain cotton or foam for padding. Some are decorative. In cars, they may be used to increase the height of the driver. Orthopedic backrests provide support for the back. Car seats sometimes have built-in and adjustable lumbar supports. These can also be used on kitchen chairs. Chair mats are mats meant to cover different types of flooring. They are usually made from plastic. This allows chairs on wheels to roll easily over the carpet and protects the carpet or floor. They come in various shapes, some specifically sized to fit partially under a desk. Remote control bags can be draped over the arm of easy chairs or sofas and used to hold remote controls for home cinemas. They are counter-weighted so as to not slide off the arms under the weight of the remote controls. Chair glides are attached to the feet of chairs to prevent them from scratching or snagging on the floor. An antimacassar is a cloth covering for a headrest to protect the fabric and enable easy washing.

The chair had spikes that retracted when a credit card was inserted to download a seating license. Later other museums and galleries were equipped with the \\"Pay to Sit\\" chair, with a global central seating license server located in Toronto. The first sitting session was free, with a database of persons who had already used their free session. In a performance piece at the 2012 Republican Political Convention, Clint Eastwood addressed an empty chair, as if it represented President Barack Obama (meant to be construed as MIA or ineffectual). The address was controversial, whether it was poignant or bizarre.

When making Comt√©, cheesemakers would end the day with leftover curd that was not enough for an entire cheese. Thus, they would press the remaining evening curd into a mold, and spread ash over it to protect it overnight. The following morning, the cheese would be topped up with morning milk.

He has been involved in thousands of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. His music draws from funk, world music, jazz, dub and ambient styles. According to music critic Chris Brazier, \\"Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out.\\" The credo of one record label run by Laswell which typifies much of his work is \\"Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted\\". Although his bands may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically. Material began as a noisy dance music band, but later albums concentrated on hip hop, jazz, or spoken word readings by William S. Burroughs. Most versions of the band Praxis have included guitarist Buckethead, but they have explored different permutations on albums. Career =Early years= Laswell got his earliest professional experience as a bass guitarist in R&B; and funk bands in Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan. He saw shows that combined genres, such as Iggy and the Stooges, MC5, and Funkadelic. He was also influenced by jazz musicians John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and Miles Davis. =New York and Material= In the late 1970s Laswell moved to New York City, immersing himself in the thriving New York music scene. He moved into producer Giorgio Gomelsky's loft and became part of a group of musicians that would become the first version of Material. Material became the backing band for Daevid Allen and New York Gong. The band consisted of Laswell, keyboardist Michael Beinhorn, and drummer Fred Maher. They were usually supplemented by guitarists Cliff Cultreri or Robert Quine. He worked with Brian Eno, Fred Frith, John Zorn, Daniel Ponce, Ginger Baker, Peter Br√∂tzmann, Kip Hanrahan, Sonny Sharrock, and with musicians in no wave, a genre that combined avant-garde jazz, funk, and punk. He started a recording studio with Martin Bisi and met Jean Karakos, owner of Celluloid Records. Under the Material name Laswell became the de facto house producer for Celluloid until the label was sold in the 1980s. He recorded music that was experimental, combining jazz, funk, pop, and R&B;, by musicians such as Whitney Houston, Sonny Sharrock, Archie Shepp, Henry Threadgill, and the band Massacre with Fred Frith and Fred Maher. His association with Celluloid allowed his first forays into \\"collision music\\", a term coined by British writer Chris May of Black Music & Jazz Review. Recordings with the Golden Palominos and production on albums by Shango, Toure Kunda, and Fela Kuti appeared on the label. Celluloid was an early advocate of hip hop, producing albums by Fab 5 Freddy, GrandMixer D.ST, Phase II, and Afrika Bambaataa. The album World Destruction paired John Lydon with Afrika Bambaataa years before Aerosmith and Run‚ÄìD.M.C. collaborated on their rock/hip hop version of \\"Walk This Way\\". In 1982, Laswell released Baselines, his solo debut album. A year later, he had a breakthrough with \\"Rockit\\", a song he co-wrote and produced for Herbie Hancock's album Future Shock. He played bass guitar and co-wrote other songs on the album, leading to collaborations with Hancock through the 2000s. He won a Grammy Award for producing Hancock's next album, Sound-System. He became a member of the band Last Exit in 1986 with Peter Br√∂tzmann, Ronald Shannon Jackson, and Sonny Sharrock. Aside from one album that Laswell cobbled together in the studio, the band was primarily a live one, showing up at gigs with no rehearsal. The first time the four members played together was on stage at their first show. Laswell produced albums for Sly and Robbie, Mick Jagger, PiL, Mot√∂rhead, Ramones, Iggy Pop and Yoko Ono. Many of these bands afforded Laswell the opportunity to hire his working crew to record on more mainstream records. Sly and Robbie hired him to produce their 1985 album Language Barrier and 1987 album Rhythm Killers. =Running Axiom= Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records, gave him the opportunity to begin a label with the backing of Island, and thus Axiom Records was started in 1990. In addition to albums by Material that included Sly and Robbie, William S. Burroughs, Bootsy Collins, Wayne Shorter, and Bernie Worrell, he produced and released albums by Ginger Baker, Ronald Shannon Jackson, Sonny Sharrock, Nicky Skopelitis, and Umar Bin Hassan. Among the studio-based albums, Palestinian oud and violinist Simon Shaheen recorded an album of music by Egyptian composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab. Gambian virtuoso Foday Musa Suso recorded an album of dance music with his electric Kora, and Turkish saz master Talip Oezkan recorded an album. Master Musicians of Jajouka recorded an album in their village in the Rif Mountains. There were albums by Mandinka and Fulani recorded at Suso's family compound in Gambia and Gnawa music from Morocco. Praxis featured guitarist Buckethead on Transmutation with Bootsy Collins, Bryan Mantia, Bernie Worrell, and Afrika Baby Bam from the Jungle Brothers. The album blended funk grooves and heavy metal riffs with many tracks co- written by Laswell. The band spawned other releases, never with the same line- up, though consisting of the core trio of Laswell, Buckethead, and Mantia. Funkcronomicon included previously released tracks by Praxis and Skopelitis and tracks with members of Parliament-Funkadelic. George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and the last recordings of Eddie Hazel are featured prominently. The album includes DXT, Umar Bin Hassan, Abiodun Oyewole and Torture.Axiom Dub: Mysteries of Creation, Hyperreal Archive Laswell remixed the Axiom catalog for Axiom Ambient, blending seemingly disparate tracks, releasing some of the music for Sample Material ‚Äì International Free Zone, a sample library for other musicians to use as material. =Other labels= Subharmonic, conceived by Laswell and ex-Celluloid A&R; Robert Soares, though not owned by Laswell, was essentially a vehicle for his projects, most in the ambient or ambient-dub categories. The label licensed a few releases from European labels for American re-release, notably Psychonavigation with Pete Namlook and Cymatic Scan with Tetsu Inoue from Pete Namlook's FAX label; Somnific Flux with Mick Harris and Cold Summer by Lull from the Sentrax label. Other collaborators included Jonah Sharp and Terre Thaemlitz. The label also released albums by Painkiller, Praxis, and Divination, an ambient dub project by Laswell. A sub-label called Strata was created with five releases in a more experimental dub/noise/ambient vein. Each of these releases (Death Cube K, Cypher 7, Azonic, and two under his alias Automaton) came in a black jewel case with the name of the project and album title printed on the front. Three other short-lived labels were created after the demise of the Subharmonic deal. One was Meta, which was intended to be a spoken word label. The second label, Submeta, managed four releases before folding. Meta, formed with Janet Rienstra, released only one album, Baptism of Solitude with novelist Paul Bowles reading excerpts from his work over soundscapes by Laswell. Meta would appear periodically, distributed by other labels, over the next few years until it returned as a spiritual/yogic label run by Rienstra. The third label, Black Arc, was an associated label of Rykodisc focusing on \\"Black Rock, Cyber Funk, and Future Blues\\", according to a sampler. The label featured members of P-Funk on most of the albums and released albums by Bootsy Collins (under the name \\"Zillatron\\"), Bernie Worrell (Japan-only), Mutiny (Jerome Brailey), and Billy Bass. Charged (1999) by Eraldo Bernocchi and Toshinori Kondo was released by Laswell's label Innerythmic. After a brief inactive period, the label restarted in 2001, releasing over the next few years and albums by Nicky Skopelitis, Raoul Bj√∂rkenheim, James Blood Ulmer, Shin Terai, and Gonervill. Innerhythmic also released a live recording by Praxis and reissued Black Arc albums from the 1990, including Zillatron, The Last Poets' Holy Terror and Buddy Miles' Hell & Back. Laswell moved his studio to West Orange, New Jersey and called it Orange Music Sound Studios. Under Palm's umbrella, though, four albums and a DVD set were released, including a studio album and a live 2-disc set from Tabla Beat Science centered on tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain, son of Alla Rakha. The album included Karsh Kale, Trilok Gurtu, Ustad Sultan Khan, and Talvin Singh. This group has performed in the US, Lebanon, and Japan. Laswell, Kale, Kahn, and Hussain are usually supplemented by other musicians, which have included Gigi, DJ Disk, Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Sussan Deyhim, and artist Petulia Mattioli. In 2001 Life Space Death was released with Japanese trumpeter Toshinori Kondo, Laswell on bass, guitar, and keyboards, and words by the 14th Dalai Lama interviewed by Kondo.Life Space Death, album sleeve notes At the request of Blackwell, Laswell oversaw the debut album by Ethiopian singer Gigi for Palm Pictures with Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Laswell. He also produced Abyssinia Infinite and Gold & Wax. Laswell has stated in interviews that he met with Miles Davis a number of times and discussed working together, but busy schedules kept them from arranging such a recording before Davis' death. He remixed some of Davis's music for Panthalassa: The Music of Miles Davis 1969-1974 (Axiom, 1998). =New century, new labels= He signed a contract with Sanctuary Records that led to the creation of his label Nagual. He worked in the drum and bass genre, starting with Brutal Calling credited to Bill Laswell vs. Submerged that was released by Avant in 2004. He and Submerged worked together again on The Only Way to Go is Down (2006) under the name Method of Defiance. After this album, they assembled producers in drum and bass to collaborate with musicians from jazz. Evol Intent, Future Prophecies, and SPL recorded with Buckethead, Herbie Hancock, and Pharoah Sanders. In 2010, Laswell created the label M.O.D. Technologies. Its first releases were the albums Jahbulon and Incunabula by Method of Defiance and Mesgana Ethiopia by Material with Gigi. Along with live dates around the world with Massacre, Material, Method of Defiance, and Painkiller, Laswell travels to Japan every year for recordings and live dates, including with Tokyo Rotation. In September 2017, Bill Laswell was interviewed by the Data.Wave webzine. In November 2018, he performed in Dave Douglas Uplift band at the London Jazz Festival. =Collaborators= Laswell works frequently with a small group of collaborators. These include bassists Jah Wobble, Jonas Hellborg, and Bootsy Collins; guitarists Buckethead and Nicky Skopelitis; keyboardists Jeff Bova and Bernie Worrell; percussionists A√Øyb Dieng and Karsh Kale, and musicians from P-Funk. Robert Musso has been his chief engineer for over twenty years. Oz Fritz has occasionally filled the role. Fritz is usually Laswell's live engineer of choice, known for live mixing technique. Remixes have been done for Sting, Nine Inch Nails, Almamegretta, Scorn, Ozzy Osbourne, and Tori Amos. He has done much work for John Zorn's Tzadik Records. In 2005, Laswell was invited to appear on the PBS series Soundstage.

Green tea originated in China, but its production and manufacture has spread to other countries in East Asia. Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest. Although there has been considerable research on the possible health effects of consuming green tea regularly, there is little evidence that drinking green tea has any effects on health. History The tea fields in the foothills of Gorreana, Azores Islands, Portugal: the only European region other than Georgia to support green tea production. Tea consumption has its legendary origins in China during the reign of Emperor Shennong. A book written by Lu Yu in 618‚Äì907 AD (Tang dynasty), The Classic of Tea (), is considered important in green tea history. The Kissa Yojoki (Âñ´Ëå∂È§äÁîüË®ò Book of Tea), written by Zen priest Eisai in 1211, describes how drinking green tea may affect five vital organs, the shapes of tea plants, flowers and leaves, and how to grow and process tea leaves. Steeping, brewing and serving Four varieties of green tea prior to brewing The color of green tea brewed for 3 minutes at Steeping, or brewing, is the process of making tea from leaves and hot water, generally using of tea per of water (H2O) or about 1 teaspoon of green tea per 150 ml cup. Steeping temperatures range from to and steeping times from 30 seconds to three minutes. Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter and longer while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually multiple times (2‚Äì3 typically). Higher-quality teas like gyokuro use more tea leaves and are steeped multiple times for short durations. Steeping too hot or too long results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew's taste is also affected by the steeping technique; two important ones are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down, and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water during consumption. Extracts Polyphenols found in green tea include epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate, epicatechins and flavanols, which are under laboratory research for their potential effects in vivo. Other components include three kinds of flavonoids, known as kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin.Committee on Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer, Assembly of Life Sciences, National Research Council, Diet, nutrition, and cancer, Washington: D.C National Academies Press, 1982, p. 286. Although the mean content of flavonoids and catechins in a cup of green tea is higher than that in the same volume of other food and drink items that are traditionally considered to promote health,USDA Database for the Flavonoid Content of Selected Foods, Release 2.1 (2007) flavonoids and catechins have no proven biological effect in humans. Consumption of green tea extract is linked to hepatotoxicity and liver failure. Green tea leaves are initially processed by soaking in an alcohol solution, which may be further concentrated to various levels; byproducts of the process are also packaged and used. Extracts are sold over the counter in liquid, powder, capsule, and tablet forms,I.T. Johnson & G. Williamson, Phytochemical functional foods, Cambridge, UK: Woodhead Publishing, 2003, pp. 135-145A. Bascom, Incorporating herbal medicine into clinical practice, Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company, 2002, p. 153. and may contain up to 17.4% of their total weight in caffeine, though decaffeinated versions are also available. Health effects  Regular green tea is 99.9% water, provides 1 kcal per 100 mL serving, is devoid of significant nutrient content (table), and contains phytochemicals such as polyphenols and caffeine. Numerous claims have been made for the health benefits of green tea, but human clinical research has not found good evidence of benefit. In 2011, a panel of scientists published a report on the claims for health effects at the request of the European Commission: in general they found that the claims made for green tea were not supported by sufficient scientific evidence. Although green tea may enhance mental alertness due to its caffeine content, there is only weak, inconclusive evidence that regular consumption of green tea affects the risk of cancer or cardiovascular diseases, and there is no evidence that it benefits weight loss. Although using green tea as a health supplement green tea is associated with a slight improvement in overall quality of life, it is also associated with some potential adverse effects. A 2020 review by the Cochrane Collaboration listed these as gastrointestinal disorders, higher levels of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin reactions. =Cancer= Research has shown there is no good evidence that green tea helps to prevent or treat cancer in people. The link between green tea consumption and the risk of certain cancers such as stomach cancer and non-melanoma skin cancers is unclear due to inconsistent or inadequate evidence. Green tea interferes with the chemotherapy drug bortezomib (Velcade) and other boronic acid-based proteasome inhibitors, and should be avoided by people taking these medications. =Cardiovascular disease= Observational studies found a minor correlation between daily consumption of green tea and a 5% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease. In a 2015 meta-analysis of such observational studies, an increase in one cup of green tea per day was correlated with slightly lower risk of death from cardiovascular causes. Green tea consumption may be correlated with a reduced risk of stroke. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials found that green tea consumption for 3‚Äì6 months may produce small reductions (about 2‚Äì3 mm Hg each) in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. A separate systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that consumption of 5-6 cups of green tea per day was associated with a small reduction in systolic blood pressure (2 mmHg), but did not lead to a significant difference in diastolic blood pressure. =Glycemic control= Green tea consumption lowers fasting blood sugar but in clinical studies the beverage's effect on hemoglobin A1c and fasting insulin levels was inconsistent. =Hyperlipidemia= Drinking green tea or taking green tea supplements decreases the blood concentration of total cholesterol (about 3‚Äì7 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (about 2 mg/dL), and does not affect the concentration of HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. A 2013 Cochrane meta-analysis of longer-term randomized controlled trials (>3 months duration) concluded that green tea consumption lowers total and LDL cholesterol concentrations in the blood. =Inflammation= A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials found that green tea consumption was not significantly associated with lower plasma levels of C-reactive protein levels (a marker of inflammation). =Weight loss= There is no good evidence that green tea aids in weight loss or weight maintenance. =Potential for liver toxicity= In 2018, a scientific panel for the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the safety of green tea consumption over a low-moderate range of daily EGCG intake from 90 to 300 mg per day, and with exposure from high green tea consumption estimated to supply up to 866 mg EGCG per day. Dietary supplements containing EGCG may supply up to 1000 mg EGCG and other catechins per day. The panel concluded that EGCG and other catechins from green tea in low-moderate daily amounts are generally regarded as safe, but in some cases of excessive consumption of green tea or use of high-EGCG supplements, liver toxicity may occur. Production In 2013, global production of green tea was approximately 1.7 million tonnes, with a forecast to double in volume by 2023. As of 2015, China provided 80% of the world's green tea market, leading to its green tea exports rising by 9% annually, while exporting 325,000 tonnes in 2015. In 2015, the US was the largest importer of Chinese green tea (6,800 tonnes), an increase of 10% over 2014, and Britain imported 1,900 tonnes, 15% more than in 2014. =Growing, harvesting and processing= Hand-rolling green tea after steaming Green tea is processed and grown in a variety of ways, depending on the type of green tea desired. As a result of these methods, maximum amounts of polyphenols and volatile organic compounds are retained, affecting aroma and taste. The growing conditions can be broken down into two basic types ‚àí those grown in the sun and those grown under the shade. The green tea plants are grown in rows that are pruned to produce shoots in a regular manner, and in general are harvested three times per year. The first flush takes place in late April to early May. The second harvest usually takes place from June through July, and the third picking takes place in late July to early August. Sometimes, there will also be a fourth harvest. It is the first flush in the spring that brings the best-quality leaves, with higher prices to match. Green tea is processed using either artisanal or modern methods. Sun-drying, basket or charcoal firing, or pan-firing are common artisanal methods. Oven-drying, tumbling, or steaming are common modern methods. Processed green teas, known as aracha, are stored under low humidity refrigeration in 30- or 60-kg paper bags at . This aracha has yet to be refined at this stage, with a final firing taking place before blending, selection and packaging take place. The leaves in this state will be re-fired throughout the year as they are needed, giving the green teas a longer shelf-life and better flavor. The first flush tea of May will readily store in this fashion until the next year's harvest. After this re-drying process, each crude tea will be sifted and graded according to size. Finally, each lot will be blended according to the blending order by the tasters and packed for sale. =Import of radioactive Japanese tea= On 17 June 2011, at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France, radioactive cesium of 1,038 becquerels per kilogram was measured in tea leaves imported from Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster on 11 March, which was more than twice the restricted amount in the European Union of 500 becquerels per kilogram. The government of France announced that they rejected the leaves, which totaled .\\"Êó•Êú¨„Åã„Çâ„ÅÆÁ∑ëËå∂„Å´Âü∫Ê∫ñË∂Ö„Åà„Çã„Çª„Ç∑„Ç¶„É† „Éë„É™„ÅÆÁ©∫Ê∏Ø„ÅßÊ§úÂá∫.\\" (Japanese) Asahi Shimbun. 2011-06-18.

In response, the governor of Shizuoka Prefecture, Heita Kawakatsu, stated: \\"there is absolutely no problem when they [people] drink them because it will be diluted to about 10 becquerels per kilogram when they steep them even if the leaves have 1,000 becquerels per kilogram;\\" a statement backed by tests done in Shizuoka.\\"ÈùôÂ≤°Áü•‰∫ã„ÄåÈ£≤Áî®Ëå∂„Å´„Åô„Çå„Å∞ÂïèÈ°å„Å™„ÅÑ„Äç ‰ªè„Åß„ÅÆÊ§úÂá∫Âèó„Åë.\\" (Japanese) Asahi Shimbun. 2011-06-18.

Green tea in East Asia  = China = Loose leaf green tea has been the most popular form of tea in China since at least the Southern Song dynasty. While Chinese green tea was originally steamed, as it still is in Japan, after the early Ming dynasty it has typically been processed by being pan-fired in a dry wok. Other processes employed in China today include oven-firing, basket- firing, tumble-drying and sun-drying. Green tea is the most widely produced form of tea in China, with 1.42 million tons grown in 2014. Popular green teas produced in China today include: * Biluochun Produced in Jiangsu, this tea is named after the shape of the leaves, which are curled like snails. * Chun Mee Known in English by its Cantonese name, and popular outside China. It has a plum-like flavor. * Gunpowder tea A tea which is tumble-dried so that each leaf is rolled into a small pellet that resembles gunpowder. * Huangshan Maofeng A type of maofeng tea grown in the microclimate of the Huangshan mountain range in Anhui province. Maofeng teas are harvested by plucking intact two equal-sized leaves and a bud together. * Longjing Also known as \\"Dragon Well\\" tea, the English translation of its name. Grown near Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, Longjing is the most well-known pan-fired Chinese green tea. Its flavor derives partly from the terroir of the region in which it is produced. * Lu'an Melon Seed Grown in Anhui province. Unlike typical Chinese teas, two leaves are plucked separately from each branch, with no bud and no stems. Harvested later in the season, it has a grassier flavor than typical Chinese green teas. * Taiping Houkui Grown in Anhui province. Uses a cultivar with an unusually large leaf. The production process flattens the tea leaves, creating the so-called \\"two knives and a pole\\" shape from the leaves and stem. * Xinyang Maojian A type of maojian tea grown in Xinyang, Henan province. Maojian teas are harvested by plucking a bud and one leaf together. = Japan = Sencha green tea, the most popular form of tea in Japan. Tea seeds were first brought to Japan in the early 9th century by the Buddhist monks Saicho and K≈´kai. During the Heian period (794‚Äì1185), Emperor Saga introduced the practice of drinking tea to the imperial family. The Zen Buddhist priest Eisai (1141‚Äì1215), founder of the Rinzai school of Buddhism, brought tea seeds from China to plant in various places in Japan. Eisai advocated that all people, not just Buddhist monks and the elite, drink tea for its health benefits. The oldest tea- producing region in Japan is Uji, located near the former capital of Kyoto. It is thought that seeds sent by Eisai were planted in Uji, becoming the basis of the tea industry there. Today, Japan's most expensive premium teas are still grown in Uji. The largest tea-producing area today is Shizuoka Prefecture, which accounts for 40% of total Japanese sencha production. Other major tea- producing regions include the island of Kyushu and the prefectures of Shiga, Gifu, and Saitama in central Honshu. All commercial tea produced in Japan today is green tea, though for a brief period black tea was also produced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Japanese tea production is heavily mechanized, and is characterized by the use of modern technology and processes to improve yields and reduce labor. Because of the high cost of labor in Japan, only the highest quality teas are plucked and processed by hand in the traditional fashion. Japanese green teas have a thin, needle-like shape and a rich, dark green color. Unlike Chinese teas, most Japanese teas are produced by steaming rather than pan firing. This produces their characteristic color, and creates a sweeter, more grassy flavor. A mechanical rolling/drying process then dries the tea leaves into their final shape. The liquor of steamed Japanese tea tends to be cloudy due to the higher quantity of dissolved solids. Most Japanese teas are blended from leaves grown in different regions, with less emphasis on terroir than in the Chinese market. Because of the limited quantity of tea that can be produced in Japan, the majority of production is dedicated to the premium tea market. Bottled tea and tea- flavored food products usually use lower-grade Japanese-style tea produced in China. Although a variety of commercial tea cultivars exist in Japan, the vast majority of Japanese tea is produced using the Yabukita cultivar developed in the 1950s. Popular Japanese green teas include: * Bancha A lower-grade tea plucked from the same bushes used to produce sencha. It has a somewhat bolder flavor, and is plucked each season after sencha production is finished. * Genmaicha Made by combining sencha tea leaves with toasted puffs of rice. * Gyokuro Grown under shade for three weeks prior to plucking, gyokuro is one of the most exclusive varieties of tea produced in Japan. The shading technique imparts a sweeter flavor, and produces a particularly rich color thanks to the higher amounts of chlorophyll in the shaded leaf. Gyokuro tea is associated with the Uji region, the first tea-growing region in Japan. It is often made using smaller-leaf cultivars of the tea plant. * H≈çjicha This type of tea is made by roasting sencha or bancha leaves with kukicha twigs. * Kabusecha Similar to gyokuro, kabusecha is shaded for only a week prior to plucking. Its flavor is somewhat between that of gyokuro and normal sencha. * Kukicha A blended tea made of sencha leaves and stems. * Matcha Like gyokuro, matcha is shaded before plucking. The plucked and processed leaf is called tencha. This product is then ground into a fine powder, which is matcha. Because the tea powder is very perishable, matcha is usually sold in small quantities. It is typically rather expensive. Matcha is the type of tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony. It is prepared by whisking the tea with hot water in a bowl, until the surface is frothy. If the water is too hot, the tea may become overly bitter. * Sencha This type of tea is produced throughout the tea season, and is the standard style today, representing 80% of all tea produced in Japan. 90% of sencha is grown from the Yabukita cultivar. * Shincha The first early harvest of tea, plucked before the first flush, is called shincha. Shincha is made from the youngest new growth leaves, and is plucked from early April to early May. Shincha typically refers to the early harvest of sencha, but can refer to any type of tea plucked early in the season, before the main harvest. Because of the limited quantities in which it is produced, shincha is highly prized and expensive to obtain. = Korea = Gakjeochong, a Goguryeo tomb, shows a knight drinking tea with two ladies (5-6th century) Tea leaves: sejak (green tea), ujeon (green tea), and hwangcha (yellow tea) from Hadong County According to Record of Gaya cited in Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms, the legendary queen Heo Hwang-ok, a princess of the Ayodhya married to King Suro of Gaya, brought the tea plant from India and planted it in Baegwolsan, a mountain in current Changwon. However, it is a widely held view that systematic planting of tea bushes began with the introduction of Chinese tea culture by the Buddhist monks around the 4th century. Amongst some of the earliest Buddhist temples in Korea, Bulgapsa (founded in 384, in Yeonggwang), Bulhoesa (founded in 384, in Naju) and Hwaeomsa (founded in Gurye, in 544) claim to be the birthplace of Korean tea culture. Green tea was commonly offered to Buddha, as well as to the spirits of deceased ancestors. Tea culture continued to prosper during the Goryeo Dynasty, with the tea offering being a part of the biggest national ceremonies and tea towns were formed around temples. Seon-Buddhist manners of ceremony prevailed. During the Joseon Dynasty, however, Korean tea culture underwent secularization, along with the Korean culture itself. Korean ancestral rite jesa, also referred to as charye (, \\"tea rite\\"), has its origin in darye (, \\"tea rite\\"), the practice of offering tea as simple ancestral rites by the royal family and the aristocracy in Joseon. Tea culture of Korea was actively suppressed by the Japanese during the Japanese forced occupation period (1910‚Äí1945), and the subsequent Korean War (1950‚Äí1953) made it even harder for the Korean tea tradition to survive. The restoration of the Korean way of tea began in the 1970s, around Dasolsa. Commercial production of green tea in South Korea only began in the 1970s,. By 2012 the industry was producing 20% as much tea as Taiwan and 3.5% as much as Japan. Green tea is not as popular as coffee or other types of Korean teas in modern South Korea. The annual consumption per capita of green tea in South Korea in 2016 was , compared to coffee. Recently however, as the coffee market reached saturation point, South Korean tea production doubled during 2010‚Äí2014, as did tea imports during 2009‚Äì2015, despite very high tariff rate (513.6% for green tea, compared to 40% for black tea, 8% for processed/roasted coffee, and 2% for raw coffee beans). Korean green tea can be classified into various types based on several different factors. The most common is the flush, or the time of the year when the leaves are plucked (and thus also by leaf size). * Ujeon Ujeon (), or cheonmul-cha (), is made of hand-picked leaves plucked before gogu (20‚Äì21 April). The ideal steeping temperature for ujeon tea is . * Sejak Sejak (), or dumul-cha (), is made of hand-picked leaves plucked after gogu (20‚Äì21 April) but before ipha (5‚Äì6 May). The tea is also called jakseol () as the tea leaves are plucked when they are about the size of a sparrow's tongue. The ideal steeping temperature for sejak tea is . * Jungjak Jungjak (), or semul-cha (), is made of leaves plucked after ipha (5‚Äì6 May) until the mid May. The ideal steeping temperature for jungjak tea is . * Daejak Daejak (), or kkeunmul-cha (), is made of tea leaves plucked in late May and after. It is usually made into tea bags or used in cooking. The ideal steeping temperature for daejak tea is . The mode of preparation also differs: * Ipcha (yeopcha) The synonyms ipcha () and yeopcha () refer to loose leaf tea, often in contrast to tea in tea bags. As the words mean \\"leaf tea\\", they can also be used in contrast to powdered tea. * Garucha (malcha) The synonyms garucha () and malcha () refer to powdered tea. Leaf teas are processed either by roasting or steaming. * Deokkeum-cha (bucho-cha) Roasting is the most common and traditional way of tea processing in Korea. Also translated into \\"pan-fried tea\\", the deokkeum-cha () or bucho-cha () varieties are richer in flavour. * Jeungje-cha Steaming is less popular in Korean green tea processing, but the method is still used in temple cuisine. Tea prepared with steamed tea leaves, called jeungje-cha (), are more vivid in colour. Southern, warmer regions such as Boseong in South Jeolla Province, Hadong in South Gyeongsang Province, and Jeju Island are famous for producing high-quality tea leaves. * Banya-cha Banya-cha () is one of the most renowned Korean green teas. This steamed tea is developed by Buddhist monks in Boseong. The tea is grown on sandy loam near mountains and sea. The word banya is a Korean transliteration of the Buddhist concept praj√±ƒÅ. * Jungno-cha Jungno-cha () is one of the most renowned Korean green teas. The roasted variety of tea is made of tea leaves grown among the bamboo in Gimhae, Hadong, and Jinju in South Gyeongsang Province. Green tea can be blended with other ingredients. * Hyeonmi-nokcha Nokcha (green tea) blended with hyeonmi-cha (brown rice tea) is called hyeonmi-nokcha (). * Remon-nokcha Nokcha (green tea) blended with lemon is called remon-nokcha ().

This produces a swept comb filter effect: peaks and notches are produced in the resulting frequency spectrum, related to each other in a linear harmonic series. Varying the time delay causes these to sweep up and down the frequency spectrum. A flanger is an effects unit that creates this effect. Part of the output signal is usually fed back to the input (a \\"re-circulating delay line\\"), producing a resonance effect which further enhances the intensity of the peaks and troughs. The phase of the fed- back signal is sometimes inverted, producing another variation on the flanger sound. Origin As an audio effect, a listener hears a \\"drainpipe\\" or \\"swoosh\\" or \\"jet plane\\" sweeping effect as shifting sum-and-difference harmonics are created analogous to use of a variable notch filter. The term \\"flanging\\" comes from one of the early methods of producing the effect. The finished music track is recorded simultaneously to two matching tape machines, then replayed with both decks in sync. The playback-head output from the two recorders is mixed to a third recorder. The engineer slows down one recorder by lightly pressing a finger on the flange (rim) of one of the playout reels. The \\"drainpipe\\" or subtle \\"swoosh\\" 'flange flango' effect \\"sweeps\\" in one direction, and the playback of that recorder remains slightly behind the other when the finger is removed. By pressing a finger on the flange of the other deck, the effect sweeps back in the other direction as the decks progress towards being in sync. The Beatles' producer George Martin has disputed this \\"reel flange\\" source, instead attributing the term to John Lennon (see Martin's account below.) Older recording hardware could suffer flanging as a side effect when recording long tracks. As the weight of the tape built on one reel, the pressure on the capstans caused flanging in mixdown or dubbing. This was a problem faced by studio engineers in the 1960s and 1970s when recording large concept pieces, as explained by Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull when recounting the studio challenges of recording Thick as a Brick. Despite subsequent claims over who originated flanging, Les Paul discovered the effect in the late 1940s and 1950s; however, he did most of his early phasing experiments with acetate disks on variable-speed record players. On \\"Mammy's Boogie\\" (1952) he used two disk recorders, one with a variable speed control.Bode, Harald (October 1984) \\"History of Electronic Sound Modification\\". Journal of the Audio Engineering Society. Vol. 32, No. 10, p. 730. (Convenience archive).Thompson, Art (1997) The Stompbox: A History of Guitar Fuzzes, Flangers, Phasers, Echoes and Wahs. Backbeat Books, p. 24. The first hit song with a very discernible flanging effect was \\"The Big Hurt\\" (1959) by Toni Fisher.Lacasse, Serge (2004) 'Listen to My Voice‚Äô: The Evocative Power of Vocal Staging in Recorded Rock Music and Other Forms of Vocal Expression. Further development of the classic effect is attributed to Ken Townsend, an engineer at EMI's Abbey Road Studio, who devised the process in the spring of 1966. Tired of laboriously re-recording dual vocal tracks, John Lennon asked Townsend if there was some way for the Beatles to get the sound of double-tracked vocals without doing the work. Townsend devised artificial double tracking or ADT. According to historian Mark Lewisohn, it was Lennon who first called the technique \\"flanging\\". Lennon asked George Martin to explain how ADT worked, and Martin answered with the nonsense explanation \\"Now listen, it's very simple. We take the original image and we split it through a double vibrocated sploshing flange with double negative feedback\\". Lennon thought Martin was joking. Martin replied, \\"Well, let's flange it again and see\\". From that point, when Lennon wanted ADT he would ask for his voice to be flanged, or call out for \\"Ken's flanger\\". According to Lewisohn, the Beatles' influence meant the term \\"flanging\\" is still in use today, more than 50 years later. The first Beatles track to feature flanging was \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" from Revolver, which was recorded on 6 April 1966. When Revolver was released on 5 August 1966, almost every song had been subjected to flanging.Lewisohn, Mark. The Beatles: Recording Sessions (New York: Harmony Books, 1988), page 70. Others have attributed it to George Chkiantz, an engineer at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. One of the first instances on a pop recording was the Small Faces' 1967 single \\"Itchycoo Park\\",Hodgson, Jay (2010). Understanding Records, p.142. . Interludes between chorus and verse at 0:50‚Äì1:07, 1:40‚Äì2:05, and 2:20‚Äì2:46. recorded at Olympic and engineered by Chkiantz's colleague Glyn Johns. The first stereo flanging is credited to producer Eddie Kramer, in the coda of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Bold as Love\\" (1967). Kramer said in the 1990s that he read BBC Radiophonic Workshop journals for ideas and circuit diagrams. Kendrick's setup to control flanging In 1968, the record producer for the Litter, Warren Kendrick, devised a method to precisely control flanging by placing two 15 IPS (inches per second) stereo Ampex tape recorders side by side.Diagram by Warren Kendrick ‚Äì 'K-Tel Reissue CD 10002 (1991)' The take-up reel of recorder A and supply reel of B were disabled, as were channel 2 of recorder A, channel 1 of recorder B and the erase head of recorder B. The tape was fed left-to-right across both recorders and an identical signal was recorded on each channel of the tape, but displaced by approximately 18 inches along the length of the tape. During recording, an ordinary screwdriver was wedged between the recorders to make the tape run \\"uphill\\" and \\"downhill.\\" The same configuration was employed during the playback/mixdown to a third recorder. The screwdriver was moved back and forth to cause the two signals to diverge, then converge. The latter technique permits zero point flanging; i.e., the lagging signal crosses over the leading signal and the signals change places. A similar \\"jet plane-like\\" effect occurs naturally in long distance shortwave radio music broadcasts. In this case the varying delays are caused by varying radio wave propagation times and multipath radio interference. Artificial flanging In the 1970s, advances in solid-state electronics made flanging possible using integrated circuit technology. Solid-state flanging devices fall into two categories: analog and digital. The flanging effect in most newer digital flangers relies on DSP technology. Flanging can also be accomplished using computer software. The original tape-flanging effect sounds a little different from electronic and software recreations.REAPER Not only is the tape-flanging signal time- delayed, but response characteristics at different frequencies of the tape and tape heads introduced phase shifts into the signals as well. Thus, while the peaks and troughs of the comb filter are more or less in a linear harmonic series, there is a significant non-linear behaviour too, causing the timbre of tape-flanging to sound more like a combination of what came to be known as flanging and phasing. =\\"Barber pole\\" flanging= Also known as \\"infinite flanging\\", this sonic illusion is similar to the Shepard tone effect, and is equivalent to an auditory \\"barber pole\\".\\"The Sonic Barber Pole: Shepard's Scale\\". at cycleback.com. The sweep of the flanged sound seems to move in only one direction (\\"up\\" or \\"down\\") infinitely, instead of sweeping back-and-forth. While Shepard tones are created by generating a cascade of tones, fading in and out while sweeping the pitch either up or down, barber pole flanging uses a cascade of multiple delay lines, fading each one into the mix and fading it out as it sweeps to the delay time limit. The effect is available on various hardware and software effect systems.  Comparison with phase shifting  Spectrograms of phasing and flanging effects Flanging is one specific type of phase-shifting, or \\"phasing\\". In phasing, the signal is passed through one or more all-pass filters with non-linear phase response and then added back to the original signal. This results in constructive and destructive interference that varies with frequency, giving a series of peaks and troughs in the frequency response of the system. In general, the position of these peaks and troughs do not occur in a harmonic series. In contrast, flanging relies on adding the signal to a uniform time-delayed copy of itself, which results in an output signal with peaks and troughs which are in a harmonic series. Extending the comb analogy, flanging yields a comb filter with regularly spaced teeth, whereas phasing results in a comb filter with irregularly spaced teeth. In both phasing and flanging, the characteristics (phase response and time delay respectively) are generally varied in time, leading to an audible sweeping effect. To the ear, flanging and phasing sound similar, yet they are recognizable as distinct colorations. Commonly, flanging is referred to as having a \\"jet-plane-like\\" characteristic. In order for the comb filter effect to be audible, the spectral content of the program material must be full enough within the frequency range of this moving comb filter to reveal the filter's effect. It is more apparent when it is applied to material with a rich harmonic content, and is most obvious when applied to a white noise or similar noise signal. If the frequency response of this effect is plotted on a graph, the trace resembles a comb, and so is called a comb filter.

It is an ancient asana in yoga, predating hatha yoga, and is widely used for meditation in Hindu, Tantra, Jain, and Buddhist traditions. Variations include half lotus, bound lotus, and psychic union pose. Advanced variations of several other asanas including yoga headstand have the legs in lotus or half lotus. The pose can be uncomfortable for people not used to sitting on the floor, and attempts to force the legs into position can injure the knees. Shiva, the meditating ascetic God of Hinduism, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, and the Tirthankaras in Jainism have been depicted in the lotus position, especially in statues. The pose is emblematic of both Buddhist meditation and of yoga, and as such has found a place in Western culture as a symbol of healthy living and well-being.  Etymology and history The flower of the sacred lotus, Nelumbo nucifera, grows out of mud, thus symbolising enlightenment. The name Padmasana is from the Sanskrit ‡§™‡§¶‡•ç‡§Æ Padma, \\"lotus\\" and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®, ƒÄsana, \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". In Asian cultures, the sacred lotus is used as a symbol of growth towards perfection and enlightenment as it is rooted in the mud at the bottom of the pond, but rises and blooms above the water. In Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism, the pose is also called the \\"vajra position\\" (Skt. vajrƒÅsana, Ch. ÈáëÂâõÂ∫ß jƒ´ngƒÅngzu√≤). The pose is ancient and is described, along with other asanas (sitting postures), in the 8th century book Patanjalayogashastravivarana. A figure seated in lotus position on a lotus flower is shown on dinar coins of Chandragupta II, who reigned c. 380‚Äìc. 415 AD. The first tantric text to discuss posture (asana), the 6th-10th century Nisvasattvasamhita Nayasutra (4.11-17, 4.104-106), directs the meditator and \\"user of mantras\\" to sit in lotus or a similar posture. The 15th century Hatha Yoga Pradipika states that the pose destroys all diseases, and that a yogin in the pose who retains the air breathed in through the nadi channels attains liberation.  Position  From sitting cross-legged on the floor in Sukhasana, one foot is placed on top of the opposite thigh with its sole facing upward and heel close to the abdomen. The other foot is then placed on the opposite thigh as symmetrically as possible. The pose requires \\"very open hips\\". It can be modified using a support such as a cushion or blanket; by sitting on its forward edge, the pelvis is tilted forward. Variations In half lotus, ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß ‡§™‡§¶‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∏‡§® (Ardha Padmasana), one leg is bent and resting on the ground, the other leg is bent with the foot in lotus position. It is an easier meditation position than full lotus. In bound lotus, ‡§¨‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§™‡§¶‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∏‡§® (Baddha Padmasana), the practitioner sits in full lotus, and each hand reaches around the back to grasp the opposite foot. For psychic union pose, ‡§Ø‡§ì‡§ó‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§∏‡§®‚Äã (Yogamudrasana), the practitioner bends forward in full lotus, bringing the forehead as close to the floor as possible. The pose is both an asana and a mudra; easier variants begin from Ardha Padmasana or Sukhasana. Variations of several other asanas such as Sirsasana (yoga headstand), Sarvangasana (shoulderstand), Simhasana (lion pose), Matsyasana (fish pose), and Gorakshasana (cowherd pose) have the legs in lotus. Asanas such as Vatayanasana (horse pose) and advanced forms of Ardha Matsyendrasana (half lord of the fishes pose) have one leg as in half lotus.

Attempts to force the legs into lotus pose can injure the knees by squeezing and damaging the medial meniscus cartilage; this is painful and takes a long time to heal. The hip joints must rotate outwards freely approximately 115 degrees to permit full lotus. Students who cannot achieve this much hip rotation may try to compensate by bending the knee joint sideways, risking injury. Safer alternatives include Baddha Konasana (cobbler's pose), provided the knees are not pushed down. The thighs can be encouraged to rotate using hand pressure or a strap. Yoga expert B. K. S. Iyengar notes that people unused to sitting on the floor will initially feel \\"excruciating\\" pain in the knees, but that this subsides with practice, until the pose becomes relaxing, both restful and alert and hence ideal for pranayama. Twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga, such as Iyengar, made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. Iyengar claimed that Padmasana encourages blood circulation in the abdomen and lumbar region, toning the spine and abdominal organs.  In art and culture  =Asian art= In Buddhism, statues of the founder, Gautama Buddha, sometimes depict him seated in lotus position and enthroned on a lotus flower. In Hinduism, statues often depict gods, especially Shiva, meditating in Padmasana. In Jainism, seated Tirthankaras are represented in Lotus posture.

Dresner notes that Bond is mirroring Fleming's own struggles with the pose. The BBC journalist Megan Lane commented in 2003 that since yoga as exercise had become mainstream, lotus position (like tree pose) had been used by advertisers to sell \\"all manner of goods and services.\\" She noted that both \\"healthy living\\" goods such as vitamins, fitness clubs, water filter and probiotic yogurt, and unrelated items such as cars, airlines, financial services \\"and even beer\\" have made use of images of yoga to convey a message of well-being. Poland's Obory Dairy gave its advertising agency the goal of creating awareness of their \\"Jogi\\" yogurt as exclusive and with a positive image. The agency responded with a photograph of two young women meditating in lotus at dawn under the heading \\"Start your day with Jogi\\", the brand name also meaning \\"yoga\\" in Polish.

Originally, \\"Baraita\\" probably referred to teachings from schools outside the main Mishnaic-era academies ‚Äì although in later collections, individual Baraitot are often authored by sages of the Mishna (Tannaim). According to Maimonides (Introduction to Mishneh Torah), the baraitot were compiled by Rabbi Hoshaya and Bar Kappara, although no compilation was passed down to us as the Tosefta was.

These were later compiled in works called the \\"Baraitot\\" ‚Äì often in the form of a list of teachings by one sage. Baraita can thus also designate collections of such traditions. The main collections of Baraita are the Tosefta and the Halakhic Midrashim (Mekhilta, Sifra and Sifre). The authority of the Baraita is somewhat less than that of the Mishnah.

India has several special forces (SF) units. The three branches of the Indian Armed Forces have separate special forces units, viz. the Para SF of the Indian Army, the MARCOS of the Indian Navy and the Garud Commando Force of the Indian Air Force. There are other special forces which are not controlled by the military but operate under civilian organisations such as Home ministry‚Äôs National Security Guard. Small groups from the military SF units are deputed in the Armed Forces Special Operations Division, which has a unified command and control structure. Research and Analysis Wing, the external Intelligence agency of India, has separate special forces under its control, namely the Special Group and the Special Frontier Force. Indian Army =Para (Special Forces)= Para SF soldiers in Ladakh, 2020 The Parachute Regiment (Special Forces), or Para (SF), are the special forces of the Indian Army. This unit was created in June 1966 in the aftermath of the 1965 Indo-Pakistani war. An impromptu commando unit called Meghdoot Force, which took part in the 1965 war, formed the first nucleus of the permanent Para commando battalion which was to be raised under the Parachute Regiment. By 1969, the unit had grown into 2 battalions, viz. the 9 Para and the 10 Para. The unit's first combat missions were conducted during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war in which they undertook raids against Pakistan's military. In 1988, the 3 Para (SF) and 6 Para participated in the first known foreign intervention by the Indian Army during Operation Cactus in Maldives. Operation Cactus was launched to thwart a coup against the government of president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. In the late 1980s, the Para (SF) were deployed in Sri Lanka where they conducted helicopter-borne assaults and security operations. Since the 1990s, the Para (SF) have been deployed on counter-terrorism operations in the Kashmir region against insurgents. These operations include raids and ambushes. In 1999, Para (SF) undertook operations against Pakistan‚Äôs military during the Kargil war which included raids against Pakistani infantry and special forces. In 2002, the 2 Para (SF) participated in Operation Khukri in Sierra Leone to rescue 223 soldiers of the Indian Army's 5/8 Gorkha Rifles who were deployed as UN peacekeepers but were surrounded by militants from the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone. Some of the later reported missions carried out by Para (SF) include the 2016 ‚Ä≤Surgical Strikes‚Ä≤ and the 2015 Operation Hot Pursuit, purportedly undertaken inside Myanmar.

It is the special forces unit of the Indian Navy. Initially, the U.S. Navy SEALs and British special forces trained a few officers of the Indian navy who formed the first core of MARCOS. Months after their creation, MARCOS were deployed in Sri Lanka against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in July 1987. In the 1990s, MARCOS undertook numerous operations such as Operation Tasha (1991) against the LTTE, Operation Zabardust (1992) against a ship that was smuggling arms and in support of the United Nations in Somalia (1993). They also participated in the 1999 Kargil War. Since 1995, MARCOS are permanently deployed for counter-terrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir against militants. MARCOS had participated in efforts against the 2008 Mumbai attacks alongside the National Security Guards but their effectiveness was diluted due to bureaucratic indecision. MARCOS have also been deployed in anti-piracy operations. After a 10 week long basic training, MARCOS are sent to train alongside Indian Army‚Äôs Para commandos for 3 weeks. Advanced training follows, during which MARCOS learn skills such as sky-diving, weapons training, counter-insurgency, languages and warfare in different terrains, among other things. Each MARCOS squad, called Prahar, is composed of 8 soldiers. Some of the responsibilities of MARCOS are- * Providing support to Amphibious operations. * Special surveillance and reconnaissance operations. * Clandestine operations inside hostile territory, including diving operations and raids. * Counter-terrorism operations. Indian Air Force =Garud Commando Force= The Garud commandos are the special forces of the Indian Air Force (IAF).

First conceived in 2002, this unit was officially established on February 6, 2004.Garud Commandos. All Garuds are volunteers who are imparted a 52-week basic training, which includes a three-month probation followed by special operations training, basic airborne training and other warfare and survival skills. The last phase of basic training sees Garuds been deployed to get combat experience. Advanced training follows, which includes specialised weapons training.Garud Commandos para-dropping at Exercise Iron Fist on Pokhran in 2013. The mandated tasks of the Garuds include direct action, special reconnaissance, rescuing downed pilots in hostile territory, establishing airbases in hostile territory and providing air-traffic control to these airbases. The Garuds also undertake suppression of enemy air defences and the destruction of other enemy assets such as radars, evaluation of the outcomes of Indian airstrikes and use laser designators to guide Indian airstrikes. The security of IAF installations and assets are usually performed by the Air Force Police and the Defence Security Corps even though some critical assets are protected by the Garuds.

Slash-and-burn agriculture, also called fire-fallow cultivation, is a farming method that involves the cutting and burning of plants in a forest or woodland to create a field called a swidden. The method begins by cutting down the trees and woody plants in an area. The downed vegetation, or \\"slash\\", is then left to dry, usually right before the rainiest part of the year. Then, the biomass is burned, resulting in a nutrient-rich layer of ash which makes the soil fertile, as well as temporarily eliminating weed and pest species. After about three to five years, the plot's productivity decreases due to depletion of nutrients along with weed and pest invasion, causing the farmers to abandon the field and move over to a new area. The time it takes for a swidden to recover depends on the location and can be as little as five years to more than twenty years, after which the plot can be slashed and burned again, repeating the cycle. In India, the practice is known as jhum or jhoom. Slash-and-burn can be part of shifting cultivation, an agricultural system in which farmers routinely move from one cultivable area to another. It may also be part of transhumance, the moving of livestock between seasons. A rough estimate is that 200 million to 500 million people worldwide use slash-and-burn. In 2004, it was estimated that in Brazil alone, 500,000 small farmers each cleared an average of one hectare (2.47105 acres) of forest per year. The technique is not scalable or sustainable for large human populations. Methods such as Inga alley cropping and slash-and- char have been proposed as alternatives which would cause less environmental degradation. A similar term is assarting, which is the clearing of forests, usually (but not always) for the purpose of agriculture. Assarting does not include burning. History Historically, slash-and-burn cultivation has been practiced throughout much of the world, in grasslands as well as woodlands. During the Neolithic Revolution, which included agricultural advancements, groups of hunter-gatherers domesticated various plants and animals, permitting them to settle down and practice agriculture, which provides more nutrition per hectare than hunting and gathering. This happened in the river valleys of Egypt and Mesopotamia. Due to this decrease in food from hunting, as human populations increased, agriculture became more important. Some groups could easily plant their crops in open fields along river valleys, but others had forests blocking their farming land. In this context, humans used slash-and- burn agriculture to clear more land to make it suitable for plants and animals. Thus, since Neolithic times, slash-and-burn techniques have been widely used for converting forests into crop fields and pasture.Jaime Awe, Maya Cities and Sacred Caves, Cu bola Books (2006) Fire was used before the Neolithic as well, and by hunter-gatherers up to present times. Clearings created by the fire were made for many reasons, such as to draw game animals and to promote certain kinds of edible plants such as berries. Slash-and-burn fields are typically used and owned by a family until the soil is exhausted. At this point the ownership rights are abandoned, the family clears a new field, and trees and shrubs are permitted to grow on the former field. After a few decades, another family or clan may then use the land and claim usufructuary rights. In such a system there is typically no market in farmland, so land is not bought or sold on the open market and land rights are traditional. In slash-and-burn agriculture, forests are typically cut months before a dry season. The \\"slash\\" is permitted to dry and then burned in the following dry season. The resulting ash fertilizes the soil and the burned field is then planted at the beginning of the next rainy season with crops such as upland rice, maize, cassava, or other staples. Most of this work is typically done by hand, using such basic tools such as machetes, axes, hoes, and makeshift shovels. Old American civilizations, like the Inca, Maya and Aztecs, also used this agricultural technique. Sometimes, the flames spread and caused forest fires which would lead to loss of life (both wild animals and human beings). Large families or clans wandering in the lush woodlands long continued to be the most common form of society through human prehistory. Axes to fell trees and sickles for harvesting grain were the only tools people might bring with them. All other tools were made from materials they found at the site, such as fire stakes of birch, long rods (Vanko), and harrows made of spruce tops. The extended family conquered the lush virgin forest, burned and cultivated their carefully selected swidden plots, sowed one or more crops, and then proceeded on to forests that had been noted in their wanderings. In the temperate zone, the forest regenerated in the course of a lifetime. So swidden was repeated several times in the same area over the years. But in the tropics the forest floor gradually depleted. It was not only in the moors, as in Northern Europe, but also in the steppe, Savannah, prairie, pampas and barren desert in tropical areas where shifting cultivation is the oldest type of farming. Cultivation is similar to slash-and-burn. (Clark 1952 91‚Äì107).Clark J.G.D. 1952, Farming: Clearance and Cultivation II Prehistoric Europe: The Economic Basis, Cambridge. In Sweden the practice is known as svedjebruk. Historical references Painting by Eero J√§rnefelt of forest- burning Southern European Mediterranean climates have favored evergreen and deciduous forests. With slash-and-burn agriculture, this type of forest was less able to regenerate than those north of the Alps. Although in northern Europe one crop was usually harvested before grass was allowed to grow, in southern Europe it was more common to exhaust the soil by farming it for several years. Classical authors mentioned large forests,Semple E.C.1931, Ancient Mediterranean Forests and the Lumber Trade, vol. II., p. 261-296. Henry Holt et al., The Geography of the Mediterranean Region, New York. with Homer writing about \\"wooded Samothrace\\", Zakynthos, Sicily, and other woodlands.Homer, e.g., Iliad XIII.11‚Äì13, Odyssey IX.22‚Äì24. These authors indicated that the Mediterranean area once had more forest; much had already been lost, and the remainder was primarily in the mountains.Darby, H.C., 1950, Domesday Woodland II Economic History Review, 2d ser.,III, London; Darby, H.C., 1956, The clearing of the Woodland in Europe II, p 186. Although parts of Europe aside from the north remained wooded, by the late Iron Age and early Viking Ages, forests were drastically reduced and settlements regularly moved. The reasons for this pattern of mobility, the transition to stable settlements from the late Viking period on, or the transition from shifting cultivation to stationary farming are unknown. From this period, plows are found in graves. Early agricultural peoples preferred good forests on hillsides with good drainage, and traces of cattle enclosures are evident there. In Italy, shifting cultivation was a thing of the past by the common era. Tacitus describes it as a strange cultivation method, practiced by the Germans. In 98 CE, he wrote about the Germans that their fields were proportional to the participating cultivators but their crops were shared according to status. Distribution was simple, because of wide availability; they changed fields annually, with much to spare because they were producing grain rather than other crops. A W Liljenstrand wrote 1857 in his doctoral dissertation, \\"About Changing of Soil\\" (pp. 5 ff.), that Tacitus discusses shifting cultivation: \\"arva per annos mutant\\".Perkins and Marvin, Ex Editione Oberliniana, Harvard College Library, 1840 (Xxvi, 15‚Äì23).Arenander E.O. 1923, Germanemas jordbrukskultur ornkring Kristif√òdelse // Berattelse over Det Nordiska Arkeologmotet i Stockholm 1922, Stockholm. This is the practice of shifting cultivation. During the Migration Period in Europe, after the Roman Empire and before the Viking Age, the peoples of Central Europe moved to new forests after exhausting old parcels. Forests were quickly exhausted; the practice had ended in the Mediterranean, where forests were less resilient than the sturdier coniferous forests of Central Europe. Deforestation had been partially caused by burning to create pasture. Reduced timber delivery led to higher prices and more stone construction in the Roman Empire (Stewart 1956, p. 123).Stewart O.C. 1956, Fire as the First Great Force Employed by Man, II. Thomas W.L. Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth, Chicago. Although forests gradually decreased in northern Europe, they have survived in the Nordic countries. Tribes in pre-Roman Italy (including the Etruscans, Umbrians, Ligurians, Sabines, Latins, Campanians, Apulians, Saliscans, and Sabellians) apparently lived in temporary locations. They cultivated small patches of land, kept sheep and cattle, traded with foreign merchants, and occasionally fought. These Italic groups developed identities as settlers and warriors around 900 BCE. They built forts in the mountains which are studied today, as are the ruins of a large Samnite temple and theater at Pietrabbondante. Many Italic peoples saw benefits in allying with Rome. When the Romans built the Via Amerina in 241 BCE, the Falisci settled in cities on the plains and aided the Romans in road construction; the Roman Senate gradually acquired representatives from Faliscan and Etruscan families, and the Italic tribes became settled farmers. Classical writers described peoples who practiced shifting cultivation, which characterized the Migration Period in Europe. The exploitation of forests demanded displacement as areas were deforested. Julius Caesar wrote about the Suebi in Commentarii de Bello Gallico 4.1, \\"They have no private and secluded fields (\\"privati ac separati agri apud eos nihil est\\") ... They cannot stay more than one year in a place for cultivation‚Äôs sake\\" (\\"neque longius anno remanere uno in loco colendi causa licet\\"). The Suebi lived between the Rhine and the Elbe. About the Germani, Caesar wrote: \\"No one has a particular field or area for himself, for the magistrates and chiefs give year by year to the people and the clans, who have gathered together, as much land and in such places as seem good to them and then make them move on after a year\\" (\\"Neque quisquam agri modum certum aut fines habet proprios, sed magistratus ac principes in annos singulos gentibus cognationibusque hominum, qui tum una coierunt, a quantum et quo loco visum est agri attribuunt atque anno post alio transire cogunt\\" [Book 6.22]). Strabo (63 BCE‚Äîc. 20 CE) also writes about the Suebi in his Geography (VII, 1, 3): \\"Common to all the people in this area is that they can easily change residence because of their sordid way of life; they do not cultivate fields or collect property, but live in temporary huts. They get their nourishment from their livestock for the most part, and like nomads, pack all their goods in wagons and go on to wherever they want\\". Horace writes in 17 BCE (Carmen Saeculare, 3, 24, 9ff.) about the people of Macedonia: \\"The proud Getae also live happily, growing free food and cereal for themselves on land they do not want to cultivate for more than a year\\" (\\"Vivunt et rigidi Getae, / immetata quibus iugera liberas / fruges et Cererem ferunt, / nec cultura placet longior annua\\"). Locations of Norwegian tribes described by Jordanes in his Getica Jordanes, of Gothic descent, became a monk in Italy. In his mid-sixth-century CE Getica (De origine actibusque Getarum; The Origin and Deeds of the Goths),G. Costa, 32. Also: De Rebus Geticis: O. Seyffert, 329; De Getarum (Gothorum) Origine et Rebus Gestis: W. Smith, vol 2 page 607 he described the large island of Scandza, on which the Goths originated. According to Jordanes, of the tribes living there, some are Adogit from within 40 days of the midnight sun. After the Adogit were the Screrefennae and Suehans, who also lived in the north. The Screrefennae did not raise crops, instead hunting and collecting bird eggs. The Suehans, a semi-nomadic tribe with good horses (comparable to the Thuringii), hunted furs to sell; grain could not be grown so far north. In about 550 CE, Procopius also described a primitive hunting people he called \\"Skrithifinoi\\": \\"Both men and women engaged incessantly just in hunting the rich forests and mountains, which gave them an endless supply of game and wild animals.\\" Slash-and-burn in Sm√•land, Sweden (1904) The use of fire in northeastern Sweden changed as agriculture evolved. Although the Sami people did not burn land (since burning killed the lichen required by their reindeer), later farmers frequently used slash-and-burn techniques. The 19th- century Swedish timber industry moved north, clearing the land of trees but leaving waste behind as a fire risk; during the 1870s, fires were frequent. There was a fire in Norrland in 1851, followed by fires in 1868 and 1878; two towns were lost in 1888. =Forest Finns= Huuhta cultivation spread: within the circle in 1500 CE, within the line in 1600, and to the dashed line in 1700. One culture which flourished in pre-agricultural Europe survives: the Forest Finns in Scandinavia. Martin Tvengsberg, a descendant of the Forest Finns, studied them in his capacity as curator of the Hedmark Museum in Norway.Svedjebruk.Hedmark 2010.Foreword by Ragnhild Queseth Haarstad Styreleder i Norsk Skogfinsk Museum. . The Savo-Karelians had a sophisticated system for cultivating spruce forests. A runic poem about Finland's spruce forests reads, \\"G√•ivu on mehdien valgoinen valhe\\" (\\"The birch is the forest‚Äôs white lie\\"). The best spruce forests reportedly contain birch trees, which grow only after a forest has burned once or twice. =Modern Western world= Slash-and-burn may be defined as the large-scale deforestation of forests for agricultural use. Ashes from the trees help farmers by providing nutrients for the soil. In industrialized regions, including Europe and North America, the practice was abandoned with the introduction of market agriculture and land ownership. Slash-and-burn agriculture was initially practiced by European pioneers in North America such as Daniel Boone and his family, who cleared land in the Appalachian Mountains during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. However, land cleared by slash-and-burn farmers was eventually taken over by systems of land tenure focusing on long-term improvement and discouraging practices associated with slash-and-burn agriculture.  Northern European heritage  Telkk√§m√§ki Heritage Farm in Finland, some areas are still burned annually. Telkk√§m√§ki Nature Reserve in Kaavi, Finland, is an open-air museum which still practices slash-and-burn agriculture. Farm visitors can see how people farmed when slash-and-burn agriculture became the norm in the Northern Savonian region of eastern Finland beginning in the 15th century. Areas of the reserve are burnt each year. =South Asia= Tribal groups in the northeastern Indian states of Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland and the Bangladeshi districts of Rangamati, Khagrachari, Bandarban and Sylhet refer to slash-and- burn agriculture as jhum or jhoom cultivation. The system involves clearing land, by fire or clear-felling, for economically-important crops such as upland rice, vegetables or fruits. After a few cycles, the land's fertility declines and a new area is chosen. Jhum cultivation is most often practiced on the slopes of thickly-forested hills. Cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the land, burning the trees and grasses for fresh soil. Although it is believed that this helps fertilize the land, it can leave it vulnerable to erosion. Holes are made for the seeds of crops such as sticky rice, maize, eggplant and cucumber are planted. After considering jhums effects, the government of Mizoram has introduced a policy to end the method in the state. Slash-and-burn is typically a type of subsistence agriculture, not focused on a need to sell crops globally; planting decisions are governed by the needs of the family (or clan) for the coming year.Tony Waters, The Persistence of Subsistence Agriculture.

The remains of German town of Wesel after intensive Allied area bombing in 1945 near the end of World War II (a destruction percentage of 97% of all buildings). The aerial bombing of cities in warfare is an optional element of strategic bombing which became widespread during World War I. The bombing of cities grew to a vast scale in World War II, and is still practiced today. The development of aerial bombardment marked an increased capacity of armed forces to deliver ordnance from the air against combatants, military bases, and factories, with a greatly reduced risk to its ground forces. Civilian and non-combatant casualties in bombed cities have variously been a purposeful result of the bombings, or unavoidable collateral damage depending on intent and technology. A number of multilateral efforts have been made to restrict the use of aerial bombardment so as to protect non- combatants. Before World War I =Kites= Incendiary kites were first used in warfare by the Chinese.The Strange and Violent History of Kites, Haaretz, Noa Manheim, 28 June 2018 During the Song dynasty the Fire Crow, a kite carrying incendiary powder, a fuse, and a burning stick of incense was developed as a weapon.China Reconstructs, Volume 33, 1984 Walter de Milemete's 1326 De nobilitatibus, sapientiis, et prudentiis regum treatise depicts a group of knights flying kite laden with a black-powder filled firebomb over the wall of city. In the 17th century, the forces of Thai king Phetracha tied gunpowder barrels to kites used for airborne assault. =Venice 1849= In 1849, Austrian forces besieging Venice launched some 200 incendiary balloons, each carrying a 24- to 30-pound bomb that was to be dropped from the balloon with a time fuse over the besieged city. The balloons were launched from land and from the Austrian navy ship SMS Vulcano that acted as a balloon carrier. =Italian Invasion of Libya= The first ever air raid was conducted during the Italo-Turkish War by Italian forces against the Ottoman province of Libya on November 1, 1911. Giulio Gavotti dropped 1.5 kg of bombs on Ain Zara, a village 8 km west of the capital Tripoli. =Balkan War= Adrianople (presently Edirne) was bombed by Bulgaria in 1912 in the First Balkan War. Historically, it was the first bombardment of a city from a heavier-than-air aircraft. In the morning of 29 October 1912 at 9:30 a.m. the plane Albatros F-3 took off from an airfield near the village of Mustafa Pasha ‚Äì present day Svilengrad, Bulgaria. The pilot was captain Radul Mikov with spotter and bombardier Prodan Tarakchiev. The airfield was specially created to carry out the take off and landing. According to the report weather conditions were perfect. The flight lasted for 1 hour and 20 minutes and the altitude was 500m. During the flight the crew flew over the city of Edirne, discovered hidden Ottoman forces in the nearby villages and flew towards to city railroad station, near the village of Karaagach. The plane was equipped with two bombs, which were released at 10:00 am over the station. The crew landed successfully at the airfield with 4 holes on the hull. A number of journalists and military attach√©s attended the site. =Mexican Revolution= In May 1914, during the revolution of 1910‚Äì17, General Venustiano Carranza, later president, ordered a biplane to bomb Neveria Hill adjacent to the downtown area of Mazatl√°n in order to take the city. The bomb landed not on target but in a city street and in the process killed four civilians, including a French diplomat, and wounded several others. World War I German airship Sch√ºtte Lanz SL2 bombing Warsaw in 1914. The first civilian target to be bombed from the air was the Belgian city of Antwerp. This city, at that moment the National Redoubt of Belgium, was bombed during the night of 24‚Äì25 August 1914. Instead of targeting the surrounding fortresses, the Zeppelin LZ 25's intention was to bomb the clearly distinguishable historical centre of the city. The zeppelin dropped approximately ten bombs, killing ten people and injuring forty. The British Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914 and 8 October, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in Cologne and D√ºsseldorf. The aeroplanes carried twenty-pound bombs, and at least one airship was destroyed. On 19 January 1915 two German Zeppelins dropped 24 fifty-kilogram (110 lb) high-explosive bombs and ineffective three- kilogram incendiaries on the English towns of Great Yarmouth, Sheringham, King's Lynn, and the surrounding villages; in all, four people were killed, 16 injured, and monetary damage was estimated at ¬£7,740. Ward's Book of Days. Pages of interesting anniversaries. What happened on this day in history. 19 January. On this day in history in 1915, German zeppelins bombed Britain . London was bombed for the first time on 30 May 1915. In July 1916, the German government allowed directed raids against urban centers, sparking 23 airship raids in 1916 in which 125 tons of ordnance were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691. Gradually British air defenses improved and the Germans also introduced large bomber aircraft for bombing Britain. In 1917 and 1918 there were only eleven Zeppelin raids against England, and the final raid occurred on 5 August 1918, which resulted in the death of KK Peter Strasser, commander of the German Naval Airship Department. By the end of the war, 51 raids had been undertaken, in which 5,806 bombs were dropped, killing 557 people and injuring 1,358. In the course of the Zeppelin raids the Germans lost more than half their airships and 40% of their crew. It has been argued that the raids were effective far beyond material damage inflicted, in diverting and hampering wartime production, and diverting twelve squadrons and over 10,000 men to air defenses. The British developed an Independent Force of long-range bombers that could bomb Berlin, but the war ended before these raids began. After the war, bombers' increasing sophistication led to the general belief that aerial bombing would both destroy cities and be impossible to stop; as Stanley Baldwin stated in a 1932 speech, \\"The bomber will always get through\\".  Interbellum period  =Iraqi revolt against the British= After World War I, there were protests in Iraq against continued British rule. Many Iraqis across a wide spectrum of opinion opposed the British Mandate for Iraq. The Iraqi revolt against the British began, with peaceful demonstrations in May 1920. Initial demands were rejected by the British administration, and fighting broke out in June 1920. This was suppressed, with many deaths, and at very high costs to the Empire. A policy of 'aerial policing', an invention of Winston Churchill's was brought in. This amounted to bombing restive civilians, followed up by pacification by ground troops. This continued up to the mid 1920s. The aerial campaign included Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet, who commanded a Vickers Vernon squadron engaged in the bombing and strafing of recalcitrant civilians. Harris felt that the Arab civilians required this kind of \\"heavy hand\\" treatment. =Somaliland Campaign= Following the end of World War I, the British stepped up their efforts in their war against the Somali Dervish movement, led by the so-called \\"Mad Mullah\\", whom they had been fighting for the control the area formerly known as British Somaliland. However, they had been unable to defeat the Dervish movement for nearly 25 years. In January 1920, the British launched a combined aerial and land attack, bombarding Taleeh, the capital of the revolt. The Somaliland Campaign has been described as one of the bloodiest and longest-running conflicts in the history of sub-Saharan Africa and the Somali forces are noted for concurrently repelling the invading British, Italian and Abyssinian forces for a period of 25 years. = Tulsa race riot = In the United States during the Tulsa race riot of May 31 ‚Äì June 1, 1921, private aircraft flown by white men dropped kerosene bombs on the Greenwood neighborhood. =Cristero War= During the Cristero War in Mexico in 1929, Irish pilot and mercenary Patrick Murphy mistakenly dropped several improvised \\"suitcase bombs\\" on the border town of Naco, Arizona, while bombing government forces in the adjacent town of Naco, Sonora, for the Cristero revolutionaries. The bombing, which caused damage to many buildings and injured several bystanders on the American side of the international border, became the first aerial bombardment of the Continental United States by a foreign power in American history. =Second Italo-Abyssinian War= The Italians used aircraft against the Ethiopian cities in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. For example, in February 1936, the Italian invasion forces in the south prepared for a major thrust towards the city of Harar. On 22 March, the Regia Aeronautica bombed Harar and Jijiga as a prelude. Both cities were reduced to ruins even though Harar had been declared an \\"open city\\".Barker, A. J., \\"The Rape of Ethiopia 1936, p. 112 =Spanish Civil War= During the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalists under Francisco Franco made extensive use of aerial bombing on civilian targets. Nazi Germany gave aircraft to Franco to support the overthrow of the Spanish Republican government. The first major example of this came in November 1936, when German and Spanish aircraft bombed Republican-held Madrid; this bombardment was sustained throughout the Siege of Madrid. Barcelona and Valencia were also targeted in this way. On 26 April 1937, the German Luftwaffe (Condor Legion) bombed the Spanish city of Guernica carrying out the most high-profile aerial attack of the war. This act caused worldwide revulsion and was the subject of a famous painting by Picasso, but by the standards of bombings during World War II, casualties were fairly minor (estimates ranging from 500 to 1,500). Shortly after, the front-page headlines of the Diario de Almeria, dated June 3, 1937, referred to the press in London and Paris carrying the news of the \\"criminal bombardment of Almeria by German planes\\".Abella, Rafael La vida cotidiana durante la guerra civil: la Espa√±a republicana. p. 254 Editorial Planeta 1975 Barcelona was bombarded for three days beginning on 16 March 1938, at the height of the Spanish Civil War. Under the command of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Italian aircraft stationed on the island of Majorca attacked 13 times dropping 44 tons of bombs, aimed at the civil population. The medieval Cathedral of Barcelona suffered bomb damage and more than one thousand people died, including many children. The number of people injured is estimated to be in the thousands. Many others Spanish towns and cities were bombed by the German Legion Condor and the Italian Aviazione Legionaria among them Jaen, Durango, Granollers and Alicante. The Spanish Republican government also used aerial bombings, but not as extensively, as they did not have as many planes available. Cities like Valladolid, Granada, Sevilla, Zaragoza or Burgos were bombarded, killing some people. The biggest aerial attack against civil population was in Cabra, a small town away from the war front, and with no strategic value, that was bombed due to an error. 109 people were killed and more than 200 wounded. Planes coming from Barcelona launched three bombs against the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar on August 3rd, 1936. The bombs failed to detonate, but did damage one of the cupolas painted by Goya. The fact was considered a miracle, as, if the bombs bad exploded, the eastern half of the Cathedral would have been completely destroyed. =Second Sino-Japanese War= air raid in Chongqing (Chungking). During the Manchurian Incident of 1931, the Japanese widely used airplanes to indiscriminately bomb key targets and cities, such as Mukden. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service, in conjunction with the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, began relentlessly bombing Shanghai, Beijing (Peking), Tianjin (Tientsin) and several cities on the Chinese coast from the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. The bombing campaigns on Nanking and Canton which started in September 1937 evoked protests from the Western powers culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the League of Nations. An example of the many expressions of indignation came from Lord Cranborne, the British Under- Secretary of State For Foreign Affairs: > Words cannot express the feelings of profound horror with which the news of > these raids had been received by the whole civilized world. They are often > directed against places far from the actual area of hostilities. The > military objective, where it exists, seems to take a completely second > place. The main object seems to be to inspire terror by the indiscriminate > slaughter of civilians ... World War II =European Theater= A raid by the 8th Air Force on the Focke Wulf factory at Marienburg, Germany (1943). V-2 bombing at Battersea, London, 27 January 1945. Apollo company industrial plant in Bratislava (Slovakia) in September 1944. At the beginning of World War II, bombing of cities prior to invasion was an integral part of Nazi Germany's strategy. In the first stages of war, the Germans carried out many bombings of towns and cities in Poland (1939), including the capital Warsaw (also bombed in 1944), with Wielu≈Ñ being the first city destroyed by 75%. The Soviet Union also attempted strategic bombing against Poland and Finland, bombing Helsinki. Germany began aerial bombing of British cities immediately after the British declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, while the first British bombing raids against Germany were on the night of 15/16 May of 1940, with 78 bombers against oil targets, 9 against steelworks and 9 against marshalling yards, all military and industrial targets in the German hinterland.Ellis, Major L.F., \\"The War In France And Flanders 1939‚Äì1940\\" Oil remained the main British objective until the summer of 1941, although German cities and towns were regularly bombed from May 1940. Previous raids had been carried out by the RAF, but when targets were not found, the bombers returned without making an attack. After the Fall of France, the Luftwaffe redirected its full attention to the United Kingdom. The scale of the attack increased greatly in July 1940, with 258 civilians killed, and again in August with 1,075 dead.Overy, Richard, \\"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality\\", p. 91 During the night of 25 August, British bombers raided targets in and around Greater Berlin for the first time, in response to the misdirected bombing of Oxford Street and the West End by the Luftwaffe while it was bombing the London docks. On 4 September 1940 Hitler, frustrated by the RAF's superiority over the Luftwaffe and enraged by its bombing of German cities, decided to retaliate by bombing London and other cities in the UK. On 7 September the Luftwaffe began massed attacks on London. The bombing campaign was known in the UK as \\"the Blitz\\", and ran from September 1940 through to May 1941. The Coventry Blitz and the Belfast Blitz were two of the heaviest of all bombings by the Luftwaffe, killing 568‚Äì1,000 civilians of Coventry, killing over 1,100 civilians in Belfast, and destroying much of both city centres. British bombing policy evolved during the war. In the beginning, the RAF was forbidden to attack urban targets in Germany due to the risk of accidental civilian casualties.Cox, Sebastian, \\"The Strategic Air War Against Germany, 1939‚Äì1945\\", pp. 1, 2 Following a German attack on military targets in the Orkney Islands on 16 March 1940 that killed a civilian, the RAF mounted an attack on the seaplane base on the island of Sylt.Terraine, John, \\"The Right of the Line\\", p. 112 The RAF began attacking transport targets west of the Rhine on the night of 10 May following the German invasion of the Low Countries, and military targets in the rest of Germany after the bombing of Rotterdam.Ellis, p. 57 On 9 September 1940 RAF crews were instructed that due to the \\"indiscriminate\\" nature of German bombing, if they failed to find their assigned targets they were to attack targets of opportunity rather than bring their bombs home.Cox p. 4 On the 15/16 December the RAF carried out its first area bombing attack (destroying 45% of the city of Mannheim), officially in response to the raid on Coventry.Terraine p. 268 In 1942, the goals of the British attacks were defined: the primary goal was the so-called \\"morale bombing\\", to weaken the will of the civil population to resist. Following this directive intensive bombing of highly populated city centers and working class quarters started. On 30 May 1942, the RAF Bomber Command launched the first \\"1,000 bomber raid\\" when 1,046 aircraft bombed Cologne in Operation Millennium, dropping over 2,000 tons of high explosive and incendiaries on the medieval town and burning it from end to end. 411 civilians and 85 combatants were killed, more than 130,000 had to leave the city. Two further 1,000 bomber raids were executed over Essen and Bremen, but to less effect than the destruction at Cologne. The effects of the massive raids using a combination of blockbuster bombs and incendiaries created firestorms in some cites. The most extreme examples were caused by the bombing of Hamburg in Operation Gomorrah (45,000 dead), and the bombings of Kassel (10,000 dead), Darmstadt (12,500 dead), Pforzheim (21,200 dead), Swinemuende (23,000 dead), and Dresden (25,000 dead). The Allies also bombed urban areas in the other countries, including occupied France (Caen) and the major industrial cities of northern Italy, like Milan and Turin. Some cities were bombed at the different times by the Luftwaffe and the Allies, for example Belgrade in Yugoslavia and Bucharest in Romania. The Luftwaffe also bombed cities in the Soviet Union, destroying Stalingrad in a massive air raid at the start of the Battle of Stalingrad and bombing Leningrad during the siege of the city of 1941‚Äì1943. The Soviet bombing of the German cities was limited in comparison with the RAF bombing (destruction caused by the Soviet army was mainly due to the land artillery). The Soviet Air Force also bombed Budapest in Hungary. =Asiatic-Pacific Theater= Nagasaki before and after bombing. In the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, Japan continued to bomb Chinese cities and expanded its air operations towards others in Asia such as Singapore, Rangoon, and Mandalay. In the first few months of the war with the Western Powers, Japan projected its airpower on settlements as distant as Honolulu, Darwin, and Unalaska. The capture of the Mariana Islands in 1944 enabled the United States Army Air Forces to reach the Japanese home islands using the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The U.S. firebombed Tokyo on the night of March 9‚Äì10, 1945, and killed more than 100,000 people in the deadliest conventional bombing in history, known as Operation Meetinghouse. In a few hours, 100,000 people who were in Tokyo including civilians died either by the bombing or the conflagration that followed the bombing by 325 B-29's night attacks. The bombing was meant to burn wooden buildings and indeed the bombing caused fire that created a 50 m/s wind that is comparable to tornadoes. A total of 381,300 bombs amounting to 1783 tons, were used in the bombing. After the successful Operation Meetinghouse raid, the USAAF went on to firebomb other Japanese cities in effort to pulverize the Japanese war industry and shatter Japanese civilian morale. From March to August 1945, the U.S. firebombing of 67 Japanese cities had killed 350,000 civilians. In addition, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed 120,000 people.Media Monitors Network. Lessons from Japan for the US occupation of Iraq by Yusuf Al-Khabbaz (2 September 2004)  Since World War II  =Korean War= During the Korean War of 1950‚Äì1953, U.S.-led UN air forces heavily bombed the cities in North Korea and the North-occupied South Korea, including their respective capital cities. There were also plans to use nuclear weapons against North Korea and the People's Republic of China. =Vietnam War= From 1965 to 1968, during the Vietnam War, the United States Air Force conducted an aerial campaign known as Operation Rolling Thunder. The campaign began with interdiction of supply lines in rural areas of southern North Vietnam but incrementally spread northward throughout the country. In 1966, restrictions against bombing the capital city of Hanoi and the country's largest port, Haiphong, were lifted, and they were bombed by the USAF and Navy. The bombing of the city centers continued to be prohibited.Released by the Office of the Historian. Foreign Relations, 1964‚Äì1968, Volume V, Vietnam 1967, Documents 222‚Äì239 , Policy Decisions and the McNamara and Clifford- Taylor Missions to South Vietnam June‚ÄìAugust, United States State Department. Accessed 22 May 2008 However, the South Vietnamese cities seized by the communists were bombed, including the former capital of Hu·∫ø during the 1968 Tet Offensive. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force bombed contested cities in South Vietnam in 1968, 1972 and 1975, while the Vietnam People's Air Force attacked Southern cities (including the capital city of Saigon) in 1975. =Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict= The Lebanese capital of Beirut was attacked by the Israeli aircraft during the Siege of Beirut in 1982, and during the 2006 Lebanon War (using guided munitions). Israeli cities were bombed by Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian aircraft during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the Six-Day War. The bombing included attacks on some of Israel's largest cities, such as Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa. Israel also conducted air strikes targeting Palestinian targets during the Second Intifada, including against Hamas in Gaza. =Wars in Afghanistan= In March 1979, in response to an uprising, the Khalq-control army of Democratic Republic of Afghanistan carpet-bombed the Afghanistan's third-largest city of Herat, causing massive destructionUrban, Mark (1990). War in Afghanistan. London: Palgrave MacMillan. p. 30. .] and some 5,000 to 25,000 deaths. Herat was also repeatedly bombed during the following Soviet involvement in the Afghan civil war. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S.-led coalition attacked the urban targets in Afghanistan using mainly precision-guided munitions (or \\"smart bombs\\"). The United States government maintains that it has a policy of striking only significant combatant targets while doing all possible to avoid what it terms \\"collateral damage\\" to civilians and non-combatants during the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. =Iran‚ÄìIraq War= 200px Saddam Hussein's Iraq attacked civilian targets in Iranian cities in the War of the Cities during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in the 1980s, with Iranians retaliating in kind (both sides soon switched to ballistic missile attacks). Iraqi aircraft also bombed the Iraqi Kurdistan city of Halabjain 1988 with conventional and chemical weapons in 1988, killing more than 5,000 people in the largest aerial poison gas attack in history. = Somalia's campaign against Isaaq = thumbAftermath of the Somali government's attack on Hargeisa, 90 percent of the city was destroyed Somaliland: Time for African Union Leadership In 1988 Somali Air Force aircraft conducted intense aerial bombardment of major Isaaq cities targeting civilian Isaaqs during its campaign against Somali National Movement in the north of the country. Civilians were also strafed by Somali Air Force aircraft as they were fleeing the aerial bombardment. The artillery shelling and aerial bombardment caused the deaths of estimated 50,000‚Äì200,000 Isaaq civilians, as well as the complete destruction of Somalia's second and third largest cities. It also caused up to 500,000 Somalis (primarily of the Isaaq clan) p. 10 to flee and cross the border into Hartasheikh in Ethiopia as refugees in what was described as \\"one of the fastest and largest forced movements of people recorded in Africa\\", and resulted in the creation of the world's largest refugee camp then (1988), with another 400,000 being internally displaced. The scale of destruction led to Hargeisa being known as the 'Dresden of Africa'. =Gulf War= The Iraqi Air Force attacked Kuwait City in 1990 and bombed their own cities during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, targeting civilians with the use of bomb-carrying helicopters (use of airplanes was banned by the Coalition as part of the ceasefire agreement that ended hostilities of the Gulf War but not the war itself). UN-led coalition aircraft attacked targets in Iraqi cities, including in the capital Baghdad and the largest southern city of Basra during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. =Yugoslav wars= At the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars, in Croatia (1991), the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) carried out aerial bombing of Dubrovnik and Vukovar. NATO's aerial bombing of FR Yugoslavia in 1999, an answer to the Yugoslav campaign of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, included targeted aerial bombing throughout Serbia, notably of targets in Belgrade, Novi Sad and Ni≈°. In addition to military casualties, there were at least 500 civilian casualties. Despite the NATO campaign appearing to violate NATO's charter, the UNSC rebutted the case on March 24 and March 26, 1999. In addition to purely military targets NATO targeted the national power grid (leaving many cities in the dark), water purification plants, oil refineries, fertilizer factories, and a petrochemical plant in Pancevo. The 78-day bombing campaign is assessed as having been an 'economic catastrophe', cutting the Yugoslav economy in half. =Chechen wars= Post-Soviet Russia heavily bombed the Chechen capital of Grozny from the air with mostly unguided munitions (including fuel-air explosives) as well as bombarding it with a massive artillery barrages (1994‚Äì1995, 1996 and 1999‚Äì2000), killing thousands of people (some estimates say 27,000 civilians were killed during the 1994‚Äì1995 siege alone) including civilians during the First and Second Chechen Wars. Although the Russian pilots and soldiers were ordered to attack designated targets only, such as the Presidential Palace, due to their inexperience and lack of training, Russian soldiers and pilots bombed and shelled random targets inside the city. In 2003, the UN still called Grozny the most destroyed city on earth.Scars remain amid Chechen revival , BBC News, 3 March 2007 =Iraq War= In 2003 Invasion of Iraq, the U.S.-led coalition aircraft again bombed Iraq, including the Shock and Awe campaign of precision bombing of government targets in the city centers. From 2003 to 2011 and 2014 to 2018, coalition aircraft attacked Iraqi insurgent targets, including in urban locations like Najaf, Fallujah, Mosul, Basra, and Baghdad. There are frequent reports of civilian casualties, though it is often hard to distinguish guerrillas and civilians. =Syria= Syrian MiG-23s bombed the city of Aleppo on 24 July 2012, the first use of aerial bombing in the Syrian Civil War. Over the course of the war, the Syrian government has dropped tens of thousands of bombs, mostly unguided barrel bombs, on the cities of Aleppo, Damascus, Homs, Hama,https://web.archive.org/web/20140201220129/http://www.eurasiareview.com/22012014-assads- forces-shell-barrel-bomb-rebels-across-syria-despite-geneva-ii-peace-talks/ Deir ez-Zor, Hasakah, Daraa, Darayya, and Al-Bab. =Other conflicts= Budapest was attacked by intense Soviet air strikes in 1956 during the Hungarian Revolution. A year before, on 16 June 1955, Casa Rosada, the Argentine government seat at Buenos Aires, was the target of four waves of fighter-bombers during a military uprising to overthrow Juan Peron. Fourteen- tons of bombs scattered on a wide area, killing hundreds of civilian passers- by as well as 11 soldiers. In 2008, the cities of Tskhinvali and Gori were hit by the Georgian and Russian aircraft during the war in Georgia.Russia/Georgia: Investigate Civilian Deaths: High Toll from Attacks on Populated Areas , Human Rights Watch, 14 August 2008 International law A memorial for victims of aerial bombing in Karlsruhe, Germany. The cenotaph at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Air warfare, theoretically, must comply with laws and customs of war, including international humanitarian law by protecting the victims of the conflict and refraining from attacks on protected persons. These restraints on aerial warfare are covered by the general laws of war, because unlike war on land and at sea ‚Äì which are specifically covered by rules such as the 1907 Hague Convention and Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions, which contain pertinent restrictions, prohibitions and guidelines ‚Äì there are no treaties specific to aerial warfare. To be legal, aerial operations must comply with the principles of humanitarian law: military necessity, distinction, and proportionality: An attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a legitimate military objective, and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.

It is a term introduced by philosopher Joseph Levine. In the 1983 paper in which he first used the term, he used as an example the sentence, \\"Pain is the firing of C fibers\\", pointing out that while it might be valid in a physiological sense, it does not help us to understand how pain feels. The explanatory gap has vexed and intrigued philosophers and AI researchers alike for decades and caused considerable debate. Bridging this gap (that is, finding a satisfying mechanistic explanation for experience and qualia) is known as \\"the hard problem\\".David Chalmers, Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness, JCS, 2 (3), 1995 , pp. 200-19. To take an example of a phenomenon in which there is no gap, a modern computer's behavior can be adequately explained by its physical components alone, such as its circuitry and software. In contrast, it is thought by many mind-body dualists (e.g. Ren√© Descartes, David Chalmers) that subjective conscious experience constitutes a separate effect that demands another cause that is either outside the physical world (dualism) or due to an as yet unknown physical phenomenon (see for instance quantum mind, indirect realism). Proponents of dualism claim that the mind is substantially and qualitatively different from the brain and that the existence of something metaphysically extra-physical is required to \\"fill the gap\\". Similarly, some argue that there are further facts‚Äîfacts that do not follow logically from the physical facts of the world‚Äîabout conscious experience. For example, they argue that what it is like to experience seeing red does not follow logically from the physical facts of the world.  Implications  The nature of the explanatory gap has been the subject of some debate. For example, some consider it to simply be a limit on our current explanatory ability.Dennett, D. C. 1991. Consciousness Explained. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. They argue that future findings in neuroscience or future work from philosophers could close the gap. However, others have taken a stronger position and argued that the gap is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities as humans‚Äîno amount of further information will allow us to close it.McGinn, C. 1989. ‚ÄúCan we solve the mind-body problem?‚Äù Mind, 98: 349-66 There has also been no consensus regarding what metaphysical conclusions the existence of the gap provides. Those wishing to use its existence to support dualism have often taken the position that an epistemic gap‚Äîparticularly if it is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities‚Äînecessarily entails a metaphysical gap.Chalmers, D. 1996. The Conscious Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Levine and others have wished to either remain silent on the matter or argue that no such metaphysical conclusion should be drawn.Levine, J. 1983. ‚ÄúMaterialism and qualia: the explanatory gap‚Äù. Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 64: 354-361. He agrees that conceivability (as used in the Zombie and inverted spectrum arguments) is flawed as a means of establishing metaphysical realities; but he points out that even if we come to the metaphysical conclusion that qualia are physical, they still present an explanatory problem. > While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not > suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability > considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the > body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical > properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the > mental in terms of the physical.J.

Kaszniak and David > Chalmers (eds.), Towards a Science of Consciousness III: The Third Tucson > Discussions and Debates, The MIT Press, 1999,. pp 3-12. However, such an epistemological or explanatory problem might indicate an underlying metaphysical issue‚Äîthe non-physicality of qualia, even if not proven by conceivability arguments is far from ruled out. > In the end, we are right back where we started. The explanatory gap argument > doesn't demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of > nature. Of course a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our > understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature. But so > long as we have countervailing reasons for doubting the latter, we have to > look elsewhere for an explanation of the former. At the core of the problem, according to Levine, is our lack of understanding of what it means for a qualitative experience to be fully comprehended. He emphasizes that we don't even know to what extent it is appropriate to inquire into the nature of this kind of experience. He uses the laws of gravity as an example, which laws seem to explain gravity completely yet do not account for the gravitational constant. Similarly to the way in which gravity appears to be an inexplicable brute fact of nature, the case of qualia may be one in which we are either lacking essential information or in which we're exploring a natural phenomenon that simply is not further apprehensible. Levine suggests that, as qualitative experience of a physical or functional state may simply be such a brute fact, perhaps we should consider whether or not it is really necessary to find a more complete explanation of qualitative experience. Levine points out that the solution to the problem of understanding how much there is to be known about qualitative experience seems even more difficult because we also lack a way to articulate what it means for actualities to be knowable in the manner that he has in mind. He does conclude that there are good reasons why we wish for a more complete explanation of qualitative experiences. One very significant reason is that consciousness appears to only manifest where mentality is demonstrated in physical systems that are quite highly organized. This, of course, may be indicative of a human capacity for reasoning that is no more than the result of organized functions. Levine expresses that it seems counterintuitive to accept this implication that the human brain, so highly organized as it is, could be no more than a routine executor. He notes that although, at minimum, Materialism appears to entail reducibility of anything that is not physically primary to an explanation of its dependence on a mechanism that can be described in terms of physical fundamentals, that kind of reductionism doesn't attempt to reduce psychology to physical science. However, it still entails that there are inexplicable classes of facts which are not treated as relevant to statements pertinent to psychology.

Engineers used the process well into the 20th century as a simple and low-cost process to produce copies of drawings, referred to as blueprints. The process uses two chemicals: ferric ammonium citrate and potassium ferricyanide. History The English scientist and astronomer Sir John Herschel discovered the procedure in 1842. Though the process was developed by Herschel, he considered it as mainly a means of reproducing notes and diagrams, as in blueprints. Anna Atkins created a series of cyanotype limited-edition books that documented ferns and other plant life from her extensive seaweed collection, placing specimens directly onto coated paper and allowing the action of light to create a silhouette effect. By using this photogram process, Anna Atkins is sometimes considered the first female photographer. Cyanotype photography was popular in Victorian England, but became less popular as photography improved. Another proponent of the craft was Washington Teasdale from Leeds. Numerous contemporary artists employ the cyanotype process in their art: Christian Marclay, Marco Breuer, Kate Cordsen and John Dugdale. Process Cyanotype postcard, Racine, Wis., c. 1910 In a typical procedure, equal volumes of an 8.1% (w/v) solution of potassium ferricyanide and a 20% solution of ferric ammonium citrate are mixed. The overall contrast of the sensitizer solution can be increased with the addition of approximately 6 drops of 1% (w/v) solution potassium dichromate for every 2 ml of sensitizer solution. This mildly photosensitive solution is then applied to a receptive surface (such as paper or cloth) and allowed to dry in a dark place. Cyanotypes can be printed on any surface capable of soaking up the iron solution. Although watercolor paper is a preferred medium, cotton, wool and even gelatin sizing on nonporous surfaces have been used. Care should be taken to avoid alkaline-buffered papers, which degrade the image over time. Prints can be made from large format negatives and lithography film, digital negative or everyday objects can be used to make photograms. A positive image can be produced by exposing it to a source of ultraviolet light (such as sunlight) as a contact print through the negative (traditionally, semitransparent paper) or objects. The combination of UV light and the citrate reduces the iron(III) to iron(II). This is followed by a complex reaction of the iron(II) complex with ferricyanide. The result is an insoluble, blue dye (ferric ferrocyanide) known as Prussian blue. The extent of color change depends on the amount of UV light, but acceptable results are usually obtained after 10‚Äì20 minute exposures on a dark, gloomy day. After exposure, developing of the picture involves the yellow unreacted iron solution being rinsed off with running water. Although the blue color darkens upon drying, the effect can be accelerated by soaking the print in a 6% (v/v) solution of 3% (household) hydrogen peroxide. The water-soluble iron(III) salts are washed away, while the non-water-soluble Prussian blue remains in the paper. This is what gives the picture its typical blue color. The highlight values should appear overexposed, as the water wash reduces the final print values. Toning In a cyanotype, a blue is usually the desired color; however, there are a variety of effects that can be achieved. These fall into three categories: reducing, intensifying, and toning. * Bleaching is the process of decreasing the intensity of the blue. Sodium carbonate, ammonia, Clorox, TSP, borax, Dektol and other chemicals can be used to do this. A good easily obtained reducer is bleach, though it destroys the paper base. How much and how long to bleach depends on the image content, emulsion thickness and what kind of toning is being used. When using a bleaching agent it is important to pull the cyanotype out of the weak solution and put the cyanotype into a water bath to arrest the bleaching process and prevent the loss of detail in the highlights. * Intensifying is the strengthening of the blue effect. These chemicals can also be used to expedite the oxidation process the cyanotype undergoes. These chemicals are hydrogen peroxide, citric acid, lemon juice, and vinegar. * Toning is the process used to change the color of the iron in the print cyanotype. The color change varies with the reagent used. There are a variety of elements that can be used, including tannic acid, oolong tea, wine, cat urine, and pyrogallic acid.  Long-term preservation  In contrast to most historical and present-day processes, cyanotype prints do not react well to basic environments. As a result, it is not advised to store or present the print in chemically buffered museum board, as this makes the image fade. Another unusual characteristic of the cyanotype is its regenerative behavior: prints that have faded due to prolonged exposure to light can often be significantly restored to their original tone by simply temporarily storing them in a dark environment. Cyanotypes on cloth are permanent but must be washed by hand with non-phosphate soap so as to not turn the cyan to yellow. Large cyanotypes There have been some very large cyanotypes. One of these is 276.64 m (2977.72 ft), created by Stefanos Tsakiris (Greece) in Thessaloniki, Greece, on 18 September 2017.* Prior to that, the largest cyanotype was created on 26 May 2016 in Lyon, France at the IUT Lyon 1 La Doua.

A rack of audio compressors in a recording studio.

Dynamic range compression (DRC) or simply compression is an audio signal processing operation that reduces the volume of loud sounds or amplifies quiet sounds thus reducing or compressing an audio signal's dynamic range. Compression is commonly used in sound recording and reproduction, broadcasting, live sound reinforcement and in some instrument amplifiers. A dedicated electronic hardware unit or audio software that applies compression is called a compressor. In the 2000s, compressors became available as software plugins that run in digital audio workstation software. In recorded and live music, compression parameters may be adjusted to change the way they affect sounds. Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A limiter is a compressor with a high ratio and, generally, a short attack time.  Types  Downward compression reduces loud sounds over a certain threshold while quiet sounds remain unaffected. A limiter is an extreme type of downward compression. Upward compression increases the loudness of sounds below a certain threshold while leaving louder sounds unaffected. Both downward and upward compression reduce the dynamic range of an audio signal. An expander increases the dynamic range of the audio signal. Expanders are generally used to make quiet sounds even quieter by reducing the level of an audio signal that falls below a set threshold level. A noise gate is a type of expander.  Design  A feed-forward compressor design (left) and feedback design (right) The signal entering a compressor is split; one copy is sent to a variable-gain amplifier and the other to a side-chain where the signal level is measured and a circuit controlled by the measured signal level applies the required gain to the amplifier. This design, known as a feed-forward type, is used today in most compressors. Earlier designs were based on a feedback layout where the signal level was measured after the amplifier. There are a number of technologies used for variable-gain amplification, each having different advantages and disadvantages. Vacuum tubes are used in a configuration called variable-mu where the grid-to-cathode voltage changes to alter the gain. Optical compressors use a photoresistor and a small lamp (incandescent, LED, or electroluminescent panel) to create changes in signal gain. Other technologies used include field effect transistors and a diode bridge. When working with digital audio, digital signal processing techniques are commonly used to implement compression as audio plug-ins, in mixing consoles, and in digital audio workstations. Often the algorithms used emulate the above analog technologies.  Controls and features  Different compression ratios for a signal level above the threshold A number of user-adjustable control parameters and features are used to adjust dynamic range compression signal processing algorithms and components. = Threshold = A compressor reduces the level of an audio signal if its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. Threshold is commonly set in decibels (dBFS for digital compressors and dBu for hardware compressors), where a lower threshold (e.g. -60 dB) means a larger portion of the signal is treated. When the signal level is below the threshold, no processing is performed and the input signal is passed, unmodified, to the output. Thus a higher threshold of, e.g., ‚àí5 dB, results in less processing, less compression. Threshold timing behavior is subject to attack and release settings (see below). When the signal level goes above threshold, compressor operation is delayed by the attack setting. For an amount of time determined by the release after the input signal has fallen below the threshold, the compressor continues to apply dynamic range compression. = Ratio = The amount of gain reduction is determined by ratio: a ratio of 4:1 means that if input level is 4 dB over the threshold, the output signal level is reduced to 1 dB over the threshold. The gain and output level has been reduced by 3 dB. The highest ratio of ‚àû:1 is often known as limiting. It is commonly achieved using a ratio of 60:1, and effectively denotes that any signal above the threshold is brought down to the threshold level once the attack time has expired. = Attack and release = The attack and release phases in a compressor A compressor may provide a degree of control over how quickly it acts. The attack is the period when the compressor is decreasing gain in response to increased level at the input to reach the gain determined by the ratio. The release is the period when the compressor is increasing gain in response to reduced level at the input to reach the output gain determined by the ratio, or, to unity, once the input level has fallen below the threshold. Because the loudness pattern of the source material is modified by the time-varying operation of compressor, it may change the character of the signal in subtle to quite noticeable ways depending on the attack and release settings used. The length of each period is determined by the rate of change and the required change in gain. For more intuitive operation, a compressor's attack and release controls are labeled as a unit of time (often milliseconds). This is the amount of time it takes for the gain to change a set amount of dB or a set percentage towards the target gain. There is no industry standard for the exact meaning of these time parameters. In many compressors, the attack and release times are adjustable by the user. Some compressors, however, have the attack and release times determined by the circuit design and cannot be adjusted. Sometimes the attack and release times are automatic or program dependent, meaning that the behavior may change depending on the input signal. = Soft and hard knees = Hard Knee and Soft Knee compression Another control a compressor might offer is hard knee or soft knee selection. This controls whether the bend in the response curve between below threshold and above threshold is abrupt (hard) or gradual (soft). A soft knee slowly increases the compression ratio as the level increases and eventually reaches the compression ratio set by the user. A soft knee reduces the potentially audible transition from uncompressed to compressed, and is especially applicable for higher ratio settings where the changeover at the threshold would be more noticeable. = Peak vs RMS sensing = A peak-sensing compressor responds to the peak level of the input signal. While providing tighter peak level control, peak level sensing does not necessarily relate to human perception of loudness. Some compressors apply a power measurement function (commonly root mean square or RMS) on the input signal before comparing its level to the threshold. This produces a more relaxed compression that more closely relates to human perception of loudness. = Stereo linking = A compressor in stereo linking mode applies the same amount of gain reduction to both the left and right channels. This is done to prevent image shifting that can occur if each channel is compressed individually. This becomes particularly noticeable when a loud element that is panned to either edge of the stereo field raises the level of the program to the compressor's threshold, causing its image to shift toward the center of the stereo field. Stereo linking can be achieved in two ways: The compressor uses the sum of the left and right inputs to produce a single measurement that drives the compressor; or, the compressor calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels as one might wish to have less compression for left-side events). = Make-up gain = Because a downward compressor only reduces the level of the signal, the ability to add a fixed amount of make-up gain at the output is usually provided so that an optimum output level is produced. = Look-ahead = The look-ahead function is designed to overcome the problem of being forced to compromise between slow attack rates that produce smooth-sounding gain changes, and fast attack rates capable of catching transients. Look-ahead is implemented by splitting the input signal and delaying one side by the look-ahead time. The non-delayed side is used to drive the compression of the delayed signal, which then appears at the output. This way a smooth-sounding slower attack rate can be used to catch transients. The cost of this solution is added audio latency through the processor.  Uses  = Public spaces = Compression is often applied in audio systems for restaurants, retail, and similar public environments that play background music at a relatively low volume and need it compressed, not just to keep the volume fairly constant, but also to make quiet parts of the music audible over ambient noise. Compression can increase average output gain of a power amplifier by 50 to 100% with a reduced dynamic range. For paging and evacuation systems, this adds clarity under noisy circumstances and saves on the number of amplifiers required. = Music production = Compression is often used in music production to make performances more consistent in dynamic range so that they \\"sit\\" in the mix of other instruments. Vocal performances in rock music or pop music are compressed to improve clarity and to make them stand out from the surrounding instruments. Compression can also be used on instrument sounds to create effects not primarily focused on boosting loudness. For instance, drum and cymbal sounds tend to decay quickly, but a compressor can make the sound appear to have a more sustained tail. Guitar sounds are often compressed to produce a fuller, more sustained sound. Most devices capable of compressing audio dynamics can also be used to reduce the volume of one audio source when another audio source reaches a certain level; this is called side-chaining. In electronic dance music, side-chaining is often used on basslines, controlled by the kick drum or a similar percussive trigger, to prevent the two from conflicting, and provide a pulsating, rhythmic dynamic to the sound. = Voice = A compressor can be used to reduce sibilance ('ess' sounds) in vocals (de- essing) by feeding the compressor or its side-chain with an equalized version of the input signal, so that only those frequencies activate the compressor. If unchecked, sibilance can cause distortion even at moderate levels. Compression is used in voice communications in amateur radio that employ single-sideband (SSB) modulation to make a particular station's signal more readable to a distant station, or to make one's station's transmitted signal stand out against others. This is applicable especially in DXing. An SSB signal's strength depends on the level of modulation. A compressor increases the average level of the modulation signal thus increasing the transmitted signal strength. Most modern amateur radio SSB transceivers have speech compressors built-in. Compression is also used in land mobile radio, especially in transmitted audio of professional walkie-talkies and remote control dispatch consoles. = Broadcasting = Compression is used extensively in broadcasting to boost the perceived volume of sound while reducing the dynamic range of source audio. To avoid overmodulation, broadcasters in most countries have legal limits on instantaneous peak volume they may broadcast. Normally these limits are met by permanently inserted compression hardware in the on-air chain. Broadcasters use compressors in order that their station sounds louder than comparable stations. The effect is to make the more heavily compressed station jump out at the listener at a given volume setting. This is not limited to inter-channel differences; they also exist between programme material within the same channel. Loudness differences are a frequent source of audience complaints, especially TV commercials and promos that seem too loud. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has been addressing this issue in the EBU PLOUD group, which consists of over 240 audio professionals, many from broadcasters and equipment manufacturers. In 2010, the EBU published EBU R 128 which introduces a new way of metering and normalizing audio. The Recommendation uses ITU-R BS.1770 loudness metering. , several European TV stations have announced their support for the new norm and over 20 manufacturers have announced products supporting the new EBU Mode loudness meters. To help audio engineers understand what loudness range their material consists of (e.g. to check if some compression may be needed to fit it into the channel of a specific delivery platform), the EBU also introduced the Loudness Range (LRA) descriptor. = Marketing = Most television commercials are heavily compressed (typically to a dynamic range of no more than 3 dB) to achieve near-maximum perceived loudness while staying within permissible limits. This causes a problem that TV viewers often notice: when a station switches from minimally compressed program material to a heavily compressed commercial, the volume sometimes seems to increase dramatically. Peak loudness might be the same‚Äîmeeting the letter of the law‚Äîbut high compression puts much more of the audio in the commercial at close to the maximum allowable, making the commercial seem much louder. = Over-usage = Something\\" by The Beatles mastered on CD four times since 1983. Record companies, mixing engineers and mastering engineers have been gradually increasing the overall volume of commercial albums. The greater loudness is achieved by using higher degrees of compression and limiting during mixing and mastering; compression algorithms have been engineered specifically to accomplish the task of maximizing audio level in the digital stream. Hard limiting or clipping can result, affecting the tone and timbre of the music. The effort to increase loudness has been referred to as the loudness war. = Other uses = Some applications use a compressor to reduce the dynamic range of a signal for transmission, expanding it afterward. This reduces the effects of a channel with limited dynamic range. See Companding and Noise reduction system. Bass amplifiers and keyboard amplifiers often include compression circuitry to prevent sudden high-wattage peaks that could damage the speakers. Electric bass players often use compression effects, either effects units available in pedal, rackmount units, or built-in devices in bass amps, to even out the sound levels of their basslines. Gain pumping, where a regular amplitude peak (such as a kick drum) causes the rest of the mix to change in volume due to the compressor, is generally avoided in music production. However, many dance and hip-hop musicians purposefully use this phenomenon, causing the mix to alter in volume rhythmically in time with the beat. Hearing aids use a compressor to bring the audio volume into the listener's hearing range. To help the patient perceive the direction sound comes from, some hearing aids use binaural compression. Compressors are also used for hearing protection in some electronic \\"active sound protection\\" earmuffs and earplugs, to let sounds at ordinary volumes be heard normally while attenuating louder sounds, possibly also amplifying softer sounds. This allows, for example, shooters wearing hearing protection at a shooting range to converse normally, while sharply attenuating the much louder sounds of the gunshots, and similarly for musicians to hear quiet music but be protected from loud noises such as drums or cymbal crashes. In applications of machine learning where an algorithm is training on audio samples, dynamic range compression is a way to augment samples for a larger data set.  Limiting  Limiting and clipping compared. Note that clipping introduces a large amount of distortion whereas limiting only introduces a small amount while keeping the signal within the threshold. Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A limiter is a compressor with a high ratio and, generally, a fast attack time. Compression with ratio of 10:1 or more is generally considered limiting. Brick wall limiting has a very high ratio and a very fast attack time. Ideally, this ensures that an audio signal never exceeds the amplitude of the threshold. Ratios of 20:1 all the way up to ‚àû:1 are considered 'brick wall'. The sonic results of more than momentary and infrequent hard/brick-wall limiting are harsh and unpleasant, thus it is more common as a safety device in live sound and broadcast applications. Some bass amps and PA system amplifiers include limiters to prevent sudden volume peaks from causing distortion and/or damaging the speakers. Some modern consumer electronics devices incorporate limiters. Sony uses the automatic volume limiter system (AVLS), on some audio products and the PlayStation Portable.  Side-chaining  The sidechain of a feed-forward compressor A compressor with a side-chain input controls gain from main input to output based on the level of the signal at the side-chain input. The compressor behaves in the conventional manner when both inputs are supplied with the same signal. The side-chain input is used by disc jockeys for ducking ‚Äì lowering the music volume automatically when speaking. The DJ's microphone signal is routed to the side-chain input so that whenever the DJ speaks the compressor reduces the volume of the music. A sidechain with equalization controls can be used to reduce the volume of signals that have a strong spectral content within a certain frequency range: it can act as a de- esser, reducing the level of vocal sibilance in the range of 6‚Äì9 kHz. A de- esser helps reduce high frequencies that tend to overdrive preemphasized media (such as phonograph records and FM radio). Another use of the side-chain in music production serves to maintain a loud bass track without the bass drum causing undue peaks that result in loss of overall headroom. Parallel compression One technique is to insert the compressor in a parallel signal path. This is known as parallel compression, a form of upward compression that facilitates dynamic control without significant audible side effects, if the ratio is relatively low and the compressor's sound is relatively neutral. On the other hand, a high compression ratio with significant audible artifacts can be chosen in one of the two parallel signal paths‚Äîthis is used by some concert mixers and recording engineers as an artistic effect called New York compression or Motown compression. Combining a linear signal with a compressor and then reducing the output gain of the compression chain results in low- level detail enhancement without any peak reduction (since the compressor significantly adds to the combined gain at low levels only). This is often beneficial when compressing transient content, since it maintains high-level dynamic liveliness, despite reducing the overall dynamic range.   Multiband compressors can act differently on different frequency bands. The advantage of multiband compression over full-bandwidth compression is that unneeded audible gain changes or \\"pumping\\" in other frequency bands is not caused by changing signal levels in a single frequency band. Multiband compressors work by first splitting the signal through some number of band- pass filters or crossover filters. The frequency ranges or crossover frequencies may be adjustable. Each split signal then passes through its own compressor and is independently adjustable for threshold, ratio, attack, and release. The signals are then recombined and an additional limiting circuit may be employed to ensure that the combined effects do not create unwanted peak levels. Software plug-ins or DSP emulations of multiband compressors can be complex, with many bands, and require corresponding computing power. Multiband compressors are primarily an audio mastering tool, but their inclusion in digital audio workstation plug-in sets is increasing their use among mix engineers. On-air signal chains of radio stations commonly use hardware multiband compressors to increase apparent loudness without fear of overmodulation. Having a louder sound is often considered an advantage in commercial competition. However, adjusting a radio station's multiband output compressor requires some artistic sense of style, plenty of time, and good ears. This is because the constantly changing spectral balance between audio bands may have an equalizing effect on the output, by dynamically modifying the on-air frequency response. A further development of this approach is programmable radio output processing, where the parameters of the multiband compressor automatically change between different settings according to the current program block style or the time of day. Serial compression Serial compression is a technique used in sound recording and mixing. Serial compression is achieved by using two fairly different compressors in a signal chain. One compressor generally stabilizes the dynamic range while the other aggressively compresses stronger peaks. This is the normal internal signal routing in common combination devices marketed as compressor-limiters, where an RMS compressor (for general gain control) is followed by a fast peak sensing limiter (for overload protection). Done properly, even heavy serial compression can sound natural in a way not possible with a single compressor. It is most often used to even out erratic vocals and guitars.  Software audio players  Some software audio players support plugins that implement compression. These can increase perceived volume of audio tracks, or even out the volume of highly-variable music (such as classical music, or a playlist that spans multiple music types). This improves listenability of audio played through poor-quality speakers, or when played in noisy environments (such as in a car or during a party). Such software may also be used in micro- broadcasting or home-based audio mastering.  Objective influence on the signal  In an article released in January 2014 by the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, Emmanuel Deruty and Damien Tardieu performed a systematic study describing the influence of compressors and brickwall limiters on the musical audio signal. The experiment involved four software limiters: Waves L2, Sonnox Oxford Limiter, Thomas Mundt‚Äôs Loudmax, Blue Cat‚Äôs Protector,as well as four software compressors: Waves H-Comp, Sonnox Oxford Dynamics, Sonalksis SV-3157, and URS 1970. The study provides objective data on what limiters and compressors do to the audio signal. Five signal descriptors were considered: RMS power, EBU3341/R128 integrated loudness, crest factor, EBU3342 LRA, and density of clipped samples. RMS power accounts for the signal's physical level, EBU3341 loudness for the perceived level. The crest factor, which is the difference between the signal's peak and its average power, is on occasions considered as a basis for the measure of micro-dynamics, for instance in the TT Dynamic Range Meter plug-in. Finally, EBU3342 LRA has been repeatedly considered as a measure of macro-dynamics or dynamics in the musical sense. = Limiters = The tested limiters had the following influence on the signal: * increase of RMS power, * increase of EBU3341 loudness, * decrease of crest factor, * decrease of EBU3342 LRA, but only for high amounts of limiting, * increase of clipped sample density. In other words, limiters increase both physical and perceptual levels, increase the density of clipped samples, decrease the crest factor and decrease macro- dynamics (LRA) given that the amount of limiting is substantial. = Compressors = As far as the compressors are concerned, the authors performed two processing sessions, using a fast attack (0.5 ms) in one case, and a slow attack (50 ms) in the other. Make-up gain is deactivated, but the resulting file is normalized. Set with a fast attack, the tested compressors had the following influence on the signal: * slight increase of RMS power, * slight increase of EBU3341 loudness, * decrease of crest factor, * decrease of EBU3342 LRA, * slight decrease of clipped sample density. In other words, fast-attack compressors increase both physical and perceptual levels, but only slightly. They decrease the density of clipped samples, and decrease both crest factor and macro-dynamics. Set with a slow attack, the tested compressors had the following influence on the signal: * decrease of RMS power, * decrease of EBU3341 loudness, * no influence on crest factor, * decrease of EBU3342 LRA, * no influence on clipped sample density. In other words, slow-attack compressors decrease both physical and perceptual levels, decrease macro-dynamics, but have no influence on crest factor and clipped sample density.

It is notable for having chicks that have claws on two of their wing digits. It is the only member of the genus Opisthocomus (Ancient Greek: \\"long hair behind\\", referring to its large crest). This is the only extant genus in the family Opisthocomidae. The taxonomic position of this family has been greatly debated by specialists, and is still far from clear. Description At Lake Sandoval, Peru The hoatzin is pheasant-sized, with a total length of , and a long neck and small head. It has an unfeathered blue face with maroon eyes, and its head is topped by a spiky, rufous crest. The long, sooty-brown tail is a broadly tipped buff. The upper parts are dark, sooty-brown-edged buff on the wing coverts, and streaked buff on the mantle and nape. The under parts are buff, while the crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca), primaries, underwing coverts and flanks are rich rufous-chestnut, but this is mainly visible when it opens its wings. The hoatzin is an herbivore, eating leaves and fruit, and has an unusual digestive system with an enlarged crop used for fermentation of vegetable matter, in a manner broadly analogous to the digestive system of mammalian ruminants. The alternative name of \\"stinkbird\\" is derived from the bird's foul odour, which is caused by the fermentation of food in its digestive system. This is a noisy species, with a variety of hoarse calls, including groans, croaks, hisses and grunts. These calls are often associated with body movements, such as wing spreading. Taxonomy, systematics and evolution In Brazil The hoatzin was originally described in 1776 by German zoologist Statius M√ºller. There has been much debate about the hoatzin's relationships with other birds. Because of its distinctness it has been given its own family, the Opisthocomidae, and its own suborder, the Opisthocomi. At various times, it has been allied with such taxa as the tinamous, the Galliformes (gamebirds), the rails, the bustards, seriemas, sandgrouse, doves, turacos and other Cuculiformes, and mousebirds. A whole genome sequencing study published in 2012 places the hoatzin as the sister taxon of a clade composed of Gruiformes (cranes) and Charadriiformes (plovers). In 2015, genetic research indicated that the hoatzin is the last surviving member of a bird line that branched off in its own direction 64 million years ago, shortly after the extinction event that killed the non- avian dinosaurs.New study rearranges family tree of birds =History of the debate= Historical placement as gamebirds is based mainly on phenetic considerations of external morphology, which are considered unreliable and generally dismissed today; the gamebirds together with the waterfowl are classified as Galloanserae whereas the hoatzin are not. However, cuckoos have zygodactyl feet (two toes forward, two backward) and turacos are semi- zygodactylous, whereas the hoatzin has the more typical anisodactyl foot with three toes forward, one backwards. The evolution of avian dactyly, on the other hand, is not entirely resolved to satisfaction. Sibley and Ahlquist in 1990 considered the hoatzin likely to be a basal cuckoo based on DNA-DNA hybridization. Avise et al. in 1994 found mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data to agree with Sibley and Ahlquist's previous treatment. Subsequently, Hughes and Baker in 1999 proclaimed to have \\"resolved\\" the relationships of the hoatzin to be with turacos, based on their own analysis of 6 sets of mtDNA and one of nDNA sequences. Group of five in Peru Using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences of increased length, Sorenson et al. in 2003 noted that all three previous DNA studies were apparently flawed due to errors in methodology, small sample size, and sequencing errors; their study strongly suggested against a close relationship between the hoatzin and cuckoos or turacos. It was not possible, though, to reliably determine the hoatzin's closest living relatives. Even though it tended to group with doves, this was not at all well-supported, with little more than 10% likelihood at best that such an arrangement was accurate according to Sorenson et al.'s analysis. Supplementary Material Fain and Houde in 2004 proposed a dichotomy in the Neoaves (neognaths excluding fowl) based on Œ≤-fibrinogen intron 7 (FGB-int7) sequences. In their suggested phylogeny, the hoatzin was a basal member of the Metaves, a proposed clade that would include many other historically problematic bird families, such as flamingos, grebes, tropicbirds, sandgrouse and mesites. While the doves did also group with the \\"Metaves\\", no close relationship between these and the hoatzin within Metaves was recovered. While the other major neoavian lineage, Coronaves, largely agreed in its internal phylogeny with what is currently emerging as consensus,e.g. that there is a major clade of \\"near passerines\\" and that the Charadriiformes are quite distinct. the interrelationships of the \\"Metaves\\" were not resolvable. Nor do supposed metavian groupings like flamingos and nightjars or tropicbirds and hummingbirds seem to have a factual basis rather than being artifactually grouped based on molecular homoplasies or lack of informative characters within the group, as Fain and Houde originally suggested; Metaves instead may be a \\"wastebasket taxon\\". It seems probable that the taxa included in the Metaves by Fain and Houde contain some good clades, such as Caprimulgiformes, the Mirandornithes, or the Apodiformes. Considering that some \\"odd Gruiformes\\" which might be each other's closest living relatives make up most of the remaining Metaves, the doves, the hoatzin, and sandgrouse would remain as \\"Metaves incerta sedis\\" (Metaves with uncertain placement). This would seem to suggest that the hoatzin is at least more closely related to doves than to many of the other purported 'coronavian' families that previously have been suggested. Subsequent multigene studies of Ericson et al. 2006 and of Hackett et al. 2008 corroborated the Metaves clades, dependent on the inclusion of one and two genes respectively, but the latter did not recover the hoatzin with Metaves. More recently, Houde embarked on sequencing the entire genome of the hoatzin. As of 2011, it was reported that more than 1.4 billion base pairs of hoatzin DNA had been sequenced, roughly equal to its entire haploid genome, but that only about 2.4% of its genome had yet been assembled. Completion of this project would be welcomed for more reasons than resolution of hoatzin relationships. Out of the diverse Class Aves, the genomes of no more than 4 species of birds including of the waterfowl/fowl and songbirds have been sequenced. Moreover, much might be learned by coordinating these efforts with that of the metagenomic analysis of the hoatzin foregut ruminant bacterial microflora.\\"Why Sequence Hoatzin crop microbiome\\" US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute web page Retrieved 2017-Nov-08. =Fossil record= The newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger enabling it to dexterously climb tree branches until its wings are strong enough for sustained flight. These claws disappear by the time the bird reaches adulthood. With respect to other material evidence, an undisputed fossil record of a close hoatzin relative is specimen UCMP 42823, a single cranium backside. It is of Miocene originOriginally believed to be of Late Miocene age ‚Äì some 10‚Äì5 million years old ‚Äì, the bone was found in association with fossils of the monkey Cebupitheca sarmientoi that today, usually is considered of Early or Middle Miocene, possibly 18 but at least some 12 million years of age. and was recovered in the upper Magdalena River Valley, Colombia in the well known fauna of La Venta. This has been placed into a distinct, less derived genus, Hoazinoides, but clearly would be placed into the same family as the extant species. It markedly differs in that the cranium of the living hoatzin is characteristic, being much domed, rounded, and shortened, and that these autapomorphies were less pronounced in the Miocene bird. Miller discussed these findings in the light of the supposed affiliation of the hoatzins and the Galliformes, which was the favored hypothesis at that time, but had been controversial almost since its inception. He cautioned, however, \\"that Hoazinoides by no means establishes a phyletic junction point with other galliforms\\" for obvious reasons, as we know today. Anything other than the primary findings of Miller are not to be expected in any case, as by the time of Hoazinoides, essentially all modern bird families are either known or believed to have been present and distinct. Going further back in time, the Late Eocene or Early Oligocene (some 34 million years ago) Filholornis from France has also been considered \\"proof\\" of a link between the hoatzin and the gamebirds. The fragmentary fossil Onychopteryx from the Eocene of Argentina and the quite complete but no less enigmatic Early-Middle Eocene (Ypresian- Lutetian, some 48 million years ago) Foro panarium are sometimes used to argue for a hoatzin-cuculiform (including turacos) link. But as demonstrated above, this must be considered highly speculative, if not as badly off the mark as the relationship with Cracidae discussed by Miller. The earliest record of the order Opisthocomiformes is Protoazin parisiensis, from the latest Eocene (approximately 34 mya) of Romainville, France. The holotype and only known specimen is NMB PG.70, consisting of partial coracoid, partial scapula, and partial pedal phalanx. According to the phylogenetic analysis performed by the authors, Namibiavis, although later, is more basal than Protoazin. Opisthocomiforms seem to have been much more widespread in the past, with the present South American distribution being only a relic. By the Early to Middle Miocene, they were probably extinct in Europe already, as formations dated to this time and representing fluvial or lacustrine palaeoenvironments, in which the hoatzin thrives today, have yielded dozens of bird specimens, but no opisthocomiform. A possible explanation to account for the extinction of Protoazin between the Late Eocene and the Early Miocene in Europe, and of Namibiavis after the Middle Miocene of Sub-Saharan Africa is the arrival of arboreal carnivorans, predation by which could have had a devastating effect on the local opisthocomiforms, if they were as poor flyers and had similarly vulnerable nesting strategies as today's hoatzins. Felids and viverrids first arrived in Europe from Asia after the Turgai Sea closed, marking the boundary between the Eocene and the Oligocene. None of these predators, and for the matter, no placental predator at all was present in South America before the Great American Interchange 3 mya, which could explain the survival of the hoatzin there. In addition to being the earliest fossil record of an opisthocomiform, Protoazin was also the earliest find of one (1912), but it was forgotten for more than a century, being described only in 2014. Hoazinavis is an extinct genus of early opisthocomiform from Late Oligocene and Early Miocene (about 24‚Äì22 mya) deposits of Brazil. It was collected in 2008 from the Trememb√© Formation of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. It was first named by Gerald Mayr, Herculano Alvarenga and C√©cile Mourer-Chauvir√© in 2011 and the type species is Hoazinavis lacustris. Namibiavis is another extinct genus of early opisthocomoform from early Middle Miocene (approximately 16 mya) deposits of Namibia. It was collected from Arrisdrift, southern Namibia. It was first named by C√©cile Mourer-Chauvir√© in 2003 and the type species is Namibiavis senutae. Behaviour =Feeding= The hoatzin is a folivore - it eats the leaves (and to a lesser degree fruits and flowers) of the plants that grow in the marshy and riverine habitats where it lives. It clambers around clumsily along the branches, and being quite tame (though they become stressed by frequent visits), often allows close approach and is reluctant to flush. The hoatzin uses a leathery bump on the bottom of its crop to help balance itself on the branches. Once it was thought that the species could eat the leaves of only arums and mangroves, but the species is now known to consume the leaves of more than fifty species. One study undertaken in Venezuela found that the hoatzin's diet was 82% leaves, 10% flowers, and 8% fruit. Any feeding of insects or other animal matter is purely accidental.. In flight, Bolivia One of this species' many peculiarities is that it has a digestive system unique amongst birds. Hoatzins use bacterial fermentation in the front part of the gut to break down the vegetable material they consume, much as cattle and other ruminants do. Unlike ruminants, however, which possess the rumen (a specialized stomach for bacterial fermentation), the hoatzin has an unusually large crop, folded in two chambers, and a large, multi-chambered lower esophagus. Its stomach chamber and gizzard are much smaller than in other birds. The crop of the hoatzin is so large as to displace the flight muscles and keel of the sternum, much to the detriment of their flight capacity. Because of aromatic compounds in the leaves they consume and the bacterial fermentation, the bird has a disagreeable, manure-like odor and is only hunted by humans for food in times of dire need. =Breeding= Hoatzins are seasonal breeders, breeding during the rainy season, the exact timing of which varies across its range. Hoatzins are gregarious and nest in small colonies, laying two or three eggs in a stick nest in a tree hanging over water in seasonally flooded forests. The chicks, which are fed on regurgitated fermented food, have another odd feature; they have two claws on each wing. Immediately on hatching, they can use these claws, and their oversized feet, to scramble around the tree branches without falling into the water. When predators such as the great black hawk attack a hoatzin nesting colony, the adults fly noisily about, trying to divert the predator's attention, while the chicks move away from the nest and hide among the thickets. If discovered, however, they drop into the water and swim under the surface to escape, then later use their clawed wings to climb back to the safety of the nest. This has inevitably led to comparisons to the fossil bird Archaeopteryx, but the characteristic is rather an autapomorphy, possibly caused by an atavism toward the dinosaurian finger claws, whose developmental genetics (\\"blueprint\\") presumably is still in the avian genome. Since Archaeopteryx had three functional claws on each wing, some earlier systematists speculated that the hoatzin was descended from it, because nestling hoatzins have two functional claws on each wing. Modern researchers, however, hypothesize that the young hoatzin's claws are of more recent origin, and may be a secondary adaptation from its frequent need to leave the nest and climb about in dense vines and trees well before it can fly. Relationship with humans Though conspicuous‚Äîeven attractive‚Äîat close range due to its bizarre shape, striking colors, unwariness, and poor flight, it is not considered endangered. In fact, its survival seems to be more assured than that of many other endemics of its range. In Brazil, indigenous peoples sometimes collect the eggs for food, and the adults are occasionally hunted, but in general this is rare, as it is reputed to have a bad taste. While its preferred habitats, mangrove and riverine forest, are disappearing quickly in some regions, it is less threatened than the Amazon rainforest, which is a primary target for deforestation. The hoatzin therefore remains fairly common in a large part of its range. The hoatzin is the national bird of Guyana.

Several fossil species have been identified, including one from Africa and one from Europe. The hoatzin is a stunning, colourful bird from South America. The hoatzin is found in the rainforest of the Amazon. It has a long, permanently erected crest which gives the species a stunning silhouette. This gregarious species is often found in groups of more than 40 birds, and up to 100 birds during breeding season which occurs during rainfalls. The nest is a flat platform in bush or tree above water. The chicks are semi-precocial and leave the nest at about two to three weeks of age. The adults feed them with semi-digested slimy mass from their crops, and the young are fed during the first four or five months of their life. The young nestlings can jump out into the water, and swim with wings and feet, in order to escape predators at nest. Hoatzin embryos are known to develop very quickly compared to other birds. The hoatzin lives in tropical forested wetlands of 200 to 500 meters elevation. The hoatzin is an arboreal species and is folivorous, feeding on leaves, flowers and fruits of a small number of plant species. It has a large crop that uses bacteria to break down the leaves that it eats. The hoatzin is unique because it has bacteria in its crop that breaks down its food while it is still in the crop. This is a process called foregut fermentation. It rarely drinks because its diet includes water. The hoatzin is sedentary and widespread in suitable habitat. They are noisy birds, calling in unison, uttering large numbers of varied sounds. In addition to foregut fermentation, the hoatzin has a highly modified skeleton to accommodate its large crop, and in the young of this species, wing claws at the wrist joint which are used to climb among the branches of the nest tree.

McIntyre studied Medicine at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, and worked as a GP and a consultant pulmonologist. He came to political prominence in 1945 when he won the Motherwell by-election, becoming the SNP's first ever-elected Member of Parliament. Richard J. Finlay, ‚ÄòMcIntyre, Robert Douglas (1913-1998)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press McIntyre served as the Leader of the Scottish National Party from 1947‚Äì56, and as President of the SNP from 1958‚Äì1980. He was the Provost of Stirling from 1967‚Äì1975. Known affectionately as \\"Doc Mac\\", he was often referred to as the \\"Father of the SNP\\". Dick Douglas, ‚ÄòAt The Helm: The Life & Times of Dr. Robert D McIntyre‚Äô, NPFI Publications Early life and medical career McIntyre was born in Motherwell, the son of John Ebenezer McIntyre, a minister of the United Free Church of Scotland. He was educated at Hamilton Academy and Daniel Stewart's College. After a short period working at an accountants‚Äô office, McIntyre managed to acquire the necessary qualifications to attend the University of Edinburgh, where he initially studied Chemistry, before switching to study Medicine. At university, he was Chairman of the University Labour Party and an active member of Edinburgh University Socialist Society. He also served as the University Labour Party's delegate on the Edinburgh Trades and Labour Council in 1935. In December 1938, McIntyre graduated with an MB ChB, and joined a general practice in Warwick, England as an assistant. Following brief spells as a General practitioner in Musselburgh and Polmont, he served as a house surgeon at Stirling Royal Infirmary, and then as House Physician at Bangour Village Hospital. In this period, he developed an interest in the area of public health and studied at the University of Glasgow to gain a Diploma in Public Health. After qualifying, McIntyre was appointed as Senior Resident at Hawkhead Hospital in Paisley; a hospital for infectious diseases. The early-1940s witnessed a dramatic increase in the confirmed cases of diphtheria in Scotland. McIntyre was in charge of a major campaign of diphtheria immunisation directed at Paisley's schoolchildren, visiting every school in the area to persuade the children and their parents to get themselves vaccinated against the lethal disease. Robert McIntyre then took up a position under Glasgow Corporation‚Äôs Department of Health as Port Boarding Medical Officer, based at Greenock. This involved his being part of a team which had the responsibility of ensuring that ships were free of infections before they proceeded up the River Clyde to Glasgow, and also liaising with the vessels‚Äô medical staff. Following his defeat at the 1945 general election, he served for a short period as a locum GP on North Uist, before obtaining a position with Stirling County Council as a Tuberculosis Officer responsible to the Medical Officer for Health. With the creation of the National Health Service in 1948, McIntyre was appointed as Consultant Chest Physician at Stirling Royal Infirmary. He would remain in the post until his retirement. Political career McIntyre had joined the Labour Party in 1936, and was active in Labour politics at Edinburgh University. However, he had become increasingly disillusioned with the Labour Party's commitment to Scottish home rule and had been disappointed when he and his fellow students at the Edinburgh University Labour Party had sent a resolution to the Scottish Council of the Labour Party, only to be informed that the Council was not involved in the formation of Labour Party policy. Steeped in Scottish history and culture, he believed in the right of small nations to self-government. In 1940, McIntyre joined the Scottish National Party and became the party's membership secretary when it was still headed by John MacCormick, but he resisted MacCormick's later attempts to change the SNP from supporting a policy of full Scottish independence to supporting a modicum of Home Rule. MacCormick would leave the SNP in 1942 from which point McIntyre became the party's leading figure, serving as National Secretary (1942-1945) and as vice-chairman (1945-1947), before being chosen as Chairman (leader) of the SNP in May 1947. On 13 April 1945, shortly before the end of World War II, McIntyre won the Motherwell by- election, with a narrow majority of 617 votes over his Labour opponent. He made history as the first SNP candidate to be elected as a Member of Parliament. Upon arriving at Parliament, he had difficulty finding the customary two sponsors to allow him to take his seat, as members did not want to break party loyalties. Two reluctant sponsors were found but McIntyre chose to present himself to the Speaker alone, later writing \\"I very clearly stated to the people of Motherwell and Wishaw that I would give no allegiance to the London-controlled parties\\". A vote to waive the rule was lost, and eventually he accepted the sponsorship of James Barr and Alexander Sloan \\"under protest\\". He lost the seat only three months later at the 1945 general election, to the Labour Party. He then returned to his medical practice, working in Stirling Royal Infirmary to treat and prevent tuberculosis. However, he continued to stand at every subsequent general election, up to October 1974. After McIntyre stood down as party leader in 1956, he was elected as President of the Scottish National Party, holding this office until 1980. In 1956, he was also elected as a member of Stirling Burgh Council, a position he held until 1975. He was Provost of Stirling from 1967‚Äì1975. McIntyre was first (and last) vice- president of the Celtic League (from 1961‚Äì71). Gwynfor Evans was president at the time. Robert McIntyre died on 2 February 1998, aged 84.

Bondage cuffs are restraints designed for use in sexual bondage situations. Compared to conventional handcuffs, they are wide wrist and ankle restraints generally made of leather, often padded with soft leather or fake fur. Bondage cuffs may be fastened at the wrists and/or ankles by a locking mechanism, by a buckle or by velcro. They are secured around the wrist or ankle, and the cuffs may then be attached to each other or another object. They may be fitted with D-ring attachments or buckles to which nylon webbing, chain or another restraining strap may be attached. The straps may have a loop mechanism to allow the tightening of the straps. Bondage cuffs are typically secured to each wrist and ankle, and to each other and other objects depending on the needs of each play. A set of cuffs may be used to create a hogtie, and a pair of ankle cuffs can be used together with thigh-width straps to create a frogtie. They are typically used in conjunction with other bondage equipment, such as leg spreaders.  Safety considerations  Bondage cuffs are designed to be safer than conventional handcuffs. Unlike bondage cuffs, the primary design goals of handcuffs are not comfort and safety, but immobilization and prevention of escape, and they are not padded to try to reduce the risk of nerve damage and other injuries. Nevertheless, as with all restraint devices, it is still possible for the use of bondage cuffs to cause serious injuries if misused or not monitored carefully. Ordinary bondage cuffs are not designed to be safe when used to carry any significant load. Suspension cuffs are a specialized form of bondage cuffs, designed to be used to suspend the body during suspension bondage. File:Suspension Bondage Cuffs.jpgWrists encased in suspension cuffs.

Her commitment to addressing social issues and her involvement in collective action has made her concentrate on themes as diverse as the AIDS epidemic, mental illness, despair, loss of dignity, as well as political injustice, historical revisionism and war crimes, among much else. Gal√°s has attracted the attention of the press particularly for her voice ‚Äì a soprano sfogato ‚Äì and written accounts that describe her work as original and thought- provoking refer to her as \\"capable of the most unnerving vocal terror\\", an \\"aesthetic revolutionary\\", \\"a mourner for the world's victims\\" and \\"an envoy of risk, honesty and commitment\\". As a composer, pianist, organist and performance artist, Gal√°s has presented mainly her own work, but her live performances have also included works by other musicians, such as the avant- garde composers Iannis Xenakis and Vinko Globokar, jazz musician Bobby Bradford, and collaborations with saxophonist John Zorn, the bands Recoil and Erasure, and bassist for Led Zeppelin, John Paul Jones.Gal√°s, Diamanda. Defixiones, Will & Testament Interview in Italy. Retrieved 2013-01-09 Background and education Gal√°s was born and raised in San Diego, California, to a Maniot Greek-American mother from Dover, New Hampshire, Georgianna Koutrelakos-Gal√°s, and an Egyptian-American father from Lynn, Massachusetts, James Gal√°s, both of whom were Greek Orthodox Christians. Her father's Greek ancestors were from Smyrna, Pontus, and Chios, while one of his grandmothers was an Egyptian from Alexandria. Gal√°s does not refer to her Smyrniote and Pontic ancestry as \\"Turkish\\", but rather as Anatolian. Gal√°s's first contact with music was during her childhood in San Diego, where her parents lived and worked as teachers. Her father, who was a gospel choir director, taught her how to play the piano when she was three years old, while introducing her later to classical music, the New Orleans jazz tradition, rebetika and other classics of his Greek heritage, some Blues standards, and other historical music genres. Galas also took cello and violin lessons, and studied a wide range of musical forms.Diamanda Gal√°s. Interview in kultur & n√∂je. Sweden. April 1, 2011. By the age of fourteen, she had been playing gigs in San Diego with her father's band, performing Greek and Arabic music, and she had also made her orchestral debut with the San Diego Symphony as the soloist for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1. But while her father encouraged her to play the piano, he did not want her to sing because he believed that singing was for \\"hookers and idiots.\\" Gal√°s and her brother Phillip-Dimitri acquired a taste for dark literature at an early age. Their inspirations were Marquis de Sade, Friedrich Nietzsche, Antonin Artaud, and Edgar Allan Poe. In the 1970s, Gal√°s studied biochemistry at the University of Southern California, specializing in immunology and hematology studies. Music = Early years (1979‚Äì1986) = In the early 1970s, Gal√°s and her friend contra- bass player Mark Dresser joined the jazz band Black Music Infinity, which included drummer Stanley Crouch, trumpeter Bobby Bradford, cornetist Butch Morris, flutist James Newton and saxophonist David Murray. She later collaborated with members of the San Diego band CETA VI, which included, among others, jazz saxophonist Jim French, with whom Gal√°s went on to record and release her first compositions, as part of the album If Looks Could Kill (1979), together with guitarist and sound engineer Henry Kaiser. At the same time, Gal√°s was preparing for her live solo debut, which took place at the 1979 Festival d'Avignon, in France, where she was doing post-graduate studies. It was a performance of Vinko Globokar's Un Jour comme un autre, an opera based on Amnesty International's documentation about the arrest and torture of a Turkish woman for alleged treason. Her first solo album, The Litanies of Satan (1982), was also an operatic work. It included only two compositions: a twelve-minute piece entitled 'Wild Women with Steak-Knives', which was described by Gal√°s in the album notes as tragedy-grotesque deriving from her work \\"Eyes Without Blood\\", and another lengthy composition, 'Litanies of Satan', an adaptation to music of a section from Charles Baudelare's poem Les Fleurs du Mal. Her second album, Diamanda Galas (1984), contained two lengthy compositions, too. They were 'Panoptikon', which was dedicated to Jack Henry Abbott, whose 1981 autobiographical book In the Belly of the Beast described his experience of the prison system, and 'Tragoudia Apo To Aima Exoun Fonos' ('Song From the Blood of Those Murdered'), a Greek-language piece dedicated to those political prisoners who were either murdered or executed during the Greek military regimes in the years 1967-74. = Mute Records (1986‚Äì2008) = Gal√°s began writing and performing on the subject of AIDS around 1984, while living in San Francisco. This theme resulted in the trilogy Masque of the Red Death, an operatic trilogy which included The Divine Punishment (1986), Saint of the Pit (1986) and You Must Be Certain of the Devil (1988). In these three works Gal√°s detailed the suffering of people with AIDS. Shortly after the recording of the trilogy's first volume began, her brother, playwright Philip- Dimitri Gal√°s, became sick with AIDS, which inspired her to join activist groups that raised awareness about this new illness. Her brother died in 1986, just before the completion of the trilogy. Taking a break from her own recordings, Gal√°s appeared on the 1989 studio album Moss Side Story by former Magazine and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds instrumentalist Barry Adamson. In Moss Side Story, which was described by the press as a \\"soundtrack for a non- existent film-noir\\", Gal√°s sang the opening track, 'On the Wrong Side of Relaxation'. In 1992, Gal√°s released the album Vena Cava, a series of unaccompanied voice pieces recorded in New York during a live performance at The Kitchen. For her next record, Gal√°s changed stylistic direction by turning to the blues tradition and interpreting a wide range of songs with only a piano and solo voice. This stylistic turn produced the studio album The Singer (1992), on which she covered songs by Willie Dixon, Roy Acuff, and Screamin' Jay Hawkins, as well as \\"Gloomy Sunday\\", a song written by Hungarian pianist and composer Rezs≈ë Seress in 1933 and translated into English by Desmond Carter. This material formed the basis of the video Judgement Day, which was released in 1993. In the next three years, Gal√°s returned to collaborations with other musicians. She first worked with Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, a longtime admirer of her work, to write material for a record, and the album The Sporting Life was produced with him in 1994. A tour that followed the album's release saw the two musicians performing together live on stage as well as on the popular MTV show The Jon Stewart Show. Then, in the same year, two of Gal√°s's songs from her previous album were featured on the soundtrack for Oliver Stone's film Natural Born Killers. In 1995, Gal√°s contributed vocals to the eponymous album of British synth-pop duo Erasure at the invitation of the lead singer, Andy Bell, and the following year she took part in the album Closed on Account of Rabies, a tribute to Edgar Allan Poe which also included Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry and Marianne Faithfull, who lent their voices to the tales of the legendary author. Gal√°s's reading of \\"The Black Cat\\" was the longest recording on the compilation. In 1998, Gal√°s released Malediction and Prayer, which was recorded live in 1996 and 1997. In 2000, Gal√°s worked with Recoil by contributing her voice to the album Liquid. She was the lead vocalist on the album's first single, \\"Strange Hours\\", for which she also wrote the lyrics, and can be heard on \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"Vertigen\\" as a backing vocalist. Gal√°s's next project revolved around the Armenian, Anatolian-Greek and Assyrian genocides that occurred between 1914 and 1923. This work took the title 'Defixiones ‚Äì Will and Testament' in reference to the last wishes of the dead who had been taken to their graves under extreme circumstances, as 'defixiones' in Greece and Asia Minor is associated with the warnings written on gravestones by relatives of the dead to warn people against desecrating them. This material formed part of the 80-minute long album Defixiones: Will and Testament (2003), which was released simultaneously with La Serpenta Canta (2003), a live album including cover versions recorded between May 1999 and November 2002. One of the unaccompanied vocal pieces from Defixiones: Will and Testament (2003), \\"Orders from the Dead\\", was later used on the album Aealo (2010) by Greek black metal band Rotting Christ. In 2008, Gal√°s released her seventh live album, Guilty Guilty Guilty. Diamanda Gal√°s at the QE Hall in London = Intravenal Sound Operations (2009‚Äìpresent) = After 2009 Gal√°s found herself without a record deal, and until 2016 she was remixing and remastering her earlier works as well as recording some new songs which were made available online digitally as self-released singles. Gal√°s's focus in this period was on regaining ownership and control of her entire catalogue, since the selling of her records by Mute to EMI, which passed them to BMG, had made Gal√°s's back catalogue unavailable. In the meantime, two new albums, All the Way (2017) and At Saint Thomas the Apostle Harlem (2017), were released through her own label simultaneously, and a world tour followed. In 2019, Gal√°s regained the rights of her back catalogue and her discography was made available again. The result was the release of a remastered version of her debut album The Litanies of Satan (1982), which had been originally released on Y Records. This was followed by the 21-minute piano work De- formation: Piano Variations (2020), which was based on music for the 1912 poem Das Fieberspital (The Fever Hospital) by the German expressionist writer Georg Heym.  Art  = Performance art = Although Gal√°s found herself in the mid-70s studying and practicing music and performance in the West Coast, where performance artists tended to be much more reliant on text and closer to the theatrical event than their European and East-Coast counterparts, her use of text did not restrict her performances to a script, as her introduction of electronically processed sounds shifted her attention towards vocal improvisation to allow more freedom. Her first public performances at New York's The Kitchen and the 1980 Moers Festival reflect this direction, and works such as 'Wild Women with Steak-Knives' and 'Panoptikon', which were developed in this period and used heavily the improvisation element and vocal experimentation, were later recorded and released as music records for her first two solo albums in 1982 and 1984 respectively. In 1990, Gal√°s selected material from her AIDS trilogy and created a performance piece for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. With a theme addressing the Roman Catholic Church's indifference to sufferers of HIV and Gal√°s's introduction of theatrical props, such as artificial blood and special lights, her performance, for some members of her audience, \\"combined ululating shrieks, whispers and howls with an intensity that left the audience stunned.\\" The performance was documented in photographs and audio, and a live album was released under the title Plague Mass in 1991. = Painting = Gal√°s has stated that, for her, painting acts as \\"an exorcism of that which is troubling [her] deeply\\", and that the visual language she uses allows her \\"to paint an analogue of the experience, the misery, and therefore get rid of it for the time being. But only because of that vocabulary\\", she adds. Gal√°s paints in the neo-expressionistic style, which is similar to that of the late-70s and early-80s style used by Georg Baselitz, Paula Rego and Jean-Michel Basquiat, who painted objects and human forms in a distorted way, yet not entirely un- recognisable. According to Donald Kuspit, neo-expressionist artists look back to the roots of modern art, particularly to Expressionism, because they are interested in returning to the past. Many of Gal√°s's paintings, which often borrow their subjects from themes she has explored in her performances and music, engage with the past, too. Titles such as 'Ragip:Turkish Prison for Infidels', 'Medusa', 'Artemis', Cleopatra', 'Mani: Me Epifilakzin ‚Äì Salt Maketh A Man Who Fears No God' and 'Ethiopian Martyr/Amharic Brother to Greek Orthodox, Egyptian Coptic and Palestinian Orthodox', among others, look back to the same historical events that have been inspiring her to write lyrics and compose music. = Installation = In 2011, Gal√°s collaborated with Soviet dissident artist Vladislav Shabalin on Aquarium, a sound installation inspired by the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The event took place at Leonhardskirche in Basel (Switzerland) from June 12 to 19. Aquarium was then installed at the church of San Francesco in Udine (Italy), at the festival \\"Vicino/Lontano\\", from May 9 to 12, 2013. In July 2020, Galas presented via Fridman Gallery's online space a work inspired by poetry and visuals related to physical and mental scars in soldiers who were injured in the First World War. With collaborators such as artist and sound engineer Daniel Neumann, video artist Carlton Bright, and artist Robert Knocke on a guest appearance, Gal√°s produced 'Broken Gargoyles', an installation based on the words of German poet Georg Heym and on photographs by Ernst Friedrich. Films In 1984, Gal√°s made a voice cameo appearance, performing the voices for the Japanese assassins and flying weapons in Cannon Films' Ninja III: The Domination. This was followed by three more film appearances: she made the voice of the witch in John Milius's Conan the Barbarian (1982), the voice of the dead in Wes Craven's film The Serpent and the Rainbow, and also offered her voice to Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film, Dracula, for one of the Brides of Dracula. In 1995, Gal√°s was commissioned to record a cover version of the Schwartz-Dietz song \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" for Clive Barker's film Lord of Illusions, and her song appeared during the closing credits. While two of her earlier recordings, \\"Le Treizi√®me Revient\\" and \\"Exeloume\\", appeared on the soundtrack to Derek Jarman's The Last of England (1987), Gal√°s herself also made an appearance in a film, as in 1990 she took part in Rosa von Praunheim's documentary Positive about AIDS in the New York gay scene. Also, excerpts from Gal√°s's \\"I Put a Spell on You\\", \\"Vena Cava\\", \\"The Lord is My Shepherd\\" and \\"Judgement Day\\" can be heard in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, and her vocal improvisation in Hideo Nakata's film The Ring Two (2005). In 2011, Gal√°s premiered Schrei 27, a film made in collaboration with Italian filmmaker Davide Pepe. It was based on Schrei X, a 1994 radio piece which was a co- commission to Gal√°s by New American Radio and the Walker Art Center, and it has been described as an \\"unrelenting\\" portrait of a body suffering torture in a medical facility. Most recently, Gal√°s contributed work to James Wan's 2013 horror film, The Conjuring, and her composition \\"Free Among the Dead\\" from the album The Divine Punishment (1986) was featured in Zoe Mavroudi's Ruins: Chronicle of an HIV Witch-Hunt (2013), a documentary about the criminalization of AIDS.  Awards  In 2005, Gal√°s was awarded Italy's prestigious Demetrio Stratos International Career Award.  Activism  In 1986, Gal√°s's brother, playwright Philip-Dimitri Gal√°s, died from AIDS, and this inspired her to join the AIDS activist group ACT UP. Her subsequent involvement in ACT UP's Stop the Church demonstration resulted in her arrest on December 10, 1989 during her performance inside Saint Patrick's Cathedral. The group was protesting John Cardinal O'Connor's opposition to AIDS education and to the distribution of condoms in public schools. A total of 53 people were arrested that day, and Gal√°s was one of them.  Cultural references  Gal√°s was mentioned in Michael Kustow's autobiographical book One in Four (1987), which uses the form of a journal to tell the author's story for the year 1986, when he was working as a Commissioning Editor for the Arts in the British TV station Channel Four. Gal√°s's name does not appear directly in the book, but several references to her are made in a conversation between the author and the owner of the independent music label Some Bizzare Records Stevo Pearce, such as the use of cutting-edge technology in her live performances, her singing technique, and her Greek heritage. The following dialogue between these two persons illustrates best how this is an indirect mention of Gal√°s: > My label's called Some Bizzare. ... I've got the best f***ing TV show you'll > ever see. Drama, video art, music, films made by the bands themselves. > You'll get ratings. Innovation? I can give Channel Four all the innovation > it wants. Greek singer, for example. She wears twenty contact microphones > round her body, like necklaces, she's an opera singer, it's pure > unaccompanied transformed voice. It'll drive your viewers crazy!  Critical analyses  Art historian Nicholas Chare discusses the concert performance Todesfuge [Death's Fugue] by Diamanda Gal√°s in his study Auschwitz and Afterimages: Abjection, Witnessing and Representation (2011). Chare is interested in the Holocaust and representations of it in painting, photography, musical performance and museum artefacts, so in the section where he examines how Gal√°s has transformed the words in the poem Todesfuge, which was written by the Romanian-born German-language poet Paul Celan, he looks at her work to investigate the relationship between style and horror in music, poetry and art.  Influences  Gal√°s has cited multiple artists as influences on her music, including Maria Callas, Annette Peacock, Patty Waters, John Lee Hooker, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, and Jimi Hendrix. She is additionally influenced greatly by Greek and Middle Eastern styles of singing, and also blues music. Gal√°s has also expressed admiration for the comedian Don Rickles, who she has called \\"my hero\\", as well as the work of poets such as Henri Michaux and Georg Heym, and an array of other musicians, including Chet Baker, Doris Day, The Supremes, Gladys Knight, Miki Howard, Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, and Adele.

Revisiting music theory: a guide to the practice, p.28. . Tango is a partner dance, and social dance that originated in the 1880s along the R√≠o de la Plata, the natural border between Argentina and Uruguay. It was born in the impoverished port areas of these countries, in neighborhoods which had predominantly African descendants. The tango is the result of a combination of Rioplatense Candombe celebrations, Spanish-Cuban Habanera, and Argentinean Milonga. The tango was frequently practiced in the brothels and bars of ports, where business owners employed bands to entertain their patrons with music. The tango then spread to the rest of the world. Many variations of this dance currently exist around the world. On August 31, 2009, UNESCO approved a joint proposal by Argentina and Uruguay to include the tango in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. History The origin and spread of tango Tango is a dance that has influences from African, Native American and European culture. Dances from the candombe ceremonies of former African slave peoples helped shape the modern day tango. The dance originated in lower-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The music derived from the fusion of various forms of music from Europe. The words \\"tango\\" and \\"tambo\\" around the River Plate basin were initially used to refer to musical gatherings of slaves, with written records of colonial authorities attempting to ban such gatherings as early as 1789. Initially, it was just one of the many dances, but it soon became popular throughout society, as theatres and street barrel organs spread it from the suburbs to the working-class slums, which were packed with hundreds of thousands of European immigrants.Frommers. Destinations. Buenos Aires When the tango began to spread internationally around 1900, cultural norms were generally conservative, and so tango dancing was widely regarded as extremely sexual and inappropriate for public display. This led to a phenomenon of culture shock. Additionally, the combination of African, Native American and European cultural influences in tango was new and unusual to most of the Western world. Many neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires have their particular tango histories: for example La Boca, San Telmo and Boedo. At Boedo Avenue, C√°tulo Castillo, Homero Manzi and other singers and composers used to meet at the Japanese Cafe with the Boedo Group. In the early years of the 20th century, dancers and orchestras from Buenos Aires travelled to Europe, and the first European tango craze took place in Paris, soon followed by London, Berlin, and other capitals. Towards the end of 1913, it hit New York City as well as Finland. In the U.S., around 1911, the word \\"tango\\" was often applied to dances in a or rhythm such as the one-step. The term was fashionable and did not indicate that tango steps would be used in the dance, although they might be. Tango music was sometimes played but at a rather fast tempo. Instructors of the period would sometimes refer to this as a \\"North American tango\\", versus the so-called \\"Argentine Tango\\". The Tango was controversial because of its perceived sexual overtones and, by the end of 1913, the dance teachers who had introduced the dance to Paris were banished from the city.Knowles, Mark. The Wicked Waltz and Other Scandalous Dances By 1914, more authentic tango stylings were soon developed, along with some variations like Albert Newman's \\"Minuet\\" tango. In Argentina, the onset in 1929 of the Great Depression, and restrictions introduced after the overthrow of the Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen government in 1930, caused tango to decline. Its fortunes were reversed as tango became widely fashionable and a matter of national pride under the government of Juan Per√≥n. Taquito Militar by Mariano Mores played a monumental part in the rise of the tango and a major effect on Argentinian culture as a whole. This song was premiered in 1952 during a governmental speech of President Juan D. Per√≥n, which generated a strong political and cultural controversy between different views of the concepts of \\"cultured\\" music and \\"popular\\" music, as well as the links between both \\"cultures\\". Tango declined again in the 1950s, as a result of economic depression and the banning of public gatherings by the military dictatorships; male-only tango practice‚Äîthe custom at the time‚Äîwas considered \\"public gathering\\". That, indirectly, boosted the popularity of rock and roll because, unlike tango, it did not require such gatherings. In 2009, the tango was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. = Etymology = There are several theories regarding the origin of the word tango, none of which has been proven. An African culture is often credited as the creator of this word; in particular, it is theorized that the word derives from the Yoruba word shang√≥, which refers to Shango, the God of Thunder in traditional Yoruba religion. This theory suggests that the word ‚Äúshang√≥‚Äù was morphed through the dilution of the Nigerian language once it reached South America via slave trade. According to an alternative theory, tango is derived from the Spanish word for \\"drum\\", tambor. This word was then mispronounced by Buenos Aires‚Äô lower-class inhabitants to become tambo, ultimately resulting in the common tango. It is also sometimes theorized that the word is derived from the Portuguese word tanger, which means \\"to play a musical instrument\\". Another Portuguese word, tangom√£o, a combination of the verb tanger (\\"to touch\\") with the noun m√£o (\\"hand\\") meaning \\"to play a musical instrument with one's hands\\", has been suggested as the etymon of tango. According to some authors, tango is derived from the Kongo word ntangu which means \\"sun\\", \\"hour\\", \\"space-time\\". Michel Plisson, Tango du noir au blanc, Actes Sud, 2004 Robert Farris Thompson, Tango: The Art History of Love, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2010, p.277 Styles Tango postcard, c. 1919 Choreographed stage tango in Buenos Aires World tango dance tournament in Buenos Aires The tango consists of a variety of styles that developed in different regions and eras of Argentina as well as in other locations around the world. The dance developed in response to many cultural elements, such as the crowding of the venue and even the fashions in clothing. The styles are mostly danced in either open embrace, where lead and follow have space between their bodies, or close embrace, where the lead and follow connect either chest-to-chest (Argentine tango) or in the upper thigh, hip area (American and International tango). Different styles of tango are: * Tango argentino * Tango canyengue * Tango Oriental Uruguayan tango * Tango liso * Tango salon * Tango orillero * Tango camacupense (Angola) * Tango milonguero (tango apilado) (see also \\"Milonguero\\") * Tango nuevo (new tango) * Tango vals *Milonga * Ballroom tango * Finnish tango These are danced to several types of music: * Tango * Electronic tango-inspired music * \\"Alternative tango\\", i.e. music that is an alternative to tango, or non-tango music employed for use in tango-inspired dance The milonguero style is characterized by a very close embrace, small steps, and syncopated rhythmic footwork. It is based on the petitero or caquero style of the crowded downtown clubs of the 1950s. In contrast, the tango that originated in the family clubs of the suburban neighborhoods (Villa Urquiza/Devoto/Avellaneda etc.) emphasizes long elegant steps, and complex figures. In this case the embrace may be allowed to open briefly, to permit execution of the complex footwork. The complex figures of this style became the basis for a theatrical performance style of tango seen in the touring stage shows. For stage purposes, the embrace is often open, and the complex footwork is augmented with gymnastic lifts, kicks, and drops. A newer style sometimes called tango nuevo or \\"new tango\\", has been popularized in recent years by a younger generation of dancers. The embrace is often quite open and very elastic, permitting the leader to lead a large variety of very complex figures. This style is often associated with those who enjoy dancing to jazz- and techno-tinged \\"alternative tango\\" music, in addition to traditional tango compositions. =Tango de salon (salon tango)= =Tango canyengue= Tango canyengue is a rhythmic style of tango that originated in the early 1900s and is still popular today. It is one of the original roots styles of tango and contains all fundamental elements of traditional Tango from the River Plate region (Uruguay and Argentina). In tango canyengue the dancers share one axis, dance in a closed embrace, and with the legs relaxed and slightly bent. Tango canyengue uses body dissociation for the leading, walking with firm ground contact, and a permanent combination of on- and off-beat rhythm. Its main characteristics are its musicality and playfulness. Its rhythm is described as \\"incisive, exciting, provocative\\". The complex figures of this style became the basis for a theatrical performance style of Tango seen in the touring stage shows. For stage purposes, the embrace is often very open, and the complex footwork is augmented with gymnastic lifts, kicks, and drops. =Tango nuevo= A newer style sometimes called tango nuevo or \\"new tango\\" was popularized after 1980 by a younger generation of musicians and dancers. √Åstor Piazzolla, composer and virtuoso of the bandone√≥n (so-called \\"tango accordion\\") played a major role in the innovation of traditional tango music. The embrace is often quite open and very elastic, permitting the leader to initiate a great variety of very complex figures. This style is often associated with those who enjoy dancing to jazz- and techno-tinged, electronic and alternative music inspired in old tangos, in addition to traditional Tango compositions. Tango nuevo is largely fueled by a fusion between tango music and electronica (), though the style can be adapted to traditional tango and even non-tango songs. Gotan Project released its first tango fusion album in 2000, quickly following with La Revancha del Tango in 2001. Bajofondo Tango Club, a Rioplatense music band consisting of seven musicians from Argentina and Uruguay, released their first album in 2002. Tanghetto's album Emigrante (electrotango) appeared in 2003 and was nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2004. These and other electronic tango fusion songs bring an element of revitalization to the tango dance, serving to attract a younger group of dancers. = New tango songs = The dance of two Argentine tango street dancers in Buenos Aires. In the second half of the 1990s, a movement of new tango songs was born in Buenos Aires. It was mainly influenced by the old orchestra style rather than by Piazzolla's renewal and experiments with electronic music. The novelty lies in the new songs, with today's lyrics and language, which find inspiration in a wide variety of contemporary styles. In the 2000s, the movement grew with prominent figures such as the Orquesta T√≠pica Fernandez Fierro, whose creator, Julian Peralta, would later start Astillero and the Orquesta T√≠pica Juli√°n Peralta. Other bands also have become part of the movement such as the Orquesta Rascacielos, Altertango, Ciudad Baig√≥n, as well as singer and songwriters Alfredo \\"Tape\\" Rub√≠n, Victoria di Raimondo, Juan Ser√©n, Natal√≠ de Vicenzo and Pacha Gonz√°lez. =Ballroom tango= Ballroom tango illustration, 1914 Ballroom tango, divided in recent decades into the \\"International\\" and \\"American\\" styles, has descended from the tango styles that developed when the tango first went abroad to Europe and North America. The dance was simplified, adapted to the preferences of conventional ballroom dancers, and incorporated into the repertoire used in International Ballroom dance competitions. English tango was first codified in October 1922, when it was proposed that it should only be danced to modern tunes, ideally at 30 bars per minute (i.e. 120 beats per minute ‚Äì assuming a measure). Subsequently, the English tango evolved mainly as a highly competitive dance, while the American tango evolved as an unjudged social dance with an emphasis on leading and following skills. This has led to some principal distinctions in basic technique and style. Nevertheless, there are quite a few competitions held in the American style, and of course mutual borrowing of technique and dance patterns happens all the time. Ballroom tangos use different music and styling from the tangos from the River Plata region (Uruguay and Argentina), with more staccato movements and the characteristic head snaps. The head snaps are totally foreign to Argentine and Uruguayan tango, and were introduced in 1934 under the influence of a similar movement in the legs and feet of the tango from the River Plate, and the theatrical movements of the pasodoble. This style became very popular in Germany and was soon introduced to England. The movements were very popular with spectators, but not with competition judges.PJS Richardson, History of English Ballroom Dancing, Herbert Jenkins 1946, pp. 101‚Äì102 =Finnish tango= Arja Koriseva at the 2004 Tangomarkkinat in Sein√§joki, Finland Tango arrived in Finland in 1913. The tango spread from the dominant urban dance form to become hugely popular across Finland in the 1950s after World War I and World War II. The melancholy tone of the music reflects the themes of Finnish folk poetry; Finnish tango is almost always in a minor key. The tango is danced in very close full thigh, pelvis and upper body contact in a wide and strong frame, and features smooth horizontal movements that are very strong and determined. Dancers are very low, allowing long steps without any up and down movement, although rises and falls are optional in some styles. Forward steps land heel first except when descending from a rise, and in backward steps dancers push from the heel. In basic steps, the passing leg moves quickly to rest for a moment close to the grounded leg. Dips and rotations are typical. There is no open position, and typically feet stay close to the floor, except in dips the follower might slightly raise the left leg. Unlike in some Latin American tango styles, in Finnish tango there is no kicking of any kind, and there are no aerials. The annual Finnish tango festival Tangomarkkinat draws over 100,000 tangophiles to the central Finnish town of Sein√§joki; the town also hosts the Tango Museum.. Comparison of techniques A tango demonstration film from 1930 Argentine, Uruguayan, and Ballroom Tango use very different techniques. In Argentine and Uruguayan tango, the body's center moves first, then the feet reach to support it. In ballroom tango, the body is initially set in motion across the floor through the flexing of the lower joints (hip, knee, ankle) while the feet are delayed, then the feet move quickly to catch the body, resulting in snatching or striking action that reflects the staccato nature of this style's preferred music. In tango, the steps are typically more gliding, but can vary widely in timing, speed, and character, and follow no single specific rhythm. Because the dance is led and followed at the level of individual steps, these variations can occur from one step to the next. This allows the dancers to vary the dance from moment to moment to match the music (which often has both legato and/or staccato elements) and their mood. The Tango's frame, called an abrazo or \\"embrace\\", is not rigid, but flexibly adjusts to different steps, and may vary from being quite close, to offset in a \\"V\\" frame, to open. The flexibility is as important as is all movement in dance. The American Ballroom Tango's frame is flexible too, but experienced dancers frequently dance in closed position: higher in the elbows, tone in the arms and constant connection through the body. When dancing socially with beginners, however, it may be better to use a more open position because the close position is too intimate for them. In American Tango open position may result in open breaks, pivots, and turns which are quite foreign in Argentine tango and International (English) tango. There is a closed position as in other types of ballroom dance, but it differs significantly between types of tango. In Tango from the River Plata region, the \\"close embrace\\" involves continuous contact at the full upper body, but not the legs. In American Ballroom tango, the \\"close embrace\\" involves close contact in the pelvis or upper thighs, but not the upper body. Followers are instructed to thrust their hips forward, but pull their upper body away and shyly look over their left shoulder when they are led into a \\"corte\\". In tango from the River Plate region, the open position, the legs may be intertwined and hooked together, in the style of Pulpo (the Octopus). In Pulpo's style, these hooks are not sharp, but smooth ganchos. In Tango from the River Plata, Uruguay and Argentina, the ball or toe of the foot may be placed first. Alternatively, the dancer may take the floor with the entire foot in a cat-like manner. In the International style of Tango, \\"heel leads\\" (stepping first onto the heel, then the whole foot) are used for forward steps. Ballroom tango steps stay close to the floor, while the River Plata Tango (Uruguayan and Argentine) includes moves such as the boleo (allowing momentum to carry one's leg into the air) and gancho (hooking one's leg around one's partner's leg or body) in which the feet travel off the ground. Both Uruguayan and Argentine tango features other vocabulary foreign to ballroom, such as the parada (in which the leader puts his foot against the follower's foot), the arrastre (in which the leader appears to drag or be dragged by the follower's foot), and several kinds of sacada (in which the leader displaces the follower's leg by stepping into her space). Famous tango singers *Carlos Acu√±a (1915‚Äì1999) was known for his deep, high and expressive voice.

For the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina, Adidas designed a ball and named it Tango, likely a tribute to the host country of the event. This design was also used in 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain as Tango M√°laga, and in 1984 and 1988 UEFA European Football Championships in France and West Germany. Tango in society Tango appears in different aspects of society: Regular milongas and special festivals. A very famous festival is the Tango Buenos Aires Festival y Mundial in Buenos Aires also known as World tango dance tournament. On a regional level there are also many festivals inside and outside of Argentina. One local festival outside Argentina is Buenos Aires in the Southern Highlands in Australia.  Gender and Tango  Typically the tango is performed between a man and a woman, however the two have very different aspirations within the tango. Woman often looked to the tango to help them gain confidence and to help them find a potential relationship. Men however looked to the tango for intimate reasons, and were known to be flirty and sexually willing. Women, however, were primarily focused on the dance itself and became wealthy. As time went on and the tango culture changed, women and men often wanted to travel and compete and also teach tango classes and then both women and men are viewed as equals. Gender roles also plays a big part in the mechanics of tango due to the tango needing a leader. But in more recent times this is being challenged due to woman not wanting to be dependent on the male for the dance. In the early 1900s, there were often more male dancers than female so the dance was performed between two men. This allowed for both men to learn the leading and following roles of tango and adapt to both lead equally in the dance. This changed the mechanics of the dance to be closer to two equally leading roles between men and women or same sex pairs. Health benefits It has been suggested that tango makes people feel more relaxed, sexier, and less depressed, and increases testosterone levels. Dance targets six main areas considered to be important for high quality of life and successful aging: # physical exercise # social satisfaction # spirituality and mindfulness # cognition # meaningfulness # emotional and educational health While all types of dance confers some types of benefits, Argentine tango dancing, in particular, has documented evidence that these areas are improved in both healthy and disabled populations. Tangolates is an exercise method that combines the core stability of Pilates with the concentration, coordination and fluid movement of tango, designed in 2004 by Tamara Di Tella. Utilizing a partner-method and incorporating the aerobic or cardio element of music, it started as a rehabilitation technique for patients with severe dysfunctions of the nervous system.

Corona was purchased by the Beecham Group in 1958, and Corona Soft Drinks by Britvic in 1987. , the flavours available in the United Kingdom include Orange, Strawberry and Watermelon and Tropical in addition to flavours of the \\"Tango Ice Blast\\" slush range. Tango is known in the United Kingdom for their advertisements, mostly those broadcast on television in the 1990s from the Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury advertising agency. Advertising Advertisements for Tango attracted attention in the 1990s when they became well known for their distinctively bizarre and post modern tone. The manufacturer Britvic considers the drink to be \\"probably most famous for its successful and innovative marketing campaigns\\". The catchphrase \\"You know when you've been Tango'd\\" was introduced by advertising agency HHCL. The campaign began in 1992 with an advert, Orange Man, featuring a man drinking Tango and immediately being slapped around the face, by a portly man painted orange (Peter Geeves). The advert received widespread condemnation after a craze for \\"Tangoing\\" people swept the nation's playgrounds, and there were reports of children receiving serious injuries, or even being deafened by being slapped on the ears. Tango voluntarily replaced the \\"slapping\\" advert with an almost identical new version, where the orange clad person kisses the man instead of hitting him. The original version was ranked third in a list of the \\"100 Greatest Adverts\\", in a 2000 poll conducted by The Sunday Times and Channel 4. Most subsequent Tango advertisements have avoided showing violence, except for the advert from October 2004, \\"Pipes\\", which showed a man rolling down a hill with concrete pipes, causing it to be banned, and the advert from March 1997, \\"Vote Orange Now\\", where the orange clad man made another appearance, slapping the advert's protagonist several times. This latter advert was featured in the first advert break on Channel 5. In March 2000, an advert which premi√®red in 1998 featuring James Corden being bullied for not drinking Tango was banned because it was seen as encouraging the bullying of overweight children. The replacement was a satirically inoffensive advert, Drink Tango: It's Nice. During August 1999, Tango teamed up with the newspapers Daily Mail and Daily Record to extend their summer peak sales period in a campaign called \\"Tango Time\\". The main thread of the campaign activity was a competition where a time of day is printed on the base of cans of Tango. The winning 'Tango Time' was published in the Daily Mirror and Daily Record and winners invited to call a prize claim line. The newspaper adverts were trailed by branding on the front page, including a free offer for a bottle of Tango. The adverts containing the winning 'Tango Time' ran for twenty six days in August 1999. Tango Apple has often been subject to experimental advertising including an \\"Apple Tango Calendar\\" given free in June 1996 with the Daily Star and, in 2003, the \\"Big Drench Tour\\", a roadshow of a thirty foot tall apple shaped installation filled with water. Players must stand underneath and take part in a game of 'drench roulette' to win prizes. Later that year, as Tango Strange Soda launched, three ultimately unsuccessful advertisements for the drink (Taste Buds, Trainers and Classroom) were aired featuring a man's \\"taste buddies\\" which are a group of young men behaving as the man's taste buds that vibrate rapidly when the man consumes Strange Soda. The \\"taste buddy\\" actors in the advertisements were shot as live action, with the actor standing on a moveable circular frame which was then manoeuvred via a handle to give the \\"vibrating\\" trembling effect for each of the \\"buddies\\" seen on screen.http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=22845 In August 2009, a billboard campaign extolled the \\"weird and wonderful\\" side effects of drinking too much \\"Tango with added Tango Orange\\" (such as \\"Too much Tango made me suck a bull's udder\\"). The British press pointed out that the initials of \\"Tango With Added Tango\\" spelled the insult \\"twat\\" when read vertically, and this was later revealed to be intentional. Tango advertisements have sometimes featured phone numbers for viewers to call, although the phone numbers would typically appear too briefly on the screen for viewers to type in the number or write it down. Many of these advertisements incorporate a send-away prize, including a rubber doll or a clown horn (the Tango Horn). A notable exception was an advert which first premi√®red in 1993 for Still Tango disguised as a subvert falsely alerting people that the drink is unauthorised, and features a phone number for 'affected' viewers to call. Tango sponsored the television show The Word in 1994 and the Underage Festival in 2010. Historically, slogans have included \\"You Taste the Tang in Tango Every Sparkling Sip You Take\\" in the 1960s and \\"The Whole Fruit\\" in the late 1980s. Logos and packaging The first packaging that Britvic introduced, upon buying the brand in 1987, featured the word 'Tango' on a circle with an orange background. In 1989, the cast, material and graphic design of the can changed considerably. No longer molded in the shape of a baked bean can in a non reusable steel material, Tango was now available in a recyclable aluminium composition, with an innovative new ring pull system. On the can itself, the word 'Tango' was featured inside an oval on a backdrop of half sliced oranges. The design was often seen on display in the form of laminated stickers, in the shop windows of confectionery stores and newsagents. 1992 saw the packaging change again, with the 'Tango' logo depicted on the fruit the drink was flavoured with against a black background, with the flavour specified at the bottom. In the beginning of 1996, Tango packaging changed again, with the words 'Tango' and the respective flavour written on something representing the drink (for example, an orange explosion for Tango Orange). Slight changes were made in 1997, adding more detail. In April 2002, another revamp occurred, with a more three dimensional logo. The design was dropped in 2007, although is still used by Tango Ice Blast. The Diet Tango Orange products from this era featured a grey background instead of a black one. The summer of 2007 saw a much simpler logo and design, featuring the 'Tango' logo on top of a carved version of the fruit, with the flavour written in lower case at the bottom. Intended to help restore sales of Tango, it actually led to a further decline. May 2009 saw new packaging created by Blue Marlin Brand Design. It featured mashed up images of fruit and graffiti style type, and contributed to a rise in sales. For limited edition variations of Tango, special packaging has sometimes been produced for them. Notably, the 'Tango Talk' rebrand of Tango Orange and Tango Apple featured a mobile phone in place of the flavour representation featured on regular versions of the flavours at the time. The 2009 larger can packaging of Tango Orange known as \\"Tango with Added Tango Orange\\" featured more oranges in the background. The same can be said for the 2010 \\"King Tango\\" Tango Orange bottles. More apples were used on the label for King Tango Apple and more cherries for King Tango Cherry. No changes to flavour was made only the size of the can or bottle. The labelling of the short lived Tango Strange Soda featured a \\"strange\\" fruit with facial features, patterned after the name and flavour of the drink. \\"Tango Orange Sound System: Official Can\\", a 2010 repackaging of the notably large \\"Tango with Added Tango Orange\\" featured speakers on the can, in place of the mashed-up fruit. Both these large cans were advertised as \\"the first time Tango cans are larger\\". This is not true, as from 1991 until roughly 2000, all Tango flavours could be purchased in similar size larger cans. The large cans, at the initial 1991 launch, were called \\"King-Size\\". During 2000, short lived 250ml bottles of Tango were introduced as part of a ¬£42m campaign by Britvic, to market their drinks as being suitable for children's lunch boxes. The campaign also introduced the popular Robinson's line of juice drinks Fruit Shoot. Tango Cherry and Tango Lemon were first to feature the revamp of 2002, getting the treatment in September 2001. Flavours and variants In addition to orange, Tango has been sold in numerous flavours. Tango Lemon was introduced in the 1950s, and more recent flavours have included apple in the 1980s, and blackcurrant and cherry in the 1990s. A range of Diet Tango products were released in the 1990s, later branded as \\"Tango No Added Sugar\\". Some variants are still sold, but most have been discontinued. The orange flavour was the only original flavour, and for this reason is the flagship flavour of the brand. As well as drinks, the brand have also sold two different chocolate bars, and chewy ball sweets. There have been two product recalls of the drink throughout its long history. In June 1994, the brand recalled more than a million bottles of Still Tango, after complaints that the drink was fermenting on the shelves. The drink was not relaunched until September 1995. Then, on 25 August 2005, over 100,000 cans of Tango Cherry and Tango Fruit Fling were recalled over fears they could explode due to an ingredient in the drink. In July 2011, Turbo Tango, when launched, was described as the \\"first aerosol drink\\". In October 2000, Tango introduced a flavoured bar of Crunchie. During 2011, several flavours of Chew Stick and Chewy Bonbons were introduced. In January 2013, a Tango branded shower gel was launched. A Tango branded hand soap was also launched around the same time. =Blackcurrant Tango= Blackcurrant Tango was launched in 1996. The drink is notable for the multiple award-winning television commercial from 1997,'St. George' St George, which was used to promote it. Blackcurrant Tango was relaunched in August 2011, as an exclusive flavour to Asda, and since December 2012, is sold by other retailers. For the launch of Blackcurrant Tango in 1996, HHCL produced the \\"St. George\\" television and cinema advertisement. In the advertisement, a member of Tango's customer service staff, Ray Gardner, provides a response to a letter of complaint about the flavour of Blackcurrant Tango he has received from Sebastien Loyes, a French exchange student. The letter prompts an increasingly jingoistic tirade during which Ray Gardner removes his suit to reveal bright purple boxing shorts. In one seemingly continuous take, he walks from his office, marches out of Tango's building, and is joined by a flag waving crowd as he enters a boxing ring. As the camera pulls back, the ring is revealed to be perched on the edge of the White Cliffs of Dover. As the camera circles, Gardner can be heard shouting, \\"Come on France, Europe, the world. I'll take you all on! I'm Ray Gardner. I drink Blackcurrant Tango. Come and get me!\\" whilst three Harrier Jump Jets with purple landing lights hover in the background. The advertisement was notable for the use of digital editing to seamlessly merge a number of tracking shots, including the final transition from a sky camera to a helicopter shot. Ray Gardner later won the ITV Best Actor In A Commercial award for his performance. The commercial was voted the Best Long Commercial (1956‚Äì2001), by the United Kingdom's Film4 television channel in June 2007. The song that appeared in the advertisement, \\"Don't You Want Me\\" by Felix, was rereleased with Tango branding. =Ice Blast range= Since 2001, Tango has offered a frozen slush range branded as \\"Tango Ice Blast\\", which is primarily sold in UK cinemas.

University of Utrecht, Netherlands. Retrieved January 11, 2014 The lunar crater Azophi and the minor planet 12621 Alsufi are named after him. Al-Sufi published his famous Book of Fixed Stars in 964, describing much of his work, both in textual descriptions and pictures. Al- Biruni reports that his work on the ecliptic was carried out in Shiraz. He lived at the Buyid court in Isfahan. Biography 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi was one of the nine famous Muslim astronomers. His name implies that he was from a Sufi Muslim background. He lived at the court of Emir Adud ad-Daula in Isfahan, Persia, and worked on translating and expanding Greek astronomical works, especially the Almagest of Ptolemy. He contributed several corrections to Ptolemy's star list and did his own brightness and magnitude estimates which frequently deviated from those in Ptolemy's work, with only 55% of Al- Sufi's magnitudes being identical to Ptolemy's. He was a major contributor of translation into Arabic of the Hellenistic astronomy that had been centered in Alexandria, Egypt, the first to attempt to relate the Greek with the traditional Arabic star names and constellations, which were completely unrelated and overlapped in complicated ways. Astronomy Sagittarius from The Depiction of Celestial Constellations Al-Sufi made his astronomical observations at a latitude of 32.7¬∞ in Isfahan. He identified the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is visible from Yemen, though not from Isfahan; it was not seen by Europeans until Magellan's voyage in the 16th century. He also made the earliest recorded observation of the Andromeda Galaxy in 964 AD; describing it as a \\"small cloud\\". These were the first galaxies other than the Milky Way to be observed from Earth. Al-Sufi published Kitab al-Kawatib al- Thabit al-Musawwar (also commonly known as the Book of Fixed Stars) in AD 964 and dedicated it to Adud al-Dawla, the current ruler of Buwayhid at the time.Hafez, Ihsan; Stephensen, Richard; Orchiston, Wayne, (January 1, 2011),Abdul-Rahman al-Sufi and his Book of the Fixed Stars, pp. 121-138, , retrieved November 13, 2019 This book describes forty-eight constellations and the stars that they are composed of. Within the Book of Fixed Stars, Al-Sufi compared Greek and Arabic constellations and stars to equate the same ones to each other. He included two illustrations of each constellation, one showing the orientation of the stars from the perspective of outside the celestial globe and the other from the perspective of looking at the sky while standing on the earth. He separated the constellations into three groups: twenty-one northern constellations, twelve zodiac constellations, and fifteen southern constellations. For each of these forty-eight constellations, Al-Sufi provided a star chart that contains all of the stars that form the constellation. Each star chart names and numbers the individual stars in the constellation, provides their longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates, the magnitude or brightness of each star, and its location north or south of the ecliptic. Although the magnitude was given for each star, of the 35 remaining copies of the Book of Fixed Stars the star magnitudes are not consistently the same number for each star due to scribal error. Al-Sufi organized the stars in each of his drawings into two groups: the stars that form the image that the constellation is meant to depict, and the stars that are in close proximity to the constellation but do not contribute to the overall image. He identified and described stars that Ptolemy did not, but he did not include them in his star charts. Al-Sufi states at the beginning of the Book of Fixed Stars that his charts are modeled after those that were produced by Ptolemy, so Al-Sufi left them out of his charts as well. Eight hundred thirty-nine years had passed since Ptolemy had published the Almagest, so the longitudinal placement of the stars within constellations had changed. To account for the procession of the stars, Al-Sufi added 12¬∞ 42' to the longitudes Ptolemy had previously suggested for the placement of the stars. Al-Sufi differed in Ptolemy by having a three leveled scale to measure the magnitude of stars instead of a two leveled scale. This extra level increased the accuracy of his measurements. His methods of determining these magnitude measurements cannot be found in any remaining texts. Despite the importance of the Book of Fixed Stars in the history of astronomy, there is no English translation of the work. Al-Sufi observed that the ecliptic plane is inclined with respect to the celestial equator and more accurately calculated the length of the tropical year. Al-Sufi also wrote about the astrolabe, finding numerous additional uses for it: he described over 1000 different uses, in areas as diverse as astronomy, astrology, horoscopes, navigation, surveying, timekeeping, Qibla, Salat prayer, etc. Al-Sufi's astronomical work was used by many other astronomers that came soon after him, including Ulugh Beg who was both a prince and astronomer. Tribute Since 2006, Astronomy Society of Iran ‚Äì Amateur Committee (ASIAC) hold an international Sufi Observing Competition in the memory of Al-Sufi.

It is a form of erotic bondage which can be practiced alone. Self-bondage is characterized by experimentation and ingenuity, and can be riskier than conventional bondage. Self-bondage requires use of techniques for self-binding as movement becomes increasingly restricted as more restraints are applied, and also requires a reliable release mechanism. Many types of bondage equipment can be applied before the one that restrains the hands. For example, leg irons can be applied, as well as gags, blindfolds, etc. For many of its practitioners, the added challenges and dangers are a part of the appeal of self-bondage, who often devise elaborate self-bondage schemes and release mechanisms, both in practice and in erotic fiction. Risks Self-bondage is considered a higher-risk activity than many other BDSM practices ‚Äî particularly when combined with autoerotic asphyxia ‚Äî and has led to a number of recorded deaths. The death in 1994 of Stephen Milligan, the British Conservative MP for Eastleigh, was a case of autoerotic asphyxiation combined with self-bondage. Self-bondage has all the risks of physical restraint and sexual bondage, with the added factor that should anything go wrong, there is no-one to effect a rescue. For example, if blood circulation cuts off sensation in limbs, the planned escape mechanism may not be usable. Types Preparation of a strict self-bondage with leather belts and a special version of a lycra bodybag Self-bondage can be either strict or sensual. =Sensual self-bondage= In sensual self-bondage, escape from restraints is simple and available immediately, if desired. For example, the keys might be within reach or the knots loosely tied. The chief aim is the sensation of immobility and of constrained movement. =Strict self-bondage= Strict self-bondage requires that the means of escape be unavailable until the lapse of time before the release mechanism activates itself. This feature of strict self-bondage makes it potentially more hazardous, but some practice it for the greater sense of helplessness it creates. =Emergency intervention= A compromise position between safety and strictness allows for a backup release mechanism that is available immediately, but carries with it some penalty or cost with its use. For example, keys could be placed in a bucket of paint. The person in self-bondage can escape quickly if necessary, such as a fire breaking out, or excessive numbness of limbs. However, the annoyance of cleaning up the paint afterwards would coerce the person into waiting for the main release mechanism to come into effect if he or she were merely bored or uncomfortable. Another penalty may be the need to contact somebody, with the penalty being having to explain what has happened. Release mechanisms Many release mechanisms are used in self-bondage to allow the practitioner to escape the restraints after a period of time. There are various trade-offs to be made between ease of use, reliability, precision of timing, cost, and so forth. There should be several mechanisms available, thus ensuring redundancy and safety. * Ice cubes are commonly used as a release mechanism. For example, a key can be placed in water which is then frozen. The key will not be available until the ice melts. Advantages include simplicity and reliability. The disadvantage is that it can be difficult to gauge precisely how long a scenario will last, although some enjoy the uncertainty. Self-bondage preparations with an ice lock as release mechanism * Ice locks are frozen together and do not move until the ice has melted down. These can be used alone (to lock a person to a stationary object) or in combination with tightening devices (to keep the tension for a certain period of time).Like Ra's Self-Bondage  Time Release * \\"Salt locks\\": Salt, sugar or any other safe water-soluble substance blocks parts of a lock. It needs to be dissolved in order to release the mechanism.Like Ra's Self-Bondage TimeRelease  Sugar or Salt based padlock 1 * Combination locks can be used as release mechanisms. These can rely on the time needed to try every possibility for an unknown combination, or they can rely on light in order to see to enter the known combination correctly. ** Unknown combination: The idea is that the lock is reset to an unknown combination, then used to lock the bondage in place. The person must find the correct combination by trial and error. A three digit combination lock contains a thousand possibilities. At a second per attempt, this could take up to 16 minutes and 40 seconds, usually less assuming the combination starts with lower numbers. For a four-digit lock, it is nearer two hours. Disadvantages include the fact that it may be distracting to actively \\"crack\\" the lock. ** In darkness: Even if the number is known, for many locks, it is not possible to enter the combination without being able to see the faces of the dials. This release mechanism relies on darkness. The light can be provided either by the morning sunlight, or, preferably, through a light on a time switch. The advantages include a large amount of control over how long the bondage lasts (with a timer), and a backup of the onset of daylight. The disadvantages are only being able to use the technique at night, and having to perform the bondage in the dark. * Electromagnets: Electromagnets can be used to release keys after a delay. If combined with electronics or a computer, a large amount of control is possible over the timing, and the mechanism is somewhat \\"fail-safe\\" -- if power fails, the key will fall early. Disadvantages include complexity and cost. The powerful electromagnets used in door locks can also be adapted for use directly as restraints.Like Ra's Naughty Blog ¬ª Electro magnetic door lock as a self-bondage timer * Soldering irons: Soldering irons can be used, in conjunction with a timing mechanism, to cut a nylon rope, or to release keys. This may be a fire hazard unless appropriate precautions are taken. * The use of a delivery/messenger service or regular mail in order to obtain the object (usually key/keys) needed in order to become released. This relies on the delivery service being 100% reliable. =Emergency backup= There are also a number of release mechanisms designed to be emergency backups. The idea behind these release mechanisms is that triggering them will cause something undesirable to happen, and thus are only used in situations where death or serious injury could occur otherwise. * Paint tin: A backup key is stored in a tin of paint, ink or motor oil in such a way that recovering the key will cause the contents of the container to spill, causing costly damage to a carpet or other possessions. This mechanism can be used for extremely quick release in an emergency such as a fire, but can make the situation worse if a flammable liquid is used. * Unpleasant drink: An unpleasant liquid, such as urine (the safety of this is discussed in the article Urophagia), is stored in a container. The key is only released when the contents of the container have been drunk (it should be designed so that the contents can not be spilled). The idea is to make the drink so unpleasant that it will only be considered as a last resort. * Rescue: A friend or relative is notified to come over at a certain time (that time being after the bondage session is planned to end). The friend may or may not be aware of the bondage. An alternative is to position a phone somewhere that is accessible during the bondage, so that a friend or the emergency services may be called if the planned release mechanisms fail. Techniques Apart from release mechanisms, self-bondage poses a somewhat awkward problem of getting into bondage, especially when using rope. What might be a relatively simple matter for couples can be considerably more complex alone. With rope, the main difficulty is tying the hands in a way that is not easy to untie. One common solution is to use a cinch noose -- essentially a kind of slip knot -- together with a coil (a loop of rope). The wrists are placed through the coil with the cinch noose between the wrists and around the coil. To achieve a basic hogtie position, the cinch noose is tied to the ankles. With pressure, the noose tightens the wrist coil, securing the hands. It proves very difficult to escape from, and usually a knife or scissors is required to cut free. Equipment that can be tightened only, and not loosened, often has application in self-bondage. This includes handcuffs, zip ties and ratcheting pulleys. Commercial equipment Professional metal cuffs set for bondage and self-bondage purposes While for the most part self-bondage is performed using ordinary and easily available equipment (indeed, it lends itself to impromptu adaptation and a \\"do it yourself\\" approach), a few commercial products have appeared -- in the United States and United Kingdom for the most part -- catering for the self-bondage practitioner.

He was also known as Liao Chenyun () as he took his uncle's (Liao Wenguang; ) family name when he was adopted by him after his parents died. He was one of the major political leaders of China both during and after the Chinese Civil War along with Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De and Ren Bishi, and was later considered to be one of the Eight Elders of the Communist Party of China. In the 1980s and 1990s, Chen Yun was regarded as the second most powerful person in China after Deng Xiaoping. Biography =Early life= A native of Qingpu, Jiangsu (now part of Shanghai), Chen was one of the few Communist Party organizers from an urban working-class background; he worked underground as a union organizer in the late 1920s, participated in the Long March, and served on the Central Committee from 1931 to 1987.*Free searchable biography of Chen Yun at China Vitae He was active throughout his career in the field of economics, despite receiving no formal education after elementary school. As a typesetter for the famous Commercial Press of Shanghai, Chen played a prominent role as a younger organizer in the labor movement during the early and mid-1920s, joining the CPC in 1924. Following the May Thirtieth Movement of 1925, Chen was an important organizer under Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi. After Chiang Kai-shek turned against the CPC in 1927, Chen fled to his hometown, but soon returned to Shanghai and secretly continued his work as a labor unionist. He served on the Central Committee in the Third Plenary Session of Sixth Central Committee of CPC in 1930 and became a member of the Politburo in 1934. In 1933 he evacuated to Ruijin, in Jiangxi province, the headquarters of the CPC's main \\"soviet\\" area. He was in overall charge of the Party's \\"white areas\\" work, that is, underground activities in places not under Party control. On the Long March he was one of the four Standing Committee members of the Political Bureau who attended the January 1935 Zunyi Conference. He left the Long March sometime in the spring of 1935, returning to Shanghai, and in September 1935 he went to Moscow, serving as one of the CPC's representatives to the Comintern. In 1937 Chen returned to China as an adviser to the Xinjiang leader Sheng Shicai. Chen later joined Mao in Yan'an, probably before the end of 1937. In November 1937 he became director of the Party's Organization Department, serving in that capacity until 1944, and by the early 1940s was in the inner circle of Mao's advisers. His writings on organization, ideology, and cadre training were included in the important study materials for the Yan'an Rectification Movement of 1942, a campaign of political persecutions which consolidated Mao's power within the Party. =Maoist politician= Chen's economic career began in 1942, when he was replaced by Ren Bishi as head of the CPC Organization Department. In his new position, Chen was assigned responsibility for the financial management of Northwest China. Two years later, he was identified as responsible for finance in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region as well. He added Northeast China to his portfolio in 1946 (under the overall leadership of General Lin Biao and Political Commissar Peng Zhen. In May 1949, Chen Yun was named head of the new national Central Finance and Economic Commission. In early 1952, Zhou Enlai led a team to draft the first Five-Year Plan which included Chen, Bo Yibo, Li Fuchun and General Nie Rongzhen. Zhou, Chen and Li presented the draft to Soviet experts in Moscow, who rejected it. In early 1953, Gao Gang and the State Planning Commission began work on what would eventually become the final version.Huang, p. 184. After Gao's fall, Chen, Bo Yibo, Li Fuchuan and (later) Li Xiannian would manage the Chinese economy for the next 30+ years. Throughout the 1950s, Chen was the official who did the most to moderate Mao's radical economic reforms. Looking back, Chen would later believe that it was the Chairman's errors that most kept China from achieving its Five-Year Plans.MacFarquhar xviii In 1956, when the 8th National Congress of Communist Party of China was held, Chen was elected a Vice-chairman of the Central Committee. Around that time, both Mao and Chen had come to believe that the economic system, modeled on that of the Soviet Union, was overly centralized, but had different ideas about what to do about it. Chen's proposal was to make wider use of the market, allowing for the operation of supply and demand rather than simple government fiat in determining the allocation of resources. He argued that decisions concerning prices and production should be made by individual firms, in conformity with business logic. At the same time he favored giving the central government ministries stronger control over these firms, to assure that their decisions did not transgress the boundaries of the plan. Mao's idea, rather, was to devolve powers to provincial and local authorities, in practice Party committees rather than state technocrats, and to use mass mobilization rather than either a detailed central plan or the market to promote economic growth. Mao's program prevailed, and these policies converged with the rest of the ultimately disastrous Great Leap Forward. By early 1959 the economy was already showing signs of strain. In January of that year Chen Yun published an article calling for increased Soviet aid, perhaps a signal to Moscow that the wild men were no longer in control of the economy. In March he published a subdued but general critique of the Leap, especially its reliance on the mass movement. Economic growth, he asserted, is not simply a matter of speed. It requires attention to safe working conditions and quality engineering. It depends on technical skill, not just political awareness. =Attempts to lead China's economic recovery= This was Chen's last public statement during Mao's lifetime. In the summer of 1959 the Party convened a meeting at the resort town of Lushan to review the policies of the Leap. The Minister of Defense, Marshal Peng Dehuai, attacked the radicalism of the Leap, and Mao took this, or affected to take it, as an attack on himself and his authority. Mao responded with a vicious personal attack on Peng. Peng lost his military positions and the Party undertook a general purge of what Mao termed right opportunism. Further reform of the Leap policies was now out of the question. China continued on its set course for another year or more, and by the end of 1960 had fallen deep into famine. Chen Yun was certainly in sympathy with Peng Dehuai's criticism of the Leap, but he was not included among the right opportunists. Chen joined forces with Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping to manage the economy in the post-Great Leap Forward period, which required deft handling of Chairman Mao's sensitivity to criticism.Huang, pp. 240-41. Although Chen nominally retained his positions as Party vice chairman and member of the Politburo, he was no longer in practice part of the core Party leadership. He did, however, continue to express his opinions behind the scenes. In 1961 he conducted investigations of the rural areas around Shanghai. According to a Cultural Revolution attack on him by the radical group within the finance system, he reported the peasants as saying: \\"In the days of Chiang Kai-shek we had rice to eat. In the glorious era of Chairman Mao, we have only gruel.\\" According to his obituary, Chen was one of the main designers of the economic policies of the 1961-1962 \\"capitalist road\\" era, when China's economic policy stressed material incentives and sought to encourage economic growth in preference to pursuing ideological goals. This approach is often referred to as Chen's \\"bird-cage\\" theory of post-Great Leap economic recovery, where the bird represents the free market and the cage represents a central plan. Chen proposed that a balance should be found between \\"setting the bird free\\" and choking the bird with a central plan that was too restrictive; this theory would later become a focal point of criticism against Chen during the Cultural Revolution. His only public appearance during this time was a photograph of him published on the front page of the People's Daily and other major newspapers on May 1, 1962, showing a somewhat emaciated Chen shaking hands with Chairman Mao, while Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping (the entire inner core of leadership of that time, with the exception of Lin Biao) look on. There was no caption or any other explanation. During the Cultural Revolution, Chen Yun was denounced in Red Guard publications but not in the official press. He was re-elected to the Central Committee in the Ninth Party Congress in April 1969 but not to the Politburo. He no longer held any functional positions. Later that year he was \\"evacuated\\" from Beijing, as were many other inactive or disgraced first-generation leaders, as part of a supposed plan preparing against the eventuality of an invasion by the Soviet Union with whom China had a serious split. Chen was put to work in a factory in Nanchang in Jiangxi province, where he stayed for three years. In January 1975, he was elected to the Standing Committee of China's legislature, the National People's Congress. =Criticism of Maoism after Mao= Following the death of Mao in September 1976 and the coup d'√©tat against the radical Gang of Four a month later, Chen became increasingly active in the country's political life. He and General Wang Zhen petitioned Party chairman Hua Guofeng to rehabilitate Deng Xiaoping at the March 1977 CPC CC Work Conference, but were turned down.Huang, p. 351. After Deng was rehabilitated later that year, Chen led the attack on the Maoist era at the November‚ÄìDecember 1978 CPC CC Work Conference, raising the sensitive \\"six issues\\": the purges of Bo Yibo, Tao Zhu, Wang Heshou and Peng Dehuai; the 1976 Tiananmen Incident; and, Kang Sheng's errors. Chen raised the six issues in order to undermine Hua and his leftist supporters.Huang, pp. 361-362. Chen's intervention tipped the balance in favor of movement toward an open repudiation of the Cultural Revolution and Deng Xiaoping's promotion, in December 1978, to de facto head of the regime. Chen laid the basis for Deng's \\"reform and opening\\" program. In July 1979, Chen Yun was named head (and Li Xiannian deputy head) of the new national Economic and Financial Commission staffed with his own allies and conservative economic planners. In April and July of that year he made further provocative statements in internal Party meetings, although their authenticity was denied (in an equivocal manner) by official spokesmen. In these Chen deplored China's lack of economic progress and the people's loss of confidence in the Party. In April he criticized the luxurious life of Party leaders (including himself), and said if he had known in the period before Liberation what the past ten-some years would be like (that is, the Cultural Revolution period), he would have defected to Chiang Kai-shek. He deplored Mao's dictatorial ways and implied, although not very strongly, that the Party should take a milder line against dissidents. If \\"Lin Biao and the Gang of Four; that is, the radical leftists\\" had been able to assure the people food and clothing, he said, they would not have been so easy to overthrow. In July Chen developed these themes in the course of another rambling exposition (which also included some sarcastic observations on the late Chairman's taste in literature). Chen said: \\"We say the old dynasties and the KMT 'ruled' the country, but talk instead of the 'leadership' of the Communist Party. But the Party is in fact a ruling party, and if it wishes to keep its position it must also keep the support of the people. It should not float above the masses but should live among them as their servants. Both the welfare of the people and the Party's ruling position require that the Party shrink the distance between itself and the people.\\" The old dynasties, Chen said, knew the value of a \\"policy of yielding\\", of retreating from untenable positions. The Party has to be able to step back from its past practices: in economy, culture, education, science, and ideology. Without compromising the basic principle of socialism, Chen believed that the Party must accommodate, for the time being, co-existence with aspects of capitalism. But all of this, Chen added, must be done carefully: otherwise China would be in danger of abandoning socialism and restoring capitalism. These pronouncements presaged the major reorientation of Chinese communism in the reform movement. =Role in promoting China's economic reform= Though Deng Xiaoping is credited as the architect of modern China's economic reforms, Chen Yun contributed much to the strategy adopted by Deng, and Chen was more directly involved in the details of its planning and construction. A key feature of the reform was to use the market to allocate resources, within the scope of an overall plan. The reforms of the early 1980s were, in effect, the implementation, finally, of the program Chen had outlined in the mid-1950s. Chen called this the \\"birdcage economy\\".Exupoli According to Chen, \\"the cage is the plan, and it may be large or small. But within the cage the bird [the economy] is free to fly as he wishes.\\" In 1981 a rival \\"Financial and Economic Leading Group\\" was established under Zhao Ziyang and staffed by a more balanced mix of economic planners. In 1982 Chen Yun, who was 77 years old, resigned from the Politburo and Central Committee and from his active administration positions. He served as Chairman of the new Central Advisory Commission, a temporary institution set up to provide a place for the surviving leadership of the founding generation, to give them a graceful way to step aside in favor of younger minds while also remaining at least marginally involved in public affairs. During the 1980s Chen did in fact remain very much involved in policy discussions. He was increasingly disenchanted with the direction the reforms were taking. In 1982 he was among those grumbling about \\"spiritual pollution\\" (an \\"Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign\\" was organised in late 1983), as the sense of freedom spread from economics into China's social cultural, and threatened China's political status quo. Chen's philosophical rupture with Deng Xiaoping became permanent around 1984, when the CPC began to apply the kind of market reforms that had been so successful in agriculture to urban areas and the industrial sector. =Late opponent of reform= Chen was not, in principle, opposed to the scope of Deng's reforms: China's economic policy had effectively frozen consumer prices for decades, to the point that prices in China no longer had much relationship to the relative value of resources, goods, or services. Chen did object to the way in which the urban reforms were carried out. The immediate consequence of Deng's price reform was a sudden and massive inflation, unprecedented in the experience of the younger generation and particularly frightening to older folks who could still remember the rampant inflation in the last years of the Nationalist regime. The increasing circulation of money in the economy, together with a hybrid system in which those in official position or with official connections were particularly well-placed to take advantage of the new opportunities to make a profit, encouraged official corruption. The government's first response to inflation was to issue bonuses to workers in state-owned enterprises, to help make up for the price increases. Chen Yun argued that, if there were to be such bonuses, they should be gauged to increased productivity. In practice these bonuses were universal throughout the state sector, and had the same economic effect as if the government had simply printed more money. Because Chinese farmers were not eligible for bonuses (since they were not technically state employees), China's agricultural sector, which had prospered in the first stage of the reform, was especially damaged by inflation. Chen's theory had been that the market should supplement the plan. In the context of radical Maoism this made him seem like a social democratic proponent of market socialism. It turned out, however, that Chen meant exactly what he had said. He was much less enthusiastic about the market than Deng Xiaoping and Deng's younger colleagues. Although in his \\"secret\\" pronouncements of 1979 Chen had shown an unusual personal disdain for Mao, he also indicated he shared the late Chairman's worries that China would abandon socialism and revert to capitalism. During the 1980s Chen emerged as the main figure among the more hard-line opponents of reform. He supported the vicious campaign in the early 1980s against the \\"three kinds of people\\", a general purge of all those who had been identified with radical factions during the Cultural Revolution. He made common cause with conservatives among other Party elders. During the reform era Chen refused to meet with foreigners. Chen never visited the new Special Economic Zones. In a memorial tribute to Li Xiannian, an old colleague from the economic system (and, like Chen, one of the few real proletarians among the first generation of Party leaders), Chen stated that he was not necessarily opposed to everything about the Special Economic Zones. While Chen became the moral leader of the conservative opposition to Deng Xiaoping, he did not challenge Deng's personal primacy as head of regime. Although Zhao Ziyang's promotion of political and economic reform made Zhao one of Chen's main political rivals, Chen was one of the Party elders active in the 1980s who Zhao respected most. In Zhao's autobiography, Chen was one of the few elders who Zhao referred to regularly as a \\"comrade\\". Before implementing new policies, Zhao made a habit of visiting Chen, in order to solicit Chen's advice and attempt to gain Chen's approval. In the event that Zhao failed to gain Chen's approval, Zhao would then normally attempt to fall back on the favor of Deng Xiaoping in order to promote reforms. In 1989 Chen was among the Party elders responsible for making the key decisions concerning the student- led Tiananmen Square protests. There is no evidence that Chen indulged in diatribes against the students or actively advocated their violent repression. While Chen was opposed to the violent suppression of the students, he did give his support to the military once the action had begun. Chen agreed that Zhao Ziyang should be replaced as the formal head of the Party, and he endorsed Li Xiannian's nomination of Jiang Zemin as the new Party General Secretary. Legacy Chen Yun was known for his conservatism, especially in his last years, but the general Chinese population held mixed feelings about him. He was admired, despite his political stands, because he was not considered corrupt. Chen's political perspective is generally viewed as liberal until about 1980, but conservative after about 1984. Although it could be argued that his opposition to radicalism, be it Maoism or neoliberalism, represented a consistent conservative position similar to other paleo-left politicians like the British politician Peter Shore or the French politician Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement. Chen's criticism of Deng's economic reforms was influential within the Communist Party, and was reflected in the policies of China's leaders after Deng. Chen's theories supported the efforts of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao to use state power to provide boundaries for the operation of the market, and to mediate the damage that capitalism can do to those who find it difficult to benefit from the free market. Chen's notion of the CPC as a \\"ruling party\\" is central to the redefinition of the role of the Party in Jiang Zemin's Three Represents. In 2005, on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of Chen's birth, the Party press published, over the course of several weeks, the proceedings of a symposium discussing Chen's contributions to CPC history, theory and practice. Although Chen was out of favor with the Mao regime and ultimately opposed to Deng's line, Chen was not a victim of public humiliation or abuse. One reason for Chen's ability to escape political persecution, especially in Mao's time, was his lack of will or ability to challenge the top leadership (one of Deng's merits was that he did not subject his defeated critics to public abuse). Whatever the wisdom of his substantive positions, Chen consistently appeared to act on principle rather than for personal advantage: perhaps another reason he could keep his influence even while excluded from the inner circles of decision-making. Chen showed little of the ambition, opportunism, or freedom of scruple that is often observed in those who rise to the top in politics, whether in China or abroad. His son, Chen Yuan, served as the Governor of the China Development Bank, and later became a Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

It is a semi-autobiographical film starring Potter and Pablo Ver√≥n, about Argentinian Tango.. The film, a co-production of Argentina, France, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom, was produced by Christopher Sheppard in Britain and Oscar Kramer in Argentina, and was shot mostly in black and white in Paris and Buenos Aires. The soundtrack includes original recordings of Carlos Gardel's Mi Buenos Aires querido and √Åstor Piazzolla's Libertango, two of the most iconic tangos in the history of the genre. It also includes an original song written and sung by Potter. Synopsis Sally, a filmmaker and screenwriter suffering from writer's block, is dissatisfied with her film project, a murder mystery called Rage, which features the fashion industry. Taking a break, she travels to Paris, where she sees the dancer Pablo (Pablo Ver√≥n) performing tango. She becomes obsessed with the dance and offers Pablo a part in her film in exchange for dance lessons. The two become deeply involved as dancers and as lovers. Their emotional intimacy threatens the success of their dancing together. The film explores the conflict between the woman dancer accepting the man's lead in the dance, while the man must accept the woman's lead in the film. It is a love story and a showcase for Ver√≥n's dancing.

The incidence of autoerotic fatalities in Western countries is around 0.5 per million inhabitants each year. Autoerotic asphyxia is the leading cause. 70 to 80% of autoerotic deaths are caused by hanging, while 10 to 30% are attributed to plastic bags or chemical use. Both of these lead to autoerotic asphyxia. 5 to 10% are related to electrocution, foreign body insertion, overdressing/body wrapping, or another atypical method. Specific causes include the use of chemicals such as amyl nitrite, GHB, or nitrous oxide, and props and tools such as knives, oversized dildos, ligatures or bags for asphyxiation, duct tape, electrical apparatus for shocks, water for self-immersion, fire-making equipment for self-immolation, or sharp, unhygienic or large fetishized objects.

Shahab-3 / Zelzal-3 fas.org It was tested from 1998 to 2003 and added to the military arsenal on 7 July 2003, with an official unveiling by Ayatollah Khamenei on July 20. With an accuracy of 140 m CEP, the Shahab-3 missile is primarily effective against large, soft targets (like cities). Given the Shahab-3‚Äôs payload capacity, it would likely be capable of delivering nuclear warheads. According to the IAEA, Iran in the early 2000s may have explored various fuzing, arming and firing systems to make the Shahab-3 more capable of reliably delivering a nuclear warhead.https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/shahab-3/ The forerunners to this missile include the Shahab-1 and Shahab-2. In 2007, the then-Iranian Defence Minister Admiral Shamkhani has denied that Iran plans to develop a Shahab-4. Some successors to the Shahab have longer range and are also more maneuverable. Operating under the Sanam Industrial Group (Department 140), which is part of the Defense Industries Organization of Iran, the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group (SHIG), led the development of the Shahab missile. US Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center estimates that as of June 2017 fewer than 50 launchers were operationally deployed. Variants Shahab is the name of a class of Iranian missiles, service time of 1988‚Äìpresent, which comes in six variants: Shahab-1, Shahab-2, Shahab-3, Shahab-4, Shahab-5, and Shahab-6. Shahab-3B Range of the Shahab-3 The Shahab-3B differs from the basic production variant. It has improvements to its guidance system and warhead with a greater range, a few small changes on the missile body, and a new re-entry vehicle whose terminal guidance system and rocket-nozzle steering method are completely different from the Shahab-3A's spin-stabilized re-entry vehicle. The new re-entry vehicle uses a triconic aeroshell geometry (or \\"baby bottle\\" design) which improves the overall lift to drag ratio for the re-entry vehicle. This allows greater range maneuverability which can result in better precision. The triconic design also reduces the overall size of the warhead from an estimated to . The rocket-nozzle control system allows the missile to change its trajectory several times during re-entry and even terminal phase, effectively preventing interceptor guidance via trajectory prediction by early warning radar‚Äîa method nearly all long range ABM systems use. As a high-speed ballistic missile and pre-mission fueling capability, the Shahab-3 has an extremely short launch/impact time ratio. This means that the INS/gyroscope guidance would also remain relatively accurate until impact (important, given the fact that the gyroscopes tend to lose accuracy with longer flights). The CEP is estimated to be at or less. However, the accuracy of the missile is largely speculative and cannot be confidently predicted for wartime situations. These improvements would increase the Shahab-3B's survivability against ABM systems such as Israel's Arrow 2 missile defence system (though its ability to overcome Arrow is very questionable) as well as being used for precision attacks against high-value targets such as command, control, and communications centres. Shahab-3C and D Little is known about Shahab-3C and Shahab-3D. From what can be gathered, the missiles have an improved precision, navigation system, and a longer range. The missiles were indigenously developed, and are being mass-produced. Iran had in 2008 a production capacity of 70 units per year.

Iran has conducted at least six test flights of the Shahab-3. During the first one, in July 1998, the missile reportedly exploded in mid-air during the latter portion of its flight; U.S. officials wondered whether the test was a failure or the explosion was intentional. A second, successful test took place in July 2000. In September 2000, Iran conducted a third test, in which the missile reportedly exploded shortly after launch. In May 2002, Iran conducted another successful test, leading then-Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani to say the test improved the Shahab-3's \\"power and accuracy\\". Another successful test reportedly occurred in July 2002. On 7 July 2003, the foreign ministry spokesman said that Iran had completed a final test of the Shahab 3 \\"a few weeks ago\\" that was \\"the final test before delivering the missile to the armed forces\\", according to a New York Times report. On 9 November 2004, Shamkhani said Iran could mass-produce the missile. On 2 November 2006, Iran fired unarmed missiles to begin 10 days of military war games. Iranian state television reported \\"dozens of missiles were fired including Shahab-2 and Shahab-3 missiles. The missiles had ranges from to up to ...Iranian experts have made some changes to Shahab-3 missiles installing cluster warheads in them with the capacity to carry 1,400 bombs\\". These launches come after some United States-led military exercises in the Persian Gulf on 30 October 2006, meant to train for blocking the transport of weapons of mass destruction. =2008 Great Prophet III test= On 8 July 2008, Iran test fired a non- upgraded version of the Shahab-3 as one of 9 medium- and long-range missiles launched as part of the Great Prophet III exercise, within a few weeks of a recently concluded military exercise by Israel. Other missiles fired include the surface-to-surface Fateh-110 and Zelzal missiles. Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps air and naval units conducted these tests in a desert location. Air Force commander Hossein Salami advised that Iran was ready to retaliate to military threats, saying \\"We warn the enemies who intend to threaten us with military exercises and empty psychological operations that our hand will always be on the trigger and our missiles will always be ready to launch\\". One day later, on 9 July 2008, Iran once-again fired a version of the Shahab-3, amongst other missiles, which officials have said has a range of and is armed with a 1-ton conventional warhead. These tests were conducted at the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran has threatened to shut down traffic into if it is attacked. Independent national security webblog, ArmsControlWonk.com, analyzed Iranian launch footage and concluded that Iranian claims of testing an upgraded Shahab missile were unfounded. A senior Republican Guard commander said Iran would maintain security in the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. Gen. Mohammad Hejazi, chief of the Guards' joint staff, called the missile tests a \\"defensive measure against invasions\\". He also said, Iran will not jeopardize the interests of neighboring countries. According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the French news agency Agence France-Presse which published pictures from the missile test reported that \\"Iran had apparently doctored photographs of missile test-firings and exaggerated the capabilities of the weapons\\" and that an additional missile was added afterwards to cover up a failed launch\\". In a sign of commercial fallout from the second missile test in two days, the French oil company Total S.A. announced the conditions were not right to invest in Iran as major oil companies have been under increasing political pressure from the United States and its allies over their activities in Iran amid mounting tensions over Iran's nuclear program. To ratchet up the pressure further, Israel also showed off its latest spy plane in what is seen as a display of strength in response to Iranian war games (missile tests). The test on 8 July 2008 caused anxiety, the tests were seen widely as a response to Israeli aerial war games staged earlier in the month. Ali Shirazi, representative of the Revolutionary Guards naval forces said, warned that Iran would \\"set fire\\" to Israel and the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf as its first response to any pre-emptive strike by America or Israel over its nuclear program. Brig. Gen. Hoseyn Salami, commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' air force, said: \\"Our missiles are ready for shooting at any place and any time, quickly and with accuracy\\". He also made the statement that \\"enemy targets are under surveillance\\". Speaking on a visit to Malaysia on the first day of the tests, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissed the possibility of an attack by the United States or Israel as a \\"joke\\". General Mohammad Hejazi, chief of the Guards' joint staff, called the missile tests a \\"defensive measure against invasions\\". He also said that Iran will not jeopardize the interests of neighboring countries.

Developed in the mid-1980s, it is a scaled up adaptation of the Soviet SS-1, more commonly known by its NATO reporting name \\"Scud\\". Inventory is estimated to be around 200‚Äì300 missiles. US Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center estimates that as of June 2017 fewer than 100 launchers were operationally deployed. One variant Rodong-1M is called Hwasong-9. It influenced the design of Pakistan's Hatf-5/Ghauri-1 missile, as well as the Iranian Shahab-3. Overview Hwasong (Hwaseong in South Korea) is the Korean word for \\"firestar/Mars\\". It is believed North Korea obtained Scud-B designs from Egypt, and possibly Scud-C designs from China, allowing them to reverse- engineer them into a larger and longer-distance weapon. United States reconnaissance satellites first detected this type in May 1990 at the Musudan- ri test launch facility, in northeastern North Korea. The precise capabilities and specifications of the missile are unknown; even the fact of its production and deployment are controversial. It is a larger variant of the Scud-B, scaled up so its cross-sectional area is about double that of the Scud, with a diameter of and a length of . Its aerodynamic design is stable, reducing the need for modern active stabilization systems while the missile is flying in the denser lower atmosphere. It can only be fueled when vertical, therefore it cannot be fueled before transport as is normal for modern missiles. Its range is estimated as 900 km (960 mi) with a 1,000 kg payload to a range of between 1,000 km to 1,500 km. North Korea test-fired three Hwasong-7 missiles consecutively on 5 September 2016 and they all flew for about 1000 km, landing in the Japan Air Defense Identification Zone. It has an estimated circular error probable (CEP) of one or two kilometers. North Korea is believed to possess some 300 Hwasong-7 missilesAround 70% of N.K. missiles target S. Korea - Koreaherald.com, 4 March 2013 and fewer than 50 mobile launchers. The Hwasong-7's technology has been exported to foreign nations (such as Iran and Pakistan) in secrecy on the basis of mutual exchange of technologies, with Iran being one of the largest beneficiaries of such technology. Successful variants were tested and deployed by Iran after developing the Shahab-3 which is roughly based on Hwasong-7.http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets/Specials/Nodong/index.htm Pakistan, however, suffered with repeated failure initially due to flawed design name=\\"Defence News\\" https://www.defensenews.com/article/20121128/DEFREG03/311280005/Pakistan-Test- Fires-Medium-Range-Ballistic-Missile/ given in exchange but succeeded in reevaluating the missile's conceptual design and its electronic system in 1998 through reverse engineering. The Ghauri_(missile) was later (independently) developed by Kahuta Research Labs and eventually entered in to active military service in 2003.It is believed that it is redesigned/ reverse engineered model of Rodong-1 A few Hwasong-7 missiles were launched in the 2006 North Korean missile test, and a further two in a 2014 test over a range of 650 km. Although it has an estimated range of , launches in March 2014 flew only . Their range was shortened by firing at a higher launch angle. The missiles flew to an altitude of 160 km (100 mi) at Mach 7. U.S. and South Korean Patriot PAC-2/3 interceptors are more specialized to hit Scud-type missiles up to 40 km high. On 5 September 2016, North Korea fired three consecutive Rodong-1 missiles into the Sea of Japan and at a range of about 1,000 km.North Korea fires 3 ballistic missiles; Japan calls it 'serious threat' ‚Äì CNN, 2337 GMT 5 September 2016 This marked the Rodong-1 as a credible and matured missile suitable for operational deployment since its first successful launch in 1993.

To enable interception at higher altitudes, South Korea is indigenously developing the long-range surface-to-air missile (L-SAM), and on 8 July 2016 the U.S. agreed to deploy one Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system in Seongju County, in the south of South Korea, by the end of 2017.

Known primarily for her children's books, she has also published poetry and fiction for adults.  Biography  Sheree Fitch was born on 3 December 1956 in Ottawa, Ontario, where her father was serving with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Her father was originally from Nova Scotia, and her mother was from Sussex, New Brunswick. Sheree is the eldest of three children. When she was less than a year old, the family moved to Miramichi, New Brunswick. Three years later they moved to Moncton, where they lived for ten years, and then to Fredericton. Sheree Fitch graduated from Fredericton High School in 1974 as her class's valedictorian. She married while still in her teens and had two sons, whom she raised as a single parent after divorcing at the age of 24. Sheree Fitch attended St. Thomas University in Fredericton as a mature student and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1987. She earned a Master of Arts in English from Acadia University in 1994. Her MA thesis was entitled \\"The Sweet Chorus of Ha, Ha, He!\\" Polyphony in utterature: A collection of writings on children's poetry. In it she coined the term \\"utterature\\" to refer to \\"all literature which depends upon the oral tradition and community of listeners\\". In the 1990s Sheree Fitch was based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where her second husband Gilles Plante worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 2001 he was transferred to Washington, D.C., and she spent almost 10 years there. Sheree Fitch and her husband now live in River John, Nova Scotia.  Writing for children  Sheree Fitch is best known as the author of children's poetry books characterized by \\"exuberant wordplay and humour\\". She began writing poems for her own young sons, and took creative writing courses to develop her skills. She performed her poems at schools and libraries for several years before her first book, Toes in My Nose, with illustrations by Molly Bobak, was published in 1987. Her second book, Sleeping Dragons All Around, was published in 1989 and won that year's Atlantic Booksellers' Choice Award. Its title comes from a line in the poem The Eve of St. Agnes, by John Keats. During the 1990s Doubleday Canada published several of Sheree Fitch's books of children's poetry, a number of which won awards. In 1992 There Were Monkeys in My Kitchen won the Canadian Children's Book Centre's Mr. Christie's Book Award for a book for children eight years and under. Her 1995 book Mabel Murple won the Ann Connor Brimer Award, and in 2000 she was awarded the Vicky Metcalf Award for Literature for Young People, which is presented to a Canadian author for a \\"body of work (at least four books) that, in the opinion of the judges, demonstrates the highest literary standards\\". If You Could Wear My Sneakers: A Book about Children's Rights, which was published in 1998, was commissioned by UNICEF. Its 15 poems are based on some of the articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the rights to education, privacy, free speech and protection from war. Canadian journalist and broadcaster Peter Gzowski wrote the foreword for the book, which won the Ontario Library Association's Silver Birch Award and the Atlantic Canadian Hackmatack Children's Choice Award. In the 2000s Sheree Fitch continued to publish books for young children, including her first board book, Kisses Kisses Baby-O, which was presented to the families of all babies born in Nova Scotia in 2008 as part of a family literacy program. She also expanded her range to the young adult fiction audience with her 2002 novel One More Step, followed by The Gravesavers in 2005. In addition to poetry and novels, Sheree Fitch has written two non-fiction books for children who are aspiring writers: Breathe, Stretch, Write: Learning to Write with Everything You've Got, and Writing Maniac: How I Grew up to be a Writer (And You Can Too).  Writing for adults  In 1993 Sheree Fitch's book of poetry for adults, In This House are Many Women, was published. It deals with serious issues in the lives of working- class women. The title refers to a sequence of poems set in a shelter for women escaping domestic violence. The author identifies strongly with the women in her poems, who are presented as survivors. Like her work for children, the adult poems play with words, but the material is darker, as in \\"Civil Servant\\", in which a receptionist in an unemployment office imagines herself as Saint Peter at the Pearly gates, asking her clients \\"Can I have your sin?\\" (i.e. Social Insurance Number). An expanded edition of In This House are Many Women was published in 2004. Sheree Fitch's first novel for adults, Kiss the Joy as it Flies, was published in 2008. The heroine is a single parent and a writer with \\"realistic financial and familial problems, who experiences dark times without losing her playfulness and humour\\". Kiss the Joy as it Flies was shortlisted for the 2009 Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour.  Literacy advocacy and honours  Sheree Fitch is active in the promotion of literacy, both through her writing and performing for children, and through her support of literacy organizations. In the 1990s she was a frequent guest and member of a discussion panel on Peter Gzowski's Morningside radio program on CBC Radio One. As a result, she became involved in the Peter Gzowski Invitational (PGI) golf tournaments, which raise funds for literacy organizations. She has often acted as the PGI tournament's poet laureate, including several times when the event was held in the Arctic. She is the Honorary Patron of the Literacy Coalition of New Brunswick (LCNB). The LCNB's Sheree Fitch Adult Learner Scholarship Awards, which are awarded annually, honour her commitment to the cause of literacy. She is also Honorary Spokesperson for the Nova Scotia Read to Me program. She sponsors the annual Sheree Fitch Prize for Young Writers awarded by the Writers' Federation of New Brunswick to a writer between 14 and 18 years old. Sheree Fitch was granted an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by Saint Mary's University in Halifax in May 1998. In May 2004 she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by Acadia University. St. Thomas University awarded her an honorary doctorate in May 2010, citing her contributions as an author, educator, and \\"tireless advocate for literacy\\".

After training in medicine and specialising in neurology in the late 1950s, he came to prominence in the early 1960s in the comedy revue Beyond the Fringe with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett. Miller began directing operas in the 1970s. His 1982 production of a \\"Mafia\\"-styled Rigoletto was set in 1950s Little Italy, Manhattan. In its early days, he was an associate director at the National Theatre. He later ran the Old Vic Theatre. As a writer and presenter of more than a dozen BBC documentaries, Miller became a television personality and public intellectual in Britain and the United States. Life and career = Early life = Miller grew up in St John's Wood, London, in a well-connected Jewish family. His father Emanuel (1892‚Äì1970), who was of Lithuanian descent and suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis, was a military psychiatrist and subsequently a paediatric psychiatrist at Harley House. His mother, Betty Miller (n√©e Spiro), was a novelist and biographer who was originally from County Cork, Ireland. Miller's older sister Sarah (died 2006) worked in television for many years and retained an involvement with Judaism that Miller, as an atheist, always eschewed. Miller was educated at Taunton School and St Paul's School, London where he developed an early (and ultimately lifelong) interest in the biological sciences. While at St Paul's School at the age of 12, Miller met and became close friends with Oliver Sacks and Oliver's best friend Eric Korn, friendships which remained crucial throughout the rest of their lives. In 1953, before leaving secondary school, he performed comedy several times on the BBC radio program Under Twenty Parade. Miller studied natural sciences and medicine at St John's College, Cambridge (MB BChir, 1959), where he was a member of the Cambridge Apostles before going on to train at University College Hospital in London. While studying medicine, Miller was involved in the Cambridge Footlights, appearing in the revues Out of the Blue (1954) and Between the Lines (1955). Good reviews for these shows, and for Miller's performances in particular, led to him performing on a number of radio and television shows while continuing his studies; these included appearances on Saturday Night on the Light, Tonight and Sunday Night at the London Palladium. He qualified as a medical doctor in 1959 and then worked as a hospital house officer for two years, including at the Central Middlesex Hospital as house physician for gastroenterologist Francis Avery Jones. =1960s: Beyond the Fringe= Miller (far right) in Beyond the Fringe on Broadway, with (from left) Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett and Peter Cook. Miller helped to write and produce the musical revue Beyond the Fringe, which premiered at the Edinburgh Festival in August 1960. This launched, in addition to his own, the careers of Alan Bennett, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Miller quit the show shortly after its move from London to Broadway in 1962, and took over as editor and presenter of the BBC's arts programme Monitor in 1965. The Monitor appointment arose because Miller had approached Huw Wheldon about taking up a place on the BBC's director training course. Wheldon assured him that he would \\"pick it up as he went along\\". Miller's first experience of directing a stage-play was for John Osborne, whose Under Plain Cover he directed in 1962.Heilpern, John, John Osborne: A Patriot for Us, 2007, Random House, pp.287. In 1964, he directed the play The Old Glory by the American poet Robert Lowell in New York City. It was the first play produced at the American Place Theatre and starred Frank Langella, Roscoe Lee Brown, and Lester Rawlins. The play won five Obie Awards in 1965 including an award for \\"Best American Play\\" as well as awards for Langella, Brown and Rawlins. He wrote, produced, and directed an adaptation for television of Alice in Wonderland (1966) for the BBC. He followed this with Whistle and I'll Come to You (1968) starring Michael Hordern, a television adaptation of M. R. James's 1904 ghost story \\"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\\". He produced a National Theatre Company production of The Merchant of Venice starring Sir Laurence Olivier. He later resigned as associate director. =1970s: Medical history and opera= Miller held a research fellowship in the history of medicine at University College London from 1970 to 1973. In 1974, he also started directing and producing operas for Kent Opera and Glyndebourne, followed by a new production of The Marriage of Figaro for English National Opera in 1978. Miller's other turns as an opera director included productions of Rigoletto (in 1975 and 1982) and the operetta The Mikado (in 1987). Miller drew upon his own experiences as a physician as writer and presenter of the BBC television series The Body in Question (1978),Closing Credits which caused some controversy for showing the dissection of a cadaver. For a time, he was a vice-president of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. =1980s: Shakespeare and neuropsychology= In 1980, Miller was persuaded to join the troubled BBC Television Shakespeare project (1978‚Äì85). He became producer (1980‚Äì82) and directed six of the plays himself, beginning with a well received Taming of the Shrew starring John Cleese. In the early 1980s, Miller was a popular and frequent guest on PBS' Dick Cavett Show. Miller wrote and presented the BBC television series, and accompanying book, States of Mind in 1983 and the same year directed Roger Daltrey as Macheath, the outlaw hero of the BBC's production of John Gay's 1728 ballad opera, The Beggar's Opera. He also became chair of Edinburgh Festival Fringe board of directors. In 1984, he studied neuropsychology with Dr. Sandra Witelson at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, before becoming a neuropsychology research fellow at the University of Sussex the following year. =1990s= In 1990, Miller wrote and presented a joint BBC/Canadian production entitled, Born Talking: A Personal Inquiry into Language. The four- part series looked into the acquisition of language, and complexities surrounding language production, with special focus on sign language used by deaf people. This interest was contemporaneous with his friend Oliver Sacks' immersion in, and writing/publishing a book about Deaf Culture and deaf people entitled Seeing Voices. Miller then wrote and presented the television series Madness (1991) and Jonathan Miller on Reflection (1998). The five-part Madness series ran on PBS in 1991. It featured a brief history of madness and interviews with psychiatric researchers, clinical psychiatrists, and patients in therapy sessions. In 1992, Opera Omaha staged the United States premiere of the Gioachino Rossini's 1819 opera Ermione, directed by Miller. =2000s: Atheism and return to directing= In 2004, Miller wrote and presented a television series on atheism entitled Atheism: A Rough History of Disbelief (more commonly referred to as Jonathan Miller's Brief History of Disbelief) for BBC Four, exploring the roots of his own atheism and investigating the history of atheism in the world. Individual conversations, debates and discussions for the series that could not be included due to time constraints were aired in a six-part series entitled The Atheism Tapes. He also appeared on a BBC Two programme in February 2004, called What the World Thinks of God appearing from New York. The original three-part series aired on public television in the United States in 2007. In 2007, Miller directed The Cherry Orchard at The Crucible, Sheffield, his first work on the British stage for 10 years. He also directed Monteverdi's L'Orfeo in Manchester and Bristol, and Der Rosenkavalier in Tokyo and gave talks throughout Britain during 2007 called An Audience with Jonathan Miller in which he spoke about his life for an hour and then fielded questions from the audience. He also curated an exhibition on camouflage at the Imperial War Museum. He appeared at the Royal Society of the Arts in London discussing humour (4 July 2007) and at the British Library on religion (3 September 2007). In January 2009, after a break of 12 years, Miller returned to the English National Opera to direct his own production of La Boh√®me, notable for its 1930s setting. This same production ran at the Cincinnati Opera in July 2010, also directed by Miller. =2010s= On 15 September 2010 Miller, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in The Guardian, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK. In April and May 2011, Miller directed Verdi's La Traviata in Vancouver, Canada, and in February and March 2012, Mozart's Cosi fan tutte in Washington, DC. On 25 November 2015 the University of London awarded Miller an honorary degree in Literature. Personal life Miller married Rachel Collet in 1956. They had two sons and a daughter.PROFILE : JONATHAN MILLER : What's eating the doc?

The term \\"French Jive\\" is occasionally used instead, reflecting the origins of the style, as is the term \\"Smooth Jive\\". The word \\"modern\\" distinguishes it from ballroom Jive. History Modern Jive was developed in the United Kingdom during the 1980s at three London clubs: Ceroc, Le Roc, and Cosmopolitan Jive. The style was based on a type of Jive that evolved in France after World War II when American dances such as the jitterbug were popular due to the presence of the American military.The Origins Of Modern Jive Modern Jive was not created in France, but its origin owes something to the French version of Le Bop. The dance commonly known as Modern Jive is different from Le Bop, a high tempo dance. Michel Ange Lau played a major role in the change from Le Bop to Modern Jive at a club called Centre Charles Peguy). Two British people, James Cronin and Christine Keeble, saw Le Bop in France and wanted to learn the dance when they returned to London. They were among Lau's students. The style of music played at discos was changing, and high tempo dances like Rock and Roll and Le Bop were becoming less popular. The change in music prompted the birth of Modern Jive; in 1980 Lau and the Le Bop dancers changed the timing of Le Bop, causing a revolution in the dance. This change in timing not only allowed Lau and his students to dance to a much larger variety of music but also to create more intricate moves.  What is Modern Jive?  Modern Jive adapts moves from other dance styles such as West Coast Swing, Salsa, Ballroom and Latin. The key to understanding Modern Jive is the beginner moves. These 20-plus moves continually reinforce the absolutes to the dance. The consistencies allow modern jive dancers to dance together, despite their preferences.  Modern Jive absolutes and consistencies  Due to Modern Jives unique timing it has the ability to be danced to a wide variety of tempos (extremes 60bpm - 180bpm, typically 110bpm - 140bpm, although this varies considerably with geography), and the dance is generally danced to 2 beats in 4. Danced to the stressed beats 1, 3, 5, & 7, it's on these beats the dancers are in position (moving through the less-stressed beats 2, 4, 6, & 8), e.g. a classical Yo Yo has 8 positions danced to 16 beats of music. The step back at the start of each move; this derived from the Rock Step and changed to a simple step back when the timing changed. The step back creates the in & out or concertina motion that many people consider to be an essential part of the dance style; both dancers step away from each other at the start of a move / pattern, to achieve tension and compression/extension in the connection point. This extension assists lead and follow technique, but perhaps more importantly the step back into extension is the consistent part that allows an infinite number of moves to be joined in any order, depending on which handhold or other connection the lead is using. The follows right hand is key to the dance, each beginner move starts with the follows right hand (sometimes both hands), whenever the follow spins or hand is released it's the right hand that's they needs to offer. The motion of the dance, for the majority of the beginner moves the follow steps in to the leads right side on count two (this is not always consistent at intermediate level moves, and the lead often signals with their right hand behind their back to bring the follow down the left side) e.g. Pretzel, (a lead technique can also be developed to bring the follow down the left hand side). Off phrase dancing, Modern Jive is a 'Off phrase' dance. This means a move does not always have to start on a particular beat e.g. beat 1 or beat 2 (Cha Cha) of the music ‚Äì this allows the massive flexibility, diversity, and high level of musicality that's often seen in the dance. Moves often have varying numbers of beats to them e.g. Catapult 8 counts (16 beats of music), Octopus 7 counts (14 beats of music).  Modern Jive popular variants  Dancing to slower tempos (in some groups referred to as Modern Jive Blues). Slower tempos in Modern Jive allow for more styling and musical interpretation. The slower tempo allows the follower to indicate when they want freestyle time, the dance can also use body leads at slower tempos and dancers often dance a lot closer. Dancing to slower music allows for a lot more two way communication, allowing more freedom, and music interpretation, however good Modern Jive dancers should be able to adapt their dancing and dance to a full spectrum of tempos. At higher tempos timing becomes more of a skill, where two way communication is reduced, at higher tempos musicality (e.g. hitting the music phrasing / breaks and interpreting the music), is more difficult to achieve as both dancers have to be in tune together but also with the music. Most dancers dancing Modern Jive Blues originate from Modern Jive and are familiar with Modern Jive Beginners moves and associated absolutes. Rotating Slot In the classical form, Modern Jive naturally rotates (normally clockwise). This is due to 2 or 3 consistencies that can be seen in the beginner moves and more often than not in the intermediate moves. a) the follow continually steps into the leads right side, causing a clockwise rotation ‚Äì rarely to the leads left side, b) Often on count three the follow is turned or spun clockwise (1st move basic, Yo Yo, Hatchback.....), c) a lot of the beginner moves finish with an anti clockwise return ‚Äì causing the follow to stabilise on the left foot stepping slightly to her left (clockwise), instead of directly back. This is Modern Jive danced in its natural form, and should not be confused with a really bad technique where the follow continually skips around the lead (also known as 'Roundy Roundy' in the UK), despite his lead. This 'Roundy Roundy' style is often found at higher tempos by inexperienced follow dancers and is totally different from the slightly rotating slot (of the natural dance). Slotted dancing Over roughly the last decade, Modern Jive has been influenced by West Coast Swing, an American partner dance developed from Lindy Hop with the addition of the 'slot' meaning it is danced up and down an imaginary line. As WCS teaching tends to be more technique focused, it tends to attract experienced dancers from Modern Jive, who then bring elements of the dance back into M-J. The slot concept is one that has taken a hold in Modern Jive and is now very often taught even from beginner level, although more commonly in the Ceroc franchise venues and other groups that run competitions, than independents such as LeRoc. Dancing slotted allows the follow (and lead) to always complete a full turn, which helps to avoid dizziness, and has many other technical advantages. However, some dancers find that at high tempos (140BPM and above) it is easier to abandon the slot and revert to a rotational style. These dancers find that many of the older Modern Jive moves done in the classical form, such as the YoYo, the Catapult and the Push Spin work better at higher tempos, and are less suitable for slow tempos (100BPM or lower) where other moves and a more elastic style of dancing are more appropriate. When Modern Jive tends to be danced rotationally, it is still often taught on stage in two directions, to allow large classes to observe the instruction and instructors often compensate to be seen. In these classes, directional leads are often not taught effectively at beginner level (even at intermediate level), and so as soon as the class goes to freestyle dancing the dancers start to rotate in a rotating slot style. For these groups, dancing in the slot is an advanced technique / preference that can be developed and adds another dimension to Modern Jive, and it also looks impressive when a group of dancers are dancing slotted in the same area in the same direction. Where Modern Jive tends to be danced slotted by default, slotted dancing tends to be taught rather more effectively, and it's reinforced in social dancing where it is possible to pack many more people onto a dance floor more safely if they are all dancing slotted. These groups have also tended to modify older moves slightly from the classical form, in order to take advantage of the known direction of momentum and other technical advantages of the slotted form. Presenting forward / Blocking Presenting forward is a skill often developed by professionals, competition dancers and showcase dancers and requires further skills and additional techniques. Here the dancers develop the skill of presenting in one consistent direction (usually forward or towards an audience as compared to facing each other). Dips, drops, poses, exiting moves / lifts and even smiling consistently in one direction in order to present the best possible picture to spectators, judges and/or audiences are all factors.  Branding  The term Modern Jive was coined in 1990 by Christine Keeble on a program called 'How to Jive', designed to promulgate this new style of jive. At that time the dance was known variously as Ceroc, LeRoc, or French Jive. Christine Keeble used the term 'modern jive' to encompass all of these names. The term 'modern jive' was adopted, despite the absence of chasse or triple step (typical of \\"real\\" jive forms). Various clubs used the umbrella term as the dance spread out from its two earliest centres of London and Bristol and it later became accepted as a generic term for the dance. It is now used by a large number of independent teachers across the UK and internationally. It is also used by many of the franchise operators, although these companies often still prefer to use their own branding.  Organizations  In the English-speaking world, Modern Jive classes and events are often franchised or run under various brand names, including, Jive Addiction, Blitz, DanceJive, ViBe Dance Nights, \\"Revolution Dance\\" Northwest, Ceroc, LeRoc, Ginger Jive, Mo'Jive, Cloud9, Jiveasy, South Coast Modern Jive, The Thing, and others. Beyond the bounds of the English- speaking world, modern jive has still to make a significant impact. In Europe there are JiveNation Poland in Poland, M-Jive and Jive.Berlin in Germany and Leroc Z√ºrich and Modern Jive Z√ºrich in Switzerland which are slowly bringing the dance style to a wider audience. Following a different but similar evolutionary path, dance styles such as Discofox (in Germany and Switzerland and derived from Foxtrott ) and Bugg (found in Sweden) may sometimes be indistinguishable from the Modern Jive found in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Dance moves While these forms of Modern Jive have Swing and Rock- and-Roll dance moves in common, moves from many forms of dance including Salsa and Tango may be included, according to the specific franchise or even the particular dance teacher. Because of its eclectic nature there are hundreds of moves and variations that can be learnt, introduced or adapted. Although dance routines are developed and rehearsed for competitions, Modern Jive is most frequently danced freestyle, providing additional challenges to more advanced dancers in terms of musical interpretation and expression; which is why some Modern Jive dancers prefer Blues Music, drawing out the move and allowing the follow to improvise and partake in the dance (as opposed to being dragged around the floor). =Move naming= Different franchises or teachers often have different names for identical moves, and different signals to indicate the next move. The Man's Spin taught at one venue may be identical to the Man's Pass taught by a different venue. Due to its origins, Modern Jive moves may be similar to moves from other dance styles; the First Move Triple Steps in Modern Jive is similar to the Lindy Hop Jockey, for example. Despite this there is rarely a problem dancing with people who have been taught other styles, at least with the less advanced moves. A solid lead is better than using a signal (which may only be suited to one dance style); thus allowing good follows to dance regardless of the learning style. =Lead variations= Like many Western partner dances, Modern Jive is most often a male-led dance. The gender of the lead is irrelevant to the technique required, however many moves are more easily led by a taller lead on a shorter follow, and thus a shorter lead will need to modify their lead and the move to allow for the differences in angle, or choose different moves that are more easily led by them. Modern Jive is also occasionally danced by three dancers, with one lead and two followers (a variant known as \\"Double Trouble\\" in the UK or \\"Triples\\" in Australia/New Zealand). It can also be danced with two leads smoothly and continuously swapping with each other to dance with one follow, or two follows doing the same with one lead (known in the UK as \\"Tag\\", and in Australia/New Zealand as \\"Swaps 'n' Steals\\") = Step footwork vs rock footwork = Many of the Australian offshoots of Ceroc transitioned to a footwork coined \\"Step\\" in about 1995. The original \\"rock\\" footwork specifies a step back with either foot, transferring the weight to the moved foot on each of the odd numbered beats (1, 3, 5, 7) The moved foot is returned to its starting position on the even beats. (2, 4, 6, 8). \\"Step\\" footwork specifies that the leader takes a step back with the right foot on the half beat or \\"and\\" count and \\"closes\\", stepping backwards with the left foot on the numbered count. \\"closing\\" implies that the feet end up close together. On the next count the leader steps forward with their right foot on the \\"and\\" count and closes with their left on the numbered count. The follower mirrors this by stepping back on their left and \\"closing\\" with their right and then stepping forward with their left and closing with their right. Rock footwork was originally offered as a \\"beginner\\" footwork in Australia. More recently it has been dropped. The reason for it being dropped is pedagogical. The problem appeared to be that the transition from beginner to intermediate dancer (so-called) meant one had to \\"unlearn\\" one and then \\"re-learn\\" another rhythm and weight change components of the dance. Unfortunately, the \\"rock\\" footwork is actually more suited to fast music (leaning towards \\"advanced\\" dancers) as it reduces the number of weight changes required during any rhythm unit. Thus, the preference for \\"step\\" footwork has reduced the \\"terminal velocity\\" modern jive can be danced at - because it forces a weight change every beat. Music Modern Jive is generally danced to music with four beats to the bar (Quadruple or Common time), from latest chart hits to big band music and everything between, in a wide variety of tempos from slow to very fast. Some teachers or franchises may concentrate on particular musical styles, such as swing. Music is typically between 108 and 160 bpm. Experienced jivers occasionally dance to music outside those broad constraints.  Weekenders  Around the world there are a number of \\"weekenders\\" (short dance-focused holidays, typically running from Friday - Monday) running annually. Jive Time originally started weekenders in the UK but now Ceroc run the majority of the weekenders; with independent organisers still running a number of other weekender events, such as the Jive Addiction, Jive Time or MJ Roc events.  Competitions  Modern Jive competitions are typically judged based on the following criteria: * Musicality * Content & execution * Style & Technique * Presentation Depending on how the scoring is done, the judges may award marks for each of these, or may just give an overall mark or place, based on considering each of these factors. = UK competitions = As of 2015, Modern Jive Competitions in the United Kingdom include: * UK Contemporary Blues & Smooth Dance Champs, Huddersfield (February) * World Modern Jive Champs, Blackpool (March) * English Modern Jive Champs Horsham (April)English Modern Jive Champs * Ceroc Champs, London (May) * Ceroc Northern Champs, Manchester (June) * International Open Modern Jive Championships, Dorking (July) * Ceroc Welsh Champs, Cardiff (September) * European Blues Open Championships, (Ceroc Breeze) (October) * Britroc, London (October) * Ceroc Scotland Champs, Edinburgh (November) * UK Modern Jive Champs, Whitby (November) * Ceroc Midlands Champs, Stoke-on-Trent (November) = New Zealand competitions = As of 2019, Modern Jive Competitions in New Zealand include: * Cerocmania Weekend, Auckland (March) * Christchurch Modern Jive Champs, Christchurch (April) * Waikato Ceroc Champs, Tamahere (May) * Ceroc Coast to Coast Weekend, Tauranga (June) * iDance Classic Champs, Wellington (June) * Auckland Ceroc Champs, Auckland (September) * iDance Simply Dance Weekend, Wellington (October) * Ceroc Jurassic Jam, Auckland (October) * Ceroc NZ National Champs, Auckland (November) = Australian competitions = As of 2019, Modern Jive Competitions in Australia include: * SummerJive, Canberra (February) *Victorian Modern Jive Championships, Melbourne (May) * Australian Ceroc Dance Championships, Sydney (June) * Gold Coast Champs, Gold Coast (July) * IGNITE Queensland Modern Jive Championships, Gold Coast (August) *DanceMAD, Melbourne (November) = Other competitions = Ceroc Pan Asia Dance Championships, various (October) Some competition categories are more serious (Freestyle and Dance With A Stranger) while others are more about having fun (Battle of the Sexes, Steals).

As of January 30, 2009 development was halted with no plans to resume its development. In August 2013, developer Robert Szeleney announced the release of a public beta on the SkyOS website. This allows public users to download a Live CD of the SkyOS operating system, for testing and to optionally install the system.  History  A very early version of SkyOS Another early version of SkyOS Development started in 1996 with the first version released in December 1997. Up until version 4.x the OS was freely available. Starting with beta development of SkyOS 5 in 2003, users were required to pay US$30 to get access to beta releases. SkyOS adapted new filesystem SkyFS based on OpenBFS in 2004 and its graphics subsystem was improved in 2006 with support for desktop compositing including double buffering and transparency. The OS also moved to ELF binaries then. The last beta build 6947 was released in August 2008 and there was no status update for several months. As the OS was mainly the work of one man, Robert Szeleney, there was increasing difficulty to add new device drivers. Considering lack of development under Robert Szeleney, going open source was viewed by the tech press as the best option for SkyOS. Although Szeleney tried to bypass the lack of drivers by using a new kernel based on Linux or NetBSD, and reported some progress in this regard, development has not resumed. SkyOS website disappeared in 2013 and final public build from August 2008 was released for free shortly thereafter.  Features  SkyOS Beta 4 SkyOS Beta 8 SkyOS Build 6796 = Kernel = SkyOS is a Unix-like operating system with a monolithic kernel. The OS supports multiple users and symmetric multiprocessing. = Graphics and GUI = SkyOS has an integrated graphics subsystem with support for desktop compositing including double buffering and transparency. SkyOS GUI also allows system-wide mouse gestures. = SkyFS = SkyFS is a fork of the OpenBFS filesystem. SkyOS can also be run from the following filesystems: * FAT32/FAT16/FAT12 * ISO 9660 = Fast searching = SkyOS offers real-time file content query searches with multiple keywords (comparable to Beagle in GNU/Linux or Spotlight in macOS), including indexing of files and programs.  Porting applications  Most command-line applications that were written to be compiled with the GNU Toolchain can be ported to SkyOS with little or no modification. SkyOS contains several frameworks for creating applications (including Mono port). Ported applications include Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, Nvu, GIMP and AbiWord. There was also a monetary incentive for porting applications as the SkyOS community voted for desired programs and then supported developers with donations.  Reception  Although SkyOS includes many interesting features, limited application and hardware support are among its weaknesses (e.g. only a few graphics cards allow 2D acceleration). Kernel and drivers updates were solely worked on by Szeleney, and because of this he was unable to keep up with new devices. This was one of the reasons the development ended for this project. In the end, the OS was not able to expand beyond a small albeit dedicated user community. Apart from a short early open source time period, the OS had a proprietary licence with a commercial model based on paid beta-testing. This led to some controversy as SkyOS developers were accused of unauthorized use of open source software. No proof of any wrongdoing was given, but the public image of the OS was tarnished nevertheless.

He served on the Politburo Standing Committee, the country's top ruling body, from 2002 to 2007. During that time he also served as the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, the party's anti-graft body. He had a lengthy political career, having served as mayor of Wuhan, Governor then Party Secretary of Jiangxi, then party chief of Shandong. Wu retired in 2007 and left public life. Career Wu was born in Yugan County, Jiangxi province. He joined the Communist Party of China in March 1963. Wu graduated from the department of thermal engineering at Beijing's Tsinghua University in 1968, where he studied thermal measurement and automated controls. He was then sent to Wuhan during the Cultural Revolution to work as a shop floor technician at the Gedian Chemical Engineering factory, where he was promoted to supervisor a few years later. Wu served as the mayor of Wuhan from 1983 to 1986. He became the governor of his native province Jiangxi in 1986 after the removal of Ni Xiance by the provincial People's Congress. He was later promoted to Jiangxi party chief and served between 1995 and 1997. He moved to Shandong in 1997 to become the party chief of the province and was made a full member of the Politburo the same year. It was said that Zeng Qinghong, a major confidant of then party General Secretary and President Jiang Zemin, was fond of Wu's work, and recommended him for further elevation, resulting in his promotion to the Politburo in 1997. Thereafter, Wu was known to have cultivated good relationships with both Jiang Zemin and his putative successor Hu Jintao. Wu and Hu graduated in the same year, both of them alumni of Tsinghua University. Some sources considered him to be Hu's ally, while other consider him to be Jiang's. As a result, he was sometimes included in the list of people in the Shanghai clique. In 2002, Wu joined the Politburo Standing Committee as the head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's anti- graft agency. Wu was seen as an easy compromise candidate since he had \\"cross- factional appeal\\". In 2009, a judge in Spain's Audiencia Nacional indicted Wu and four other officials for genocide against Falun Gong, though later legislation was passed limiting the impact of the ruling.\\"La Audiencia pide interrogar al ex presidente chino Jiang por genocidio\\", El Mundo, 14 Nov 2009 See also *Politics of the People's Republic of China External links *Wu Guanzheng biography @ China Vitae, online database of China VIPs * Biography of Wu Guanzheng, People's Daily Online References Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Governors of Jiangxi Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Jiangxi Category:Mayors of Wuhan Category:Tsinghua University alumni Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Jiangxi Category:Politicians from Shangrao Category:Political office-holders in Shandong Category:Secretaries of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Category:Members of the 16th Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Members of the 15th Politburo of the Communist Party of China ","title":"Wu Guanzheng"},{"id":"262789","text":"Judith Ariana Fitzgerald (11 November 1952 ‚Äì 25 November 2015) was a Canadian poet and journalist.

It originally developed two programs for media streaming, VideoLAN Client (VLC) and VideoLAN Server (VLS), but most of the features of VLS have been incorporated into VLC, with the result renamed VLC media player. The VideoLAN project began as a student endeavor at √âcole Centrale Paris (France), but after releasing the software under the free software/open source GNU General Public License, the project is now multinational with a development team spanning 40 nations.VideoLAN team contact list The project has been completely separated from √âcole Centrale Paris since 2009 when it was constituted as a non-profit organization. The current President of the VideoLAN non-profit organization is Jean-Baptiste Kempf, who is also one of the project's developers. Projects =VLC= VLC (standing for VideoLAN Client) is a portable multimedia player, encoder, and streamer supporting many audio and video codecs and file formats as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols. It is able to stream over networks and to transcode multimedia files and save them into various formats. It is one of the most platform- independent players available, with versions for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Linux, BeOS, BSD, Solaris, Chrome OS, and is widely used with over 2.1 billion downloads as of September 2017. =VLMC= VLMC (standing for VideoLAN Movie Creator) is a cross-platform, non-linear, video editing software application based on the VLC Media Player. The software is still in early development. The latest version is 0.2.0 (released 2014-10-30), released under the GPLv2 license. =VLS= The VLS (standing for VideoLAN Server) project was originally intended to be used as a server for streaming videos. But now, it has been merged with the VLC project and use of VLS is not encouraged. =Codecs= The VideoLAN project also hosts several audio/video decoding and decryption libraries, such as libdvdcss which allows the content of CSS protected DVDs to be unscrambled, x264 which can encode H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video, x265 which can encode HEVC video, x262 which can encode MPEG-2 video, dav1d which can decode AV1 video, libdca which can decode DTS audio, and the git repository of the multimedia framework FFmpeg. =VLMa= A new project has been developed, called VLMa (standing for VideoLAN Manager). VLMa is an application to manage broadcasts of TV channels, received through digital terrestrial or satellite ways. Its interface is provided as a web-site written in Java. It is also capable of streaming audio and video files. VLMa consists of a daemon (called VLMad) and a web interface (called VLMaw). VLMa is released under the GNU General Public License like VLC media player. =VLC media player Skin Editor= The VLC Skin Editor is a simple program developed by VideoLAN. The simple interface allows users to create new skins for the VLC media player without knowledge of the VLC Skins2 XML System. The program lets users change features on the main window, playlist window, and equalizer window. The current version is 2.0.8 and can be downloaded on the videolan.org website. Commercial use In May 2008, Neuros Technology and Texas Instruments began work on a port of VideoLAN to their next generation open set-top box.VLC Port to Neuros Linux VLC is currently used in products through the use of libVLC and also as raw or customized VLC for Android versions on devices. Some features have been publicly merged, such as 360¬∞ support. Opposition to software-bundling VideoLAN developers have expressed dismay at how users searching for their products see search advertising from websites that use unwanted software bundling to modify official download files with wrappers that include unwanted programs.

Unlike circle dancing, line dancers are not in physical contact with each other. Line dancing is practiced and learned in country-western dance bars, social clubs, dance clubs and ballrooms. It is sometimes combined on dance programs with other forms of country-western dance, such as two-step, western promenade dances, and as well as western-style variants of the waltz, polka and swing. Line dances have accompanied many popular music styles since the early 1970s including pop, swing, rock and roll, disco, Latin (salsa suelta), rhythm and blues and jazz. Dances like the Cha Cha Slide, Electric Slide, and Cupid Shuffle are a few of the line dances that have consistently remained part of modern American culture for years. The term \\"modern line dance\\" is now used in many line dance clubs around the world to indicate the styles of dance that will be taught will include a mix from all genres, including pop, Latin, Irish, big band and country. It indicates clubs who no longer wear western style clothing or boots. Participants dress in casual clothing and often wear dance trainers. These clubs are helping to encourage younger people into the pastime by often dancing to music they will be familiar with. History Line dancing at Wikimania 2016 in Esino Lario \\"Line dancing is most directly descended from the 1970s disco era, when America saw a variety of new dances emerge\\", including the Electric Slide, \\"in this same era, country-and-western line dancing emerged\\", including the Walkin' Wazi and the Cowboy Boogie. \\"Some claim that line dancing finds its roots in historical folk dances; other say it stemmed from contemporary disco. Whatever its source, popularity and growth of line dancing has been inextricably tied to country-and-western music.\\" Since its birth, \\"line dancing began incorporating many musical styles besides country...Country music began to appear on the pop charts, and line dancing began to cross boundaries of income, race, age, and gender...Now line dancing is considered an art form of its own, with its own terminology and standardized steps.\\" \\"If you were to ask 10 people with some knowledge of when line dancing began, you'd probably get 10 different answers\\", including: * \\"In the 1800s, European immigrants traveled west to North America, bringing with them a wealth of culture, including such native dances as the polka and waltz, whose movements joined and evolved into what was called round and square dancing. Many believe that this style of dancing introduced the terms and steps used in country line dancing today.\\" * \\"Some people feel it was the cowboys on the western frontier, from the 1860s to the 1890s, that took these more traditional dance moves and assimilated them into a country-western style.\\" * \\"Other believe that the settlers of the western states, such as Texas and Oklahoma, should be with the simple footwork and the country flair that reflects the culture of their time.\\" * \\"In the early 1900s, schools began to include folk dancing in their physical education programs. Many believe that American servicemen returning home from war influenced the spread of line dancing after being introduced to traditional European folk dances. As large numbers of youth learned country-western dance, its popularity grew in leisure and social activities.\\" * There are those, \\"who believe that the real popularity of line dancing evolved from the disco era. ... Line dances were performed to disco-style music.\\" * \\"Many say that 'Achy Breaky Heart' was a major turning point in the popularity of line dance.\\" * Some say it started out in the slums of Calcutta; the intricate and diverse range of movement were used as a form of silent communication. This travelled across the turbulent seas to the west coast of America, on trade ships, where its popularity increased. It is not documented when the communication aspect was dropped. =1950s‚Äì1970s= The Madison was a popular line dance in the late 1950s. The 1961 \\"San Francisco Stomp\\" meets the definition of a line dance.Teaching of Popular Dance. Virgil L. Morton. 1965. J Lowell Pratt & Company. pages 50-52. LoC# 66-29892 At least five line dances that are strongly associated with country-western music were written in the 1970s, two of which are dated to 1972: \\"Walkin' Wazi\\" and \\"Cowboy Boogie\\", five years before the disco craze created by the release of Saturday Night Fever in 1977, the same (approximate) year the \\"Tush Push\\" was created. The Electric Slide was a Disco-based line dance created and popularized in the mid-1970s. The \\"L.A. Hustle\\" began in a small Los Angeles disco in the Summer of 1975, and hit the East Coast (with modified steps) in Spring of '76 as the \\"Bus Stop\\".The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing. Karen L. Lustgarten. 1978. Warner Books. page 86. \\"The Bus Stop is a new version of a group dance called the Madison\\" according to Ebony Jr. Nov 1978 page 27 Another 70s line dance is the Nutbush. =1980s= Over a dozen line dances were created during the 1980s for country songs. The 1980 film Urban Cowboy reflected the blurring of lines between country music and pop, and spurred renewed interest in country culture, and western fashion, music, and dance. Many early line dances, though, were adaptations of disco line dances.Boot Scootin'. Joel Ruminer with Jimmie Ruth White. Rose Publishing Company. 1981. page 48.\\"Boot Scootin' Boogie\\" was choreographed by Bill Bader in October 1990 for the original Asleep at the Wheel recording of the song of the same name. The Brooks and Dunn version of the song has resulted in there being at least 16 line dances with \\"Boot Scootin' Boogie\\" in the title, including one by Tom Mattox and Skippy Blair under contract to the recording company. The Chicken Dance is an example of a line dance adopted by the Mod revival during the 1980s. =1990s= Billy Ray Cyrus' 1992 hit \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\" helped catapult western line dancing into the mainstream public consciousness. In 1994 choreographer Max Perry had a worldwide dance hit with \\"Swamp Thang\\" for the song \\"Swamp Thing\\" by The Grid. This was a techno song that fused banjo sounds in the melody line and helped to start a trend of dancing to forms of music other than country. In this mid 1990s period country western music was influenced by the popularity of line dancing. This influence was so great that Chet Atkins was quoted as saying \\"The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing.\\"The Roots of Country Music Collectors Edition by Life September 1, 1994 Max Perry, along with Jo Thompson Szymanski, Scott Blevins and several others, began to use ballroom rhythms and technique to take line dancing to the next level. In 1997, the band Steps created further interest outside of the U.S. with the techno dance song \\"5,6,7,8\\". In 1999 the Gap retailer debuted the \\"Khaki Country\\" ad on the Academy Awards ceremony. Line dancers performed to the 1999 version of \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" by Dwight Yoakam.

Participation The global number of participants is difficult to establish, however, it is arguably in the many millions if not tens of millions. The participants are often linked together by social media and line dance themed websites. These sites offer step sheets and videos demonstrating various dances to specific songs. It is very normal for YouTube demonstration and teaching videos of a specific dance to receive millions of views. =2000s= There are now many well developed websites devoted to the publication of instructional videos and stepsheets. The community of dancers are very connected on social media sites. Wall Each dance is said to consist of a number of walls. A wall is the direction in which the dancers face at any given time: the front (the direction faced at the beginning of the dance), the back or one of the sides. Dancers may change direction many times during a sequence, and may even, at any given point, be facing in a direction half-way between two walls; but at the end of the sequence they will be facing the original wall or any of the other three. Whichever wall that is, the next iteration of the sequence uses that wall as the new frame of reference.Lane, Christy (2000/1995). Christy Lane's Complete Book of Line Dancing, p.2-4. Human Kinetics. . * In a one-wall dance, the dancers face the same direction at the end of the sequence as at the beginning (either no turn or a full turn, 360 degrees). * In a two-wall dance, repetitions of the sequence end alternately at the back and front walls. In other words, the dancers have effectively turned through 180 degrees during one set (half turn). The samba line dance is an example of a two-wall dance. While doing the \\"volte\\" step, the dancers turn 180 degrees to face a new wall. * In a four-wall dance, the direction faced at the end of the sequence is 90 degrees to the right or left from the direction in which they faced at the beginning (quarter turn). As a result, the dancers face each of the four walls in turn at the end of four consecutive repetitions of the sequence, before returning to the original wall. The hustle line dance is an example of a four- wall dance because in the final figure they turn 90 degrees to the left to face a new wall. In some dances, they turn 270 degrees, a \\"three-quarter turn,\\" to face the new wall.

During his long career, he represented a mixed range of clients. Clifford was arrested in December 2012 on suspicion of sexual offences, as part of Operation Yewtree. He was tried in March 2014 and found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault on four girls and women aged between 15 and 19. On 2 May 2014, he was sentenced to eight years in prison, and from 7 November 2014 served his sentence at HM Prison Littlehey. He died on 10 December 2017, three days after suffering a heart attack. Early life Maxwell Frank Clifford was born in Kingston upon ThamesMax Clifford and Angela Levin Max Clifford: Read All About it! Virgin Books, 2005, () on 6 April 1943, the son of Lilian (n√©e Boffee) and electrician Frank Clifford. He was the youngest of four children, with one sister and two brothers. The family survived their father's regular bouts of unemployment, gambling, and alcoholism with the help and support of their grandmother and Clifford's sister, who was employed as a PA to the London Vice-President of Morgan Guarantee Trust Bank. Clifford left school at 15 with no qualifications, and he was sacked within four months of his first job at Ely's department store in Wimbledon. His brother Bernard used his print union connections to secure Clifford a job as editorial assistant on the Eagle. When the publication moved premises, Clifford decided to take redundancy, buying his first house and finding work with the South London Press to train as a journalist. Career =Early work as a publicist= After working in newspapers for a few years, writing an occasional record/music column and running a disco, Clifford replied to an advertisement and joined as the second member of the EMI press office in 1962, under Chief Press Officer Syd Gillingham. As the youngest and the only trained journalist in a team of four, Clifford claimed he was given the job of promoting the then relatively unknown Beatles, including during their first tour of the United States. After Gillingham left EMI, he asked Clifford to join him at Chris Hutchins's PR agency. Among the artists they represented were Paul and Barry Ryan, who introduced Clifford to their stepfather, impresario Harold Davidson, who handled the UK affairs of Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland. In 1970, aged 27, and after Gillingham retired, Clifford left Hutchins and started his own agency, Max Clifford Associates. Based in the offices of Joe Cocker's manager, he started off by representing Sinatra, Cocker, Paul and Barry Ryan, Don Partridge, and Marvin Gaye. He later also represented Muhammad Ali and Marlon Brando. =Pamella Bordes= Clifford was approached by a friendly madam of a brothel who had provided one of Clifford's clients with various services, worried about publicity from an investigative reporter from the News of the World. Clifford asked the madam to reveal details of her girls and clients, and found that one prostitute, Pamella Bordes, was simultaneously dating Andrew Neil (then editor of The Sunday Times), Donald Trelford (then editor of The Observer), Conservative minister for sport Colin Moynihan, and billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi.Summerskill, Bill (28 July 2002). \\"Paper tiger\\". The Observer (London). Retrieved 14 November 2006.Roy, Amit (9 October 2005). \\"A trip down memory lane\\" . The Telegraph (Calcutta). Retrieved 14 November 2006. Clifford rang News of the World editor Patsy Chapman and drip-fed her the story of Bordes through the investigative reporter she was using on the madam. The story was published in March 1989 under the headline \\"Call Girl Works in Commons\\", since it was discovered she had a House of Commons security pass arranged by MPs David Shaw and Henry Bellingham. Clifford claims Bordes was never his client, and that he earned his fee for \\"writing\\" the story, which ultimately served the purpose of saving the madam from any adverse publicity or court case. =Clients= Clifford came to public attention after creating the infamous \\"Freddie Starr ate my hamster\\" headline for The Sun in an effort to draw attention to his client, Freddie Starr. In May 2006 the BBC nominated \\"Freddie Starr ate my hamster\\" as one of the most familiar British newspaper headlines over the last century. Clifford later represented various clients, including former Liverpool left-wing politician Derek Hatton, for whom Clifford created an affair to change his image; O. J. Simpson‚ÄîClifford claimed to have received death threats while acting as his publicist; Gillian McKeith, whose adverts he believed harmed her image; Rebecca Loos, when she negotiated with the press about her alleged affair with England football captain David Beckham; and Jade Goody, during the reality star's cervical cancer and death. Clifford represented Simon Cowell for over a decade and was credited with shaping his public image; Cowell dropped Clifford following Clifford's 2014 conviction. In 2016, a judge awarded former client Paul Burrell ¬£5,000 damages after Burrell sued Clifford, saying that Clifford forwarded private material in a fax to Rebekah Brooks at News of the World in 2002. Journalist Louis Theroux followed Clifford in the BBC Two 2002 programme When Louis Met ... Max Clifford. During filming, it appeared that Clifford was trying to set up Theroux during a PR stunt in Sainsbury's. It backfired after Clifford was heard lying on his microphone, unaware it was still on. Clifford represented a witness in the case against Gary Glitter. In 2005, Clifford paid damages to settle defamation proceedings brought by Neil and Christine Hamilton after he represented Nadine Milroy-Sloane, who was later found to have falsely accused the pair of sexual assault. Also in 2005, he told reporters that he would not represent Michael Jackson after he was found not guilty of child abuse charges, saying: \\"It would be the hardest job in PR after [representing] Saddam Hussein\\". Following the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, but prior to his arrest, Clifford claimed that dozens of \\"big name stars\\" contacted him and feared they would become implicated in the scandal; he claimed that in the 1960s and 70s they \\"never asked for anybody's birth certificate\\" before having sex. LGBT clients Clifford helped clients who wished to conceal their sexual orientation from the public. He claimed that he was approached twice by major football clubs to help make players present a \\"straight\\" image. In an interview with Pink News, reported on 5 August 2009, Clifford said that if a gay or bisexual football player came out, his career would be over: > To my knowledge there is only one top-flight professional gay footballer who > came out ‚Äì Justin Fashanu. He ended up committing suicide. I have been > advising a top premiership star who is bisexual. If it came out that he had > gay tendencies, his career would be over in two minutes. Should it be? No, > but if you go on the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind > of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost like going back to > the dark ages. Clifford said none of his clients had been outed. In December 2009, he told The Independent on Sunday that he had represented two high-profile Premier League footballers in the past five years whom he advised to stay in the closet because football \\"remains in the dark ages, steeped in homophobia\\". =Politics= Clifford stated that what motivated him was much more than just money; he said he could not stand hypocrisy in public life, reserved a particular disgust for lying politicians, and watched with growing anger what he thought happened to the NHS over the past 20 years. For this reason, and because of his working-class background, Clifford was a traditional Labour supporter who worked to bring down the government of John Major because he felt that the National Health Service was being mismanaged. The Major government In light of Clifford's view of the deteriorating state of the NHS ‚Äì having obtained treatment for his daughter, who has juvenile idiopathic arthritis ‚Äì and moral differences with members of the John Major government, Clifford worked to expose stories to help the Labour Party to power. Although not instrumental in exposing David Mellor's affair with Antonia de Sancha, Clifford's battle in representing de Sancha against the contrived post-spin story of the \\"family man Mellor\\" handled by counter PR Tim Bell ultimately derailed Major's 'Back to Basics' agenda. Clifford invented the story which claimed Mellor made love in a Chelsea F.C. football kit, though he was blocked from mentioning it in his memoirs.Guy Adams \\"Pandora: 'Sun' shines on Chelsea fan Mellor\\", The Independent, 26 April 2006, as reproduced on the Find Articles website. Retrieved 26 March 2009. Clifford also helped to expose Jeffrey Archer's perjury in the 1980s during his candidacy for the post of Mayor of London. On 18 February 1995 he was interviewed at length by Andrew Neil for his one-on-one interview show Is This Your Life?, made by Open Media for Channel 4.Listing on IMDb The Blair government Although a supporter of the Labour party, Clifford's approach in dealing with the Blair government was similar to that which he employed with Major's preceding Conservative government. The first instance of this was the story of Welsh Assembly leader Ron Davies. Then Clifford was accused by David Blunkett at the beginning of November 2005 of having a role in Blunkett's second resignation. This derived from claims made on behalf of a much younger woman, who had become involved with Blunkett, over Blunkett's business interests, which were published in The Times. Later that week, Clifford was accused of arranging a distraction from the assault made by his friend Rebekah Wade on her husband, EastEnders actor Ross Kemp, via the \\"coincidence\\" of the other \\"Mitchell brother\\", Steve McFadden being in a similar incident with an ex-partner. Clifford denied all responsibility. On 26 April 2006, Clifford represented John Prescott's diary secretary Tracey Temple, in selling her story for \\"an awful lot more\\" than ¬£100,000 to the Mail on Sunday. The story was about the affair between Prescott and Temple which took place between 2002 and 2004. On 4 May 2006, Clifford announced his intention to expose politicians who fail to abide by the standards expected of them in public office. He called his team of undercover investigators \\"a dedicated and loyal bunch\\". =Charity works= According to his memoirs he handled the publicity for the Daniels family and helped set up the Rhys Daniels Trust from resultant media fees to combat Batten disease. Clifford was also a patron of the Royal Marsden; but after his conviction, staff at the hospital stated he was no longer a patron. Also, following his 2014 conviction for indecent assault, Shooting Star CHASE and Woking and Sam Beare Hospices announced that Clifford was no longer a patron for either charity. Indecent assault convictions Clifford reading a statement following his arrest Clifford was arrested at his home on 6 December 2012 by Metropolitan Police officers on suspicion of sexual offences; the arrest was part of Operation Yewtree which was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal. He was taken to a central London police station for questioning. The two alleged offences dated from 1977. On 26 April 2013, he was charged with a further eleven indecent assaults between 1966 and 1985 on girls and women aged 14 to 19. Clifford claimed the allegations were \\"completely false\\". On 28 May 2013, Clifford pleaded not guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court; a hearing took place at Southwark Crown Court on 12 June 2013 when a date for his trial was set for 4 March 2014. On 28 April 2014, Clifford was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault against four victims by a jury at Southwark Crown Court. He was acquitted of two charges of indecent assault, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on another charge. Following the verdict the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's Director of National Services Peter Watt stated: > Max Clifford has rightly been unmasked as a ruthless and manipulative sex > offender who preyed for decades on children and young women. On 2 May 2014, Judge Anthony Leonard sentenced Clifford to a total of eight years in prison. Judge Leonard told Clifford he should serve at least half his sentence in prison, adding that he was sure Clifford had also assaulted a 12-year-old girl in Spain, although this charge could not be pursued in the British courts. The judge added that if the offences had taken place after the law was changed in 2003, several of the offences of which Clifford was found guilty would have been tried as rape, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. One of Clifford's victims explained to the court that Clifford's assault on her (at age 15) had prevented her from having her first sexual relationship with a partner her own age, while another said that in the years following the assault she had cried whenever she saw Clifford on television, and had feared that the police would laugh at her. Clifford dismissed his victims as \\"fantasists\\" and \\"opportunists\\". The judge concluded that Clifford had caused an \\"additional element of trauma\\" to his victims by his \\"contemptuous attitude\\" during the trial. On 7 November 2014, Clifford's appeal against his eight-year sentence for sex offences was rejected by the Court of Appeal. The court ruled the sentence handed to Clifford earlier that year was \\"justified and correct.\\" The court compared Clifford's case with that of broadcaster Stuart Hall in 2013; Clifford had clowned and claimed innocence, but did not directly dispute the claims of his victims. In contrast Hall had publicly denounced his victims and accused one of seeking \\"instant notoriety\\". A lawyer commented on the Clifford appeal court ruling \\"Nothing Clifford did resembled the disastrous approach taken by Stuart Hall who, prior to pleading guilty to abusing them as girls, denounced his accusers as gold- diggers and liars.\\" Clifford's actions were deemed merely to show no remorse, and not to justify an increased penalty on appeal, although ruling out a reduction in sentence due to mitigating factors; in contrast Hall's sentence was actually increased on appeal. It was reported on 12 March 2015 that Clifford had been arrested again by Operation Yewtree police. On 3 July 2015, Clifford was charged with a single count of indecent assault stemming from an alleged incident from 1981. He pleaded not guilty on 20 October, and was cleared by a jury of the charge on 7 July 2016. At the time of his death, in December 2017, Clifford was still being sued by some of his victims. Clifford had won the right to challenge his conviction at the Court of Appeal before his death, and his daughter continued to challenge it afterward. His conviction was ultimately upheld on 2 April 2019. Personal life Clifford married Elizabeth Louise Porter at St Barnabas Church in Southfields, London, on 3 June 1967. Porter died of lung cancer in Sutton, on 8 April 2003. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clifford ran and took part in weekly adult parties for his friends and clients around London.Cadwalladr, Carole (23 July 2006). \\"Circus Maximus\\". Observer Magazine. Retrieved 26 March 2009. This brought him into contact with various madams and prostitutes, a connection which he later used to satisfy the needs of his clients, and introduced him to deviant behaviour. In March 2010, the News of the World settled out of court after Clifford sought legal action against it for intercepting his voicemail. After a lunch with editor Rebekah Brooks, the paper agreed to pay Clifford's legal fees and an undisclosed \\"personal payment\\" not described as damages. The sum exceeded ¬£1 million. The money was paid in exchange for him exclusively giving the paper stories over the next several years. Clifford lived in Hersham, Surrey, before his incarceration. On 4 April 2010, he married his former PA, Jo Westwood; guests included Des O'Connor, Bobby Davro, and Theo Paphitis. In May 2014, Westwood was granted a decree nisi, subsequently ending her four- year marriage to Clifford. Death On 7 December 2017 Clifford collapsed in HM Prison Littlehey after trying to clean his cell. He was taken to Hinchingbrooke Hospital, near Huntingdon, and died on 10 December 2017 of a heart attack at the age of 74.

Between them, two writers effectively founded the whole genre of the gastronomic essay.\\"Stephen Mennell, All manners of food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the Present, 2nd ed. 1996, p. 267. Biography Brillat-Savarin was born in the town of Belley, Ain, where the Rh√¥ne River then separated France from Savoy, to a family of lawyers. He studied law, chemistry, and medicine in Dijon in his early years and later practiced law in his hometown. In 1789, at the opening of the French Revolution, he was sent as a deputy to the Estates-General that soon became the National Constituent Assembly, where he acquired some limited fame, particularly for a public speech in defense of capital punishment. His father Marc Anthelme adopted his second surname in 1733 upon the death of an aunt named Savarin who left him her entire fortune on the condition that he adopt her name. He returned to Belley and was for a year the elected mayor. At a later stage of the Revolution, a bounty was placed on his head. He sought shelter in Switzerland, first at the home of some relatives in Moudon and then at the H√¥tel du Lion d'Argent in Lausanne. He later moved to Holland, and then to the United States, where he stayed for three years in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Hartford, living on the proceeds of giving French and violin lessons. For a time, he was first violin in the Park Theater in New York City. He returned to France under the Directory in 1797 and acquired the magistrate post he would hold for the remainder of his life, as a judge of the Court of Cassation. =Writings= He published several works on law and political economy. He also wrote an erotic short story, Voyage √† Arras.Voyage √† Arras, Dynamo, Pierre Aelberts, Li√®ge 1950. He remained a bachelor, but not a stranger to love, which he counted the sixth sense; his inscription of the Physiologie to his beautiful cousin Juliette R√©camier reads: > \\"Madam, receive kindly and read indulgently the work of an old man. It is a > tribute of a friendship which dates from your childhood, and, perhaps, the > homage of a more tender feeling...How can I tell? At my age a man no longer > dares interrogate his heart.\\"Quoted by Anne Drayton, Introduction to The > Physiology of Taste, 1994, p. 11. Title page of Physiologie du Go√ªt (Physiology of Taste) with a portrait of the author, 1848 edition His famous work, Physiologie du go√ªt (Physiology of Taste), was published in December 1825, two months before his death. The full title is Physiologie du Go√ªt, ou M√©ditations de Gastronomie Transcendante; ouvrage th√©orique, historique et √† l'ordre du jour, d√©di√© aux Gastronomes parisiens, par un Professeur, membre de plusieurs soci√©t√©s litt√©raires et savantes.\\"The physiology of taste, or, Meditations of transcendent gastronomy; a theoretical, historical and topical work, dedicated to the gastronomes of Paris by a professor, member of several literary and scholarly societies\\" The book has not been out of print since it first appeared, shortly before Brillat-Savarin's death.Mennell, 1996, p. 268. Its most notable English translation was done by food writer and critic M. F. K. Fisher, who remarked, \\"I hold myself blessed among translators.\\" Her translation was first published in 1949. The body of his work, though often wordy or excessively ‚Äì and sometimes dubiously ‚Äì aphoristic and axiomatic, has remained extremely important and has repeatedly been reanalyzed through the years since his death. In a series of meditations that owe something to Montaigne's Essays, and have the discursive rhythm of an age of leisured reading and a confident pursuit of educated pleasures, Brillat-Savarin discourses on the pleasures of the table, which he considers a science. His French models were the stylists of the Ancien R√©gime: Voltaire, Rousseau, F√©nelon, Buffon, Cochin, and d'Aguesseau. Aside from Latin, he knew five modern languages well, and when the occasion suited, was not shy of parading them; he never hesitated to borrow a word, like the English \\"sip\\" when French seemed to him to fail, until he rediscovered the then-obsolete verb siroter. The philosophy of Epicurus lies at the back of every page; the simplest meal satisfied Brillat-Savarin, as long as it was executed with artistry: :Those persons who suffer from indigestion, or who become drunk, are utterly ignorant of the true principles of eating and drinking. Low-carbohydrate diet Brillat-Savarin is often considered as the father of low-carbohydrate diet. He considered sugar and white flour to be the cause of obesity and he suggested, instead, protein-rich ingredients. > Sure enough, carnivorous animals never grow fat (consider wolves, jackals, > birds of prey, crows, etc.). Herbivorous animals do not grow fat easily, at > least until age has reduced them to a state of inactivity; but they fatten > very quickly as soon as they begin to be fed on potatoes, grain, or any kind > of flour. ... The second of the chief causes of obesity is the floury and > starchy substances which man makes the prime ingredients of his daily > nourishment. As we have said already, all animals that live on farinaceous > food grow fat willy-nilly, and man is no exception to the universal law. He promoted a diet that avoided starch, grains, sugar, and flour. He recommended meats, root vegetables, cabbage, and fruit.Strandberg, Timo. (2005). Roots of the Atkins diet. British Medical Journal 330 (7483): 132.Bray, George A. (2011). A Guide to Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome: Origins and Treatment. CRC Press. p. 31. Death and legacy The grave of Brillat-Savarin, at P√®re-Lachaise Brillat-Savarin was buried at the Cimeti√®re du P√®re Lachaise in Paris. His reputation was revitalized among modern gastronomes in many parts of the world, by his influence over Chairman Kaga of the TV series Iron Chef, which introduced to millions to his famous aphorism: \\"Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.\\" Eneas Sweetland Dallas wrote Kettner's Book of the Table, a Manual of Cookery, 1877, a treatise on gastronomy based on the work of Brillat-Savarin. Dallas published his book under the pseudonym of A. Kettner. Brillat-Savarin cheese, the Savarin mould, a ring mold with a rounded contour, and G√¢teau Savarin are named in his honor. The Caf√© Savarin, a French restaurant that was located at the former Equitable Life Assurance Building was named after him.

She is known for her acerbic style of presenting and reality television shows. She presented the British programme Points of View (1987‚Äì1997) and was one of the presenters on the consumer affairs show Watchdog (1993‚Äì2001, 2009‚Äì2015). Robinson gained her highest profile as the host of the BBC game show The Weakest Link (2000‚Äì2012), a role she reprised on the American version of the show (2001 to 2002). Robinson also returned to the role for a special in honour of Children in Need in November 2017. Early life Robinson was born in Crosby, Lancashire, on 26 September 1944 and is of Irish descent.\\"Memoirs of an Unfit Mother by Anne Robinson\\" ‚Äì Post.ie ‚Äì 11 November 2001 Her father was a schoolteacher. Her mother, Anne Josephine (n√©e Wilson), who was an alcoholic, was an agricultural businesswoman from Northern Ireland, where she was the manager of a market stall. When she came to England, she married into her husband's family of wholesale chicken dealers, and sold rationed rabbit after the Second World War. She inherited the family market stall in Liverpool and transformed it into one of the largest wholesale poultry dealing businesses in the north of England. Brought up initially at the family home in Crosby, Robinson attended a private Roman Catholic convent boarding school in Hampshire, Farnborough Hill Convent, now known as Farnborough Hill. She was hired as a chicken gutter and saleswoman during the holidays in the family business, before taking office jobs at a law firm. The family spent their summers on holiday in France, often at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes. Career =Early career= On leaving school, Robinson chose journalism over training for the theatre. After working in a news agency, she arrived in London in 1967 as the first young female trainee on the Daily Mail. Robinson's mother's going-away present to her daughter was an MG sports car and a fur coat. Robinson secured a permanent position as a result of scooping the details of the story of Brian Epstein's death from being a family friend of the Liverpool solicitor handling the legalities, offering him a ride to Euston railway station when he could not find an available taxi. Her work became more uncomfortable for her when she met and fell in love with the deputy news editor, Charlie Wilson; the couple married in 1968, but he subsequently had to sack her as a result of the marriage. Robinson joined The Sunday Times, and in 1970 the couple had a daughter, Emma Wilson, who is now a British radio disc jockey and has also hosted Scaredy Camp, a game show in the United States on the Nickelodeon network. In December 1978, she resigned from The Sunday Times and returned home to Crosby. She then began working for the Liverpool Echo. =Press= Robinson returned to Fleet Street in 1980, working as columnist and assistant editor of the Daily Mirror from the week that the Falklands War started. She also wrote a column under the pseudonym of the \\"Wednesday Witch\\", in which she developed her vitriolic style. During her career as a newspaper journalist, she developed a flair for writing tabloid headlines. On 14 November 1982, Robinson attended a formal dinner attended by Queen Elizabeth II, at which she noted that Diana, Princess of Wales, arrived late. Robinson asked the Mirrors Royal editor James Whitaker to investigate and, after conversations with various sources including Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, confirmed that Diana was suffering from an eating disorder, named as anorexia in a scoop article on 19 November 1982. As a result, Buckingham Palace Press Secretary Michael Shea rang then Mirror editor Mike Molloy, asking him to remove Robinson. She was subsequently removed from the editorial rota, and was advised by Molloy to \\"do more television, blossom, that's what you're good at\\". Robinson has written weekly columns for a succession of other British newspapers, such as Today, The Sun, The Express, The Times, and The Daily Telegraph. =Television and radio= Robinson began appearing on BBC television in 1982, initially as an occasional panellist on Question Time and presenting her 'TV Choice' on Breakfast Time. From 1986, she began sitting in on television viewers' show Points of View for regular presenter Barry Took, taking over from Took permanently in 1988 and remaining for 11 years. In 1993, she took over the presentation and writing of the consumer affairs television programme Watchdog. Robinson presented a Saturday morning show on Radio 2 from 1988 to 1993. Robinson is best known in the UK for hosting the game show The Weakest Link, and in the United States its NBC primetime counterpart, Weakest Link. She originally started with an icy, mysterious appearance and persona, remaining indifferent to funny and friendly moments throughout; however, she toned down that approach over the years, with her often smiling and on occasion laughing, especially on the celebrity episodes. Her use of insults, caustic remarks and personal questions fiercely directed at contestants became famous. Her blunt utterance \\"You are the weakest link ‚Äì goodbye!\\" became a catchphrase soon after the show started in 2000. Asked by the Duke of Edinburgh to present some Duke of Edinburgh's Awards, she agreed subject to his taking part in the Weakest Link. The Duke declined. In 2005, she made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, admitting she had been an unfit mother.Memoirs of an Unfit Mother Also in 2005, she appeared on an episode of the revived Doctor Who, entitled \\"Bad Wolf\\", voicing a futuristic android version of herself named the \\"Anne Droid\\" on a lethal version of The Weakest Link in the year 200,100. When contestants lose, the android blasts them with a disintegrator in its mouth, which really teleports them away to a Dalek fleet.Bad Wolf / The Parting of the Ways Robinson hosted the BBC's outtakes programme Outtake TV until 2009. She currently hosts a satirical news-based chat show on BBC One called What's the Problem? With Anne Robinson, and the BBC's interactive quiz Test the Nation. In 2009, Robinson returned to presenting BBC One's long-running consumer show Watchdog. She finished presenting The Weakest Link in 2012 after twelve years as the host of 1,693 shows. On 10 September 2015, it was announced that Robinson would step down from Watchdog once again, this time in order to film a new series of Britain's Spending Secrets for the channel. She had presented Watchdog for a total of 15 years. In 2016, Robinson presented Anne Robinson's Britain for BBC One. The series consisted of three episodes, each focusing on different aspects of British life. Episode one was centred on parenting, episode two on the nation's love of pets and particularly cats and dogs, and the final episode focused on the nation's fixation with how they look. Personal life In 1973, Robinson lost a custody battle for her only child, Emma, then aged two. Charles Wilson was granted sole custody, care and control of Emma, who subsequently lived with her father until she left home at 16 for boarding school.\\"Anne Robinson: The real Mrs Terrible\\" 17 October 2001, The Independent An admitted alcoholic, Robinson stopped drinking on 12 December 1978 after picking her daughter up from school and driving to a petrol station to buy a bottle of vodka. Robinson married journalist John Penrose in 1980. On 30 September 2007, the couple announced that they were planning to divorce, citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\". In 2001, she published her autobiography, Memoirs of an Unfit Mother, in which she describes her former drinking problem. In 2001, Robinson was diagnosed with skin cancer and had surgery to treat it. She has two grandchildren. Controversies In 2001, she was accused of racism towards the Welsh, after describing them as \\"irritating and annoying\\" while appearing as a guest on Room 101. The BBC received 16 complaints after Robinson asked wine connoisseur Olly Smith, who was competing on the celebrity version of The Weakest Link, to feel her breasts, after he described her as a \\"full-bodied, expensive red\\". The programme was broadcast on Saturday 5 April 2008 on BBC One. Robinson caused controversy on The Weakest Link when she made former Blue Peter presenter John Noakes cry after asking \\"What was the end for Shep?\\" Shep had been Noakes's pet dog both on and off Blue Peter. Robinson is a vocal supporter of fox hunting and, before it was banned in 2004, was a key supporter of the pro-hunt cause. The Guardian claims she has ridden with the White Horse Hunt. In an interview with Radio Times in September 2000, Robinson was asked what her first act as world leader would be, replying: \\"I'd lock up all the hunt saboteurs because they are destructive. They are campaigning about something of which they know nothing.\\"\\"What are the rights of cockroaches?\\" Auberon Waugh, Fortune City In February 2002, she hosted a spin-off version of The Weakest Link in Cirencester to raise funds for the local White Horse Hunt. The event was picketed by around 100 protesters from the League Against Cruel Sports, around 70 animal rights activists returning from another demonstration joined the picket, culminating in a near riot. The event eventually went ahead after Robinson was escorted into the venue by local police.\\"Anne told: You are the Weakest Link, Anti-Hunt Protesters Jeer TV Quiz Queen at Mock Game Show\\" 18 February 2002, Daily Post (Liverpool, England) A report published in 2006, which concluded that the BBC is \\"endemically homophobic\\", highlighted as one example of anti-gay bigotry in the network Robinson's treatment of a male contestant at The Weakest Link - Celebrity Chefs, to whom she made questions such as \\"What do you do in your restaurant - just mince around?\\", and \\"Before you go, and bear in mind that this is a family show, what's the strangest thing you've ever put in your mouth?\\" The previous year she was also accused of bigotry when she told a female prison officer that she must be a lesbian. At the end of October 2017 on BBC Radio's Today programme, Robinson responded to the accusations of sexual abuse made against multiple men which had followed Harvey Weinstein allegations published earlier in the month. She accused women of not complaining until now. According to Robinson, \\"40 years ago, there were very few of us women in power and, I have to say, we had a much more robust attitude to men behaving badly\\". At the present time, she claimed, there \\"is a sort of fragility amongst women who aren't able to cope with the treachery of the workplace\\". Referring to an allegation made against the trade minister Mark Garnier about him asking a female assistant to buy sex toys: \\"It shouldn't be happening but, on the other hand, why have women lost confidence\\". She said this incident led her to be \\"in despair\\". Robinson outlined her method of dealing with the problem: \\"In my day we gave them a slap, and told them to grow up!\\" Robinson was accused of victim blaming on social media.

History  Ceroc was created in London, England, by James Cronin, the son of writer Vincent Cronin, and grandson of Scottish author A. J. Cronin. In January 1980 he held the first ever Ceroc event in Porchester Hall in London. By 1982, Ceroc had a cabaret team that performed routines in London nightclubs and venues. Throughout the spring and summer of 1982, the Ceroc troupe worked with choreographer Michel Ange Lau, whose classes Cronin and Sylvia Coleman had attended at the Centre Charles Peguy, a French youth centre, in Leicester Square. The first video recording of a Ceroc event appears on the description for the \\"Gold Bug\\" routine, performed at the 1982 Ceroc Ball, a charity event, at the Hammersmith Palais. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cronin and Sylvia Coleman created Ceroc Enterprises, registered Ceroc as a trademarkIPO trademark details for \\"Ceroc\\" and started to sell Ceroc franchises around the country.

Ceroc Enterprises is a separate company to Ceroc Australia and Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company or CMJ (also based in Australia). These Australian companies are not franchisees of Ceroc Enterprises. Similarly, there is no legal connection between Ceroc Enterprises and Ceroc New Zealand. In November 2013 'Ceroc Australia' was sold to 'Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company or CMJ to bring them both back under the same umbrella since they split in 1998.  Modern Jive  Outside of the Ceroc Franchise, the dance style Modern Jive is also taught and danced in many independent venues, where it is commonly called LeRoc. Originally it was the same dance style taught in Ceroc venues and independents, but these have diverged enormously over the last 20 years. However, dancers who have learned at either Ceroc venues or independents can dance together in freestyle, as underneath stylistic differences it is fundamentally the same dance. Ceroc franchise venues often attract a younger demographic than independents, largely because of their branding and that they often recruit younger teachers, however this is by no means ubiquitous. In 1990, Robert Austin, an original Ceroc franchisee who had broken away from Ceroc to form LeJive, coined the term \\"Modern Jive\\". \\"Modern Jive\\" is a generic term for the dance form, and is used by teachers and clubs that are not affiliated to Ceroc Enterprise. Ceroc does not recognise the term ‚ÄúModern Jive‚Äù, and Ceroc‚Äôs web site states that it teaches dance in general and not a specific dance form.  Class format  Most Ceroc venues run regular classes, every week, usually on Monday through Thursdays. Ceroc class formats are quite different from most other dance forms, in that: * Students are typically taught in rows taught from a stage, rather than gathered around the teacher. * Class sizes are typically larger - often over 100 people per class in some UK venues. * Classes are highly-structured; a precise routine is taught to the leads who then lead the follows * Beginner routines are centrally-controlled; each venue teaches the same beginner class on a given day. * Partners are rotated frequently - typically every couple of minutes - so allowing Ceroc to advertise classes as \\"no partner required\\".This helps in the learning process as when you attend a Ceroc lesson you will dance with experienced and beginners alike. Lessons are organised so that partners are rotated every few minutes, or every couple of moves. * A small number of volunteer experienced dancers (called taxi dancers or taxis) are often available specifically to dance with beginners. * Dancers pay for the evening, rather than paying per class. = UK format = In the UK, the franchise nature of Ceroc enforces a degree of uniformity across all teachers and all venues. Ceroc classes typically follow the same format, and comprise: * A Beginners lesson, involving a routine of 3 moves drawn from a restricted repertoire of 12 moves, and lasting approximately 45 minutes. The Beginners routine taught on any given day is the same across all teachers and all venues. This is intended to allow beginners to practice what they have learned with beginners from other venues. * A freestyle period of approximately 15 minutes, in which beginners are encouraged to practise what they have learned, and experienced dancers are free to dance whatever they wish. No moves are barred during a freestyle period, except aerials, and moves are improvised on the spot to the music. Partner swapping occurs whenever the music changes, and does not require leaving the dance floor. * An Intermediate lesson, involving a routine of 3 moves drawn from a much larger repertoire of Intermediate-level moves, and lasting approximately 45 minutes. At least one of the Intermediate moves will be a Classic move which is intended for new Intermediate dancers. Many of the harder Intermediate moves are based around these Classic moves. There are 24 Classic moves. Individual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the intermediate-level lesson. Intermediate moves are more complex and may contain footwork. * In many venues, depending on available space, a Beginners Practice Session takes place at the same time, where beginners may review the moves taught in the Beginners lesson with the help of the taxi dancers. Beginners may instead watch the Intermediate lesson, if they so choose. The usual recommendation is for Beginners to complete approximately six Beginners classes before attempting to move up to Intermediate level. * A second freestyle period lasting for the rest of the evening, which is around an hour and a half to two hours. The start time varies from venue to venue, but is generally between 7pm and 8pm. Sunday classes often start earlier. Whatever the start time, the entire evening lasts three to four hours in most venues (with rare exceptions). = Australian format = A Beginner Progression class (also known variously as Bridging, Beginner Consolidation, Intromediate or Freestyle class ) taught at the same time as the Intermediate or Intermediate/Advanced class has also been introduced in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Adelaide, involving a breakdown of technique and either a review of the preceding Beginner class (possibly with some extensions or variations to the moves from that class) or a new routine drawn from a mixture of intermediate and beginner level moves . This class is taught at the same time as the Intermediate class. Individual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the Intermediate classes, however there is generally a stronger focus on technique (footwork, frame & connection, balance etc.), intermediate skills (dips & drops, leans, spinning etc.) and styling rather than just teaching moves. A video clip of a Ceroc class filmed in Melbourne can be seen at Mind Body & Soul Most Australian schools teach \\"Step\\" footwork. See Modern Jive#Step footwork vs Rock footwork = New Zealand format = In New Zealand there are typically Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced classes, with the clearer separation of moves between the classes. Moving up the classes leads to moves which are more complicated, more syncopated and physically closer. Beginners moves have 2-4 timing, preserve contact between partners at all times, have single speed, single turn spins, the dancers keep their balance (no leans, drops or dips) and partners only contact with each other is hands, arms and shoulders. Intermediate moves introduce single speed double spins and assisted double speed turns, contact with the partners back, and leans (in which one partner takes the others' weight with their body). Advanced moves can include multiple speed, multiple turn spins, loss of contact, significant syncopation, dips and drops (in which one partner takes the weight of the other with their arms) and/or contact with different body parts. Events =Freestyles and Tea Dances= As well as regular class nights, most Ceroc franchises put on special events, termed 'Freestyles', on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Sunday freestyles are termed 'tea dances' and are often held in the afternoon rather than evening. Some freestyle events begin with an 'icebreaker' class, usually at an intermediate level as beginners are unlikely to attend freestyles. A typical Saturday night freestyle would begin at either 8pm or 9pm and run until between 12midnight and 2am. Freestyles are usually held at larger venues such as town halls, and often have two rooms: the Main Room, usually the largest room playing up tempo music between 100 and 150BPM; and often a 'Blues Room' or 'Chillout' room, playing slower music between 80 and 110BPM, allowing for slower dancing focusing more on connection, interpretation and musicality. =Workshops= Many Ceroc teachers also occasionally run daytime dance workshops at weekends, which in the UK are known as Cerocshops. A workshop lasts for four hours, and covers more moves than are covered in a single regular evening class. The standard Ceroc workshops are graded (Beginners 1, Beginners 2, Beginners Plus, Intermediate 1, Intermediate 2, and Intermediate Plus). Specialised workshops may also be available which cover more advanced techniques and styles such as Dips & Drops, Baby Aerials, Double Trouble (one lead, two follows), Switch it Up (swapping partners), Ceroc to Blues, Footwork, Frame, Spins & Turn technique, Musicality, Connection & Posture. The frequency and content of these workshops depends on the resident teacher or guest teachers who may teach various workshops over the course of a weekend often with a freestyle party in the evening such as Ceroc Aberdeen's Beach Ballroom Weekend or Ceroc Conexion's Extreme Mini Weekender. =Championships= Ceroc Enterprises holds an annual UK Ceroc dance championship. This is held in London (currently at the Watford Colosseum) at the beginning of May with a mix of freestyle dancing and competitions. Competitions range from beginner oriented categories, such as the Lucky Dip (a Jack and Jill competition) and 'Ceroc X' where competitors are restricted to a set list of 8 basic moves, which they have to dance to different musical styles and are judged on performance and musicality. In recent years, the Intermediate and Advanced Freestyle Categories have been merged into an All Stars category divided into three different age brackets. Above this there is still the Open category, and Top Cats, another Jack and Jill where individual competitors are judged rather than couples. Other categories include Aerials, Showcase, and Team Cabaret competitions. There are other championships held on a regional or franchise basis, for example the Midlands, Ceroc Scotland and Welsh champs, and the Australasian. Ceroc also hosts the European Neo-Blues Championships. This is held at the weekender 'Breeze' at the Pontins at Brean Sands in October, and includes an invitational Masters Jack and Jill, Blues Open, Blues DWAS, and Showcase categories. = Weekenders = Ceroc hosts a number of 'Ceroc Escape' dance weekenders throughout the year, attracting hundreds of dancers from around the UK and Europe. Most of these take place at the Pontins holiday resorts at Camber Sands, Southport and Somerset. Other more luxurious weekenders are held at hotels, such as LUX and Swish. Freestyle dancing begins on the Friday night and carries on through until the Monday morning. During the day a range classes and workshops are available with teachers from around the country. Most events have a Saturday night cabaret, featuring teachers showcase, competition, and showcase performances. In 2005, Ceroc Enterprises completed the purchase of Rebel Roc, along with its annual dance weekender event at Pontins, Camber Sands. The first such event under the ownership of Ceroc Enterprises was Ceroc \\"Storm\\" at Camber Sands in March 2006. Ceroc Enterprises has been expanding its weekender offerings, and has taken over weekender venues from JiveTime (Camber Sands) at the end of 2007, and Jive Addiction (Southport) in August 2008.

He is best known for developing the concept of \\"Fourth World\\" music, which describes a \\"unified primitive/futurist sound\\" combining elements of various world ethnic traditions with modern electronic techniques. The concept was first articulated on Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics, his 1980 collaboration with Brian Eno. He has also worked with artists such as the Theatre of Eternal Music, Talking Heads, Farafina, Peter Gabriel, Tears for Fears, Ani DiFranco, Techno Animal, Ry Cooder, Moritz von Oswald, and Carl Craig. Life and career Born in Memphis, Tennessee, United States, Hassell received his master's degree from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. During this time he became involved in European serial music, especially the work of Karlheinz Stockhausen, and so after finishing his studies at Eastman, he enrolled in the Cologne Course for New Music (founded and directed by Stockhausen) for two years. Hassell returned to the U.S. in 1967, where he met Terry Riley in Buffalo, New York and performed on the first recording of Riley's seminal work In C in 1968. He pursued his Ph.D. in musicology in Buffalo and performed in La Monte Young's Theatre of Eternal Music in New York City, contributing to the 1974 LP Dream House 78' 17\\". On his return to Buffalo in the early 1970s, Hassell was introduced to the music of Indian Pandit Pran Nath, a specialist in the Kiranic style of singing. Hassell, Young, Marian Zazeela, and Riley went together to India to study with Nath. His work with Nath awoke his appetite for traditional musics of the world, and on the album Vernal Equinox, he used his trumpet (treated with various electronic effects) to imitate the vocal techniques to which Nath had exposed him. He stated: :\\"From 1973 up until then I was totally immersed in playing raga on the trumpet. I wanted the physical dexterity to be able to come into a room and be able to do something that nobody else in the world could do. My aim was to make a music that was vertically integrated in such a way that at any cross-sectional moment you were not able to pick a single element out as being from a particular country or genre of music.\\" In 1980, he collaborated with Brian Eno on the album Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics and appeared on the Eno-produced Talking Heads album Remain in Light. Hassell's 1981 release, Dream Theory in Malaya, led to a performance at the first World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) Festival, organized by Peter Gabriel. He performed and co-wrote tracks on David Sylvian's first solo album Brilliant Trees, and its instrumental follow-up Words with the Shaman. In the late 1980s, Hassell contributed to Gabriel's Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ, the soundtrack album for Martin Scorsese's film, The Last Temptation of Christ. Hassell and Pete Scaturro composed the electronic theme music for the television show The Practice. In 1989, Hassell contributed to the Tears for Fears album The Seeds of Love. Style Hassell coined the term \\"Fourth World\\" to describe his work on \\"a unified primitive/futuristic sound combining features of world ethnic styles with advanced electronic techniques.\\" He uses extensive electronic processing of his trumpet playing. In addition to nonwestern traditional musics, critics have noted the influence of Miles Davis on Hassell's style, particularly Davis' use of electronics, modal harmony, and understated lyricism. Both on record and during live performances, Hassell makes use of western instruments‚Äîkeyboards, bass, electric guitar, and percussion‚Äîto create modal, hypnotic grooves, over which he plays microtonally-inflected trumpet phrases in the style of Nath's Kiranic vocals.Jon Pareles, \\"Jon Hassell with Trumpet and Electronics,\\" New York Times September 21, 1989: p.

The main innovation was to simplify the footwork, making LeRoc very adaptable to different types of music in a 4-beat, fast or slow. According to the particular teacher, it may incorporate elements of other dance styles including Salsa and Tango. Both LeRoc and, later, Ceroc evolved in London during the Jive revival in the early 1980s, with dancers often being members of both clubs. LeRoc dances at the Notre Dame Hall, off Leicester Square, and Ceroc dances at the Porchester Hall in Bayswater rarely conflicted so it was easy to attend both, and rivalry between the clubs spurred the development of new dance moves. The split had occurred when James Cronin decided to trademark the word \\"Ceroc\\", and run the Ceroc club as a franchised business.

He was first elected to D√°il √âireann in 1948 as a Fianna F√°il Teachta D√°la (TD) representing Donegal East. Blaney served as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (1957), Minister for Local Government (1957‚Äì1966) and Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (1966‚Äì1970). He was Father of the D√°il from 1987 until his death. Early life Neil Blaney was born in 1922 in the rural Fanad Peninsula in the north of County Donegal, in Ireland. The second eldest of a family of eleven, Blaney's father Neal had been a commander of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Donegal during the War of Independence and the Civil War. He served as both a TD and as a Senator between 1927 and 1948. It was from his father that Blaney got his strong republican views and his first introduction to politics. He was educated locally at Tamney on the rugged Fanad Peninsula and later attended St Eunan's College in Letterkenny as a boarder. Blaney later worked as an organiser with the Irish National Vintners and Grocers Association. Early political career Blaney was first elected to D√°il √âireann for the Donegal East constituency in a by-election in December 1948, following the death of his father from cancer. He also became a member of Donegal County Council. Upon his election Blaney was the youngest member of the D√°il. He remained on the backbenches for a number of years before he was one of a group of young party members handpicked by Se√°n Lemass to begin a re- organisation drive for the party following the defeat at the 1954 general election. Within the party Blaney gained fame by running the party's by- election campaigns throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He introduced the concept of cavalcades after his election victories in his constituency together with roadside bonfires. At the time this was an alien political concept in Ireland. Blaney also adopted wearing sunglasses, chewing gum and wearing bright ties and colourful suits. His dedicated bands of supporters earned the sobriquet 'the Donegal Mafia', and succeeded in getting Des O'Malley and Gerry Collins elected to the D√°il. Ministerial career Following Fianna F√°il's victory at the 1957 general election √âamon de Valera, as Taoiseach, brought new blood into the Cabinet in the shape of Blaney, Jack Lynch, Kevin Boland and M√≠che√°l √ì M√≥r√°in. Blaney was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, becoming the first government minister from Donegal, however, he moved to the position of Minister for Local Government at the end of 1957 following the death of Se√°n Moylan. Blaney proved to be an innovative minister and his first task as minister was to prepare the groundwork for the referendum to scrap the proportional representation electoral system and replace it with the first- past-the-post voting system. The referendum failed to be passed, however, Blaney was retained in the post when Lemass succeeded de Valera as Taoiseach in 1959. In 1963 he introduced the Planning Act to rationalise planning throughout the local authorities in the state. This act also created the agency, An For√°s Forbatha, to bring planning experts together. His department underwent a very large programme to provide piped water to rural homes. In 1965 Blaney introduced the Road Traffic Act which required that motorists take a driving test in roadworthy cars. During his tenure it became possible to pay rates (property taxes) by instalment and he also introduced legislation which entitled non-nationals to vote in local elections. In 1966 Lemass resigned as Taoiseach and Fianna F√°il leader. The subsequent leadership election saw George Colley and Charles Haughey emerge as the two front-runners. Blaney was unimpressed with the choice and, with the support of the like-minded Kevin Boland, he threw his hat in the ring, declaring himself to be the \\"Radical Republican\\" candidate. However outside the Northwest and apart from Boland, Blaney failed to attract much support. After some pressure from Lemass the Cork politician, Jack Lynch, entered the race and was deemed to be an unbeatable candidate. Haughey and Boland withdrew in support of Lynch, however, Colley forced a contest. He was defeated heavily with Lynch becoming party leader and Taoiseach. In the subsequent cabinet reshuffle Blaney was appointed Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Arms Crisis In 1969, when conflict broke out in Northern Ireland, Blaney was one of the first to express strong Irish republican views, views which contradicted the policy of the Irish Government, in support of Northern nationalists. Blaney was a native of Ulster and was affected by the outbreak of violence in parts of his home province. He was concerned about the plight of the Nationalist majority in West Tyrone and in Derry, areas that bordered his constituency in West Ulster. From around late 1968 onwards, Blaney formed and presided over an unofficial Nationalist group in Leinster House popularly known as 'the Letterkenny Table', so named because this group of politicians used to meet at a certain table in either the D√°il bar or the D√°il restaurant. The group was dominated by Blaney up until his death. He had also been one of a four-member Cabinet sub-committee set up to decide on government policy to Northern Ireland together with Haughey, P√°draig Faulkner and Joseph Brennan. A fund of ¬£100,000 was set up to give to the nationalist people in the form of aid. However, those involved have denied that the government supported the importation of arms. There was general surprise when, in an incident known as the Arms Crisis, Blaney, along with Haughey, was sacked from Lynch's cabinet amid allegations of the use of the funds to import arms for use by the IRA.RT√â Television ‚Äì Hidden History Opposition leader Liam Cosgrave was informed by the Garda that a plot to import arms existed and included government members. Cosgrave told Lynch he knew of the plot and would announce it in the D√°il next day if he didn't act. Lynch asked for Haughey and Blaney's resignations. Both men refused, saying they did nothing illegal. Lynch then advised President de Valera to sack Haughey and Blaney from the government. Boland resigned in sympathy, while M√≠che√°l √ì M√≥r√°in was dismissed one day earlier in a preemptive strike to ensure that he was not the Minister for Justice when the crisis broke. Lynch chose government chief whip Des O'Malley for the role. Haughey and Blaney were subsequently tried in court along with an army Officer, Captain James Kelly, and Albert Luykx, a Belgian businessman who allegedly used his contacts to buy the arms. After trial all the accused were acquitted but many of their critics refused to recognise the verdict of the courts. Although Blaney was cleared of wrongdoing, his ministerial career was brought to an end. Lynch subsequently moved against Blaney so as to isolate him in the party. He was defeated by George Colley in a vote for the position of Joint Honorary Treasurer at the 1971 Ardfheis, while his constituency colleague, Liam Cunningham, had been appointed a Parliamentary Secretary in the cabinet reshuffle. In the D√°il Blaney abstained on a motion of no confidence on the worthiness of cabinet minister Jim Gibbons for office, sponsored by the opposition. Paudge Brennan and Desmond Foley acted similarly and, while the government survived, they were all expelled from the parliamentary party. When Blaney and his supporters tried to organise the party's national collection independently Lynch acted and in 1972 Blaney was expelled from the Fianna F√°il party for 'conduct unbecoming'. Independent Fianna F√°il Following his expulsion from Fianna F√°il, Kevin Boland tried to persuade Blaney to join the Aontacht √âireann party he was creating but Blaney declined. Instead, he contested all subsequent elections for Independent Fianna F√°il ‚Äì The Republican Party, an organisation that he built up, chiefly in the County Donegal constituencies from disaffected members of the Fianna F√°il party who remained loyal to him along with a large number of Republicans. Throughout the 1970s there were frequent calls for his re-admittance to Fianna F√°il but the most vocal opponents of this move were Fianna F√°il delegates from County Donegal. At the 1979 European elections Blaney topped the poll in the Connacht‚ÄìUlster constituency to the annoyance of Fianna F√°il. He sat in the Technical Group of Independents and served as chair of the group along with the Italian Radical Marco Pannella and Danish left-wing Eurosceptic Jens-Peter Bonde. He narrowly lost the seat at the 1984 election but was returned to serve as an MEP in 1989 election where he sat with the regionalist Rainbow Group. He also canvassed for IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election, in which Sands was elected to Westminster. Blaney held his D√°il seat until his death from cancer at the age of 73 on 8 November 1995 in Dublin. In the resulting by-election on 2 April 1996, the Fianna F√°il candidate reclaimed the seat. However, Blaney's brother, Harry Blaney, was elected as an Independent Fianna F√°il TD at the 1997 general election. He was replaced by his son, Niall Blaney, who was elected at the 2002 general election. But in July 2006 Niall rejoined Fianna F√°il. This was opposed by other members of the Blaney family, including all seven children of Neil Blaney and his widow Eva, who issued a press release prior to Niall Blaney's decision castigating the Fianna F√°il party and disassociating themselves from any so called 'truce' with them.

He helped shape the revolutionary aesthetic of the Futurism movement as one of its principal figures. Despite his short life, his approach to the dynamism of form and the deconstruction of solid mass guided artists long after his death. His works are held by many public art museums, and in 1988 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City organized a major retrospective of 100 pieces. Biography Umberto Boccioni was born on 19 October 1882 in Reggio Calabria. His father was a minor government employee, originally from the Romagna region in the north, and his job included frequent reassignments throughout Italy. The family soon relocated further north, and Umberto and his older sister Amelia grew up in Forl√¨ (Emilia-Romagna), Genoa and finally Padua. At the age of 15, in 1897, Umberto and his father moved to Catania, Sicily, where he would finish school. Some time after 1898, he moved to Rome and studied art at the Scuola Libera del Nudo of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma. He also studied under the Liberty style poster artist Giovanni Mataloni.Coen, Ester, Boccioni (1988, New York: Museum of Modern Art), p. 209, footnoted by translator in Severini, Gino, The Life of a Painter (1995, Princeton University Press; translated by Franchina, Jennifer). The little known about his years in Rome is found in the autobiography of his friend Gino Severini (1883‚Äì1966), who recalled their meeting in 1901 and mutual interest in Nietzsche, rebellion, life experiences and socialism. Boccioni's writings at this time already express the combination of outrage and irony that would become a lifelong characteristic. His critical and rebellious nature, and overall intellectual ability, would contribute substantially to the development of the Futurism movement. After building a foundation of skills, having studied the classics through Impressionism, both he and Severini became students of Giacomo Balla (1871‚Äì1958), a painter focusing on the modern Divisionist technique, painting with divided rather than mixed color and breaking the painted surface into a field of stippled dots and stripes. Severini wrote \\"It was a great stroke of luck for us to meet such a man, whose direction was decisive of all our careers.\\" Self portrait, 1905, oil on canvas In 1906, he briefly moved to Paris, where he studied Impressionist and Post-Impressionist styles, before visiting Russia for three months, getting a first-hand view of the civil unrest and governmental crackdowns. Returning to Italy in 1907, he briefly took drawing classes at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Venice. He had first visited the Famiglia Artistica, a society for artists in Milan, in 1901. As he travelled from one city to the other, in parallel with his most ground- breaking artistic endeavours, he worked as a commercial illustrator. Between 1904 and 1909 he provided lithographs and gouache paintings to internationally renowned publishing houses, such as Berlin-based Stiefbold & Co. Boccioni‚Äôs production in this field shows his awareness of contemporary European illustration, such as the work of Cecil Aldin, Harry Eliott, Henri Cassiers and Albert Beerts, and attests to his information of contemporary trends in the visual arts more in general.Niccol√≤ D‚ÄôAgati, ‚ÄòFox-Hunt Garbage: Umberto Boccioni and British Illustration‚Äô, Print Quarterly, XXXVI, no. 1, March 2019, pp. 31‚Äì44. Boccioni moved to Milan in 1907. There, early in 1908, he met the Divisionist painter Gaetano Previati. In early 1910 he met Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who had already published his Manifesto del Futurismo (\\"Manifesto of Futurism\\") in the previous year. On 11 February 1910 Boccioni, with Balla, Carlo Carr√†, Luigi Russolo and Severini, signed the Manifesto dei pittori futuristi (\\"Manifesto of Futurist painters\\"), and on 8 March he read the manifesto at the Politeama Chiarella theatre in Turin. Boccioni became the main theorist of the artistic movement. \\"Only when Boccioni, Balla, Severini and a few other Futurists traveled to Paris toward the end of 1911 and saw what Braque and Picasso had been doing did the movement begin to take real shape.\\" He also decided to be a sculptor after he visited various studios in Paris, in 1912, including those of Georges Braque, Alexander Archipenko, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, August Agero and, probably, Medardo Rosso. In 1912 he exhibited some paintings together with other Italian futurists at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, and the following year returned to show his sculptures at the Galerie La Bo√©tie: all related to the elaboration of what Boccioni had seen in Paris, where he had visited the studios of Cubist sculptors, including those of Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Alexander Archipenko to further his knowledge of avant-garde sculpture. Christine Poggi, In Defiance of Painting: Cubism, Futurism, and the Invention of Collage, Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 20, 177, Umberto Boccioni, 1913, Synth√®se du dynamisme humain (Synthesis of Human Dynamism), sculpture destroyed In 1914 he published Pittura e scultura futuriste (dinamismo plastico) explaining the aesthetics of the group: > \\"While the impressionists paint a picture to give one particular moment and > subordinate the life of the picture to its resemblance to this moment, we > synthesize every moment (time, place, form, color-tone) and thus paint the > picture.'' He exhibited in London, together with the group, in 1912 (Sackville Gallery) and 1914 (Dor√© Gallery): the two exhibitions made a deep impression on a number of young English artists, in particular C.R.W. Nevinson, who joined the movement. Others aligned themselves instead to its British equivalent, Vorticism, led by Wyndham Lewis. > \\"Boccioni's gift was to bring a fresh eye to reality in ways that, we now > recognise, defined the nature of the modern movement in the visual arts and > literature, too.\\" --Michael Glover (art critic, The Independent) Italian involvement in the First World War began late in May 1915 with Italy's declaration of war on Austro-Hungary. The \\"Lombard Battalion Volunteers Cyclists and Motorists\\", which Boccioni was part of, set off in early June from Milan to Gallarate, then on to Peschiera del Garda, in the rear of the Trentino front. In July 1915, the volunteers were intended for a sector of the front around Ala and the Gardesana. On 24 October 1915, Boccioni participated in the battle of Dosso Casina. On 1 December 1915 the battalion was dissolved as part of a general reorganization; the volunteers were laid off temporarily, then each was called up along with the class. In May 1916 Boccioni was drafted into the Italian Army, and was assigned to an artillery regiment at Sorte of Chievo, near Verona. On 16 August 1916, he was thrown from his horse during a cavalry training exercise and was trampled. He died the following day, age thirty-three, at Verona Military Hospital, and he was buried in the Monumental Cemetery of that city. Cimitero monumentale di verona, tomba di umberto boccioni, 1916, 04.jpgThe tomb in Verona File:Headstone_Umberto_Boccioni_Chievo.jpgA memorial where Boccioni fatally injured himself in Sorte of Chievo Works Three Women, 1909‚Äì10 The Morning, 1909Early portraits and landscapes From 1902 to 1910, Boccioni focused initially on drawings, then sketched and painted portraits ‚Äì with his mother as a frequent model. He also painted landscapes ‚Äì often including the arrival of industrialization, trains and factories for example. During this period, he weaves between Pointillism and Impressionism, and the influence of Giacomo Balla, and Divisionism techniques are evident in early paintings (although later largely abandoned). The Morning (1909) was noted for \\"the bold and youthful violence of hues\\" and as \\"a daring exercise in luminosity.\\" His 1909‚Äì10 Three Women, which portrays his mother and sister, and longtime lover Ines at center, was cited as expressing great emotion ‚Äì strength, melancholy and love. =Development of Futurism= The City Rises, 1910 Boccioni worked for nearly a year on La citt√† sale or The City Rises, 1910, a huge (2m by 3m) painting, which is considered his turning point into Futurism. \\"I attempted a great synthesis of labor, light and movement\\" he wrote to a friend. Upon its exhibition in Milan in May 1911, the painting attracted numerous reviews, mostly admiring. By 1912 it had become a headline painting for the exhibition traveling Europe, the introduction to Futurism. It was sold to the great pianist, Ferruccio Busoni for 4,000 lire that year, and today is frequently on prominent display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, at the entrance to the paintings department. The Laugh, 1911 La risata (1911, The Laugh) is considered Boccioni's first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now focused on the sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also is owned by the Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover. States of Mind I:The Farewells, 1911Dynamism of a Cyclist, 1913 Boccioni spent much of 1911 working on a trilogy of paintings titled \\"Stati d'animo\\" (\\"States of Mind\\"), which he said expressed departure and arrival at a railroad station ‚Äì The Farewells, Those Who Go, and Those Who Stay. All three paintings were originally purchased by Marinetti, until Nelson Rockefeller acquired them from his widow and later donated them to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Elasticity, 1912 Portrait of Ferruccio Busoni, 1916 Beginning in 1912, with Elasticit√† or Elasticity, depicting the pure energy of a horse, captured with intense chromaticism, he completed a series of Dynamist paintings: Dinamismo di un corpo umano (Human Body), ciclista (Cyclist), Foot-baller, and by 1914 Dinamismo plastico: cavallo + caseggiato (Plastic Dynamism: Horse + Houses). While continuing this focus, he revived his previous interest in portraiture. Beginning with L'antigrazioso (The antigraceful) in 1912 and continuing with I selciatori (The Street Pavers) and Il bevitore (The Drinker) both in 1914. In 1914 Boccioni published his book, Pittura, scultura futuriste (Futurist Painting and Sculpture), which caused a rift between himself and some of his Futurist comrades. As a result, perhaps, he abandoned his exploration of Dynamism, and instead sought further decomposition of a subject by means of colour. With Horizontal Volumes in 1915 and the Portrait of Ferruccio Busoni in 1916, he completed a full return to figurative painting. Perhaps fittingly, this last painting was a portrait of the maestro who purchased his first Futurist work, The City Rises. =Sculpture= Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, 1913 Spiral Expansion of Muscles in Action, plaster, photograph published in 1914 and 1919, in Cubists and Post-Impressionism, by Arthur Jerome Eddy, and exhibited at Erster deutscher Herbstsalon, Berlin 1913, Herwarth Walden, titled Spiralf√∂rmige ausdehnung von muskeln in bewegung. Published 1913 catalogue by Der Sturm in Berlin The writing of his (Technical manifesto of Futurist sculpture), published on 11 April 1912, was Boccioni's intellectual and physical launch into sculpture; he had begun working in sculpture in the previous year. By the end of 1913 he had completed what is considered his masterpiece, Forme uniche della continuit√† nello spazio (Unique Forms of Continuity in Space), in wax. His goal for the work was to depict a \\"synthetic continuity\\" of motion, instead of an \\"analytical discontinuity\\" that he saw in such artists as Franti≈°ek Kupka and Marcel Duchamp. During his life, the work only existed as a plaster cast. It was first cast in bronze in 1931. This sculpture has been the subject of extensive commentary, and in 1998 it was selected as the image to be engraved on the back of the Italian 20-cent euro coin. Soon after Boccioni's death in 1916 (and after a memorial exhibition was held in MilanTisdall, Caroline and Bozzolla, Angelo, Futurism, p. 72; Thames and Hudson.), his family entrusted them for an impermanent time to a fellow sculptor, Piero da Verona; da Verona then requested that his assistant place them in the local rubbish-dump.Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art (@Estorick) on Twitter, 18 December 2019; \\"After Boccioni's premature death his large sculptures were temporarily entrusted by the family to a fellow sculptor named Piero da Verona, who asked his assistant to dispose of them in a nearby rubbish dump.\\" Accessed 3 January 2020. Marinetti's outraged account of the destruction of the sculptures was slightly different; in his memoirs, he stated that the sculptures were destroyed by workmen to clear the room the \\"envious pass√®ist narrow-minded sculptor\\" had placed them.Quoted by the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art (@Estorick) on Twitter, 20 December 2019; FT Marinetti recalled the destruction of Boccioni‚Äôs sculptures in his memoirs: \\"Absurdly entrusted to an envious pass√®ist narrow- minded sculptor they were ripped apart by the workmen anxious to clear out a profitable part of the building and all is ended\\". Accessed 3 January 2020. Thus, much of his experimental work from late 1912 to 1913 was destroyed, including pieces relating to contemporaneous paintings, which are known only through photographs. One of the few surviving pieces is the Antigrazioso (Anti-Graceful, also called The Mother). In 2019, the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art held an exhibition reconstructing several of the destroyed sculptures.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Wexford from 1918 to 1922 and 1923 to 1965, and as senator from 1965 to 1969. He was in Sinn F√©in until Fianna F√°il's 1926 foundation. Early and private life Ryan was born on the family farm at Tomcoole, near Taghmon, County Wexford in 1891. The second youngest of twelve children he was educated at St Peter's College, Wexford and Ring College, Waterford. In 1911, Ryan won a county council scholarship to University College Dublin where he studied medicine.https://www.ucd.ie/archives/collections/depositedcollections/items/collectionname,235343,en.html#accordion1 He passed his final medical exam in March 1917 and subsequently opened a medical practice in Wexford. Four years later in 1921, Ryan moved to Dublin where he opened a practice at Harcourt Street, specialising in skin diseases at the Skin and Cancer Hospital on Holles Street. He left medicine in 1925, after he bought Kindlestown, a large farm near Delgany, County Wicklow. Ryan lived there and it remained a working farm until his death. In July 1919, Ryan married M√°ir√≠n Cregan, originally from County Kerry and a close friend of Sin√©ad de Valera throughout her life. Cregan, like her husband, had also fought in the Easter Rising and was subsequently an author of children's stories in Irish. They had three children together. One of Ryan's sisters, Mary Kate, married Se√°n T. O'Kelly, one of Ryan's future cabinet colleagues and a future President of Ireland. Following her death O'Kelly married her sister, Phyllis Ryan. Another of Ryan's sisters, Josephine ('Min') Ryan, married Richard Mulcahy, a future leader of Fine Gael. Another sister, Agnes, married Denis McCullough, a Cumann na nGaedheal TD from 1924 to 1927. Revolutionary career While studying at university in 1913 Ryan joined the Gaelic League at Clonmel. The company commander recruited the young catholic nationalist, who became a founder-member of the Irish Volunteers and was sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood the following year. During the Easter Rising in 1916, Ryan was the medical officer in the General Post Office (GPO). He was, along with James Connolly, one of the last people to leave the GPO when the evacuation took place. Following the surrender of the patriots Ryan was deported to HM Prison Stafford in England and subsequently at Frongoch. He was released in August 1916.https://www.ucd.ie/archives/collections/depositedcollections/items/collectionname,235343,en.html#accordion1 Ryan rejoined the Volunteers immediately after his release from prison, and in June 1917, he was elected Commandant of the Wexford Battalion. His political career began the following year when he was elected as a Sinn F√©in candidate for the constituency of Wexford South in the 1918 general election. Like his fellow Sinn F√©in MPs, Ryan refused to attend the Westminster Parliament. Instead he attended the proceedings of the First D√°il on 21 January 1919. As the War of Independence went on, Ryan became Brigade Commandant of South Wexford and was also elected to Wexford County Council, serving as chairman on one occasion. In September 1919, he was arrested by the British and interned on Spike Island and later Bere Island until he was released after the June 1921 truce. Anglo-Irish Treaty which he voted against. In the 1922 \\"pact election\\" Ryan and one of the other two anti-Treaty Wexford TDs lost their seats to pro-Treaty candidates, and Ryan was imprisoned during the subsequent Civil War. While interned he won back his D√°il seat as an abstentionist at the 1923 general election. Political career In 1926, Ryan was among the Sinn F√©in TDs who followed leader √âamon de Valera out of the party to found Fianna F√°il. They entered the D√°il in 1927 and spent five years on the opposition benches.https://www.ucd.ie/archives/collections/depositedcollections/items/collectionname,235343,en.html#accordion1 =Minister for Agriculture= Following the 1932 general election, Fianna F√°il came to power appointing Ryan Minister for Agriculture, a position he would continuously hold for fifteen years. In agriculture the government's policy was based on the idea of self-sufficiency or autarky. \\"Irish farmers should have always been looking for prosperity from the towns of Britain. If they got people working in our own towns they would consume Irish produce,\\" he declared at Blackwater, County Wexford calling it the idea of a cyclical arrangement.19 January 1933, The Irish Press, 2. Ryan was given the task of implementing the following policies: imports of wheat, sugar and other agricultural produce were restricted; farmers were given a guaranteed price for wheat; farmers were forced to use home-produced grain in animal feed and bakers had to use a certain percentage of Irish flour in their bread; and the sugar beet industry was expanded with the opening of new factories. While these policies saw increases in sugar-beet production and in the growing of wheat the small farmers of Munster and Connacht gained little while the large farmers were the real beneficiaries. Ryan faced severe criticism over the Economic War with Britain: serious harm was done to the cattle trade, Ireland's main export earner. The government tried to compensate by giving bounties equal to the British duties, however, these had to be paid for by the taxpayer. The economic war ended in 1938 with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement between both governments, after a series of talks in London between the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, de Valera, Ryan and Se√°n Lemass. During World War II self-sufficiency in food became essential. The Department of Agriculture ordered every farmer to till one-eighth of his land. This was raised to three-eighths in 1944.https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/emergency-economics-ireland- during-the-second-world-war-1.1861902 In spite of strict rationing and severe shortages, basic foodstuffs remained available. At war's end farmers discontent emerged once again. A new political party, Clann na Talmhan, was established in the late 1930s to represent the interests of smaller farmers in the west of Ireland. Similarly, much of the country's land had become exhausted due to increased wartime productivity and a shortage of fertilisers. =Minister for Health and Social Welfare= In 1947, after spending fifteen years as Minister for Agriculture, Ryan was appointed to the newly created position of Minister for Health and Social Welfare. The minister brought the draft Health Bill to the cabinet's attention later that year. This was a radical and innovative piece of legislation which proposed to modernise the health service into two aspects ‚Äì mother and child welfare and infectious diseases. De Valera was anxious about accepting these measures as government policy due to opposition from the Catholic Church. In fact, much of the legislation was controversially enacted by Noel Browne, Ryan's successor as Minister from 1948 to 1951. Following Fianna F√°il's return to power at the 1951 general election, Ryan returned as Minister for Health and Social Welfare. During his second period in office he clashed with the Church once again over the implementation of the remaining aspects of the 'Mother and Child Scheme'. Following negotiations with the hierarchy, adjustments on such issues as means testing and medical inspections were made and the legislation was passed in the D√°il. Following the 1954 general election, Fianna F√°il lost power and Ryan moved to the backbenches once again. =Minister for Finance= Following the 1957 general election, Fianna F√°il were back in power and de Valera's cabinet had a new look to it. In a clear message that there would be a change to economic policy Ryan, a close ally of Se√°n Lemass, was appointed Minister for Finance, replacing the conservative Se√°n MacEntee. The first sign of a new economic approach came in 1958, when Ryan brought the First Programme for Economic Development to the cabinet table. This plan, the brainchild of T. K. Whitaker, recognised that Ireland would have to move away from self- sufficiency towards free trade. It also proposed that foreign firms should be given grants and tax breaks to set up in Ireland.https://www.ucd.ie/archives/collections/depositedcollections/items/collectionname,235343,en.html#accordion1 When Se√°n Lemass succeeded de Valera as Taoiseach in 1959, Ryan was retained in the Finance portfolio. Lemass also wanted to reward him for his loyalty by naming him T√°naiste, however, the new leader felt obliged to appoint Se√°n MacEntee, one of the party elders to the position. Ryan continued to implement the First Programme throughout the early 1960s, achieving a record growth rate of 4 per cent by 1963. That year an even more ambitious Second Programme was introduced, however, it overreached and had to be abandoned. In spite of this the annual growth rate averaged five per cent, the highest achieved since independence. Retirement and death Ryan did not stand in the 1965 general election, after which he was nominated by the Taoiseach to Seanad √âireann (the upper house of the Oireachtas), where he joined his son, Eoin Ryan Snr.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1918 to 1969. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving member of the First D√°il. Early life Born as John McEntee at 47 King Street, Belfast on 23 August 1889, the son of James McEntee, a publican, and his wife, Mary Owens, both of whom were from Monaghan. In 1901 and 1911, the family's address was 49 King Street. James McEntee was a prominent Nationalist member of Belfast Corporation and a close friend of Joe Devlin MP. MacEntee was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers School, St. Malachy's College, the Belfast Municipal College of Technology and Queen's University Belfast where he qualified as an electrical engineer. His early political involvement was with the Irish Socialist Republican Party in Belfast city. He quickly rose through the ranks of the trade union movement becoming junior representative in the city's shipyards. Following his education MacEntee worked as an engineer in Dundalk, County Louth, and was involved in the establishment of a local corps of the Irish Volunteers in the town. He mobilised in Dundalk and fought in the General Post Office Garrison in the Easter Rising in 1916. He was sentenced to death for his part in the rising. This sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. MacEntee was released in the general amnesty in 1917, and was later elected a member of the National Executives of both Sinn F√©in and the Irish Volunteers in October 1917. MacEntee was later elected Sinn F√©in MP for Monaghan South at the 1918 general election. Rebellion years An attempt to develop his career as a consulting engineer in Belfast was interrupted by the War of Independence in 1919. MacEntee served as Vice-Commandant of the Belfast Brigade of the Irish Republican Army. He was also a member of the Volunteer Executive, a sort of Cabinet and Directory for the Minister for Defence and the HQ StaffKevin B Nolan, 'Dail Eireann and the Army: Unity and Division 1919-21, in Williams (ed.), \\"Irish Struggle\\", p.271, cited in Townshend, p.87. But MacEntee remained one of the few Sinn F√©iners from the north.Others were Eoin Macneill and Ernest Blythe. William Forbes Patterson, a Canadian protestant convert to Sein Finn was commissioned by Dublin to investigate. He found that Republicans faced a pogrom in Ulster. Townshend, \\"The Republic\\", pp.172-3. On 6 August 1920, MacEntee presented 'a Memorial' lecture to the D√°il from the Belfast Corporation. He told the D√°il it was the only custodian of public order, and that a Nationalist pogrom was taking place, he advised them to fight Belfast.D√°il Debates, 6 Aug 1920, as cited by Townshend, p.176. The D√°il government's policy was dubbedBureau of Military History (Ireland) WS 1096 ( J J Murray), citing in Townshend, p.376-7.Hibernia Irredenta or 'Greening Ireland'. But many nationalist towns in Ulster wanted to remain British . Sean MacEntee was asked to resign his South Monaghan seat, after voting against a bunting celebration in Lurgan to mark the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. =The path to civil war= From April 1921, when MacEntee was transferred to Dublin to direct a special anti-partition campaign in connection with the May general election. It remained Collins policy, he declared, that the largely Protestant shipyard workers of Belfast were being directed by the British, urging all Irishmen to rejoin the Republic.Coogan, Tim Pat, \\"Michael Collins\\", p.357, cited by Townshend, p.378. Correspondingly the Ulster Unionist Council rejected the call for a review of the boundary commission decision made on Northern Ireland. But when Ulstermen chose James Craig as Premier, Collins denounced democracy in the north as a sham.Collins and Craig had a meeting at the Colonial Office, London, on 21 January 1922. It was on the partition of Ireland issue that MacEntee voted against the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 3 ‚Äì 22 December 1921, Debate on Treaty During the subsequent Civil War MacEntee commanded the IRA unit in Marlboro Street Post Office in Dublin. He later fought with Cathal Brugha in the Hamman Hotel, and was subsequently interned in Kilmainham and Gormanstown until December 1923. =Politician in the Free State= After his release from prison, MacEntee devoted himself more fully to his engineering practice, although he unsuccessfully contested Dublin County by-election of 1924. He became a founder-member of Fianna F√°il in 1926 and was eventually elected a TD for Dublin County at the 1927 general election. MacEntee founded the Association of Patent Agents in 1929, having gained his interest in Patents when he worked as an assistant engineer in Dundalk Urban District Council.http://www.aptma.ie/history.htm On MacEntee's appointment as Minister for Finance in 1932, his colleague, Francis Litton who was acting as Secretary of the Association, circulated the members with a notice to the effect that the Association was \\"suspended\\" until such time as MacEntee could return as he now had to devote his energies to the affairs of the State. However, the other members decided to carry on. MacEntee must have valued his status as a Patent Agent since he maintained his name on the Register for over 30 years while he held Ministerial rank in the Irish Government, although he is not thought to have taken any active part in the patent business, which was carried on by his business partners. In the first Fianna F√°il government (1932‚Äì48) In 1932, Fianna F√°il came to power for the very first time, with MacEntee becoming Minister for Finance. In keeping with the party's protectionist economic policies his first budget in March of that year saw the introduction of new duties on forty-three imports, many of them coming from Britain. This saw retaliation from the British government, which in turn provoked a response from the Irish government. This was the beginning of the Economic War between the two nations, however, a treaty in 1938, signed by MacEntee and other senior members who brought an end to the issue. In 1939, World War II broke out and a cabinet reshuffle resulted in MacEntee being appointed as Minister for Industry and Commerce, taking over from his rival Se√°n Lemass. During his tenure at this department MacEntee introduced the important Trade Union Act (1941). In 1941, another reshuffle of ministers took place, with MacEntee becoming Minister for Local Government and Public Health. The Health portfolio was transferred to a new Department of Health in 1947. Following the 1948 general election, Fianna F√°il returned to the opposition benches for the first time in sixteen years. In later Fianna F√°il governments (1951‚Äì54, 1957‚Äì65) In 1951, Fianna F√°il were back in government, although in minority status, depending on independent deputies for survival. MacEntee once again returned to the position of Minister for Finance where he felt it was vital to deal with the balance of payments deficit. He brought in a harsh budget in 1951 which raised income tax and tariffs on imports. His chief aim was to cut spending and reduce imports, however, this came at a cost as unemployment increased sharply. The increases were retained in his next two budgets in 1952 and 1953. It is often said that it was MacEntee's performance during this period that cost Fianna F√°il the general election in 1954. The poor grasp on economics also did his political career tremendous damage as up to that point he was seen as a likely successor as Taoiseach. Now, however, Se√°n Lemass was firmly seen as the \\"heir apparent\\". In 1957, Fianna F√°il returned to power with an overall majority with MacEntee being appointed Minister for Health. The financial and economic portfolios were dominated by Lemass and other like- minded ministers who wanted to move away from protection to free trade. He is credited during this period with the reorganisation of the health services, the establishment of separate departments of health and social welfare, and the fluoridation of water supplies in Ireland. In 1959, MacEntee became T√°naiste when Se√°n Lemass was elected Taoiseach. Retirement and death Following the 1965 general election, MacEntee was 76 years old and retired from the government. This did not mean that he went quietly to the backbenches. He re-emerged in 1966 to launch a verbal attack on Se√°n Lemass for deciding to step down as party leader and Taoiseach. The two men, however, patched up their differences shortly afterwards. MacEntee retired from D√°il √âireann in 1969 at the age of 80, making him the oldest TD in Irish history. He had a negative view of the Provisional IRA.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBv1xB-r-EY MacEntee served in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and repeatedly proposed amendments that would have watered down resolutions against the Greek junta (see Greek case). MacEntee died in Dublin on 9 January 1984, at the age of 94.Irish Times. 10 January 1984. This states that he died the previous day.

The concept is closely linked to translatio studii (the geographic movement of learning). Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible (verses 39‚Äì40).Carol Ann Newsom and Brennan W.

Also the causality of one reign necessarily leading to its successor was often detailed by the medieval chroniclers, and is seen as a typical medieval approach.

Continuing with this tradition, the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman authors Geoffrey of Monmouth (in his Historia Regum Britanniae) and Wace (in his Brut) linked the founding of Britain to the arrival of Brutus of Troy, son of Aeneas.Bratu, Cristian. \\"Translatio, autorit√© et affirmation de soi chez Gaimar, Wace et Beno√Æt de Sainte-Maure.\\" The Medieval Chronicle 8 (2013): 135-164. In a similar way, the French Renaissance author Jean Lemaire de Belges (in his Les Illustrations de Gaule et Singularit√©s de Troie) linked the founding of Celtic Gaul to the arrival of the Trojan Francus (i.e. Astyanax), the son of Hector; and of Celtic Germany to the arrival of Bavo, the cousin of Priam; in this way he established an illustrious genealogy for Pepin and Charlemagne (the legend of Francus would also serve as the basis for Ronsard's epic poem, \\"La Franciade\\").  From the Roman Empire/Byzantine Empire to the Holy Roman Empire  The cardinal point in the idea of the Translatio imperii is the link between the Roman Empire/Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. *Emperor Constantine I established Constantinople, a New Rome, as a second capital of the Roman Empire in 330. *After the death of Emperor Theodosius I (347‚Äì395), the Roman Empire was permanently divided into the Western and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire). *With the demise of the Western Empire in 476, the Byzantine Empire remained the sole Roman Empire. *Byzantine Emperor Constantine V married his son Leo IV to Irene of Athens on 17 December 768, brought to Constantinople by the father on 1 November 768. On 14 January 771, Irene gave birth to a son, Constantine. Following the deaths of Constantine V in 775 and Leo IV in 780, Irene became regent for their nine-year-old son, Constantine VI. *As early as 781, Irene began to seek a closer relationship with the Carolingian dynasty and the Papacy. She negotiated a marriage between her son Constantine and Rotrude, a daughter of the ruling Frankish king, Charlemagne. Irene went as far as to send an official to instruct the Frankish princess in Greek; however, Irene herself broke off the engagement in 787, against her son's wishes. *As Constantine VI approached maturity, the relationship between mother/regent and son/emperor was increasingly strained. In 797 Irene deposed her son, with his eyes being mutilated, who died soon afterwards. *Some Western authorities considered the Byzantine throne, now occupied by a woman, to be vacant and instead recognized that Charlemagne, who controlled Italy and much part of the former Western Roman Empire, had a valid claim to the imperial title. Pope Leo III, crowned Charlemagne as Roman Emperor in 800, an act not recognized by the Byzantine Empire. *Irene is said to have endeavored to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, but according to Theophanes the Confessor, who alone mentioned it, the scheme was frustrated by Aetios, one of her favorites.See Garland, p. 89, who explains that Aetios was attempting to usurp power on behalf of his brother Leo. * In 802, Empress Irene was deposed by a conspiracy and replaced by Nikephoros I. She was exiled and died the following year. * Pax Nicephori, a peace treaty in 803 between the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne and Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros I, Basileus of the Eastern Roman Empire. * Recognition of Charlemagne as Emperor (Basileus) in 812 by Emperor Michael I Rangabe of the Byzantine Empire (crowned on 2 October 811 by the Patriarch of Constantinople), after he reopened negotiations with the Franks. In exchange for that recognition, Venice was returned to the Byzantine Empire. * On February 2, 962, Otto I was solemnly crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope John XII. Ten days later at a Roman synod, Pope John XII, at Otto's desire, founded the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and the Bishopric of Merseburg, bestowed the pallium on the Archbishop of Salzburg and Archbishop of Trier, and confirmed the appointment of Rather as Bishop of Verona. The next day, the emperor issued a decree, the famous Diploma Ottonianum, in which he confirmed the Roman Church in its possessions, particularly those granted by the Donation of Pepin. * On April 972 14, Otto I married his son and heir Otto II to the Byzantine Princess Theophanu. Through their wedding contract, Otto was recognized as Emperor in the West, a title Theopanu was to assume together with her husband through the Consortium imperii after his death.

It was written mainly by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songwriting partnership. Influenced by the introspective lyrics of Bob Dylan, the song is considered a milestone in the Beatles' development as songwriters. The track features a sitar part, played by lead guitarist George Harrison, that marked the first appearance of the Indian string instrument on a Western rock recording. The song was a number 1 hit in Australia when released on a single there in 1966, coupled with \\"Nowhere Man\\". Lennon wrote the song as a veiled account of an extramarital affair he had in London. When recording the track, Harrison chose to add a sitar part after becoming interested in the instrument's exotic sound while on the set of the Beatles' film Help!, in early 1965. Further to several British bands, including the Beatles, using guitars to imitate the drone and other musical textures of the sitar in their recordings, \\"Norwegian Wood\\" was influential in the development of raga rock and psychedelic rock during the mid 1960s. The song also helped elevate Ravi Shankar and Indian classical music to mainstream popularity in the West. Many other rock and pop artists, including the Byrds, the Rolling Stones and Donovan, began integrating elements of the genre into their musical approach. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is also recognised as a key work in the early evolution of world music. Rolling Stone magazine ranked \\"Norwegian Wood\\" number 83 on its list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". Composition The song's lyrics are about an extramarital affair that John Lennon was involved in, as hinted in the opening couplet: \\"I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.\\" Although Lennon never revealed whom he had an affair with, writer Philip Norman speculates that it was either Lennon's close friend and journalist Maureen Cleave or Sonny Freeman. Paul McCartney explained that the term \\"Norwegian Wood\\" was a sarcastic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue in London. McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: \\"In our world the guy had to have some sort of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it meant I burned the fucking place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental.\\" Badrutt's Palace Hotel in the Swiss town of St. Moritz. Lennon began writing the song, as \\"This Bird Has Flown\\", while staying at the hotel in January 1965. According to Lennon in 1970, \\"Norwegian Wood\\" was his creation, with McCartney assisting on the middle eight. In 1980, Lennon changed his claim, saying it was \\"my song completely\\". Since Lennon's death, however, McCartney has contended that Lennon brought the opening couplet to one of their joint songwriting sessions, and that they finished the song together, with the middle eight and the title (and the \\"fire\\") being among McCartney's contributions. McCartney's statement about the level of his involvement was one of the controversial claims he made in his 1997 authorised biography, Many Years from Now. Regardless, Lennon began writing the song in January 1965, while on holiday with his wife, Cynthia, and record producer George Martin at St. Moritz in the Swiss Alps. Over the following days, Lennon expanded on an acoustic arrangement of the song, which was written in a Dylanesque time signature, and showed it to Martin while he recovered from a skiing injury. In his book The Songs of Lennon: The Beatle Years, author John Stevens describes \\"Norwegian Wood\\" as a turning point in folk-style ballads, writing that \\"Lennon moves quickly from one lyrical image to another, leaving it up to the listener's imagination to complete the picture\\". He also said the song marked a pivotal moment in Lennon's use of surreal lyrics, following on from the songs \\"Ask Me Why\\" and \\"There's a Place\\". Between 5 and 6 April 1965, while filming the second Beatles film, Help!, at Twickenham Film Studios, George Harrison first encountered a sitar, the Indian string instrument that would be a prominent feature in \\"Norwegian Wood\\". It was one of several instruments being played by a group of Indian musicians in a scene set in an Indian restaurant. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" was not the first Western pop song in which an Indian influence was evident: the raga-like drone was found in the Beatles' \\"Ticket to Ride\\", as well as in the Kinks' song \\"See My Friends\\". The Yardbirds also created a similar sound with a distorted electric guitar on \\"Heart Full of Soul\\". Barry Fantoni, a friend of Ray Davies of the Kinks, said that the Beatles first got the idea to use Indian instrumentation when Fantoni played them \\"See My Friends\\". According to author Ian MacDonald, however, while the Kinks' single most likely influenced the Beatles, Davies could well have been influenced by \\"Ticket to Ride\\" when recording \\"See My Friends\\". Rather than the Kinks or the Yardbirds, Harrison attributed his growing interest in Indian sounds to people mentioning the name of Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar to him, culminating in a discussion he had with David Crosby of the Byrds. The discussion took place in Los Angeles on 25 August, during the Beatles' 1965 American tour. Once back in London, Harrison followed Crosby's suggestion by seeking out Shankar's recordings, and he also purchased a cheap sitar, from the Indiacraft store on Oxford Street. Ringo Starr later cited Harrison's use of sitar on \\"Norwegian Wood\\" as an example of the Beatles' eagerness to incorporate new sounds in 1965, saying: \\"you could walk in with an elephant, as long as it was going to make a musical note.\\" Recording The Beatles recorded an early version of \\"Norwegian Wood\\" during the first day of sessions for their album Rubber Soul, on 12 October 1965. The session took place at EMI Studios in London, with Martin producing. Titled \\"This Bird Has Flown\\", the song was extensively rehearsed by the group, who then taped the rhythm track in a single take, featuring two 12-string acoustic guitars, bass, and a faint sound of cymbals. Harrison added his sitar part, with the take emphasising the drone quality of the instrument more so than the remake that was eventually released. The sound of the sitar proved difficult to capture, according to sound engineer Norman Smith, who recalled problems with \\"a lot of nasty peaks and a very complex wave form\\". He declined to use a limiter, which would have fixed the technical problem with distortion, but would have affected the sound. Lennon overdubbed a lead vocal, which he double tracked at the end of each line in the verses. Designed as a comedy number, this version exhibited a less folk-orientated sound, relative to the recording issued on Rubber Soul, instead highlighting laboured vocals and an unusual sitar conclusion. The band were unsatisfied with the recording, however, and decided to return to the song later in the sessions. This discarded version of \\"Norwegian Wood\\" was first released on the 1996 compilation album Anthology 2. On 21 October, the Beatles recorded three new takes, including the master. The group experimented with the arrangement, with the second take introducing a double-tracked sitar opening that complemented Lennon's acoustic melody. Though the group completely reshaped \\"Norwegian Wood\\", it was far from the album version. Harrison's sitar playing is still at the forefront, alongside heavy drumbeats. The take was not considered suitable for overdubbing, so the band scrapped it, and re-evaluated the arrangement. By the third take, the song was called \\"Norwegian Wood\\", and the group changed the key from D major to E major. The Beatles skipped the rhythm section on this take, and decided to jump directly to the master take. In all, the rhythm section accommodates the acoustics, and the band thought the musical style was an improvement over earlier run-throughs. Therefore, the sitar is an accompaniment, consequently affecting the droning sound evident in past takes. Looking back on the recording sessions in the 1990s, Harrison explained his inclusion of the sitar to be \\"quite spontaneous from what I remember\\", adding, \\"We miked it up and put it on and it just seemed to hit the spot\\". Release and reception \\"Norwegian Wood\\" was released on Rubber Soul on 3 December 1965. The song marked the first example of a rock band playing a sitar or any Indian instrument on one of their recordings. It was also issued on a single with \\"Nowhere Man\\" in Australia and was a number 1 hit there in May 1966. The two songs were listed together, as a double A-side, during the single's two weeks at number 1. Writing for AllMusic, music historian Richie Unterberger describes \\"Norwegian Wood\\" as possessing \\"more than enough ambiguity and ingenious innuendo to satisfy even a Dylan fan\\" while demonstrating to the Beatles' audience how \\"the group had sure come a long way since 'She Loves You' just two years back.\\" Unterberger concludes his review by commenting: \\"The power of the track is greatly enhanced by McCartney's sympathetic high harmonies on the bridge, and its exoticism confirmed by George Harrison's twanging sitar riffs\\". A reviewer for Rolling Stone magazine noted \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and \\"Think for Yourself\\" as documents of the Beatles' increasing awareness and creativity in the studio. Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork considers the song to be one of the most self-evident Lennon pieces on Rubber Soul to exemplify his maturity as a songwriter, and praises the composition as \\"an economical and ambiguous story-song highlighted by Harrison's first dabbling with the Indian sitar\\". In his book on the Rubber Soul era, subtitled The Enduring Beauty of Rubber Soul, John Kruth refers to \\"Norwegian Wood\\" as a \\"striking from the first listen\\" kind of tune that \\"transported Beatles fans north to the pristine forests of Scandinavia\\". Music critic Kenneth Womack admires how the song \\"reinterprets a familiar theme, in this case the loss of 'love' (well represented in earlier songs such as 'Don't Bother Me' and 'Misery'), providing listeners with security yet challenging those inclined to acknowledge the standard treatment\\". Musical influence and legacy Although droning guitars had been used previously to mimic the qualities of the sitar, \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is generally credited as sparking a musical craze for the sound of the novel instrument in the mid-1960s. The song is often identified as the first example of raga rock, while the trend it initiated led to the arrival of Indian rock and formed the essence of psychedelic rock. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is also recognised as an important piece of what is typically called \\"world music\\", and it was a major step towards incorporating non-Western musical influences into Western popular music. The composition, coupled with advice given by Harrison, sparked the interest of Rolling Stones multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who soon integrated the sitar into \\"Paint It Black\\", another landmark song in the development of raga and Indian rock. Other pieces exemplifying the rapid growth of interest in Indian music by contemporary Western musicians include Donovan's \\"Sunshine Superman\\", the Yardbirds' \\"Shapes of Things\\", and the Byrds' \\"Eight Miles High\\", among others. The popularity of Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar (pictured in 1988) soared as a result of \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and his taking on Harrison as a sitar student. According to author Jonathan Gould, the impact of \\"Norwegian Wood\\" \\"transformed\\" Ravi Shankar's career, and the Indian sitarist later wrote of first being aware of a \\"great sitar explosion\\" in popular music during the spring of 1966, when he was performing a series of concerts in the UK. Harrison developed a fascination for Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. In June 1966, Harrison met Shankar in London and became a student under the master sitarist. Having added the sitar accompaniment to \\"Norwegian Wood\\", Harrison expanded upon his initial effort by writing \\"Love You To\\", which showcased his immersion in Indian music, and presented an authentic representation of a non-Western music form in a rock song. Prior to the recording sessions for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Harrison made a pilgrimage to Bombay, India with his wife Pattie, where he continued his studies with Shankar and was introduced to the teachings of several yogis. Harrison contributed \\"Within You Without You\\" to Sgt. Pepper, featuring himself as the only performing Beatle together with uncredited musicians playing dilruba, swarmandal and tabla, alongside a string section. For the remainder of his career, he evolved his understanding of Indian musicianship, particularly in his slide guitar playing. In 2006, Mojo placed \\"Norwegian Wood\\" at number 19 in the magazine's list of \\"The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs\\", as compiled by a panel of music critics and musicians. In their commentary on the song, Roy Harper and John Cale both identified the track as an influence on their musical careers during the 1960s. Harper wrote: > We all knew that they were good ... What you weren't prepared for was Rubber > Soul. They were writing with a deeper resonance, in another time zone ... I > was envious and inspired at the same moment.

After a few times on the turntable, you > realised that the goal posts had been moved, forever, and you really wanted > to hear the next record ‚Äì now. Cale recalled that Rubber Soul was an inspiration to himself and Lou Reed as they developed their band the Velvet Underground. He described the song's mood as \\"very acid ... what you remember in a flashback is a sound, how your senses were bombarded\\", adding: \\"I don't think anybody got that sound or that closeted feeling as well as The Beatles did on Norwegian Wood.\\" In his book The Beatles Through Headphones, Ted Montgomery comments: \\"Perhaps no other song in rock and roll history captures a feel and nuance more succinctly and powerfully in 2:05 than 'Norwegian Wood'\\". The song has been covered by numerous artists, including Waylon Jennings, Tangerine Dream, Hank Williams Jr, Cornershop, Rahul Dev Burman, Buddy Rich, and P.M. Dawn.

History Ruthenians (Rutheni), an illustration in a book by Pietro Bertelli, 1563 One of the earliest references to Rus' in a Latinised form was in the 5th century, when King Odoacer styled himself as \\"Rex Rhutenorum. Ruteni, a misnomer that was also the name of an extinct and unrelated Celtic tribe in Ancient Gaul, was used in reference to Rus' in the Annales Augustani of 1089. An alternative early modern Latinisation, Rucenus (plural Ruceni) was, according to Boris Unbegaun, derived from Rusyn. Baron Herberstein, describing the land of Russia, inhabited by the Rutheni who call themselves Russi, claimed that the first of the governors who rule Russia is the Grand Duke of Moscow, the second is the Grand Duke of Lithuania and the third is the King of Poland.Sigismund von Herberstein Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii According to professor of Ukrainian origin John-Paul Himka from the University of Alberta the word Rutheni did not include the modern Russians, who were known as Moscovitae. Modern studies, however, indicate that even after the 16th century the word Rutheni was associated with all East Slavs. Vasili III of Russia, who ruled the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 16th century, was known in European Latin sources as Rhuteni Imperator.–õ–æ–±–∏–Ω –ê. –ù. –ü–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—è –í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏—è III –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á–∞ –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—É –ö–∞—Ä–ª—É V –æ—Ç 26 –∏—é–Ω—è 1522 –≥.: –û–ø—ã—Ç —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏–∏ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–∞ // Studia Slavica et Balcanica Petropolitana, ‚Ññ 1. –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥, 2013.

Jacques Margeret in his book \\"Estat de l'empire de Russie, et grande duch√© de Moscovie\\" of 1607 explained, that the name \\"Muscovites\\" for the population of Tsardom (Empire) of Russia is an error. During conversations, they called themselves rusaki (which is a colloquial term for Russians) and only the citizens of the capital called themself \\"Muscovites\\". Margeret considered that this error is worse than calling all the French \\"Parisians.\\" Professor David Frick from the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute has also found in Vilnius the documents from 1655, which demonstrate that Moscovitae were also known in Lithuania as Rutheni.Frick D.

After the partition of Poland the term Ruthenian referred exclusively to people of the Rusyn- and Ukrainian-speaking areas of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, especially in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, Bukovina, and Transcarpathia. At the request of Mykhajlo Levitsky, in 1843 the term Ruthenian became the official name for the Rusyns and Ukrainians within the Austrian Empire. For example, Ivan Franko and Stepan Bandera in their passports were identified as Ruthenians (). Panayir, D. Muscophillia.

Istorychna Pravda (Ukrayinska Pravda). 16 February 2011 By 1900 more and more Ruthenians began to call themselves with the self-designated name Ukrainians. A number of Ukrainian members of the intelligentsia, such as Mykhailo Drahomanov and Ivan Franko, perceived the term as narrow-minded, provincial and Habsburg. With the emergence of Ukrainian nationalism during the mid-19th century, use of \\"Ruthenian\\" and cognate terms declined among Ukrainians and fell out of use in Eastern and Central Ukraine. Most people in the western region of Ukraine followed suit later in the 19th century. During the early 20th century, the name Ukrajins‚Äôka mova (\\"Ukrainian language\\") became accepted by much of the Ukrainian-speaking literary class in the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, new states emerged and dissolved; borders changed frequently. After several years the Rusyn and Ukrainian speaking areas of eastern Austria-Hungary found themselves divided between the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania. In the Soviet Union the Rusyns were not officially regarded as an ethnicity distinct from Ukrainians. However, the name Ruthenian (or \\"Little Ruthenian\\") was still often applied to the Rusyn minorities of Czechoslovakia and Poland. The Polish census of 1931 listed \\"Russian\\", \\"Ruthenian\\" and \\"Ukrainian\\" (Polish: rossyjski, ruski, ukrai≈Ñski, respectively) as separate languages.Henryk Zieli≈Ñski, Historia Polski 1914-1939, (1983) Wroc≈Çaw: Ossolineum When commenting on the partition of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in March 1939, US diplomat George Kennan noted, \\"To those who inquire whether these peasants are Russians or Ukrainians, there is only one answer. They are Neither. They are simply Ruthenians.\\"Report on Conditions in Ruthenia March 1939, From Prague After Munich: Diplomatic Papers 1938-1940, (Princeton University Press, 1968) Dr. Paul R. Magosci emphasizes that modern Ruthenians have \\"the sense of a nationality distinct from Ukrainians\\" and often associate Ukrainians with Soviets or Communists.Paul R. Magosci, \\"The Rusyn Question\\" Political Thought 1995, ‚Ññ2-3 (6) P.221-231, :http://www.litopys.org.ua/rizne/magocie.htm After the expansion of Soviet Ukraine following World War II, many groups who had not previously considered themselves Ukrainians were merged into the Ukrainian identity The government of Slovakia has proclaimed Rusyns (Rus√≠ni) to be a distinct national minority (1991) and recognised Rusyn language as a distinct language (1995). Ruthenians in Poland Ruthenians of Che≈Çm in 1861. Ruthenians of Podlachia in the second half of the 19th century. In the Interbellum period of the 20th century, the term rusyn (Ruthenian) was also applied to people from the Kresy Wschodnie (the eastern borderlands) in the Second Polish Republic, and included Ukrainians, Rusins, and Lemkos, or alternatively, members of the Uniate or Greek Catholic Church churches. In Galicia, the Polish government actively replaced all references to \\"Ukrainians\\" with the old word rusini (\\"Ruthenians\\"), an action that caused many Ukrainians to view their original self-designation with distaste. The Polish census of 1921 considered Ukrainians no other than Ruthenians.(Polish) G≈Ç√≥wny UrzƒÖd Statystyczny (corporate author) (1932) \\"Ludnosc, Ludnosc wedlug wyznania religijnego i narodowosci\\" (table 11, pg. 56 However the Polish census of 1931 counted Belarusian, Ukrainian, Russian, and Ruthenian as separate language categories, and the census results were substantially different from before.(Polish) G≈Ç√≥wny UrzƒÖd Statystyczny (corporate author) (1932) \\"Ludnosc. Ludnosc wedlug wyznania i plci oraz jezyka ojczystego\\" (table 10, pg. 15). According to Rusyn-American historian Paul Robert Magocsi, Polish government policy in the 1930s pursued a strategy of tribalization, regarding various ethnographic groups‚Äîi.e., Lemkos, Boikos, and Hutsuls, as well Old Ruthenians and Russophiles‚Äîas different from other Ukrainians (although no such category existed in the Polish census apart from the first-language speakers of Russian), and offered instructions in Lemko vernacular in state schools set up in the westernmost Lemko Region. Recognition of Rusyn people The designations Rusyn and Carpatho-Rusyn were banned in the Soviet Union by the end of World War II in June 1945. Ruthenians who identified under the Rusyn ethnonym and considered themselves to be a national and linguistic group separate from Ukrainians and Belarusians were relegated to the Carpathian diaspora and formally functioned among the large immigrant communities in the United States. A cross-European revival took place only with the collapse of communist rule in 1989. This has resulted in political conflict and accusations of intrigue against Rusyn activists, including criminal charges. The Rusyn minority is well represented in Slovakia. The single category of people who listed their ethnicity as Rusyn was created in the 1920s, however, no generally accepted standardised Rusyn language existed.

Goole lies south of York and west of Hull. According to the 2011 UK census, Goole parish had a population of 19,518, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 17,600. The port, which is the UK's furthest inland port, is highly versatile and capable of handling nearly 2 million tonnes of cargo per annum, making it one of the most important ports on the east coast of England. Goole is twinned with Z≈Çot√≥w in Poland. Goole was informally twinned with Gibraltar in the 1960s; at that time, Gibraltar Court was named in Goole and Goole Court was named in Gibraltar. Etymology Unusually for an English place-name, \\"Goole\\" has its origins in Middle English. It derives from the word goule, meaning \\"stream\\" or \\"channel\\", or possibly \\"outlet drain\\". Not recorded in the Domesday Book, its first mention was in 1362 as Gulle. History The Gothic Revival St John's church, Goole, which was built between 1843 and 1848. =Background= The Dutch civil engineer Cornelius Vermuyden diverted the River Don northwards to the River Ouse in 1626‚Äì1629, to drain the marshland of Hatfield Chase at the behest of King Charles I. It made the new lower Don ‚Äì known as the Dutch River ‚Äì navigable for barges, so that coal from the South Yorkshire Coalfield could be transported to the new confluence, for transfer to seagoing vessels. There the engineers built a new wooden bridge ‚Äì rebuilt in iron in the 1890s, and now known as the Dutch River Bridge ‚Äì where to its east formed a new village called \\"Goole\\". =Development= Sir Edward Banks a contractor for the Aire and Calder Navigation company. In the 1820s, the Aire and Calder Navigation company proposed development of a new canal to transport coal, from existing broad canal from Knottingley in the northern sector of the coalfield in 1826. Once it reached Goole, the company proposed development of a new floating dock, capable of handling larger sea-going vessels. Chief engineer Thomas Hamond Bartholomew was instructed to build the canal, docks and an associated company town to house both the dock workers and visiting seamen. Bartholomew commissioned civil engineer and builder Sir Edward Banks company to construct part of the canal and the eight transshipment docks, and to lay out the associated new town to the west of the existing wooden bridge. Resultantly, the \\"Banks Arms Hotel\\" on Aire Street ‚Äì today known as the \\"Lowther Hotel\\" ‚Äì was in 1824 the first building constructed in what was known as \\"New Goole\\"; The Macintosh Arms public house on the same street took its name from engineer Hugh Macintosh. When Goole opened as a port on 20 July 1826, it was a new community of about 450 people. Now it is a town with about 18,000 inhabitants. =Docks= A Tom Pudding hoist in Goole docks Three locks keep the water in of floating docks at a constant depth of , by preventing the level from rising and falling with the tides in the River Ouse. Once ships are within the complex, eight docks provide a total quayside of . Beside the docks are transit sheds where cargo is stored, many of which are equipped with overhead cranes. Unlike many ports, every one of the eight docks has been in full, commercial operation since its construction in the period from 1826 to 1912. William Hamond Bartholomew succeeded his father T. H. Bartholomew in 1853 and introduced the Tom Pudding system of compartment boats, which could carry around of coal in 1863. On reaching the docks, the barges were lifted by large hoists, from which they could be discharged directly into seagoing ships, a system which proved so successful that it competed against rail until 1985. For most of its life, the port was most associated with the shipment of coal, and associated cargoes including the importation of pit props. With the demise of the mining industry, the former Timber Pond is now a marina, trading under the name Goole Boathouse. It has berths for 150 boats. After a period of decline, commodities were replaced by containers, the export of steel, and the import of timber from north-eastern Europe. Today the Port of Goole has regular cargo liner services to Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Morocco and South Africa; plus a transshipment route to Europort, Rotterdam. Present Boothferry Road, the main shopping street Glass is produced in Goole, which is also the centre of an agricultural district. The town's former large employer was in clothing manufacture for the big multiples, however this ended in the late 2000s. Goole has a modestly sized town centre with many high street shops, independent retailers and public houses. The main shopping area is Wesley Square, off Boothferry Road (which has been pedestrianised around the main shopping area). There is a modern retail development in the town centre, a leisure centre next to the docks, and the Goole and District Hospital, to the north of the town. A theatre and cinema, \\"Junction\\" opened in 2009, giving the town access to live music, theatre, comedy, satellite screening broadcasts and film. Goole High School, formerly Goole Grammar School Goole has several junior schools and a High School with a Sixth Form College attached to it. Goole College is affiliated with Hull College. There are Further Education colleges in Selby, York, Scunthorpe and Bishop Burton. At Goole College there is a programme run for the older students at the High School (for the pupils in year 10 and above) to see what opportunities are held at the college. Transport Goole railway station The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway built a line from Pontefract and Wakefield in 1848, and the North Eastern Railway connected the port with Doncaster and Hull in 1870. The prosperity from the coal and general cargo trade with the West Riding industrial area continued for 150 years after the opening of the canal. Today Goole railway station is at the junction of the Hull and Doncaster Branch and the Pontefract Line. Service is provided to Hull Paragon Interchange, Doncaster, Sheffield and Leeds, and the commuter stations in between. Goole is south of the M62 linking it with Kingston upon Hull in the east and the West Yorkshire urban belt in the west. The M18 runs west of the town, connecting it with South Yorkshire, the South and the Midlands. There are bus services to surrounding towns and villages provided by East Yorkshire Motor Services, Stagecoach in Hull and Arriva Yorkshire Governance Before the reform of local government in 1974, brought about by the Local Government Act 1972, Goole was in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was then placed in the Boothferry district of the county of Humberside, until that was abolished in 1996. Since 1996, Goole has been in the East Riding of Yorkshire. It is represented by four councillors on the East Riding of Yorkshire Council. Goole is in the parliamentary constituency of Brigg and Goole. The constituency has been represented in the House of Commons since 2010 by Andrew Percy, a Conservative. Landmarks Goole's twin water towers, nicknamed \\"salt\\" and \\"pepper\\" Goole's most prominent landmarks are its twin water towers, nicknamed \\"salt\\" and \\"pepper\\". In the winter months, Goole's gas holder on Anderson Road is visible across the north of the town. Many of the hoists and cranes on the dockside can be seen across the town. The steeple of Goole Parish Church is tall enough to be seen across the town. The town's landscape is made up mostly of utility and industrial structures. A clock tower is within the main shopping district of the town on a roundabout which is on the site of the former open-air marketplace. West Park is an Edwardian park in the town. Goole's Clock Tower surrounded by shops and pubs. Plans View over Kingsway Bridge after snowfall Goole's industrial park, Capitol Park / Goole36, has attracted two large employers: Guardian Industries, which built a glass manufacturing plant, and Tesco, which built a distribution centre. The arrival of these employers resulted in hundreds of new jobs being created. A new Morrisons store opened in Goole on 2 August 2010, built on land previously occupied by Timms Mill on Boothferry Road. A new railway rolling stock factory will be built at the same location during 2018/2019. The plant, which will be owned and operated by Siemens, will build the new tube trains for the Piccadilly line in London. Sport Victoria Pleasure Ground Goole Town Cricket Club supports local cricket teams. Of its three teams, the first team plays in the club cricket York & District Senior League. A new clubhouse was constructed in 1996 providing facilities and a bar. Rugby Union is played close to the cricket club at Westfield Banks, sharing facilities with Goole Tennis Club and Goole Viking Striders running club. Goole RUFC currently field two teams, the first team playing in Yorkshire Division Two. Goole Tennis Centre is a 9 court tennis club based on the Westfield Banks site. Goole has two football teams these being Goole A.F.C., and Goole United A.F.C.

She was born in the Dutch town of Hengelo to Jewish parents. Faced with the German invasion, they went into hiding. After an abortive escape attempt to England, her father Hans remained in Amsterdam while her mother and she made for Switzerland, accompanied by the Dutch painter Max van Dam. At the border they were captured by the French police, but just as they were about to be deported to the Drancy internment camp, they were rescued by the resistance, who helped them over the border. When they returned to the Netherlands following the war, Jacqueline could not speak Dutch. From 1947 on she went to school in Hengelo and Enschede (Gemeentelijk Lyceum). In 1957 she went to Paris and was employed in the boutique at Christian Dior in the meantime studying French and drama. After leaving for London spring 1958 studying drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, she returned to Amsterdam September 1958 ‚Äì 1961 and was employed by the Stedelijk Museum, the home of Modern Art there. She visited London in 1959 where she met Danish painter Asger Jorn, the founder of the CoBrA group, They became companions. He was forty-five years old, compared to her twenty years. She joined the Situationist International in 1960, and started to participate in conferences and the Central committee. After the expulsion of Constant Nieuwenhuys and his group, she became the Dutch Section of the organization. She did not accept the way the German section, also known as Gruppe SPUR, had been expelled and resigned. The cleft between the Debordists and the Second Situationist International grew, however she refused to join either faction, instead stating that people should act as situationists. Between 1962 and 1968 she edited and published The Situationist Times involving Gaston Bachelard, Roberto Matta, Wifredo Lam and Jacques Pr√©vert in this project. In 1968 she was in Paris, printing and distributing revolutionary posters. From starting her activities as a painter, sculptor and graphic artist she keeps on exhibiting all over Europe and the U.S.A. She realized wall paintings for the Amsterdam Town Hall and a separation installation for the Nederlandse Bank. In 1970 she left Asger Jorn and moved to Amsterdam with Hans Brinkman later on a gallery owner and organiser of exhibitions and international Fairs. They divorced in 1989. In 1990 she became the companion of lawyer Thomas H. Weyland (Tom 1931-2009). From 1995 Tom Weyland was on the editorial board of the International Journal of Cultural Property (de Gruyter Berlin- New York). They got married in 1998 in Airopolie (Greece). They gave several lectures on 'intellectual right, copyright, d√©tournement and modification' in the Netherlands and U.K. In 1996 they bought their property in the Bourbonnais France where she has her vegetable garden and grows the potatoes which became Art (\\"Potatoe language\\" in 2003 van Abbe Museum Eindhoven invited by Jennifer Tee, \\"Baked Potatoes\\" 2006 Albisola Italy invited by Roberto Ohrt and the Golden and Platina jewellery \\"Pommes de Jong\\" 2008-2011. In 2003 a retrospective exhibition of her work was shown at the Cobra Museum for Contemporary Art in Amstelveen, the Netherlands and the KunstCentret Silkeborg Bad Denmark, whereas a monography was published 'Undercover in de Kunst/in Art' Edition Ludion, Belgium. Together with Tom she realized The Weyland de Jong Foundation early 2009. The main aim is to support avant-garde artists of all disciplines, architects and art-scientists having reached the age of 50 and over. Weyland died in May 2009.

Over a long lifetime Seibel produced many complex hybrid crosses (known as Seibel grapes) of Vitis vinifera to American grapes. It is a cross of Seibel 788 (which is Sicilien √ó Clairette Dor√©e Ganzin) and Seibel 29 (a crossing of Munson and an unidentified Vitis vinifera).J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 66-67, Allen Lane 2012 The fruit of Aurore ripens early in the season between late August and early September. Although the vine is resistant of many mildew diseases, is productive and vigorous; the fruit suffers susceptibility from bunch rot and bird attack. Aurore is planted where growing seasons are short like the Northern United States, Canada and the United Kingdom but is also planted in more temperate climates to extend the harvest season. Aurore may be used as a table or wine grape. It tends not to be used as a table grape due to unsuitability for shipping and is generally used for bulk wine production for blending with wines made Vitis labrusca grape varieties.Lisa Smiley \\"Aurore \\" Iowa State University, 2008.

Aurore was created by the French viticulturist Albert Seibel, working from grapes varieties grown at his nursery and vineyard in Aubenas, Ard√®che in the Rh√¥ne Valley. Seibel named the variety after Aurora,Snooth \\"Aurore\\" Grape Description. Accessed: April 13th, 2013 the Roman goddess of the dawn who according to legend would announce the arrival of the sun every morning. The name Aurora, itself, is derived from the Latin word for dawn and is today still used as a synonym for Aurore. The grape was originally bred to be a table grape variety but fell out of favor for table grape growers due to how quickly the freshly picked grapes spoiled and the tendency of berries to fall off the stem in transit. Aurore was first introduced to the United States, via Ellis Island, in the 1940s and from New York spread throughout the country. Soon it was the most widely planted non-Vitis labrusca grape variety in New York but since the 1970s its numbers have declined as growers began planting more Vitis vinifera and other hybrid varieties. The first plantings of Aurore in Canada were planted in 1946. =Pedigree= Aurore is known as a \\"complex hybrid\\", meaning that within its lineage are grape varieties from a number of species in the Vitis genus--including Vitis vinifera, Vitis rupestris and Vitis lincecumii. The two parent varieties of Aurore, Seibel 788 & Seibel 29, were also Seibel grapes with complex pedigrees themselves. Seibel 788 was a crossing of the two hybrid varieties Sicilien and Clairette Dor√©e Ganzin. Sicilien is a crossing of two Vitis vinifera varieties, Bicane and Pascal blanc, while Clairette Dor√©e Ganzin was an interspecific crossing produced by French grape breeder Victor Ganzin. The two parents of Clairette Dor√©e Ganzin were the Vitis vinifera variety Bourboulenc and the hybrid Ganzin 60 (itself a cross of Aramon noir and a Vitis rupestris variety).Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Clairette Dor√©e Ganzin Accessed: April 13th, 2013 Seibel 29 is a crossing of an unknown Vitis vinifera variety and the Munson hybrid grape (also known as Jaeger 70) that was created by the Missouri viticulturist Hermann Jaeger. Munson is a crossing of a Vitis lincecumii and Vitis rupestris vine. Viticulture One of the viticultural hazards that can afflict Aurore vines are infestations from Japanese beetles. While classified as a white grape varieties and only used to produce white wines, clusters of Aurore blanc often will have a pink tinge to them (similar to Pinot gris and Gew√ºrztraminer though not as dark as those two varieties can be). Aurore is known to be a very vigorous and productive vine, capable of producing high yields and expansive foliage if not kept in check with winter pruning and summer leaf-pulling. It is a very early ripening variety, coming to full ripeness even before varieties such as Chasselas in cold climates. The variety is moderately winter-hardy, able to sustain winter freezes down to .Lon Rombough The Grape Grower: A Guide to Organic Viticulture pgs 128, 181, 202 Chelsea Green Publishing (2002) While Aurore has good resistance to downy mildew, the variety is very susceptible to the viticultural hazards of Eutypa dieback, powdery mildew, black rot and botrytis bunch rot. The smooth leaves of the vine also makes it susceptible to angular leaf scorch as well as infestation from the invasive Japanese beetle. Growers practicing organic viticulture will often use diatomaceous earth as a dusting spray to help deter the beetle but this method is only effective if the dust comes into direct contact with the beetle and gets easily washed off by rains. Aurore berries can be very thin skinned and prone to splitting if rainfall happens too close to harvest. Very mature berries also have a tendency of falling off the stem. Wine regions While Aurore originated in France and in the early 20th century had around 288 hectares (712 acres) planted in the northeastern reaches of the country and in the southwest, today it is hardly found in France. Outside France it is found in several states in the United States (most notably the cool-climate states of Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire and Nebraska). In 2009, wine producers in New York crushed 3,530 tons of the Aurore for both blended and varietal white wine. In New Hampshire, Jewell Towne Vineyards is noted for producing an Aurore varietal. Other states in the US with plantings of Aurore include: Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan (in the Leelanau Peninsula AVA), Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio (in the Lake Erie AVA), Pennsylvania, Washington (in the Puget Sound AVA), West Virginia and Wisconsin. In Canada, Aurore was once widely planted throughout British Columbia but since the 1980s have seen its number of plantings drop drastically along with other hybrid varieties as producers in regions such as the Okanagan Valley transition away from hybrid varieties to international varieties such as Pinot noir and Chardonnay. In Ontario, between 2007 and 2012 around 200 tons of Aurore in total was crushed in the province as the numbers of plantings there also decline. In Qu√©bec, producers such as Domaine des C√¥tes d'Ardoise are still producing varietal examples of Aurore. Styles Aurore is used to produce a wide range of both blended and varietal white wine styles at a variety of sweetness levels from dry to off-dry. Some producers also use the grape to make sparkling wine. While the grape does not travel well for commercial table grape production, it can be a favorite eating grape for home gardeners due to its soft, juicy flesh. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Aurore tends to produce light-bodied floral wines that are relatively neutral in flavor but often exhibit the characteristic \\"foxy\\" note typical of many hybrids. This \\"foxy\\" aroma note tends to be more pronounced from examples produced in the eastern United States than in the west. Very ripe examples of Aurore also tend to exhibit more \\"foxy\\" flavors. Synonyms and confusion with other grapes Over the years Aurore has been known under a variety of synonyms including Aurora, Feri Sz≈ël≈ë, Fin√°nc Sz≈ël≈ë, Redei, S-5279, and Seibel 5279.Aurore Blanc, Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed 2010-11-24 Aurore is often confused with a South American table grape known as Aurora that was produced at the Instituto Agronomico de Campinas in Brazil.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Aurora Accessed: April 13th, 2013 This confusion stems in part to Aurore's history of being originally bred to be a table grape itself and Aurora being one of the known synonyms for the Seibel wine grape.

Accordingly, thermal equilibrium between systems is a transitive relation. Two systems are said to be in the relation of thermal equilibrium if they are linked by a wall permeable only to heat and they do not change over time.Carath√©odory, C. (1909). As a convenience of language, systems are sometimes also said to be in a relation of thermal equilibrium if they are not linked so as to be able to transfer heat to each other, but would still not do so (even) if they were connected by a wall permeable only to heat. The physical meaning is expressed by Maxwell in the words: \\"All heat is of the same kind\\".Maxwell, J.C. (1871), p. 57. Another statement of the law is \\"All diathermal walls are equivalent\\".Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 24, 144. The law is important for the mathematical formulation of thermodynamics, which needs the assertion that the relation of thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation. This information is needed for a mathematical definition of temperature that will agree with the physical existence of valid thermometers.Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999), p. 56. Zeroth law as equivalence relation A thermodynamic system is by definition in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, that is to say, there is no change in its observable state (i.e. macrostate) over time and no flows occur in it. One precise statement of the zeroth law is that the relation of thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation on pairs of thermodynamic systems.Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999), p. 52. In other words, the set of all systems each in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium may be divided into subsets in which every system belongs to one and only one subset, and is in thermal equilibrium with every other member of that subset, and is not in thermal equilibrium with a member of any other subset. This means that a unique \\"tag\\" can be assigned to every system, and if the \\"tags\\" of two systems are the same, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and if different, they are not. This property is used to justify the use of empirical temperature as a tagging system. Empirical temperature provides further relations of thermally equilibrated systems, such as order and continuity with regard to \\"hotness\\" or \\"coldness\\", but these are not implied by the standard statement of the zeroth law. If it is defined that a thermodynamic system is in thermal equilibrium with itself (i.e., thermal equilibrium is reflexive), then the zeroth law may be stated as follows:Planck. M. (1914), p. 2. > If a body C, be in thermal equilibrium with two other bodies, A and B, then > A and B are in thermal equilibrium with one another. This statement asserts that thermal equilibrium is a left-Euclidean relation between thermodynamic systems. If we also define that every thermodynamic system is in thermal equilibrium with itself, then thermal equilibrium is also a reflexive relation. Binary relations that are both reflexive and Euclidean are equivalence relations. Thus, again implicitly assuming reflexivity, the zeroth law is therefore often expressed as a right-Euclidean statement:Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 73. > If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are > in thermal equilibrium with each other. One consequence of an equivalence relationship is that the equilibrium relationship is symmetric: If A is in thermal equilibrium with B, then B is in thermal equilibrium with A. Thus we may say that two systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other, or that they are in mutual equilibrium. Another consequence of equivalence is that thermal equilibrium is a transitive relationship and is occasionally expressed as such:Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999), p. 56.Kondepudi, D. (2008), p. 7. > If A is in thermal equilibrium with B and if B is in thermal equilibrium > with C, then A is in thermal equilibrium with C . A reflexive, transitive relationship does not guarantee an equivalence relationship. In order for the above statement to be true, both reflexivity and symmetry must be implicitly assumed. It is the Euclidean relationships which apply directly to thermometry. An ideal thermometer is a thermometer which does not measurably change the state of the system it is measuring. Assuming that the unchanging reading of an ideal thermometer is a valid \\"tagging\\" system for the equivalence classes of a set of equilibrated thermodynamic systems, then if a thermometer gives the same reading for two systems, those two systems are in thermal equilibrium, and if we thermally connect the two systems, there will be no subsequent change in the state of either one. If the readings are different, then thermally connecting the two systems will cause a change in the states of both systems and when the change is complete, they will both yield the same thermometer reading. The zeroth law provides no information regarding this final reading. Foundation of temperature The zeroth law establishes thermal equilibrium as an equivalence relationship. An equivalence relationship on a set (such as the set of all systems each in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium) divides that set into a collection of distinct subsets (\\"disjoint subsets\\") where any member of the set is a member of one and only one such subset. In the case of the zeroth law, these subsets consist of systems which are in mutual equilibrium. This partitioning allows any member of the subset to be uniquely \\"tagged\\" with a label identifying the subset to which it belongs. Although the labeling may be quite arbitrary,Dugdale, J.S. (1996), p. 35. temperature is just such a labeling process which uses the real number system for tagging. The zeroth law justifies the use of suitable thermodynamic systems as thermometers to provide such a labeling, which yield any number of possible empirical temperature scales, and justifies the use of the second law of thermodynamics to provide an absolute, or thermodynamic temperature scale. Such temperature scales bring additional continuity and ordering (i.e., \\"hot\\" and \\"cold\\") properties to the concept of temperature. In the space of thermodynamic parameters, zones of constant temperature form a surface, that provides a natural order of nearby surfaces. One may therefore construct a global temperature function that provides a continuous ordering of states. The dimensionality of a surface of constant temperature is one less than the number of thermodynamic parameters, thus, for an ideal gas described with three thermodynamic parameters P, V and N, it is a two-dimensional surface. For example, if two systems of ideal gases are in joint thermodynamic equilibrium across an immovable diathermal wall, then = where Pi is the pressure in the ith system, Vi is the volume, and Ni is the amount (in moles, or simply the number of atoms) of gas. The surface = constant defines surfaces of equal thermodynamic temperature, and one may label defining T so that = RT, where R is some constant. These systems can now be used as a thermometer to calibrate other systems. Such systems are known as \\"ideal gas thermometers\\". In a sense, focused on in the zeroth law, there is only one kind of diathermal wall or one kind of heat, as expressed by Maxwell's dictum that \\"All heat is of the same kind\\".Maxwell, J.C. (1871), p. 57. But in another sense, heat is transferred in different ranks, as expressed by Sommerfeld's dictum \\"Thermodynamics investigates the conditions that govern the transformation of heat into work. It teaches us to recognize temperature as the measure of the work-value of heat. Heat of higher temperature is richer, is capable of doing more work. Work may be regarded as heat of an infinitely high temperature, as unconditionally available heat.\\"Sommerfeld, A. (1923), p. 36. This is why temperature is the particular variable indicated by the zeroth law's statement of equivalence. Physical meaning of the usual statement of the zeroth law The present article states the zeroth law as it is often summarized in textbooks. Nevertheless, this usual statement perhaps does not explicitly convey the full physical meaning that underlies it. The underlying physical meaning was perhaps first clarified by Maxwell in his 1871 textbook. In Carath√©odory's (1909) theory, it is postulated that there exist walls \\"permeable only to heat\\", though heat is not explicitly defined in that paper. This postulate is a physical postulate of existence. It does not, however, as worded just previously, say that there is only one kind of heat. This paper of Carath√©odory states as proviso 4 of its account of such walls: \\"Whenever each of the systems S1 and S2 is made to reach equilibrium with a third system S3 under identical conditions, systems S1 and S2 are in mutual equilibrium\\".Carath√©odory, C. (1909), Section 6. It is the function of this statement in the paper, not there labeled as the zeroth law, to provide not only for the existence of transfer of energy other than by work or transfer of matter, but further to provide that such transfer is unique in the sense that there is only one kind of such wall, and one kind of such transfer. This is signaled in the postulate of this paper of Carath√©odory that precisely one non-deformation variable is needed to complete the specification of a thermodynamic state, beyond the necessary deformation variables, which are not restricted in number. It is therefore not exactly clear what Carath√©odory means when in the introduction of this paper he writes \\"It is possible to develop the whole theory without assuming the existence of heat, that is of a quantity that is of a different nature from the normal mechanical quantities.\\" Maxwell (1871) discusses at some length ideas which he summarizes by the words \\"All heat is of the same kind\\". Modern theorists sometimes express this idea by postulating the existence of a unique one-dimensional hotness manifold, into which every proper temperature scale has a monotonic mapping.Serrin, J. (1986), p. 6. This may be expressed by the statement that there is only one kind of temperature, regardless of the variety of scales in which it is expressed. Another modern expression of this idea is that \\"All diathermal walls are equivalent\\".Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 23. This might also be expressed by saying that there is precisely one kind of non-mechanical, non-matter- transferring contact equilibrium between thermodynamic systems. These ideas may be regarded as helping to clarify the physical meaning of the usual statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics. It is the opinion of Lieb and Yngvason (1999) that the derivation from statistical mechanics of the law of entropy increase is a goal that has so far eluded the deepest thinkers.Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999), p. 5. Thus the idea remains open to consideration that the existence of heat and temperature are needed as coherent primitive concepts for thermodynamics, as expressed, for example, by Maxwell and Planck. On the other hand, Planck in 1926 clarified how the second law can be stated without reference to heat or temperature, by referring to the irreversible and universal nature of friction in natural thermodynamic processes.Planck, M. (1926). History According to Arnold Sommerfeld, Ralph H. Fowler coined the term zeroth law of thermodynamics when he was discussing the 1935 text of Meghnad Saha and B. N. Srivastava. They write on page 1 that \\"every physical quantity must be measurable in numerical terms\\". They presume that temperature is a physical quantity and then deduce the statement \\"If a body A is in temperature equilibrium with two bodies B and C, then B and C themselves will be in temperature equilibrium with each other\\". They then in a self-standing paragraph italicize as if to state their basic postulate: \\"Any of the physical properties of A which change with the application of heat may be observed and utilised for the measurement of temperature.\\" They do not themselves here use the term 'zeroth law of thermodynamics'.Sommerfeld, A. (1951/1955), p. 1.Saha, M.N., Srivastava, B.N. (1935), p. 1. There are very many statements of these physical ideas in the physics literature long before this text, in very similar language. What was new here was just the label 'zeroth law of thermodynamics'. Fowler, with co-author Edward A. Guggenheim, wrote of the zeroth law as follows: ::...we introduce the postulate: If two assemblies are each in thermal equilibrium with a third assembly, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. They then proposed that \\"it may be shown to follow that the condition for thermal equilibrium between several assemblies is the equality of a certain single-valued function of the thermodynamic states of the assemblies, which may be called the temperature t, any one of the assemblies being used as a \\"thermometer\\" reading the temperature t on a suitable scale. This postulate of the \\"Existence of temperature\\" could with advantage be known as the zeroth law of thermodynamics\\". The first sentence of this present article is a version of this statement.Fowler, R., Guggenheim, E.A. (1939/1965), p. 56. It is not explicitly evident in the existence statement of Fowler and Guggenheim that temperature refers to a unique attribute of a state of a system, such as is expressed in the idea of the hotness manifold. Also their statement refers explicitly to statistical mechanical assemblies, not explicitly to macroscopic thermodynamically defined systems.

Background  = Europe and the Catholic Church = Under the influence of ascending new philosophies and ideologies such as the enlightenment, realism, positivism, materialism, nationalism, secularism and liberalism, the role of religion in society and the relationship between society and church underwent profound changes in the 18th and 19th centuries. Many countries endeavoured to strip the church of worldly powers; reduce the duties of the church to spiritual affairs by secularising the public sphere and by separation of church and state; and to assert the supremacy of the state, especially in education.Christopher Clark, Iron Kingdom (2006) pp 412-19 R√≥is√≠n Healy (2003) argues that across Europe, the Kulturkampf operated mainly on the state level and was found \\"especially in strongholds of liberalism, anti-clericalism, and anti-Catholicism.\\" Pope Pius IX (ca. 1878) The Catholic Church resisted this development which it portrayed as an attack on religion and sought to maintain and even strengthen its strong role in the state and society.Nicholas Atkin and Frank Tallett, Priests, Prelates and People: A History of European Catholicism since 1750 (Oxford UP, 2003) pp 128, 193 With the growing influence of enlightenment and after having lost much of its wealth, power and influence in the mediatisation and secularization of the early 19th century the church had been in a state of decline.Franz, Georg in: Kulturkampf.

The church strove to revert its waning influence and to keep sway in such matters as e. g. marriage, family and education and initiated a Catholic revival by founding associations, papers, schools, social establishments or new orders and encouraging religious practices such as pilgrimages, mass assemblies, the devotion of Virgin Mary or the sacred heart of Jesus and the veneration of relics;Knight, Frances in : History of the Christian Church, Vol. 6: The Church in the 19th. Century, I.B.Tauris, London, 2008, the pope himself became an object of devotion.Dittrich, Lisa in: Antiklerikalismuns in Europa: √ñffentlichkeit und S√§kularisierung in Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland (1848‚Äì1914), Vandenhoek & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen, 1914, , p. 58 Apart from the extraordinary proliferation of religious orders, the 19th. century also witnessed the rise of countless Catholic associations and organisations, especially in Germany and in France.Dittrich, Lisa in: Antiklerikalismuns in Europa: √ñffentlichkeit und S√§kularisierung in Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland (1848‚Äì1914), Vandenhoek & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen, 1914, , p. 55 Catholic propaganda including the interpretation of daily events was spread through local and national Catholic newspapers prominent in all western European nations as well as through organized missions and groups dedicated to pious literature.Ruppert, Stefan in: Kirchenkampf und Kulturkampf: Historische Legitimation, politische Mitwirkung und wissenschaftliche Begleitung durch die Schule Emil Ludwig Richter, Mohr Siebeck, T√ºbingen, 2002, , p.6-8 In the 19th century, the Catholic Church promulgated a series of contentious dogmas and encyclicals. In 1832, in the encyclical Mirari vos, Pope Gregory XVI condemned liberalism, free press and free thought. Under the leadership of his successor, Pope Pius IX: * 1854: the church proclaimed Mary's immaculate conception. * 1864: the Vatican published the encyclical Quanta cura and Syllabus of Errors. * 1870: the First Vatican Council declared the dogma of Papal infallibility. With its \\"Syllabus of Errors\\" of 1864, the Catholic Church launched an assault on the new ideologies, condemning 80 philosophical and political statements, mainly the foundations of the modern nation state, as false. It outright rejected such concepts as freedom of religion, free thought, separation of church and state, civil marriage, sovereignty of the people, democracy, liberalism and socialism, reason as the sole base of human action, and in general condemned the idea of conciliation with progress. The announcements included an index of forbidden books.Nicholas Atkin, and Frank Tallett. Priests, Prelates and People: A History of European Catholicism, 1750 to the Present (2003). pp 104-6 A profound change was the gradual reorganization of the Catholic Church and its expansive use of the media. The popes worked to increase their control of the Church. Heavily criticized by European governments, it was centralized and streamlined with a strict hierarchy, the bishops sought direction from the Vatican and the needs and views of the international church were given priority over the local ones. Opponents of the new hierarchical church organization pejoratively called it ultramontanism.Healy, Roisin in: The Jesuit Spectre in Imperial Germany, Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, , p. 42Grew, Raymond in: \\"Liberty and the Catholic Church in 19th. century Europe\\", Freedom and Religion in the 19th. Century, edited by Richard Helmstadter, Stanford University Press, 1997, , p. 198-200 In view of the church's opposition to enlightenment, liberal reforms and the revolutions of the 18th/19th centuries, these dogmas and the church's expressed insistence on papal primacy angered the liberal-minded all across Europe, even among some Catholics, adding fuel to the heated debates.Dittrich, Lisa in: Antiklerikalismuns in Europa: √ñffentlichkeit und S√§kularisierung in Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland (1848‚Äì1914), Vandenhoek & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen, 1914, , p. 182 The dogmas represented a threat to the secularized state as they reaffirmed that the fundamental allegiance of Catholics was not to their nation-state, but to the Gospel and the Church and that the pope's teaching was absolutely authoritative and binding on all the faithful. Secular politicians even wondered whether \\"Catholicism and allegiance to the modern liberal state were not mutually exclusive\\". British Prime Minister Gladstone wrote in 1874 that the teaching on papal infallibility compromised the allegiance of faithful English Catholics. For European liberalism, the dogmas were a declaration of war against the modern state, science and spiritual freedom.Bucheim, Karl in: Geschichte der christlichen Parteien in Deutschland. K√∂sel, Munich, 1953, ASIN B0000BGX87, p. 197 The pope's handling of dissent of the dogmas, e. g. by excommunication of critics or demanding their removal from schools and universities, was considered as \\"epitome of papal authoritarianism\\".Healy, Roisin in: The Jesuit Spectre in Imperial Germany, Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, , p. 55 In direct response to the Vatican's announcements, Austria passed the so-called May-Laws for Cisleithania in 1868, restricting the Concordat of 1855, and then cancelled the concordat altogether in 1870. Saxony and Bavaria withheld approval to publish the papal infallibility dogma; Hesse and Baden even denied it any legal validity. France refused to publish the doctrines altogether; Spain forbade publication of the Syllabus of Errors in 1864.Dittrich, Lisa in: Antiklerikalismuns in Europa: √ñffentlichkeit und S√§kularisierung in Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland (1848‚Äì1914), Vandenhoek & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen, 1914, , p. 95 = Germany =  Pre-1871  Anti-Catholic caricature in the Munich Leuchtkugeln, 1848. A warning not to rejoice yet. The Catholic cleric as a fox and blind passenger on the wagon of progress, in order to later reverse the course of history. By the mid-19th century, liberal policies had also come to dominate Germany and the separation of church and state became a prominent issue.Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, , p 199-200Iv√°n T. Berend in: An Economic History of 19th-century Europe, Cambridge University Press, , p 93 The Kulturkampf in Prussia is usually framed by the years 1871 and 1878 with the Catholic Church officially announcing its end in 1880 but the struggle in Germany had been an ongoing matter without definite beginning and the years 1871 to 1878 only mark its culmination in Prussia. In the wake of other European countries, most German states had taken first steps of secularisation well before unification. Predominantly Catholic Baden was at the forefront curbing the power of the Catholic Church (Baden Church Dispute, 1852‚Äì1854) and (Badischer Kulturkampf, 1864‚Äì1876).Healy, Roisin in: The Jesuit Spectre in Imperial Germany, Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, , p. 57de Gruyter, Walter in: Theologische Realenzykolp√§die, Vol. 1, Berlin-New York, 1993, p. 101, Other examples are Prussia (1830s, 1850, 1859, and 1969), W√ºrttemberg (1859/1862), Bavaria (', 1867), Hesse-Nassau or Hesse-Darmstadt.

As in many European countries, Jesuits were being banned or heavily restricted in many of the German states e. g. in Saxony (1831) and even in Catholic ones such as Bavaria (1851), Baden (1860) or W√ºrttemberg (1862).Healy, Roisin in: The Jesuit Spectre in Imperial Germany, Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, , p. 52 Not to be left out, the German areas to the west of the Rhine had already gone through a process of separation of church and state in line with a radical secularization after annexation by revolutionary and Napoleonic France in 1794. After their return to Germany in 1814, many if not most of the changes were kept in place.Rowe, Michael in: From Reich to State. The Rhineland in the Revolutionary Age, Cambridge University Press, 2003, , p. 259-264 In the Vorm√§rz period, Catholic publications usually portrayed revolutions as negative and dangerous to the existing order as well as to the interests of the Catholic Church. Most of them considered a viable Catholicism to be necessary for the very health of society and state and to be the only true and effective protection against the scourge of revolution.Schneider, Bernhard in: Katholiken auf die Barrikaden? Europ√§ische Revolutionen und deutsche katholische Presse 1815‚Äì1848, Reihe B: Forschungen, Vol. 84., Ferdinand Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn, 1998, The unsuccessful German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49, which the Catholic Church had opposed, produced no democratic reforms and attempts to radically disentangle state-church relationships failed. In the revolutionary parliament, many prominent representatives of political Catholicism took the side of the extreme right- wingers. In the years following the revolution, Catholicism became increasingly politicised due to the massive anti-modernist and anti-liberal policies of the Vatican. In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and Franco- Prussian War of 1870 the Catholic Church sided against Prussia and it was an outspoken opponent of German unification under Prussia (as well as of Italy's unification). The Catholic dogmas and doctrines announced in 1854, 1864 and 1870 were perceived in Germany as direct attacks on the modern nation state.Robbins, Keith in: The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780‚Äì1920, Political and Legal Perspectives, Leuven University Press, , p.158-161 Thus, Bismarck, the Liberals and the Conservatives representing orthodox Protestants found the Centre Party's support of the pope highly provocative. Many Catholics shared these sentiments, especially against the pope's declared infallibility and the majority of Catholic German bishops deemed the definition of the dogma as \\"'unpropitious' in light of the situation in Germany\\". While most Catholics eventually reconciled themselves to the doctrine, some founded the small breakaway Old Catholic Church. According to the Bavarian head of government, Hohenlohe, the dogma of infallibility compromised the Catholic's loyalty to the state.Healy, Roisin in: The Jesuit Spectre in Imperial Germany, Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, , p. 56 He sent a circular to all the diplomatic representatives of the Bavarian Kingdom saying, \\"The only dogmatic thesis which Rome desires to have decided by the Council, and which the Jesuits in Italy and Germany are now agitating, is the question of the Infallibility of the Pope. This pretension once become a dogma, will have a wider scope than the purely spiritual spheres, and will become evidently a political question: for it will raise the power of the Sovereign Pontiff, even in temporal matters, above all the princes and peoples of Christendom.\\" The liberal majorities in the Imperial Diet and the Prussian parliament as well as liberals in general regarded the Church as backward, a hotbed for reactionaries, enemies of progress and cast monastic life as the epitome of a backward Catholic medievalism. They were alarmed by the dramatic rise in the numbers of monasteries, convents and clerical religious groups in an era of widespread religious revival. The Diocese of Cologne, for example, saw a tenfold increase of monks and nuns between 1850 and 1872. Prussian authorities were particularly suspicious of the spread of monastic life among the Polish and French minorities.Gross, The War Against Catholicism, pp. 128-131, Univ. of Michigan Press 2004 The Church, in turn, saw the National-Liberals its worst enemy, accusing them of spearheading the war against Christianity and the Catholic Church.Winkler, Heinrich in: Der lange Weg nach Westen: Deutsche Geschichte vom Ende des Alten ..., Vol 1, Beck Verlag, Munich, 2002, p. 218,  1871‚Äì72  At unification in 1871, the new German Empire included 25.5 million Protestants (62% of the population) and 15 million Catholics (36.5% of the population). Although a minority in the empire, Catholics were the majority in the states of Bavaria, Baden, and Alsace-Lorraine as well as in the four Prussian Provinces of West Prussia, Posen, Rhineland, Westphalia and in the Prussian region of Upper Silesia. Since the Thirty Years' War the population was generally segregated along religious lines and rural areas or towns were overwhelmingly if not entirely of the same religion. Education was also separate and usually in the hands of the churches. There was little mutual tolerance, interaction or intermarriage. Protestants in general were deeply distrustful of the Catholic Church. Bismarck c. 1875 Unification had been achieved through many obstacles with strong opponents. These were the European powers of France and Austria, both Catholic nations, and the Catholic Church itself, the three of which Bismarck perceived as \\"Coalition of Catholic Revenge\\". For Bismarck, the empire was very fragile and its consolidation was an important issue. Biographer Otto Pflanze emphasizes, \\"Bismarck's belief in the existence of a widespread Catholic conspiracy that posed a threat to both his German and European policies.\\" In a Protestant empire, the Catholic Church was to lose its good standing which it had enjoyed for centuries in the Catholic-dominated Holy Roman Empire and which it would have continued to enjoy in a German empire united under Austrian auspices. Thus, in 1870, on the eve of unification, the Center Party was explicitly founded to defend the position of the church in the new empire. Bismarck was highly concerned that many major members and supporters of this new party were not in sympathy with the new empire: the House of Hanover, the ethnic minority of the Poles, the southern German states. In 1871, the predominantly Catholic states of Southern Germany had only reluctantly joined the empire, increasing the overall share of the Catholic population to 36.5%. Among this Catholic share was Germany's largest ethnic minority, well over 2 million Poles in the east of Prussia, who under Prussia and Germany suffered discrimination and oppression.Wielka historia Polski t. 4 Polska w czasach walk o niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá (1815‚Äì1864). Od niewoli do niepodleg≈Ço≈õci (1864‚Äì1918) Marian Zag√≥rniak, J√≥zef Buszko 2003 page 186 Bismarck regarded the new Centre Party not only as an illegal mixup of politics and religion and the church's \\"long arm\\" but also as a unifying force for Catholic Germans and Poles and thus a threat to the consolidation of the empire. He feared that the Centre Party would frustrate his broader political agendas and he accused the Catholic priests of fostering Polish nationalism as had been done openly in the provinces of Posen and Upper Silesia.Robbins, Keith in: The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780‚Äì1920, Political and Legal Perspectives, Leuven University Press, , p. 178Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, , p 199Arlinghouse, Francis in: The Kulturkampf and European Diplomacy 1871‚Äì1875 in The Catholic Historical Review 28/3, 1942, p. 342Ross, Ronald in: \\"Kulturkampf.

A wave of anti-Catholic, anticlerical and anti-monastic pamphleteering in the liberal press was answered by anti-liberal preaching and propaganda in Catholic newspapers and vice versa. For these reasons, the government sought to wean the Catholic masses away from the hierarchy and the Centre Party and the liberal's demands to curb the power of the churches meshed well with Bismarck's main political objective to crush the Centre Party. According to historian Anthony J. Steinhoff: > Bismarck's plan to disarm political Catholicism delighted liberal > politicians, who provided the parliamentary backing for the crusade. Yet, > the phrase the left-liberal Rudolf Virchow coined for this struggle, the > Kulturkampf, suggests that the liberals wanted to do more than prevent > Catholicism from becoming a political force. They wanted victory over > Catholicism itself, the long-delayed conclusion of the Reformation.Anthony > J. Steinhoff, \\"Christianity and the creation of Germany,\\" in Sheridan Gilley > and Brian Stanley, eds. Cambridge History of Christianity: Volume 8: > 1814‚Äì1914 (2008) p 294 At least since 1847 and in line with the Liberals, Bismarck had also been of the professed opinion, that state and church should be completely separated and \\"the sphere of the state had to be made secure against the incursions by the church,\\"Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, , p 201 although his ideas were not as far- reaching as in the United States or in Great Britain. He had in mind the traditional position of the Protestant church in Prussia and provoked considerable resistance from conservative Protestants. This became clear in a heated debate with Prussian culture minister von M√ºhler in 1871 when Bismarck said: \\"Since you stopped my plans in the Protestant church, I have to go via Rome.\\"Rumsch√∂ttel, Prof. Dr. Hermann in: Bismarcks Kulturkampf. Motive und Gegner, Presentation at Sommerakademie St. Bonifaz 2013 ‚ÄìKulturkampf in Bayern- http://sankt-bonifaz.de/fileadmin/images- bonifaz/redakteur/colloquium/docs/neu-Rumsch%C3%B6ttel_Bismarck-2013.pdf In August 1871, at Bad Ems, Bismarck revealed his intention to fight against the Centre Party, to separate state and church, to transfer school inspection to laymen, to abolish religious instruction from schools and to transfer religious affairs to the minister of justice.Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, , p 200-201 On 22 January 1872, liberal Adalbert Falk replaced conservative Heinrich von M√ºhler as Prussian minister for religion, education and health. In Bismarck's mind, Falk was \\"to re-establish the rights of the state in relation to the church\\". Yet, unlike Bismarck, whose main motivation for the Kulturkampf was the political power struggle with the Centre Party, Falk, a lawyer, was a strong proponent of state authority having in mind the legal aspects of state- church relationships. Falk became the driving force behind the Kulturkampf laws. Although Bismarck publicly supported Falk, he doubted the success of his laws and was unhappy with his lack of political tact and sensitivity. The differences in their attitudes concerning the Kulturkampf eventually put the two politicians at odds with each other. With this background and the determination of church and state, the Kulturkampf in Germany acquired an additional edge as it gathered in intensity and bitterness.  Timeline, 1871‚Äì76  \\"Between Berlin and Rome\\", with Bismarck on the left and the Pope on the right, from the German satirical magazine Kladderadatsch, 1875. Pope: \\"Admittedly, the last move was unpleasant for me; but the game still isn't lost. I still have a very beautiful secret move.\\" Bismarck: \\"That will also be the last one, and then you'll be mated in a few moves ‚Äì at least in Germany.\\" From 1871 to 1876, the Prussian state parliament and the federal legislature (Reichstag), both with liberal majorities, enacted 22 laws in the context of the Kulturkampf. They were mainly directed against clerics: bishops, priests and religious orders (anti-clerical) and enforced the supremacy of the state over the church.Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, , p 202 While several laws were specific to the Catholic Church (Jesuits, congregations etc.) the general laws affected both Catholic and Protestant churches. In an attempt to overcome increasing resistance by the Catholic Church and its defiance of the laws, new regulations increasingly went beyond state matters referring to the purely internal affairs of the church. Even many liberals saw them as an encroachment on civil liberties, compromising their own credo.Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, , p 206 Constitutionally, education and regulation of religious affairs were vested in the federal states and the leading actor of the Kulturkampf was Prussia, Germany's largest state. However, some of the laws were also passed by the Reichstag and applied to all of Germany. In general, the laws did not affect the press and associations including Catholic ones. = 1871 = * June 8: Fusion of Catholic and Protestant sections in the Prussian Ministry of Culture (responsible for religious matters). The Catholic section had been installed in 1840. The reason given for the merger was, that \\"the exclusively political attitude of equal justice to all\\" was to be adopted and that for that purpose one ecclesiastical department was required.Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, 1971, , p 200The War between Prussia and Rome in: Quarterly Review, John Murray, London, 1874, Vol. 136, p. 311 The merger was also a precondition for the School Supervision Act of the following year.Geschichte der CDU (History of the Christian Democratic Party of Germany) in: http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.8617/ * December 10: Empire, Pulpit Law (Kanzelparagraph) passed at the initiative of Bavaria and meant to curb what was considered the misuse of religious sermons for political agitation from the pulpit.Lougee, Robert W., The Kulturkampf and Historical Positivism, pp. 219‚Äì220, Church History, Vol. 23, No. 3, Sep., 1954, Cambridge Univ. The law read: \\"Any cleric or other minister of religion shall be punished with imprisonment or incarceration of up to two years if he, while exercising his occupation or having his occupation exercised, makes state affairs the subject of announcements or discussion either in public before a crowd, in a church, or before any number of people in some other place designated for religious gatherings in such a way that it endangers the public peace.\\"see text = 1872 = * January 22: Adalbert Falk became Prussian minister for spiritual, educational and health matters * March 11: Prussian (Schulaufsichtsgesetz). This legislation was at the heart of the Kulturkampf, abolishing church oversight of the Prussian primary school system (Catholic and Protestant), excluding the clergy from education and eliminating its influence in curricular matters. This was a milestone for liberalism, as placing education into the hands of the government had always been at the top of its agenda. It was to ensure an open-minded and neutral education as the prerequisite for a progressive society. In the eyes of Bismarck, this law was necessary after the church, putting itself in opposition to the state, used the schools to incite the young against the government. * April: The Vatican rejected Gustav Adolf, Cardinal Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst as German ambassador to the Holy See. Schillingsf√ºrst had been critical of the infallibility dogma but eventually accepted the decision of the council. Therefore, Bismarck took him for a suitable mediator. In response to the rejection, the diplomatic mission was left vacant and Prussia suspended relations with the Vatican in December 1872. * July 4: Empire, Jesuit Law banning of the Jesuits who were seen as the emissaries of Rome and the spearhead of ultramontanism. By acknowledging the supremacy of Papal authority, the Jesuits were accused of contesting the secular authority. The law allowed for the dissolution of all Jesuit chapters and expulsion of its members. The following year the law was extended to closely related orders: the Redemptorists, Lazarists, Fathers of the Holy Ghost, and the Ladies of the Sacred Heart. Continued and increasing Church resistance and contempt of the 1871/1872 laws led to changes in the constitution and the enactment of further laws. In order to facilitate these laws, the Prussian Constitution was amended. * September 20: The Prussian bishops, at a conference in Fulda, protested against the regulations hostile to the church. * December 23: The pope, in an address to his cardinals, denounced the new laws as persecution of the church. = 1873 = Rudolf Virchow, 1861 * January 17: The term Kulturkampf comes into play. Debating the law on education conditions for the employment of clerics, a Progressive deputy in the Prussian legislature ‚Äì the distinguished medical scientist and pioneer of public health methods, Rudolf Virchow said: \\"Ich habe die √úberzeugung, es handelt sich hier um einen gro√üen Kulturkampf\\" ('I am of the conviction that this is about a great cultural struggle').Winkler, Heinrich August in: Der lange Weg nach Westen. Deutsche Geschichte 1806‚Äì1933, Munich 2000, p. 222. He repeated this term in a call for a vote by the German Progress Party on 23 March 1873. It was ironically picked up and derided in the Catholic press and enthusiastically defended in the liberal.Bachem, Karl in: 'Vorgeschichte, Geschichte und Politik der Deutschen Zentrumspartei, Vol. III, 1927, p. 268‚Äì269 * January 30: While the laws were being debated in parliament, the Prussian bishops submit a protest against the planned legislation and in a memorial, they announced their opposition to the new laws. * April 5: Prussia, Amendment of Sections 15, 16 and 18 of the Prussian Constitution: ** In section 15 the sentence \\"The Protestant and the Roman Catholic Church, as well as every other religious community, regulates and administers its affairs independently\\" is supplemented by \\"but remain subject to the laws of the state and its legally regulated superintendence\\". It is added, that the same applies to the possession or beneficial use of institutions for religion, teaching, charity, endowments and funds. ** Section 16, regarding the unrestricted dealings of religious communities with their seniors and public announcements according to general regulations was cancelled. ** Section 18 cancelled the state's right to appoint, nominate, elect or confirm clerics for a post. But the amendment added, that the state could regulate the minimum education required for clerical posts, the appointment and dismissal of clergymen and servicemen of religion, and define the limits of ecclesiastical disciplinary measures. * May 2: The bishops issued a common pastoral letter explaining to the faithful the necessity to unanimously and passively resist these laws. * May 11-14: Four \\"May Laws\\" passed in 1873 and were enacted on May 11 through 14 that year. * May 26: The bishops issued another pastoral letter calling on the faithful to resist the new laws and informed the Prussian government that they would not cooperate in their execution. Parish councils declined to elect new pastors or accept parish administrators. Exiled or imprisoned bishops used underground networks. The bishops of M√ºnster and Paderborn refused the Kulturexamen for their seminaries and appointed priests without notifying authorities. Clergy obeying the mandate of the bishops immediately became subject to the punishments prescribed by the laws. Fines were imposed in hundreds of cases and the clerics resisted to pay at which, in turn, the government resorted to force, either by confiscation or imprisonment of up to two years. * November 21: In his encyclical Etsi multa on the persecution of the Church in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland, the pope wrote of Germany \\"No wonder, then, that the former religious tranquility has been gravely disturbed in that Empire by this kind of law and other plans and actions of the Prussian government most hostile to the Church. But who would wish to falsely cast the blame of this disturbance on the Catholics of the German Empire!\\"Robbins, Keith in: The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780‚Äì1920, Political and Legal Perspectives, Leuven University Press, , p. 180 He claimed that Freemasonry was the motivating force behind the Kulturkampf.\\"Some of you may perchance wonder that the war against the Catholic Church extends so widely. Indeed each of you knows well the nature, zeal, and intention of sects, whether called Masonic or some other name. When he compares them with the nature, purpose, and amplitude of the conflict waged nearly everywhere against the Church, he cannot doubt but that the present calamity must be attributed to their deceits and machinations for the most part. For from these the synagogue of Satan is formed which draws up its forces, advances its standards, and joins battle against the Church of Christ.\\" Para 28, Etsi Multa Ludwig Windthorst, 1872  May Laws  The Falk Laws, or 'May Laws' (Maigesetze), were a set of laws passed by the Prussian parliament in the years 1873, 1874, and 1875. Four laws passed in 1873 were enacted on May 11 through 14 that year: :1. Law on religious disaffiliation allowing a person to sever his connection with the church by simple declaration before a justice of the peace. This declaration freed him from all civil effects of belonging to a church, especially ecclesiastical burthens and dues. :2. Law on ecclesiastical disciplinary measures restricting the exercise of ecclesiastical punishments and means of discipline directed against the life, property, freedom or honour of citizens. This included the infliction of the great excommunication if proclaimed with the name of the guilty, because of possible disturbances of civil and social intercourse. Thus, disciplinary measures were almost totally restricted to the spiritual realm (see state Monopoly on violence). :3. Ecclesiastical disciplinary law concerning ecclesiastical power of discipline and the establishment of The Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs. This subordinated the Catholic Church to state jurisdiction not only in external but also in internal matters.Geschichte der CDU in: http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.8617/ The law regulated the exercise of disciplinary power by church authorities against their officers for special violation of their duties. Members of the court had to be Germans residing in Germany. Bodily chastisement by the Church was entirely forbidden, fines were limited to maximum amounts, restrictions of freedom could only consist in banishment to a church institution within Germany no longer than 3 months and not against the will of the person concerned. On the other hand, the new court also was given jurisdiction over ecclesiastical officers in violation of state laws. :With this law, the German clergy was to be exempt from any juridical body outside of the nation. Hence, judgments of the Holy See or the Roman Rota would not be binding upon them. The highest court was made up of Prussian ecclesiastics, all appointed with the permission of Prussian civil authorities. The Church's juridical and punitive powers were restricted by allowing clerics, e. g. those punished by the Church for not resisting the Kulturkampf laws, to appeal to the Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs. Bishops in defiance of this law could be deposed. :4. Education standards and civic registry law concerning the education and appointment of priests. Regarding the Protestant Church, these regulations had already been in force for a long time. All men intended for priesthood needed a graduate degree (Abitur) from a German and study 3 years of theology at a German university. :All appointments of clerics had to be approved by the state. Herewith, training and appointment of the clergy came under state supervision. The traditional regimen of clerical study was to be replaced by a modern education in a liberal German institution, thus ensuring that candidates to the priesthood were imbued with the spirit of secularism. Furthermore, ecclesiastical offices could only be filled with the permission of the highest civil authority in each province, essentially reviving the ancient practice of lay investiture. = 1874 = * March 9: Prussian Civil Registry Law (birth, marriage, death). The same law was passed for the whole empire on 6 February 1875. * May 4: Empire, Expatriation Law was meant to curb the exercise of church duties by clerics without the required consent of authorities. The law stipulated, that in such cases, after a final conviction, a cleric would be banned from his parish or sent to another place within the empire and, in case of reoccurrence, that the cleric would be expatriated and expelled. * May 20: Prussian Law on the administration of vacant bishoprics. According to the law of 11 May 1873, administrators were to be elected for vacant bishoprics, authorizing laymen to assume administrative responsibilities at the parish level. This additional law stipulated that should an administrator not be elected according to the law, the property would be managed by a state superintendent. * July 13: In the town of Bad Kissingen, Eduard Kullmann attempted to assassinate Bismarck with a pistol, but only hit his hand. Kullmann cited church laws as the reason for his attempt; he was sentenced to 14 years of Zuchthaus (correctional facilities with harsh forced labor). The assassination attempt led to an intensification of the Kulturkampf measures. = 1875 = * February 5: The encyclical Quod Nunquam declared that the May Laws were invalid, \\"insofar as they totally oppose the divine order of the Church.\\" The Catholic newspaper Westf√§lischer Merkur was the first to publish the whole text on the 18th of the same month in Germany. All the following papers publishing the encyclical were confiscated. * April 22: The Prussian Payment Law (Breadbasket Law) stopped government subsidies and payments for the Catholic bishoprics and clerics unless they signed a declaration of adherence to all laws. * May 31: Prussian Congregations Law dissolving all orders within 6 months except those involved in care for the infirm. For teaching orders, the time could be extended. * June 20: Prussian Church Finances Administration Law providing for a representation and a council elected by the parish for the administration of property. * July 4: Prussian Old-Catholic Church Entitlement Law giving Old-Catholic communities of a certain size the right to use Catholic churches and cemeteries. = 1876 = The last two laws passed in 1876 were of no practical importance: * February 26: The possible punishment for violation of the pulpit law was extended to publications. * June 7: The State Supervision Act provided for government supervision of all church assets in the Catholic dioceses in Prussia.  Mitigation and Peace Laws, 1878‚Äì1887  Pope Leo XIII (c. 1898) The political situation in Europe was very volatile. Initially perceived as a possible enemy hostile to German unification under Prussian leadership, Austria and Germany very quickly became friends and formed the Dual Alliance in 1879. The possibility of a war with France or Russia also became more remote. Therefore, social and economic problems moved to the fore and Bismarck's attention gradually turned to other topics he deemed more threatening such as the increasing popularity of the socialists or more important such as questions of import duties. In these matters, he could either not rely on the support of the liberals to pursue his goals or they were not sufficient to form a majority. Bismarck had not been comfortable with the increasing ferocity of the Kulturkampf. Concerning the rise of the Centre Party, the laws had proven to be greatly ineffective and even counterproductive. He soon realized that they were of no help battling the Centre Party and as far as separation of state and church was concerned, he had achieved more than he wanted. In order to garner support for his Anti-Socialist Laws and protective trade tariffs, Bismarck turned his back on the liberals in search of new alliances. The death of Pius IX on 7 February 1878 opened the door for a settlement with the Catholic Church. The new pope, Leo XIII was pragmatic and conciliatory and expressed his wish for peace in a letter to the Prussian king on the very day of his election followed by a second letter in a similar vein that same year. Bismarck and the Pope entered into direct negotiations without the participation of the Church or the Reichstag, yet initially without much success. It came to pass that Falk, vehemently resented by Catholics, resigned on 14 July 1879, which could be read as a peace offering to the Vatican. A decisive boost only came in February 1880, when the Vatican unexpectedly agreed to the civic registry of clerics. As the Kulturkampf slowly wound down the talks lead to a number of so-called mitigation and peace laws which were passed until 1887. * 1880 July: The First Mitigation Law reallowed government payments to Prussian dioceses and freed the bishops from swearing allegiance to the Prussian laws. Hereupon, four new bishops were reinstated where seats had been left vacant after the death of former bishops. Catholic associations involved in the care of the infirm were readmitted. * 1882: Resumption of diplomatic relations between Prussia (not Germany) and the Vatican, which had been cut in 1872 * 1882 May 31: The Second Mitigation Law allowed the waiver of government exams for clerics * 1883 July: The Third Mitigation Law legalized all religious actions of bishops and in certain cases, the king could pardon deposed bishops. 280 expelled clerics were pardoned. On 29 September 1885, as another sign of peace, Bismarck proposed the Pope as arbiter in a dispute with Spain about the Caroline Islands and accepted his verdict in favour of Spain. In gratitude but to the great horror of Catholics, the Pope awarded Bismarck the Supreme Order of Christ, the highest order of chivalry to be granted by the Holy See. Bismarck was the only Protestant ever to receive this award. After further negotiations between Prussia and the Vatican, the Prussian parliament passed 2 additional laws amending some of the Kulturkampf laws. * 1886 May 21: The First Peace Law amended some of the regulations in the education standards and civic registry law of 11 May 1873 and state exams for clerics (waiver in Second Mitigation Law of 31 May 1882) were totally abolished. Episcopal-theological academies and seminaries, as well as theological studies at these institutions, were readmitted. Students were allowed to be quartered in Catholic boarding houses (Konvikts). The state acknowledged papal disciplinary powers and abolished The Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs * 1887 April 26: The Second Peace Law readmitted all orders except the Jesuits to Prussia On 23 May 1887, the Pope declared \\"The struggle which damaged the church and was of no good to the state is now over\\". The Mitigation and Peace Laws restored the inner autonomy of the Catholic church while leaving key regulations and the laws concerning separation of church and state in place (civic marriage, civic registry, religious disaffiliation, government school supervision, civic registry of clerics, ban of Jesuits, pulpit law, state supervision of church assets, constitutional amendments and the Catholic section in the Ministry of Culture was not reintroduced). The respective opposing parties in the Reichstag harshly criticized the concessions made by the Vatican and the Prussian government. Windthorst and the Centre Party were dismayed at being sidelined and not being consulted about the concessions the pope made, e. g. about the ban on Jesuits or the civil registry of clerics. None of the party's major demands were met. Instead, the pope even sided with Bismarck on non-religious issues and pressured the Centre Party to support Bismarck or at least abstain, e. g. in the matter of the hotly debated Septennat 1887 (7-year military budget). Many Liberals, especially Falk, objected to the concessions Bismarck made to the Church. The growth of the Centre Party has been considered a major setback for Bismarck although never publicly conceded. Yet, in spite of strong Catholic representation in the Reichstag, the political power and influence of the Church in the public sphere and its political power was greatly reduced. Although Germany and the Vatican were officially at peace after 1878, religious conflicts and tensions continued. At the turn of the century, Pope Pius X announced the encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis, mounting new attacks on historical criticism of biblical texts and any accommodation of Catholicism to modern philosophy, sociology or literature. As of 1910, clerics had to take an oath against all forms of modernism, a requirement later extended to teachers of Catholic religion at schools and professors of Catholic theology resulting in intense political and public debates and new conflicts with the state.Robbins, Keith in: The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780‚Äì1920, Political and Legal Perspectives, Leuven University Press, , p. 180-181  Effects and impact  The abolition of the Catholic section of the Prussian Ministry of ecclesiastical and educational affairs deprived Catholics of their voice at the highest level. The system of strict government supervision of schools was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone. The school politics also alienated Protestant conservatives and churchmen.Lamberti, (2001) p 177 The British ambassador Odo Russell reported to London in October 1872 how Bismarck's plans were backfiring by strengthening the ultramontane (pro-papal) position inside German Catholicism: :The German Bishops who were politically powerless in Germany and theologically in opposition to the Pope in Rome ‚Äì have now become powerful political leaders in Germany and enthusiastic defenders of the now infallible Faith of Rome, united, disciplined, and thirsting for martyrdom, thanks to Bismarck's uncalled for antiliberal declaration of War on the freedom they had hitherto peacefully enjoyed.Quoted in Edward Crankshaw, Bismarck (1981) pp 308-9 Nearly all German bishops, clergy and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws and were defiantly facing the increasingly heavy penalties, trials and imprisonments. As of 1878, only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, some 1,125 of 4,600 parishes were vacant, and nearly 1,800 priests ended up in jail or in exile, nearly half the monks and nuns had left Prussia, a third of the monasteries and convents were closed. Between 1872 and 1878, numerous Catholic newspapers were confiscated, Catholic associations and assemblies were dissolved, and Catholic civil servants were dismissed merely on the pretence of having Ultramontane sympathies. Thousands of laypeople were imprisoned for assisting priests to evade the punitive new laws.Helmstadter, Richard J., Freedom and religion in the nineteenth century, p. 19, Stanford Univ. Press 1997Steinhoff, \\"Christianity and the creation of Germany,\\" (2008) p 295 The general ideological enthusiasm among the liberals for the Kulturkampf\\"Liberals were the most enthusiastic champions of the general policy, because it satisfied a tradition of passionate anti- clericalism. Virchow meant Kulturkampf as a term of praise, signifying the liberation of public life from sectarian impositions (though the term was later taken up by Catholic leaders in a spirit of bitter derision).\\" From \\"A Supreme Court in the Culture Wars\\" by Jeremy Rabkin in the Fall edition of the Public Interest was in contrast to Bismarck's pragmatic attitude towards the measures\\"Even Bismarck ‚Äì who initially saw a variety of tactical political advantages in these measures ‚Äì took pains to distance himself from the rigors of their enforcement.\\" From A Supreme Court in the culture wars by Jeremy Rabkin in the Fall edition of the Public Interest and growing disquiet from the Conservatives.\\"Conservative political forces, centering on the old Prussian aristocracy, became increasingly critical of these measures, fearing that they would jeopardize the status of their own Protestant Evangelical Church. \\"From A Supreme Court in the culture wars by Jeremy Rabkin in the Fall edition of the Public Interest Apart from the outspoken criticism of the Kulturkampf Laws by the Catholic Church and the Centre Party, there were also a number of Liberals and Protestants who voiced concern at least at the so- called \\"Kampfgesetze\\" (battle laws). \\"Unease concerning the effects of his programme continued to spread among all but the most bigoted priest-haters and the most doctrinaire liberals\\". Such noted critics outside the Catholic camp were Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken, Emil Albert Friedberg or Julius von Kirchmann. Although they were proponents of state superiority, they regarded some of the laws as either ineffective or as interference in internal church affairs and not consistent with liberal values. Geffcken wrote that \\"with the intention to emancipate the laity from the hierarchy, the main body of the Catholics was brought in phalanx into the hands of leaders from which it was to be wrested. But the state cannot fight at length against a third of the population, it has no means to break such a passive resistance supported and organized by religious fanaticism. If a statesman desists from the correctness of a measure it only matters that he has the power to enforce it.\\" Even Bismarck ‚Äì who initially saw a variety of tactical political advantages in these measures, e. g. for his suppressive policies against the Polish population ‚Äì took pains to distance himself from the rigors of their enforcement.\\"A Supreme Court in the culture wars by Jeremy Rabkin in the Fall edition of the Public Interest The Kulturkampf law considered the harshest and with no equivalent in Europe was the Expatriation Law. Passed by a liberal majority in parliament, it stipulated banishment as a punishment that all civilized peoples considered the harshest beyond the death penalty.Ruppert, Stefan in: Kirchenkampf und Kulturkampf: Historische Legitimation, politische Mitwirkung und wissenschaftliche Begleitung durch die Schule Emil Ludwig Richter, Mohr Siebeck, T√ºbingen, 2002, , p.257 ‚Äì 263 As to the Centre Party, these measures did not have the effect that Bismarck had in mind. In the state elections of November 1873, it grew from 50 to 90 seats and in the Reichstag elections from 63 to 91. The number of Catholic periodicals also increased; in 1873 there were about 120. The Kulturkampf gave secularists and socialists an opportunity to attack all religions, an outcome that distressed the Protestant leaders and especially Bismarck himself, who was a devout pietistic Protestant.Christopher Clark, Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600‚Äì1947 (2006) pp. 568‚Äì576 In the face of systematic defiance, the Bismarck government increased the penalties and its attacks, and were challenged in 1875 when a papal encyclical declared that the entire ecclesiastical legislation of Prussia was invalid, and threatened to excommunicate any Catholic who obeyed. There was no violence, but the Catholics mobilized their support, set up numerous civic organizations, raised money to pay fines and rallied behind their church and the Center Party. To Bismarck's surprise, the Conservative Party especially the Junkers from his own landowning class in East Prussia sided with the Catholics. They were Protestants and did not like the Pope, but they had much in common with the Center Party. The Conservatives controlled their local schools and did not want bureaucrats from Berlin to take them over. They were hostile to the liberals, being fearful of free trade that would put them in competition with the United States and other grain exporters, and disliking their secular views. In the Prussian legislature, they sided with the Center Party on the school issue. Bismarck was livid, and he resigned the premiership of Prussia (while remaining Chancellor of the German Empire), telling an ally, \\"in domestic affairs I have lost the ground that is for me acceptable through the unpatriotic treason of the Conservative Party in the Catholic question.\\" Indeed, many of Bismarck's conservative friends were in opposition. So too was Kaiser William I, who was King of Prussia; he was strongly opposed to the civil marriage component of the Kulturkampf.Edgar Feuchtwangler, Bismarck (2000) pp 186-87 The Kulturkampf made Catholics more resolute; they responded not with violence but with votes, and as the newly formed Center Party became a major force in the Imperial Parliament, it gained support from non-Catholic minorities who felt threatened by Bismarck's centralization of power. In the long run, the most significant result was the mobilization of the Catholic voters through the Center Party, and their insistence on protecting their church. Historian Margaret Anderson says: :The effort was perceived, and not only by its opponents, as aiming at nothing less than the forcible assimilation of the Catholic Church and its adherents to the values and norms of the empire's Protestant majority....[it led] Catholics ‚Äì young and old, male and female, cleric and lay, big men and small ‚Äì to cleave to their priests and defy the legislation.Margaret Lavinia Anderson, Practicing democracy: Elections and political culture in Imperial Germany (Princeton University Press, 2000) p 107. After the Center party had doubled its popular vote in the elections of 1874, it became the second largest party in the national parliament, and remained a powerful force for the next 60 years. It became difficult for Bismarck to form a government without their support.Hajo Holborn, A History of Modern Germany: 1840‚Äì1945 (1969), 258‚Äì260 From the decades-long experience in battling against the Kulturkampf, the Catholics of Germany, says Professor Margaret Anderson, learned democracy. She states that the clergy: :Acquired a pragmatic, but nonetheless real, commitment to democratic elections, parliamentary procedures, and party politics ‚Äì commitments in which they schooled their flock, by their practice as much as by their preaching.\\"Anderson, Practicing Democracy (2000) p 150 = Anti-Polish aspect of Kulturkampf = Studies that analyze the nationalist aspect of Kulturkampf, point out its anti-Polish character and Bismarcks attempt to Germanize Polish provinces in German EmpireThe War against Catholicism: Liberalism and the Anti-Catholic Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Germany, page 8 Michael B.

Polish demonstrations made clear the Polish nationalist feeling, and calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the Prussian Army ‚Äì though these went unheeded. Bismarck was outraged, telling the Prussian cabinet in 1871: From the Russian border to the Adriatic Sea we are confronted with the combined propaganda of Slavs, ultramontanes, and reactionaries, and it is necessary openly to defend our national interests and our language against such hostile actions.(in English) Jarmila Kaczmarek, Andrzej Prinke (2000). \\"Two Archaeologies in one Country: Official Prussian versus amateur Polish activities in Mid-Western (i.e.: Greater) Poland in XIXth-early XXth cent.\\", Pozna≈Ñ Archaeological Museum publications. Retrieved February 16, 2006 Therefore, in the Province of Posen the Kulturkampf took on a much more nationalistic character than in other parts of Germany. Not an adamant supporter of the Liberal's general Kulturkampf goals, Bismarck did recognize the potential in some of them for subduing Polish national aspirations and readily made use of it. While the Liberals main objective was the separation of state and church as essential for a democratic and liberal society, Bismarck saw its use in separating the Polish population from the only supporter and guardian of its national identity. Prussian authorities imprisoned 185 priests and forced hundreds of others into exile. Among the imprisoned was the Primate of Poland Archbishop Mieczys≈Çaw Led√≥chowski. A large part of the remaining Catholic priests had to continue their service in hiding from the authorities. Although most of the 185 imprisoned were finally set free by the end of the decade, those who were released emigrated. The anti-Polish aspects of Kulturkampf remained in place in Polish provinces of German Empire until First World War  Kulturkampf in Austria  The Kulturkampf in Austria has roots dating back to the 18th century. Emperor Joseph II launched a religious policy (later called \\"Josephinism\\") that advocated the supremacy of the state in religious matters. This resulted in far-reaching state control over the Catholic Church, including the reorganization of dioceses, the regulation of the number of masses, the transfer of many schools into government hands, state-controlled seminaries, and the limitation of the number of clerics and dissolving numerous monasteries. Protests of Pope Pius VI, and even his visit to Vienna in 1782, were to no avail. In the concordat of 1855, which was the culmination of Catholic influence in Austria, many of the Catholic Church's previous rights that were taken away under Joseph II were restored (marriage, partial control of censorship, elementary and secondary education, full control of the clergy and religious funds). In 1868 and 1869, after sanctioning from the December constitution, emperor Francis Joseph's newly appointment cabinet undid parts of the concordat with several liberal reforms. These reforms are referred to as the May Laws. After strong protests from the Catholic Church, the laws of May 25, 1868 and May 14, 1869 restored civil marriage, passed primary and secondary education into government hands, installed interconfessional schools, and regulated interconfessional relations (for example, mixed marriages and children's rights to chose their faith). In a secret consistory, Pope Pius IX condemned the constitution of 1867 and the May Laws as \\"leges abominabiles.\\" In a pastoral letter dated September 7, 1868, bishop Franz-Josef Rudigier called for resistance to these May Laws. However, the letter was confiscated, and Rudigier had to appear before court on June 5, 1869. This event lead to the first-ever public demonstrations by the Catholic population. On July 12, 1869, the bishop was sentenced to a jail term of two weeks, but he was later pardoned by the emperor. The May Laws provoked a serious conflict between state and church. After the promulgation of papal infallibility in 1870, Austria abrogated the concordat of 1855 and abolished it entirely in 1874. In May 1874, the Religious Act was officially recognized.  \\"Kulturkampf\\" in contemporary usage  = United States = In the late 19th century, cultural wars arose over issues of prohibition and education in the United States.Richard Jensen, The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political conflict, 1888‚Äì1896 (1971) online ch 3-5 The Bennett Law was a highly controversial state law passed in Wisconsin in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools. Because Wisconsin German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large numbers of parochial schools where German was used in the classroom, it was bitterly resented by German-American (and some Norwegian) communities.

(2005) This theme of \\"culture war\\" was the basis of Patrick Buchanan's keynote speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention.see August 17, 1992 Buchanan Speech By 2004, the term was in common use in the United States by both liberals and conservatives. Throughout the 1980s, there were battles in Congress and the media regarding federal support for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities that amounted to a war over high culture between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives.Richard Jensen, \\"The Culture Wars, 1965‚Äì1995: A Historian\`s Map.\\" Journal of Social History (Oct 1995), 17-36. in JSTOR Justice Antonin Scalia referenced the term in the Supreme Court case Romer v.

Menzies was a nephew of Robert Stewart Menzies. But Menzies' father was dissolute, never established a worthwhile career, and wasted his share of the family fortune; he died of tuberculosis in 1911 in his early 50s, leaving only a minimal estate.C: The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, Spymaster to Winston Churchill, by Anthony Cave Brown, 1987.

Retrieved on 13 July 2010 =First World War action= During the First World War Menzies served in France. He was wounded at Zandvoorde in October 1914, and fought gallantly in the First Battle of Ypres, November 1914. Menzies was promoted to captain on 14 November, and received the DSO in person from King George V on 2 December.C: The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, Spymaster to Winston Churchill, by Anthony Cave Brown, 1987, Macmillan, New York, , pp. 60-81 =Intelligence service= Menzies' regiment was decimated during fighting in 1915, suffering very heavy casualties in the Second Battle of Ypres. Menzies was seriously injured in a gas attack in 1915, and was honourably discharged from active combat service. He then joined the counterintelligence section of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the British commander. In late 1917, he reported to high British leadership that Haig's intelligence chief Brigadier John Charteris was fudging intelligence estimates, which soon led to Charteris' removal. This whistle-blowing was apparently done very discreetly. Menzies was promoted to brevet major before the end of the war.C: The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, Spymaster to Winston Churchill, by Anthony Cave Brown, 1987, Macmillan, New York, , pp. 82-98 MI6 Following the end of the war, Menzies entered MI6 (also known as SIS). He was a member of the British delegation to the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference. Soon after the war, Menzies was promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the Imperial General Staff, General Staff Officer, first grade. Within MI6, he became assistant director for special intelligence. Admiral Hugh Sinclair became director-general of MI6 in 1924, and he made Menzies his deputy by 1929, with Menzies being promoted to full colonel soon afterwards.C: The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, by Anthony Cave Brown, 1987. In 1924, Menzies was allegedly involved‚Äîalongside Sidney Reilly and Desmond MortonZinoviev Letter in SIS forgery (no) Shock, The Poor Mouth.‚Äîin the forging of The Zinoviev Letter.Page 121, Michael Kettle, Sidney Reilly: The True Story of the World's Greatest Spy, 1986, St. Martin's Press, . This forgery is considered to have been instrumental in the Conservative Party's victory in the United Kingdom general election of 1924, which ended the country's first Labour government.Telegraph, 5 February 1999. Chief of MI6 In 1939, when Admiral Sinclair died, Menzies was appointed Chief of Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). He expanded wartime intelligence and counterintelligence departments and supervised codebreaking efforts at Bletchley Park, overseeing the work of cryptanalyst and mathematician Alan Turing. Before the Second World War, the SIS had been a relatively minor and uninfluential branch of the British government; budgetary pressures after the First World War and during the 1930s of the Great Depression were the main reasons for this. =Second World War= When the Second World War began, SIS expanded greatly. Menzies insisted on wartime control of codebreaking, and this gave him immense power and influence, which he used judiciously. By distributing the Ultra material collected by the Government Code & Cypher School, for the first time, MI6 became an important branch of the government. Extensive breaches of Nazi Enigma signals gave Menzies and his team enormous insight into Adolf Hitler's strategy, and this was kept a closely held secret, not only during the war, but until as late as 1974. Frederick Winterbotham's 1974 book The Ultra Secret lifted the cloak of secrecy at last. The Nazis had suspicions, but believed Enigma to be unbreakable, and never knew during the war that the Allies were reading a high proportion of their wireless traffic. Menzies kept Prime Minister Winston Churchill supplied daily with important Ultra decrypts, and the two worked together to ensure that financial resources were devoted towards research and upgrading technology at Bletchley Park, to keep pace with Nazi coding refinements, as well as directing talented workers to the massive effort, which employed nearly 10,000 workers by 1945. Bletchley's efforts were decisive in the battle against Nazi submarine warfare, which was severely threatening trans-Atlantic shipping, particularly in the first half of 1943. Britain, which was cut off from Europe after mid-1940, was almost completely dependent on North American supplies for survival. The access to Ultra was also vitally important in the battle for Normandy, leading up to D-Day in June 1944, and afterwards.Bodyguard of Lies, by Anthony Cave Brown, 1975 Menzies has been suspected as being involved with the assassination, on 24 December 1942, of Fran√ßois Darlan, the Vichy military commander who defected to the allies in Algeria. British historian David Raynolds noted in his book, In Command of History, that Menzies‚Äîwho rarely left London during the war‚Äîwas in Algiers around the period he was killed, making SOE (Special Operations Executive) involvement seem likely. Furthermore, Darlan's assassin, La Chapelle, had been a member of the resistance group led by Henri d'Astier. However, as Darlan was an Allied intelligence source the potential motive for Menzies' involvement is unclear. Menzies, who was promoted to major-general in January 1944, also supported efforts to contact anti-Nazi resistance, including Wilhelm Canaris, the anti- Nazi head of Abwehr, in Germany. Prime Minister Winston Churchill was kept informed of these efforts throughout the war, and information from and about the Nazi resistance was exploited tactically. Menzies coordinated his operations with Special Operations Executive (SOE) (although he reputedly considered them \\"amateurs\\"), British Security Coordination (BSC), Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Free French Forces. He was awarded Order of the Yugoslav Crown. After the Second World War After the war, Menzies reorganised the SIS for the Cold War. He absorbed most of SOE. He was sometimes at odds with the Labour governments. He also had to weather a scandal inside SIS after revelations that SIS officer Kim Philby was actually a Soviet spy, although this came after Menzies had retired. Nonetheless, Menzies deserved some of the blame for Soviet agents having penetrated MI6, according to the book, C: The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, Spymaster to Winston Churchill by Anthony Cave Brown. Menzies was already the head of the service when Kim Philby joined (1941). The author insists that Menzies' primary criteria were whether the applicants were upper class ex- officers and recommended by another government department or known to him personally. In his New York Times review of Brown's book, novelist Ken Follett makes this conclusion: \\"Mr Philby outwitted Menzies because Mr Philby was intelligent and professional and cool, where Menzies was an amiable upper- class sportsman who was out of his depth. And British intelligence, except for the code breakers, was like Menzies‚Äîamateur, anti-intellectual and wholly outclassed.\\" After 43 continuous years of service in the British Army, Menzies retired to Bridges Court in Luckington in rural Wiltshire at 62 in mid-1952. Menzies was certainly adept at bureaucratic intrigue, a virtual necessity in his position, but his efforts as Chief had a major role in winning the Second World War, as evidenced by his nearly 1,500 meetings with Churchill during the war.C: The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, Spymaster to Winston Churchill, by Anthony Cave Brown, 1987 Marriages His first marriage was in 1918 to Lady Avice Ela Muriel Sackville, younger daughter of Gilbert Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr and Lady Muriel Agnes Brassey, daughter of Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey. They were divorced in 1931, when she left him for another man. His second wife Pamela Thetis Garton (n√©e Beckett) (d. 13 March 1951) was the fourth daughter of the Honourable Rupert Evelyn Beckett by his wife Muriel Helen Florence Paget, daughter of Lord Berkeley Charles Sydney Paget, himself a younger son of the 2nd Marquess of Anglesey. Menzies and Garton married on 13 December 1932. Garton was an invalid for many years, suffering from clinical depression and anorexia nervosa. She had Menzies' only child, a daughter, Fiona, in 1934. says that a daughter Daphne was born in 1934. Pamela was first married 1929 (div 1930) to James Roy Notter Garton, + 1939, s. of William Garton, of Bursledon, Hampshire. Pamela Beckett was a first cousin once removed of the 6th Marquess of Anglesey and a second cousin of the 7th Marquess. Her elder sister Gwladys, Lady Markham married 2ndly 1928 Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere of Vale Royal. His third marriage was in 1952 (as her fourth husband) to Audrey Clara Lilian Latham (b. 1899), formerly wife of Sir Henry Birkin, 2nd Bt. (and two other men), and daughter of Sir Thomas Paul Latham, 1st Bt. in The Peerage database. Entry last edited 14 March 2005, and retrieved 15 December 2007. Stewart and Audrey were both over age 50 at the time of their marriage, each had separate estates (his in Wiltshire, west of London, hers in Essex, east of London), and they for the most part lived separately, but they met in London for dinner each Wednesday.Cave Brown By his third marriage, he had two stepdaughters Pamela Buxton (wife of Lord Buxton of Alsa) and Sara Hanbury. Anthony Cave Brown also reported that Menzies had a long-standing affair with one of his secretaries, which he ended upon retirement (and presumably remarriage) in 1952; the secretary apparently tried to kill herself at that time. Menzies died 29 May 1968. Fictional depictions Stewart Menzies is a character in the 2014 film The Imitation Game and is portrayed by Mark Strong. He is also a principal character in 'The Speedicut Memoirs', Books 2-6, edited by Christopher Joll.

British Army Brigadier Orde Charles Wingate formed the Chindits for raiding operations against the Imperial Japanese Army, especially long-range penetration: attacking Japanese troops, facilities and lines of communication deep behind Japanese lines. Their operations featured prolonged marches through extremely difficult terrain, undertaken by underfed troops often weakened by diseases such as malaria and dysentery. Controversy persists over the extremely high casualty- rate and the debatable military value of the achievements of the Chindits. Background & formation During the East African Campaign of 1940‚Äì41, Wingate ‚Äì under General Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Command ‚Äì had begun to explore guerilla tactics, when he created and commanded a unit known as Gideon Force, composed of regular troops from Sudan and Ethiopia, as well as Ethiopean partisans. Gideon Force disrupted Italian supply lines and collected intelligence. In 1942, after the disbandment of Gideon Force, Wavell ‚Äì who had since been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the India Command ‚Äì requested the services of Wingate in Burma. It was intended that he would raise irregular forces to operate behind the Japanese lines, in a manner similar to Gideon Force.Thompson 2008, p. 374. Wingate arrived in Burma in March 1942 and for two months, as Japanese forces advanced rapidly, toured the country developing his theories of long-range penetration, during the two months preceding the Japanese conquest of Burma. After returning to Delhi, he presented his proposals to Wavell. The name Chindits was suggested by Captain Aung Thin (DSO) of the Burma Rifles. Chindit is a corrupted form of the Burmese mythical beast Chinth√© or Chinthay, statues of which guarded Buddhist temples.Brayley 2002, p. 18. =Organisation and training= The first Chindit unit, the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade, was gradually formed in the area around Jhansi in the summer of 1942. Wingate took charge of the training of the troops in the jungles of central India during the rainy season. Half of the Chindits were British: the 13th Battalion, the King's Liverpool Regiment (nominally a second-line battalion, which contained a large number of older men) and men from the former Bush Warfare School in Burma, who were formed into 142 Commando Company. The other portion of the force consisted of the 3rd Battalion, the 2nd Gurkha Rifles (a battalion that had only just been raised) and the 2nd Battalion, the Burma Rifles (a composite unit formed from several depleted battalions of Burmese troops that had retreated into India in 1942). Wingate trained this force as long-range penetration units that were to be supplied by stores parachuted or dropped from transport aircraft and were to use close air support as a substitute for heavy artillery.Thompson 1989, p. 375. They would penetrate the jungle on foot, essentially relying on surprise through mobility to target enemy lines of communication (a tactic that the Japanese had previously used in 1942 to great effect against British forces in Singapore and Burma). The standard brigade and battalion structures were abandoned. The force was instead formed into eight columns, each of which was organised as: an infantry rifle company (with nine Bren light machine guns and three 2-inch mortars); a support group with the heavy weapons (four Boys anti-tank rifles, two medium Vickers machine guns and two light anti-aircraft guns); a reconnaissance platoon from the Burma Rifles; and a sabotage group from 142 Commando Company. Small detachments from the Royal Air Force (equipped with radios to call in air support), Royal Corps of Signals and Royal Army Medical Corps were attached to the column headquarters.Chinnery 2010, p. 24. The heavy weapons, radios, reserve ammunition, and rations and other stores were carried on mules, which would also provide an emergency source of food once their loads had been depleted. With 57 mule handlers, each British column numbered 306 men (the Gurkha columns were slightly stronger, with 369 men). Each man carried more than of equipment, which was proportionally more than the mules carrying the support weapons and other stores. This included a personal weapon, such as the SMLE rifle or Sten Gun, ammunition, grenades, a machete or Gurkha kukri knife, seven days' rations, groundsheet, change of uniform and other assorted items. Much of this load was carried in an Everest carrier, which was essentially a metal rucksack frame without a pack.Brayley 2002, pp. 18‚Äì19. Shortly before the first operation, one column was broken up to bring the remaining seven up to full strength. Two or more columns were commanded by a group headquarters, which in turn was commanded by the brigade headquarters. Operation Longcloth Brigadier Orde Wingate The original intent had been to use the Chindits as a part of a larger offensive. When this offensive was cancelled, Wingate convinced General Wavell to send the Chindits into Burma anyway. Accordingly, on 8 February 1943, Operation Longcloth commenced and 3,000 Chindits, Wingate with them, began their march into Burma. The Chindits crossed the Chindwin River on 13 February and faced the first Japanese troops two days later. Two columns marched to the south and received their air supply drops in broad daylight to create an impression that they were the main attack. They even had a man impersonating a British general along with them. The RAF mounted air attacks on Japanese targets to support the deception. These columns were to swing east at the beginning of March and attack the main north-south railway in areas south of the main force. One column successfully carried out demolitions along the railway, but the other column was ambushed. Half of the ambushed column returned to India. Five other columns proceeded eastward. Two, those of Michael Calvert and Bernard Fergusson, proceeded towards the main north-south railway in Burma. On 4 March, Calvert's column reached the valley and demolished the railway in 70 places. Fergusson arrived two days later to do the same. Despite these successes, however, the railway was only temporarily disabled, and resumed operation shortly afterwards. On many occasions, the Chindits could not take their wounded with them; some were left behind in villages. Wingate had, in fact, issued specific orders to leave behind all wounded, but these orders were not strictly followed. Since there were often no established paths in the jungle along their routes, many times they had to clear their own with machetes and kukris (and on one occasion, a commandeered elephant). Supply was delivered by air using three Hudsons and three Dakotas of 31 Squadron operating out of Agartala in eastern Bengal. Once in Burma, Wingate repeatedly changed his plans, sometimes without informing all the column commanders. The majority of two of the columns marched back to India after being ambushed by the Japanese in separate actions. After the railway attacks, Wingate decided to cross his force over the Irrawaddy River. However, the area on the other side of the river turned out to be inhospitable to operations. Water was difficult to obtain and the combination of rivers with a good system of roads in the area allowed the Japanese to force the Chindits into a progressively smaller \\"box\\". In late March, Wingate made the decision to withdraw the majority of the force, but sent orders to one of the columns to continue eastward. The operations had reached the range limit of air supply and prospects for new successful operations were low, given the Japanese pressure. The columns were generally left to make their own way back to India. On the journey back, the most difficult actions involved crossing back over the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese had observers and patrols all along the river bank and could quickly concentrate once an attempt at a crossing was detected. Gradually, all the columns broke up into small groups. Wingate's headquarters returned to India on its own ahead of most of the columns. Through the spring and even into the autumn of 1943, individual groups of men from the Chindits made their way back to India. The army did what they could for the men. In one case, an aeroplane was landed in an open area and wounded men were evacuated by air. Part of one column made it to China. Another body of men escaped into the far north of Burma. Others were captured or died. By the end of April, after a three-month mission, the majority of the surviving Chindits had crossed the Chindwin river, having marched between 750‚Äì1,000 miles.Brayley 2002, p. 19. Of the 3,000 men that had begun the operation, a third (818 men) had been killed, taken prisoner or died of disease, and of the 2,182 men who returned, about 600 were too debilitated from their wounds or disease to return to active service. Of the remaining men, Wingate practically hand picked those few he would retain, while the rest were put back under the normal army command structure as part of their original battalions. Interlude Although British Army officers in India criticised the effectiveness of the Chindits (Japanese railway communications had been out of commission for less than a week), their effect on the morale of the Allied troops in India was refreshing, and they were given plenty of publicity. Wingate wrote an operations report on returning to India, which was controversial for many reasons, including attacks on officers under his command. The report had a tendency to excuse any mistakes made by its author (Wingate), while making vicious attacks on other officers, often based on limited information. Eventually, through his political allies in London, a copy of the report was given to Winston Churchill, who was impressed and took Wingate with him to the Quebec Conference. His concepts for long-range penetration operations behind Japanese lines received official backing at high level, and he obtained substantial US support for his force. The US Army also began its own plans for the group that later became Merrill's Marauders. As the members of the first expedition were making their way back to India, a second long range penetration unit, 111th Indian Infantry Brigade was being formed.Masters 2002, p. 135. Popularly known as The Leopards, the brigade was raised by General Wavell without the knowledge of Wingate, who was still in Burma and who was known to have a strong dislike for the Indian Army, its diverse troop formations, and its British officers in particular. Wavell personally selected the commander of 111th Brigade, Brigadier Joe Lentaigne. Wavell intended to use two Chindit brigades alternately during 1944. While one brigade was operating behind Japanese lines for two to three months at a time, the other would be resting in India, while training for and planning the next operation. However, Wingate returned from Quebec with authority to implement far more ambitious plans for the second expedition, which required that the force be greatly expanded to a strength of six brigades. Wingate refused to use Indian Army formations in this force, because he maintained that their training in long-range penetration techniques would take longer and their maintenance by air would be difficult due to the varied dietary requirements of different Gurkha and Indian castes and religions,Callahan 1978, p. 101. although he had little choice but to accept 111th Brigade, and two Gurkha battalions in 77th brigade. Since large numbers of trained British infantry were required, three brigades (the 14th, 16th and 23rd) were added to the Chindits by breaking up the experienced British 70th Infantry Division, much against the wishes of Lieutenant General William Slim and other commanders, who wished to use the division in a conventional role. A sixth brigade was added to the force by taking a brigade (the 3rd (West African) Infantry Brigade) from the British 81st (West Africa) Division.Rooney 1992, pp. 112 & 116. At Quebec, Wingate had also succeeded in obtaining a \\"private\\" air force for the Chindits, the 1st Air Commando Group, mainly consisting of USAAF aircraft. The Chindits were greatly encouraged by having aircraft on which they could call immediately for supply drops, casualty evacuation and air support. Other welcome American aid was the \\"K\\" Ration pack which, although it provided insufficient calories for prolonged active operations, was far better than the equivalent British or Indian ration pack.Masters (1961), p.139 The forces for the second Chindit operation were called Special Force, officially 3rd Indian Infantry Division, or Long Range Penetration Groups,Rooney 1992, pp. 110 & 115. but the nickname, the Chindits, had already stuck. The new Chindit force commenced training in Gwalior. Men were trained in crossing rivers, demolitions and bivouacking. Calvert and Fergusson, both newly promoted to Brigadier, took command of two of the brigades, and were responsible for much of the training program and the development of tactical planning. Wingate himself was absent for much of the training period, first being out of the country to attend the Quebec Conference and then struck ill with typhoid from drinking bad water in North Africa on his return.Rooney 1992, pp. 116‚Äì117. =Plans= The plans for the second Chindit operation went through many revisions. The methods of the new Long Range Penetration force in 1944 differed from those of 1943. Wingate had decided on a strategy of creating fortified bases behind the Japanese lines, which would then send out raiding columns over short distances. This change was in part forced on him by strengthened Japanese patrols along the Burmese frontier, making a repeat of the successful infiltration in 1943 unlikely.Slim 1956, p. 219. In an imaginative move prompted by Colonel Philip Cochran's assurance that he could transport both troops and supplies by glider,Alison, John (Maj. Gen.), Phil Cochran, The Most Unforgettable Character I've Met Wingate arranged for the bulk of the force to enter Burma by air, greatly accelerating the force's ability to reach its target objectives.Masters 2002, p. 172. Advance units would land in gliders in preselected open fields in Burma, and prepare them for large-scale landings by transport aircraft. The lavish air support provided by Colonels Cochran and Alison of the 1st Air Commando Group proved critical to the success of the operation.Masters 2002, pp. 146‚Äì147. Wingate also had plans for a general uprising of the Kachin population of Northern Burma. He fought over these plans with the leadership of Force 136 (an organisation set up to liaise with resistance forces in Japanese-occupied countries), which was concerned that a premature uprising of the Kachins without a permanent British military presence would lead to their slaughter by the Japanese at the end of operations. Force 136 also had their own plans for a rising to be coordinated with the arrival of the regular army in Burma. Wingate was eventually convinced to scale back his original plans. Further complicating relations between the organisations were orders issued by Wingate to the commander of Dah Force (a British-led force of Kachin irregulars attached to the Chindits) not to coordinate operations with Force 136 for security reasons. During the last months of 1943, planning was conducted to carry out the strategy for India as originally determined at the Quebec Conference. In November, the overall plan for the dry season campaign of 1944 determined by South East Asia Command focused on the use of the Chindits in the reconquest of northern Burma. These plans were approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff at the Cairo Conference and although other offensives in Burma were scaled back or cancelled, Stilwell's Northern Front offensive with the Chindits' participation survived the cuts. The uncertainty of the plans nevertheless meant that the plans and contingency plans for the use of the Chindits repeatedly changed up to the very start of operations.Planning of Operation Thursday * Prasad, Bhargava & Khera 1958, pp. 318‚Äì320.(?) * Slim 1956, p. 204. The Chindits were assigned the task of helping the forces of Joseph Stilwell push the Ledo Road through northern Burma to link up with the Burma Road and re-establish an overland supply route to China, by mounting a long range penetration operation behind the Japanese opposing his forces on the Northern Front. It had originally been intended that the IV Corps would attack on the Central Front and cross the Chindwin to tie up Japanese forces which could otherwise be used to aid the Northern Front. As the Japanese launched their own attack on the Central Front, this advance did not meet its objectives, but it still meant that most Japanese forces were engaged on the Central Front and were not available to reinforce the Japanese 18th Division on the Northern Front. The Japanese offensive on the Central Front resulted in further proposals and refinements of the plans for the Chindits. On 4 February 1944, Lieutenant General Slim, commander of the British Fourteenth Army, and USAAF General George E. Stratemeyer, commander of Eastern Air Command, issued a joint directive to General Wingate and Cols. Cochran and Alison of the 1st Air Commando Group, to march and fly into Indaw and from there under the command of the Fourteenth Army carry out the objectives of: > (i) Helping the advance of Stilwell's Ledo force on Myitkyina by cutting the > communications of the Japanese 18th Division, harassing its rear, and > preventing its reinforcement. > (ii) Creating a favourable situation for the Yunnan Chinese forces to cross > the Salween and enter Burma. > (iii) Inflicting the greatest possible damage and confusion on the enemy in > North Burma.Slim 1956, p. 259. Operation Thursday Troops of the Nigeria Regiment, 3rd West African Brigade (Thunder), board an RAF Dakota On 5 February 1944, Fergusson's 16th Brigade left Ledo for Burma. They avoided Japanese forces by traversing exceptionally difficult terrain. The rest of the Brigades were brought in by air to create fortified bases with airstrips. Three landing zones, codenamed Piccadilly, Broadway and Chowringhee, were selected. Calvert's 77th Brigade prepared to fly by Hadrian glider into Piccadilly on the night of 5 March. A last-minute aerial reconnaissance revealed Piccadilly to be covered with logs, making landing impossible. In some accounts of the incident, Wingate insisted that the operation had been betrayed and that the other landing zones would be ambushed. To proceed would be \\"murder\\". Slim accepted the responsibility of ordering a willing Calvert to proceed with the operation, using Broadway instead.Slim 1956, pp.257‚Äì259. While Piccadilly had already been used to evacuate casualties during the first Chindit operation in 1943, Broadway had to be selected from the results of aerial reconnaissance. It turned out to be a poor landing ground and there were many casualties in crash landings, but Calvert's men were just able to make the strip fit to take transport aircraft the next day. Chindit gliders also landed on Chowringhee the next day, without opposition. It was later revealed that the logs on Piccadilly had been placed there to dry by Burmese teak loggers. The real problem was the failure to maintain continuous observation of the landing zones (e.g. by high-flying Spitfire photo-reconnaissance aircraft) before the forces were deployed. Over the next week, 600 sorties by Dakota transport aircraft transferred 9,000 men to the landing zones. Chowringhee was abandoned once the fly-in was completed, but Broadway was held with a garrison which included field artillery, anti- aircraft guns and even Spitfire fighters for a brief period. Fergusson's brigade set up another base named Aberdeen north of Indaw, into which 14th Brigade was flown. Calvert's brigade established yet another, named White City at Mawlu, astride the main railway and road leading to the Japanese northern front. 111 Brigade set up ambushes and roadblocks south of Indaw (although part of the brigade which landed at Chowringhee was delayed in crossing the Irrawaddy River), before moving west to Pinlebu. Ferocious jungle fighting ensued around Broadway and White City. At times, British and Japanese troops were in close combat, bayonets and kukris against katanas. On 27 March, after days of aircraft attack, the Japanese attacked Broadway for several nights before the attack was repulsed with flown-in artillery and the aid of locally recruited Kachin irregulars. However, a setback occurred when Fergusson's brigade tried to capture Indaw on 24 March. The original intention had been to seize the town and its airfields on 15 March but Fergusson had to report that this was impossible. Wingate appeared ready to change the brigade's mission but on 20 March, he reinstated Indaw as the target. The brigade was already exhausted from its long march, and there was no time to properly reconnoitre the objective. The units were dismayed to find that the Japanese controlled the only water sources. Fergusson expected that 14th Brigade would cooperate in the attack, but they moved west instead. Japanese reinforcements had also moved into Indaw, which was a major road and rail centre. Fergusson's battalions, attacking separately, were each repulsed. After this, most of the tired 16th Brigade were flown out. =Change of command= On 24 March, Wingate flew to Imphal to confer with air force commanders. On the return journey, the USAAF B-25 bomber in which he was flying is believed to have flown into a thunderstorm and crashed in the jungle-covered mountains. All aboard were killed. Slim, the commander of the British Fourteenth Army which had loose operational control over Special Force, selected Brigadier Lentaigne to be Wingate's replacement after conferring with Brigadier Derek Tulloch, Wingate's Chief of Staff. Lentaigne was judged to be the most balanced and experienced commander in the force; he had been an instructor at the Staff College at Quetta, had led a Gurkha battalion with distinction during the gruelling retreat from Burma in 1942 and had commanded a Chindit brigade in the field (albeit for only a few weeks, but none of the other brigade commanders had more experience). As an officer of Gurkha troops, he had a similar outlook and background to Slim. The other Chindit brigade commanders were unknown quantities, mostly without staff qualifications, some of whom had never even commanded a battalion-sized unit in combat before 1944, and Wingate's staff officers lacked the necessary combat experience.Allen 1984, pp.348‚Äì351; summary from . The force's second-in-command, Major General George William Symes, was bypassed by Slim and formally protested and asked to be relieved.Allen 1984, pp. 350‚Äì351. In selecting Lentaigne, Slim did not take into account the tensions between those Chindit commanders and staff who were closely associated with Wingate, and Lentaigne, who had a classical \\"line\\" officer's background and had been critical of Wingate's methods and techniques.Allen 1984, p. 122. It is probably fair to say that nobody could have completely filled Wingate's shoes. Wingate had sustained his force outside normal army command through political connections that no successor would have available. The other dilemma of any successor was that they would constantly be second-guessed by those who thought they knew exactly what Wingate would have done in a particular situation. The same officers who would go to extraordinary lengths to justify even the most flawed decisions by Wingate, would attack any successor, whenever the opportunity presented itself. =The move north= Several major changes were made at the highest level. Much of the air support was diverted to the critical battles of Imphal and Kohima, where troops were cut off and could only be resupplied by air. 23rd Brigade, yet to fly in, was also despatched to Kohima. Those Chindits already operating in Burma were formally subordinated to General Joseph Stilwell, who ordered the Chindits to abandon their dispersed operations around Indaw, and concentrate on interdicting the supply lines to the Japanese forces opposing his Northern Combat Area Command. In April, Lentaigne ordered the main body of 111 Brigade west of the Irrawaddy, now commanded by John Masters, to move north and build a new stronghold, codenamed Blackpool, which would block the railway and main road at Hopin, south of Mogaung. Calvert was ordered to abandon White City and Broadway and move north to support Masters. Calvert was opposed to this, as his brigade had successfully held these two strongholds for months. Stilwell also feared that abandoning White City would allow Japanese reinforcements to move north. However, Lentaigne insisted that the Chindit brigades were too far apart to support each other, and that it would be difficult to use aircraft at White City and Broadway during the monsoon.Allen 1984, p. 355. Masters's force established Blackpool on 8 May and were almost immediately engaged in fierce fighting. Whereas White City had been deep in the Japanese rear, its defenders had had plenty of time to prepare their defences and its attackers had been a mixed bag of detachments from several formations, Blackpool was close to the Japanese northern front, and was immediately attacked by Japanese troops with heavy artillery support. As Calvert and Stilwell had feared, abandoning White City had allowed the Japanese 53rd Division to move north from Indaw. A heavy attack against Blackpool was repulsed on 17 May, but a second attack on 24 May captured vital positions inside the defences.Allen 1984, p. 360. Because the monsoon had broken and heavy rain made movement in the jungle very difficult, neither Calvert nor Brodie's 14th Brigade could help Masters. Finally, Masters had to abandon Blackpool on 25 May, because the men were exhausted after 17 days of continual combat. Nineteen Allied soldiers, who were so badly injured as to be beyond hope of recovery and could not be moved, were shot by the medical orderlies and hidden in heavy stands of bamboo. cites Masters, The Road Past Mandalay, pp. 277‚Äì278. =Final operations= On 17 May, Slim had formally handed control of the Chindits to Stilwell. Stilwell insisted that the Chindits capture several well-defended Japanese positions. The Chindits had no support from tanks or artillery and this led to heavier casualties than before. According to David Rooney, the Chindits were misused under Stillwell's command and suffered heavy casualties undertaking roles that they were not trained or equipped for.Rooney 1992, p. 137. Over the period from 6 June to 27 June, Calvert's 77th Brigade took Mogaung and suffered 800 casualties ‚Äì 50% of the brigade's men involved in the operation. Fearing that they would then be ordered to join the siege of Myitkyina, Calvert handed Mogaung over to Force X, shut down his radios and retreated to Kamaing, where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and Stilwell finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.Allen 1984, p. 375. 111 Brigade, after resting, was ordered to capture a hill known as Point 2171. It did so, but was now utterly exhausted. Most of the men were suffering from malaria, dysentery and malnutrition. On 8 July, at the insistence of the Supreme Commander, Admiral Louis Mountbatten, doctors examined the brigade. Of the 2,200 men present from four and a half battalions, only 119 were declared fit. The brigade was evacuated, although Masters sarcastically kept the fit men, \\"111 Company\\", in the field until 1 August. The portion of 111 Brigade east of the Irrawaddy were known as Morris Force, after its commander, Lieutenant-Colonel J.R. \\"Jumbo\\" Morris. They had spent several months harassing Japanese traffic from Bhamo to Myitkyina. They had then attempted to complete the encirclement of Myitkyina. Stilwell was angered that they were unable to do so, but Slim pointed out that Stilwell's Chinese troops (numbering 5,500) had also failed in that task. By 14 July, Morris Force was down to three platoons.Allen 1984, p. 362. A week later, they only had 25 men fit for duty. Morris Force was evacuated about the same time as 77th Brigade. 14th Brigade and 3rd West African Brigade remained in action, assisting the newly arrived British 36th Infantry Division in its advance down the \\"Railway Valley\\" south of Mogaung. Finally, they were relieved and withdrawn, starting on 17 August. The last Chindit left Burma on 27 August 1944. =Kohima= 23rd Brigade, which had been diverted from the main Chindit campaign, nevertheless acted as a long range penetration unit behind the Japanese fighting at Kohima. From April to June 1944, they marched long distances through the Naga hills, mostly in monsoon weather which made movement very difficult. They contributed in large measure to the starvation of the Japanese at Kohima, the decisive factor in that battle. Although not engaged in major battles, they accounted for large numbers of Japanese stragglers and foragers, suffering 158 battle casualties themselves. The end The Chindits had suffered heavy casualties: 1,396 killed and 2,434 wounded. Over half had to be confined to hospital and prescribed a special nutritional diet whilst hospitalised. As bad as the casualty figures may seem, those suffered by the force in 1943 were proportionally much higher. The healthy men were sent to training camps to await new operations. However, when the army command evaluated the men and equipment required to return the Chindits to operational status, it was decided to transform the force into an Airborne Division in India. Beyond direct replacements, it was known that the British element of the Chindits would be decimated in 1945 by the need to repatriate personnel who had served more than four years overseas. During the early months of 1945, several of the brigade headquarters and many of the veterans of the Chindit operations were reformed into the 14th and 77th Infantry Brigades and merged into the 44th Airborne Division (India), while the force headquarters and signals units formed the core of the Indian XXXIV Corps. The Chindits were finally disbanded in February 1945.Brayley 2002, p. 22. London memorial Badge of the Chindits on their memorial outside the Ministry of Defence building in London There is a memorial to Orde Wingate and the Chindits on the north side of the Victoria Embankment next to the Ministry of Defence headquarters in London. The memorial was unveiled on 16 October 1990 by the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The front of the monument is in memory of the Chindits and also mentions the four men of the Chindits awarded the Victoria Cross: Major Frank Gerald Blaker, Captain Michael Allmand and Lieutenant George Albert Cairns and Rifleman Tulbahadur Pun. The battalions that took part are listed on the sides of the monument. Non-infantry units are mentioned by their parent formations only. No distinction is made between those units that took part in 1943 versus those of 1944. The rear of the monument is exclusively dedicated to Orde Wingate and also mentions his contributions to the state of Israel.Chindit Memorial, London The memorial is a 4 metres (13 ft) high Portland stone pillar mounted on three steps, on which is a statue by Frank Forster of the chinthe, after which the Chindits are named. Military legacy Military historians disagree on the Chindits' military significance. The debate is part of the ongoing one of whether the deployment of special forces are a net asset to a campaign or whether the investment in time, materiel and men that such operations demand outweigh the advantages gained. For example, it is questioned whether the interdiction of Japanese supply lines during Operation Thursday by the Chindits contributed more to Stilwell's advance than if the resources committed to the operation had been used to provide Stilwell with another regular division to fight alongside his X Force. The views of the majority of the post-war British military establishment were made succinctly by Slim (commander of the Fourteenth Army), when he wrote \\"... the Chindits, gave a splendid example of courage and hardihood. Yet I came firmly to the conclusion that such formations, trained, equipped and mentally adjusted for one kind of operation were wasteful. They did not give, militarily, a worth- while return for the resources in men, materiel and time that they absorbed. ... [Special forces] were usually formed by attracting the best men ... The result of these methods was undoubtedly to lower the quality of the rest of the Army\\".Slim 1956, pp. 546‚Äì549. He makes several other arguments against special forces, about the danger of ordinary battalions thinking that some tasks could only be performed by special forces, and that special forces can only stay in the field for relatively short periods compared to regular battalions. He sums up that \\"Anything, whatever the short cuts to victory it may promise, which thus weakens the Army spirit is dangerous\\". To underline his point he suggests that \\"This cult of special forces is as sensible as to form a Royal Corps of Tree Climbers and say that no soldier, who does not wear its green hat with a bunch of oak leaves stuck in it should be expected to climb a tree\\". He does acknowledge the need for small units to stir up trouble in the enemy's rear area but does not make it clear if he is talking about V Force or the actions of Force 136. Others, like Sir Robert Thompson, himself an ex-Chindit, have asserted that the idea behind the Chindits was a sound one, but that they were just badly handled and used in operations for which they were not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence. A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their propaganda value in 1943, at a time when the Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility.Brayley 2002, p. 19‚Äì20. It has been hard to reach a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate himself. It has also been argued that the Chindits contributed to the overall success of the Allied armies in Burma through the innovations in air supply techniques and organisation that their operations required.Brayley 2002, p. 20. The Allied air forces were later to use these tactics to supply increasingly large forces that were cut off by the enemy, or were operating independently of road or rail lines of communication. Conversely, it has been argued that the apparent success of the Chindits led some Japanese commanders to believe that they could employ their own incursion tactics on a much larger scale, and that when they came to implement such tactics during the Chindwin offensive of early 1944, lacking the necessary air support that had enabled the Allies to be successful, the result was disastrous and ultimately led to defeat at both Kohima and Imphal, and later on the plains of Burma in 1945. Three of the Brigade commanders on Operation Thursday (two of whom had also served in the first Chindit expedition) subsequently wrote autobiographies, which contained their comments on the Chindits' concept and practice of operations. Bernard Fergusson, originally an enthusiastic supporter of Wingate, later came to feel that Wingate lacked both consistency and flexibility in his plans, which contributed to Fergusson's long, pointless march from Ledo and his defeat at Indaw. John Masters, who was a close friend and supporter of Lentaigne, felt that the Chindits' mobility was sacrificed in holding fixed defensive positions or attacking strong Japanese positions, without the necessary support. In criticism of the whole Chindit concept, he pointed out that the Chindit force had the infantry strength of two and a half line divisions, but, without supporting arms, it had the fighting strength of less than one. Michael Calvert, who was closest to Wingate, remained an absolute unquestioning defender of Wingate and his methods. The British Army's 77th Brigade, raised in 2015 to engage in upstream prevention for the army, was named in tribute to the Chindits.

The Tichborne case was a legal cause c√©l√®bre that captivated Victorian England in the 1860s and 1870s. It concerned the claims by a man sometimes referred to as Thomas Castro or as Arthur Orton, but usually termed \\"the Claimant\\", to be the missing heir to the Tichborne baronetcy. He failed to convince the courts, was convicted of perjury and served a long prison sentence. Roger Tichborne, heir to the family's title and fortunes, was presumed to have died in a shipwreck in 1854 at age 25\\\\. His mother clung to a belief that he might have survived, and after hearing rumours that he had made his way to Australia, she advertised extensively in Australian newspapers, offering a reward for information. In 1866, a Wagga Wagga butcher known as Thomas Castro came forward claiming to be Roger Tichborne. Although his manners and bearing were unrefined, he gathered support and travelled to England. He was instantly accepted by Lady Tichborne as her son, although other family members were dismissive and sought to expose him as an impostor. During protracted enquiries before the case went to court in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, who had gone to sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct. After the trial, Kenealy instigated a popular radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy was elected to Parliament in 1875 as a radical independent but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, and he had no dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty for the rest of his life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne. Sir Roger Tichborne =Tichborne family history= The Tichbornes, of Tichborne Park near Alresford in Hampshire, were an old English Catholic family who had been prominent in the area since before the Norman Conquest. After the Reformation in the 16th century, although one of their number was hanged, drawn and quartered for complicity in the Babington Plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I, the family in general remained loyal to the Crown, and in 1621 Benjamin Tichborne was created a baronet for services to King James I.McWilliam 2007, pp. 5‚Äì6 Tichborne family tree (simplified). The baronetcy became extinct in 1968 on the death of the 14th baronet. In 1803 the seventh baronet, Sir Henry Tichborne, was captured by the French in Verdun during the Napoleonic Wars and detained as a civil prisoner for some years.Woodruff, p. 6 With him in captivity were his fourth son, James, and a nobly born Englishman, Henry Seymour of Knoyle. Despite his confinement, Seymour managed to conduct an affair with the daughter of the Duc de Bourbon, as a result of which a daughter, Henriette Felicit√©, was born in about 1807. Years later, when Henriette had passed her 20th birthday and remained unmarried, Seymour thought his former companion James Tichborne might make a suitable husband‚Äîalthough James was close to his own age and was physically unprepossessing. The couple were married in August 1827; on 5 January 1829 Henriette gave birth to a son, Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne.McWilliam 2007, pp. 7‚Äì8 Sir Henry had been succeeded in 1821 by his eldest son, Henry Joseph, who fathered seven daughters but no male heir. As baronetcies are inherited only by males, when Henry Joseph died in 1845 the immediate heir was his younger brother Edward, who had assumed the surname of Doughty as a condition of a legacy. Edward's only son died in childhood, so James Tichborne became next in line to the baronetcy, and after him, Roger. As the family's fortunes had been greatly augmented by the Doughty bequest, this was a considerable material prospect.Woodruff, p. 2Annear, pp. 13‚Äì15 After Roger's birth, James and Henriette had three more children: two daughters who died in infancy and a second son, Alfred, born in 1839.McWilliam 2007, p. 8 The marriage was unhappy, and the couple spent much time apart, he in England, she in Paris with Roger. As a consequence of his upbringing, Roger spoke mainly French, and his English was heavily accented. In 1845 James decided that Roger should complete his education in England and placed him in the Jesuit boarding school Stonyhurst College, where he remained until 1848. In 1849 he sat the British army entrance examinations and then took a commission in the 6th Dragoon Guards, in which he served for three years, mainly in Ireland.Woodruff, pp. 11‚Äì12 When on leave, Roger often stayed with his Uncle Edward at Tichborne Park and became attracted to his cousin Katherine Doughty, four years his junior. Sir Edward and his wife, though they were fond of their nephew, did not consider marriage between first cousins desirable. At one point the young couple were forbidden to meet, though they continued to do so clandestinely. Feeling harassed and frustrated, Roger hoped to escape from the situation through a spell of overseas military duty; when it became clear that the regiment would remain in the British Isles, he resigned his commission.McWilliam 2007, p. 11 On 1 March 1853 he left for a private tour of South America on board La Pauline, bound for Valpara√≠so in Chile.Woodruff, p. 24 =Travels and disappearance= Roger Tichborne: one of two daguerrotypes taken in South America in 1853‚Äì54 On 19 June 1853 La Pauline reached Valpara√≠so, where letters informed Roger that his father had succeeded to the baronetcy, Sir Edward having died in May.Woodruff, p. 25 In all, Roger spent 10 months in South America, accompanied in the first stages by a family servant, John Moore. In the course of his inland travels he may have visited the small town of Melipilla, which lies on the route between Valpara√≠so and Santiago.Woodruff, p. 26 Moore, who had fallen ill, was paid off in Santiago, while Roger travelled to Peru, where he took a long hunting trip. By the end of 1853 he was back in Valpara√≠so, and early in the new year he began a crossing of the Andes. At the end of January, he reached Buenos Aires, where he wrote to his aunt, Lady Doughty, indicating that he was heading for Brazil, then Jamaica and finally Mexico.Woodruff, pp. 27‚Äì28 The last positive sightings of Roger were in Rio de Janeiro, in April 1854, awaiting a sea passage to Jamaica. Although he lacked a passport, he secured a berth on a ship, the Bella, which sailed for Jamaica on 20 April.Annear, pp. 38‚Äì39 The Argus seeking information as to Tichborne's fate. On 24 April 1854 a capsized ship's boat bearing the name Bella was discovered off the Brazilian coast, together with some wreckage but no personnel, and the ship's loss with all hands was assumed. The Tichborne family were told in June that Roger must be presumed lost, though they retained a faint hope, fed by rumours, that another ship had picked up survivors and taken them to Australia.McWilliam 2007, p. 13 Sir James Tichborne died in June 1862, at which point, if he was alive, Roger became the 11th baronet. As he was by then presumed dead, the title passed to his younger brother Alfred, whose financial recklessness rapidly brought about his near-bankruptcy.Woodruff, pp. 32‚Äì33 Tichborne Park was vacated and leased to tenants.McWilliam 2007, p. 14‚Äì15 Encouraged by a clairvoyant's assurance that her elder son was alive and well, in February 1863 Roger's mother Henriette, now Lady Tichborne, began placing regular newspaper advertisements in The Times offering a reward for information about Roger Tichborne and the fate of the Bella. None of these produced results; however, in May 1865 Lady Tichborne saw an advertisement placed by Arthur Cubitt of Sydney, Australia, on behalf of his \\"Missing Friends Agency\\". She wrote to him, and he agreed to place a series of notices in Australian newspapers. These gave details of the Bella's last voyage and described Roger Tichborne as \\"of a delicate constitution, rather tall, with very light brown hair and blue eyes\\". A \\"most liberal reward\\" would be given \\"for any information that may definitely point out his fate\\".Woodruff, pp. 37‚Äì38 Claimant appears =In Australia= Thomas Castro's butcher's shop in Wagga Wagga, Australia In October 1865 Cubitt informed Lady Tichborne that William Gibbes, a lawyer from Wagga Wagga, had identified Roger Tichborne in the person of a bankrupt local butcher using the name Thomas Castro.Woodruff, pp. 38‚Äì40 During his bankruptcy examination Castro had mentioned an entitlement to property in England. He had also talked of experiencing a shipwreck and was smoking a briar pipe which carried the initials \\"R.C.T.\\" When challenged by Gibbes to reveal his true name, Castro had initially been reticent but eventually agreed that he was indeed the missing Roger Tichborne; henceforth he became generally known as the Claimant. Cubitt offered to accompany the supposed lost son back to England and wrote to Lady Tichborne requesting funds.Woodruff, p. 42 Meanwhile, Gibbes asked the Claimant to make out a will and to write to his mother. The will incorrectly gave Lady Tichborne's name as \\"Hannah Frances\\", and disposed of numerous nonexistent parcels of supposed Tichborne property.McWilliam 2007, p. 16 In the letter to his mother, the Claimant's references to his former life were vague and equivocal but were enough to convince Lady Tichborne that he was her elder son. Her willingness to accept the Claimant may have been influenced by the death of her younger son, Alfred, in February.Woodruff, pp. 45‚Äì48 In June 1866 the Claimant moved to Sydney, where he was able to raise money from banks on the basis of a statutory declaration that he was Roger Tichborne. The statement was later found to contain many errors, although the birthdate and parentage details were given correctly. It included a brief account of how he had arrived in Australia: he and others from the sinking Bella, he said, had been picked up by the Osprey, bound for Melbourne.Woodruff, pp. 52‚Äì54 On arrival he had taken the name Thomas Castro from an acquaintance from Melipilla and had wandered for some years before settling in Wagga Wagga. He had married a pregnant housemaid, Mary Ann Bryant, and taken her child, a daughter, as his own; a further daughter had been born in March 1866.Annear, pp. 5‚Äì6 While in Sydney the Claimant encountered two former servants of the Tichborne family. One was a gardener, Michael Guilfoyle, who at first acknowledged the identity of Roger Tichborne but later changed his mind when asked to provide money to facilitate the return to England. The second, Andrew Bogle, was a former slave at the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos's plantation in Jamaica who had thereafter worked for Sir Edward for many years before retiring. The elderly Bogle did not immediately recognise the Claimant, whose weight contrasted sharply with Roger's remembered slender build; however, Bogle quickly accepted that the Claimant was Roger, and remained convinced until the end of his life.McWilliam 2007, p. 17 On 2 September 1866 the Claimant, having received funds from England, sailed from Sydney on board the Rakaia with his wife and children in first class, and a small retinue including Bogle and his youngest son Henry George in second class.Woodruff, pp. 55‚Äì56 Good living in Sydney had raised his weight on departure to , and during the long voyage he added another .Annear, p. 80 and p. 82 After a journey involving several changes of ship, the party arrived at Tilbury on 25 December 1866. =Recognition in France= Lady Tichborne, Sir Roger Tichborne's mother After depositing his family in a London hotel, the Claimant called at Lady Tichborne's address and was told she was in Paris. He then went to Wapping in East London, where he enquired after a local family named Orton. Finding that they had left the area, he identified himself to a neighbour as a friend of Arthur Orton, who, he said, was now one of the wealthiest men in Australia. The significance of the Wapping visit would become apparent only later.McWilliam 2007, pp. 18‚Äì19 On 29 December the Claimant visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel, where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes. The Claimant confided that he was the missing Sir Roger but asked that this be kept secret. He also sought information concerning the Tichborne family.Woodruff, pp. 57‚Äì58 Back in London, the Claimant employed a solicitor, John Holmes, who agreed to go with him to Paris to meet Lady Tichborne.McWilliam 2007, p. 21 This meeting took place on 11 January at the H√¥tel de Lille. As soon as she saw his face, Lady Tichborne accepted him. At Holmes's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the Claimant was her son. She was unmoved when Father Ch√¢tillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared the Claimant an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of ¬£1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.McWilliam 2007, p. 23 Laying the groundwork, 1867‚Äì71 =Support and opposition= The Claimant in about 1869, having acquired much extra weight since his arrival in England The Claimant quickly acquired significant supporters; the Tichborne family's solicitor Edward Hopkins accepted him, as did J.P. Lipscomb, the family's doctor. Lipscomb, after a detailed medical examination, reported that the Claimant possessed a distinctive genital malformation. It would later be suggested that Roger Tichborne had this same defect, but this could not be established beyond speculation and hearsay.Woodruff, pp. 139‚Äì40McWilliam 2007, pp. 199‚Äì200 Many people were impressed by the Claimant's seeming ability to recall small details of Roger Tichborne's early life, such as the fly fishing tackle he had used. Several soldiers who had served with Roger in the Dragoons, including his former batman Thomas Carter, recognised the Claimant as Roger.McWilliam 2007, p. 24 Other notable supporters included Lord Rivers, a landowner and sportsman, and Guildford Onslow, the Liberal MP for Guildford who became one of the Claimant's staunchest advocates. Rohan MacWilliam, in his account of the case, calls this wide degree of recognition remarkable, particularly given the Claimant's increasing physical differences from the slim Roger. By mid-June 1867 the Claimant's weight had reached almost and would increase even more in the ensuing years.McWilliam 2007, pp. 25‚Äì26 Despite Lady Tichborne's insistence that the Claimant was her son, the rest of the Tichbornes and their related families were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant's arrival in England.Woodruff, p. 74 Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors.Woodruff, pp. 78‚Äì81 Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by the Claimant, who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said he could not remember.Woodruff, pp. 90‚Äì91 The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park.Woodruff, p. 66 Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong. On 31 July 1867 the Claimant underwent a judicial examination at the Chancery Division of the Royal Courts of Justice.Woodruff, pp. 94‚Äì96 He testified that after his arrival in Melbourne in July 1854 he had worked for William Foster at a cattle station in Gippsland under the name of Thomas Castro. While there, he had met Arthur Orton, a fellow Englishman. After leaving Foster's employment the Claimant had subsequently wandered the country, sometimes with Orton, working in various capacities before setting up as a butcher in Wagga Wagga in 1865.Woodruff, pp. 99‚Äì101 On the basis of this information, the Tichborne family sent an agent, John Mackenzie, to Australia to make further enquiries. Mackenzie located Foster's widow, who produced the old station records. These showed no reference to \\"Thomas Castro\\", although the employment of an \\"Arthur Orton\\" was recorded. Foster's widow also identified a photograph of the Claimant as Arthur Orton, thus providing the first direct evidence that the Claimant might in fact be Orton. In Wagga Wagga one local resident recalled the butcher Castro saying that he had learned his trade in Wapping.McWilliam 2007, pp. 28‚Äì30 When this information reached London, enquiries were made in Wapping by a private detective, ex-police inspector Jack Whicher,Annear, pp. 122‚Äì23 and the Claimant's visit in December 1866 was revealed.Woodruff, pp. 108‚Äì09 =Arthur Orton= Vanity Fair by 'Ape' June 1871 Arthur Orton, a butcher's son born on 20 March 1834 in Wapping, had gone to sea as a boy and had been in Chile in the early 1850s. Sometime in 1852 he arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, in the transport ship Middleton and later moved to mainland Australia. His employment by Foster at Gippsland terminated around 1857 with a dispute over wages.Woodruff, pp. 102‚Äì03 Thereafter he disappears; if he was not Castro, there is no further direct evidence of Orton's existence, although strenuous efforts were made to find him. The Claimant hinted that some of his activities with Orton were of a criminal nature and that to confound the authorities they had sometimes exchanged names. Most of Orton's family failed to recognise the Claimant as their long- lost kinsman, although it was later revealed that he had paid them money. However, a former sweetheart of Orton's, Mary Ann Loder, did identify the Claimant as Orton.Woodruff, p. 114 =Financial problems= Lady Tichborne died on 12 March 1868, thus depriving the Claimant of his principal advocate and his main source of income. He outraged the family by insisting on taking the position of chief mourner at her funeral mass. His lost income was rapidly replaced by a fund, set up by supporters, that provided a house near Alresford and an income of ¬£1,400 (¬£145,278 in 2016) a year. In September 1868, together with his legal team, the Claimant went to South America to meet face-to-face with potential witnesses in Melipilla who might confirm his identity. He disembarked at Buenos Aires, ostensibly to travel to Valpara√≠so overland and there rejoin his advisers who were continuing by sea. After waiting two months in Buenos Aires he caught a ship home. His explanations for this sudden retreat‚Äîpoor health and the dangers from brigands‚Äîdid not convince his backers, many of whom withdrew their support; Holmes resigned as his solicitor. Furthermore, on their return his advisers reported that no one in Melipilla had heard of \\"Tichborne\\", although they remembered a young English sailor called \\"Arturo\\".McWilliam 2007, pp. 31‚Äì32 The Claimant was now bankrupt. In 1870 his new legal advisers launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, an issue of 1,000 debentures of ¬£100 face value, the holders of which would be repaid with interest when the Claimant obtained his inheritance. About ¬£40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums.McWilliam 2007, p. 33 The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco- Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil case that the Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.Woodruff, p. 166 Civil case: Tichborne v. Lushington, 1871‚Äì72 The case was listed in the Court of Common Pleas as Tichborne v. Lushington, in the form of an action for the ejectment of Colonel Lushington, the tenant of Tichborne Park. The real purpose, however, was to establish the Claimant's identity as Sir Roger Tichborne and his rights to the family's estates; failure on his part would expose him as an impostor.McWilliam 2007, pp. 36‚Äì37 In addition to Tichborne Park's , the estates included manors, lands and farms in Hampshire, and considerable properties in London and elsewhere, which altogether produced an annual income of over ¬£20,000, equivalent to several millions in 21st-century terms. =Evidence and cross-examination= Sir William Bovill, the presiding judge at the civil case The hearing, which took place within the Palace of Westminster, began on 11 May 1871Woodruff, pp. 171‚Äì72 before Sir William Bovill, who was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. The Claimant's legal team was led by William Ballantine and Harding Giffard, both highly experienced advocates. Opposing them, acting on instructions from the bulk of the Tichborne family, were John Duke Coleridge, the Solicitor General (he was promoted to Attorney-General during the hearing), and Henry Hawkins, a future High Court judge who was then at the height of his powers as a cross-examiner.McWilliam 2007, pp. 40‚Äì42 In his opening speech, Ballantine made much of Roger Tichborne's unhappy childhood, his overbearing father, his poor education and his frequently unwise choices of companions. The Claimant's experiences in an open boat following the wreck of the Bella had, said Ballantine, impaired his memories of his earlier years, which explained his uncertain recall.McWilliam 2007, p. 43 Attempts to identify his client as Arthur Orton were, Ballantine argued, the concoctions of \\"irresponsible\\" private investigators acting for the Tichborne family.Woodruff, p. 174 The first witnesses for the Claimant included former officers and men from Roger Tichborne's regiment, all of whom declared their belief that he was genuine.McWilliam 2007, p. 44 Among servants and former servants of the Tichborne family called by Ballantine was John Moore, Roger's valet in South America. He testified that the Claimant had remembered many small details of their months together, including clothing worn and the name of a pet dog the pair had adopted.Woodruff, p. 178 Roger's cousin Anthony Biddulph explained that he had accepted the Claimant only after spending much time in his company.McWilliam 2007, pp. 45‚Äì47Woodruff, pp. 180‚Äì85 On 30 May Ballantine called the Claimant to the stand. During his examination-in-chief, the Claimant answered questions on Arthur Orton, whom he described as \\"a large- boned man with sharp features and a lengthy face slightly marked with smallpox\\".Woodruff, p. 187 He had lost sight of Orton between 1862 and 1865, but they had met again in Wagga Wagga, where the Claimant had discussed his inheritance.McWilliam 2007, p. 187 Under cross-examination the Claimant was evasive when pressed for further details of his relationship with Orton, saying that he did not wish to incriminate himself. After questioning him on his visit to Wapping, Hawkins asked him directly: \\"Are you Arthur Orton?\\" to which he replied \\"I am not\\".Woodruff, pp. 201‚Äì06 The Claimant displayed considerable ignorance when questioned about his time at Stonyhurst. He could not identify Virgil, confused Latin with Greek, and did not understand what chemistry was. He caused a sensation when he declared that he had seduced Katherine Doughty and that the sealed package given to Gosford, the contents of which he earlier claimed not to recall, contained instructions to be followed in the event of her pregnancy.Woodruff, pp. 194‚Äì96 Rohan McWilliam, in his chronicle of the affair, comments that from that point on the Tichborne family were fighting not only for their estates but for Katherine Doughty's honour.McWilliam 2007, pp. 49‚Äì50 =Collapse of case= On 7 July the court adjourned for four months. When it resumed, Ballantine called more witnesses, including Bogle and Francis Baigent, a close family friend. Hawkins contended that Bogle and Baigent were feeding the Claimant with information, but in cross-examination he could not dent their belief that the Claimant was genuine. In January 1872 Coleridge began the case for the defence with a speech during which he categorised the Claimant as comparable with \\"the great impostors of history\\".McWilliam 2007, pp. 51‚Äì52 He intended to prove that the Claimant was Arthur Orton.Woodruff, p. 213 He had over 200 witnesses lined up,Woodruff, p. 189 but it transpired that few were required. Lord Bellew, who had known Roger Tichborne at Stonyhurst, testified that Roger had distinctive body tattoos which the Claimant did not possess. On 4 March the jury notified the judge that they had heard enough and were ready to reject the Claimant's suit. Having ascertained that this decision was based on the evidence as a whole and not solely on the missing tattoos, Bovill ordered the Claimant's arrest on charges of perjury and committed him to Newgate Prison.Woodruff, pp. 215‚Äì16 Appeal to the public, 1872‚Äì73 The Claimant's \\"Appeal to the Public\\" is satirised in Judy, or The London Serio-Comic Journal. From his cell in Newgate, the Claimant vowed to resume the fight as soon as he was acquitted.Woodruff, pp. 221‚Äì22 On 25 March 1872 he published in the Evening Standard an \\"Appeal to the Public\\", requesting financial help to meet his legal and living costs: \\"I appeal to every British soul who is inspired by a love of justice and fair play, and is willing to defend the weak against the strong\\".McWilliam 2007, pp. 61‚Äì62Woodruff, pp. 223‚Äì24 The Claimant had gained considerable popular support during the civil trial; his fight was perceived by many as symbolising the problems faced by the working class when seeking justice in the courts. In the wake of his appeal, support committees were formed throughout the country. When he was bailed early in April, on sureties provided by Lord Rivers and Guildford Onslow, a large crowd cheered him as he left the Old Bailey. At a public meeting in Alresford on 14 May, Onslow reported that subscriptions to the defence fund were already pouring in and that invitations to visit and speak had been received from many towns. As the Claimant addressed meetings up and down the country, journalists following the campaign often commented on his pronounced cockney accent, suggestive of East London origins.McWilliam 2007, p. 74 The campaign drew in some high-level supporters, among whom was George Hammond Whalley, a controversial anti- Catholic who was MP for Peterborough. He and Onslow were sometimes incautious in their speeches; after a meeting in St James's Hall, London, on 11 December 1872, each made specific charges against the Attorney General and the Government of trying to pervert the course of justice. They were fined ¬£100 each for contempt of court.McWilliam 2007, p. 71 and pp. 77‚Äì78 With few exceptions, the mainstream press was hostile to the Claimant's campaign. To counteract this, his supporters launched two short-lived newspapers, the Tichborne Gazette in May 1872 and the Tichborne News and Anti-Oppression Journal in June. The former was wholly devoted to the Claimant's cause and ran until Onslow's and Whalley's contempt convictions in December 1872. The Tichborne News, which concerned itself with a broader range of perceived injustices, closed after four months.McWilliam 2007, pp. 64‚Äì66 Criminal case: Regina v. Castro, 1873‚Äì74 =Judges and counsel= The Tichborne trial judges, left to right: Sir John Mellor; Sir Alexander Cockburn; Sir Robert Lush The criminal case, to be heard in the Queen's Bench, was listed as Regina v. Castro, the name Castro being the last uncontested alias of the Claimant.Woodruff, pp. 251‚Äì52 Because of its expected length, the case was scheduled as a \\"trial at bar\\", a device that allowed a panel rather than one judge to hear it. The president of the panel was Sir Alexander Cockburn, the Lord Chief Justice.McWilliam 2007, pp. 89‚Äì90 His decision to hear this case was controversial, since during the civil case he had publicly denounced the Claimant as a perjurer and a slanderer. Cockburn's co-judges were Sir John Mellor and Sir Robert Lush, experienced Queen's Bench justices. The prosecution team was largely that which had opposed the Claimant in the civil case, minus Coleridge. Hawkins led the team, his main assistants being Charles Bowen and James Mathew.McWilliam 2007, p. 88 The Claimant's team was significantly weaker; he would not re-engage Ballantine and his other civil case lawyers declined to act for him again. Others refused the case, possibly because they knew they would have to present evidence concerning the seduction of Katherine Doughty. The Claimant's backers eventually engaged Edward Kenealy, an Irish lawyer of acknowledged gifts but known eccentricity. Kenealy had previously featured in several prominent defences, including those of the poisoner William Palmer and the leaders of the 1867 Fenian Rising. He was assisted by undistinguished juniors: Patrick MacMahon, an Irish MP who was frequently absent, and the young and inexperienced Cooper Wyld.Woodruff, pp. 254‚Äì55 Kenealy's task was made more difficult when several of his upper-class witnesses refused to appear, perhaps afraid of the ridicule they anticipated from the Crown's lawyers.Woodruff, pp. 267‚Äì68 Other important witnesses from the civil case, including Moore, Baigent and Lipscombe, would not give evidence at the criminal trial.Woodruff, p. 313 =Trial= A contemporary illustration of the trial; Hawkins addresses the court The trial, one of the lengthiest cases heard in an English court, began on 21 April 1873 and lasted until 28 February 1874, occupying 188 court days. The tone was dominated by Kenealy's confrontational style; his personal attacks extended not only to witnesses but to the Bench and led to frequent clashes with Cockburn. Under the legal rules that then applied to criminal cases, the Claimant, though present in court, was not allowed to testify.Woodruff, p. 259 Away from the court he revelled in his celebrity status; the American writer Mark Twain, who was then in London, attended an event at which the Claimant was present and \\"thought him a rather fine and stately figure\\". Twain observed that the company were \\"educated men, men moving in good society.... It was 'Sir Roger', always 'Sir Roger' on all hands, no one withheld the title\\".Twain, pp. 74‚Äì75 Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, including numbers from France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne or that he was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant's writing resembled Orton's but not Roger Tichborne's.McWilliam 2007, pp. 95‚Äì97 The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant's description. Furthermore, the Claimant had provided the wrong name for Ospreys captain, and the names he gave for two of Ospreys crew were found to belong to members of the crew of the Middleton, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue had been found in Ospreys log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster's records.Morse, pp. 33‚Äì35 Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding the disposition of certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty's seduction or pregnancy.Morse, pp. 74‚Äì75 In this painting by Frederick Sargent, the Claimant can be seen sitting in the lower centre; behind him, partially hidden, is Henry George Bogle, son of Andrew Bogle and the Claimant's constant companion and assistant during the trial. In the row behind the Claimant, Kenealy has risen to speak. Kenealy's defence was that the Claimant was victim of a conspiracy which encompassed the Catholic Church, the government and the legal establishment. He frequently sought to demolish witnesses' character, as with Lord Bellew, whose reputation he destroyed by revealing details of the peer's adultery. Kenealy's own witnesses included Bogle and Biddulph, who remained steadfast, but more sensational testimony came from a sailor called Jean Luie, who claimed that he had been on the Osprey during the rescue mission. Luie identified the Claimant as \\"Mr Rogers\\", one of six survivors picked up and taken to Melbourne. On investigation Luie was found to be an impostor, a former prisoner who had been in England at the time of the Bella‚Äôs sinking. He was convicted of perjury and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.Woodruff, pp, 317‚Äì18 =Summing-up, verdict and sentence= After closing addresses from Kenealy and Hawkins, Cockburn began summing-up on 29 January 1874.Woodruff, p. 338 His speech was prefaced by a severe denunciation of Kenealy's conduct, \\"the longest, severest and best merited rebuke ever administered from the Bench to a member of the bar\\" according to the trial's chronicler John Morse.Morse, pp. 174‚Äì77 The tone of the summing-up was partisan, frequently drawing the jury's attention to the Claimant's \\"gross and astonishing ignorance\\" of things he would certainly know if he were Roger Tichborne.Morse, p. 78 Cockburn rejected the Claimant's version of the sealed package contents and all imputations against Katherine Doughty's honour.Woodruff, pp. 328‚Äì29Morse, pp. 226‚Äì27 Of Cockburn's peroration, Morse remarked that \\"never was a more resolute determination manifested [by a judge] to control the result\\".Morse, p. 229 While much of the press applauded Cockburn's forthrightness, his summing-up was also criticised as \\"a Niagara of condemnation\\" rather than an impartial review.Woodruff, pp. 371‚Äì72 The jury retired at noon on Saturday 28 February, and returned to the court within 30 minutes.McWilliam 2007, p. 107 Their verdict declared that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne, that he had not seduced Katherine Doughty, and that he was indeed Arthur Orton. He was thus convicted of perjury. The jury added a condemnation of Kenealy's conduct during the trial. After the judges refused his request to address the court, the Claimant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of seven years' imprisonment.Woodruff, pp. 367‚Äì70 Kenealy's behaviour ended his legal career; he was expelled from the Oxford circuit mess and from Gray's Inn, so that he could no longer practise. On 2 December 1874 the Lord Chancellor revoked Kenealy's patent as a Queen's Counsel.McWilliam 2007, pp. 110‚Äì11 Aftermath =Popular movement= Edward Kenealy, the Claimant's defence counsel, disbarred after the trial The court's verdict swelled the popular tide in favour of the Claimant. He and Kenealy were hailed as heroes, the latter as a martyr who had sacrificed his legal career.McWilliam 2007, p. 90 George Bernard Shaw, writing much later, highlighted the paradox whereby the Claimant was perceived simultaneously as a legitimate baronet and as a working-class man denied his legal rights by a ruling elite.Shaw, pp. 23‚Äì24McWilliam 2007, p. 113 In April 1874 Kenealy launched a political organisation, the \\"Magna Charta Association\\", with a broad agenda that reflected some of the Chartist demands of the 1830s and 1840s. In February 1875 Kenealy fought a parliamentary by-election for Stoke- upon-Trent as \\"The People's Candidate\\", and won with a resounding majority.Woodruff, pp. 401‚Äì02 However, he failed to persuade the House of Commons to establish a royal commission into the Tichborne trial, his proposal securing only his own vote and the support of two non-voting tellers, against 433 opposed. Thereafter, within parliament Kenealy became a generally derided figure, and most of his campaigning was conducted elsewhere. In the years of the Tichborne movement's popularity a considerable market was created for souvenirs in the form of medallions, china figurines, teacloths and other memorabilia.McWilliam 2007, p. 201 However, by 1880 interest in the case had declined, and in the General Election of that year Kenealy was heavily defeated. He died of heart failure a few days after the election.McWilliam 2007, pp. 167‚Äì68 The Magna Charta Association continued for several more years, with dwindling support; The Englishman, the newspaper founded by Kenealy during the trial, closed down in May 1886, and there is no evidence of the Association's continuing activities after that date.McWilliam 2007, pp. 184‚Äì85 =Claimant's release and final years= Paddington cemetery, the Claimant's burial place The Claimant was released on licence on 11 October 1884 after serving 10 years.McWilliam 2007, pp. 183‚Äì85 He was much slimmer; a letter to Onslow dated May 1875 reports a loss of .Woodruff, p. 378 Throughout his imprisonment he had maintained that he was Roger Tichborne, but on release he disappointed supporters by showing no interest in the Magna Charta Association, instead signing a contract to tour with music halls and circuses. The British public's interest in him had largely waned; in 1886 he went to New York but failed to inspire any enthusiasm there and ended up working as a bartender. He returned in 1887 to England, where, although not officially divorced from Mary Ann Bryant, he married a music hall singer, Lily Enever.McWilliam 2007, pp. 273‚Äì75 In 1895, for a fee of a few hundred pounds, he confessed in The People newspaper that he was, after all, Arthur Orton.Annear, pp. 402‚Äì04 With the proceeds he opened a small tobacconist's shop in Islington; however, he quickly retracted the confession and insisted again that he was Roger Tichborne. His shop failed, as did other business attempts, and he died destitute, of heart disease, on 1 April 1898. His funeral caused a brief revival of interest; around 5,000 people attended Paddington cemetery for the burial in an unmarked pauper's grave. In what McWilliam calls \\"an act of extraordinary generosity\\" the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the name \\"Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne\\" to be placed on the coffin before its interment. The name \\"Tichborne\\" was registered in the cemetery's records. =Appraisal= Commentators have generally accepted the trial jury's verdict that the Claimant was Arthur Orton. However, McWilliam cites the monumental study by Douglas Woodruff (1957), in which the author posits that the Claimant could just possibly have been Roger Tichborne. Woodruff's principal argument is the sheer improbability that anyone could conceive such an imposture from scratch, at such a distance, and then implement it: \\"[I]t was carrying effrontery beyond the bounds of sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that they would all be destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son\\".Woodruff, pp. 452‚Äì53 In 1876, while the Claimant was serving his prison sentence, interest was briefly raised by the claims of William Cresswell, an inmate of a Sydney lunatic asylum, that he was Arthur Orton. There was circumstantial evidence that indicated some connection with Orton, and the Claimant's supporters campaigned to have Cresswell brought to England. Nothing came of this, although the question of Cresswell's possible identity remained a matter of dispute for years.McWilliam, pp. 158‚Äì59Annear, pp. 300‚Äì01 In 1884 a Sydney court found the matter undecided, and ruled that the status quo should be maintained; Cresswell stayed in the asylum.Annear, pp. 392‚Äì98 Shortly before his death in 1904 he was visited by the contemporaneous Lady Tichborne, who found no physical resemblance to any member of the Tichborne family.Annear, pp. 405‚Äì406 Attempts have been made to reconcile some of the troubling uncertainties and contradictions within the case. To explain the degree of facial resemblance (which even Cockburn accepted) of the Claimant to the Tichborne family, Onslow suggested in The Englishman that Orton's mother, a woman named Mary Kent, was an illegitimate daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne, Roger Tichborne's grandfather. An alternative story has Mary Kent being seduced by James Tichborne, making Orton and Roger half-brothers. Other versions have Orton and Roger as companions in crime in Australia, with Orton killing Roger and assuming his identity.Annear, p. 406 The Claimant's daughter by Mary Ann Bryant, Teresa Mary Agnes, maintained that her father confessed to her that he had killed Arthur Orton and thus could not disclose details of his Australian years.McWilliam 2007, p. 274 There is no direct evidence for any of these theories. Teresa continued to proclaim her identity as a Tichborne daughter, and in 1924 was imprisoned for making threats and demands for money to the family. Woodruff submits that the legal verdicts, although fair given the evidence before the courts, have not fully resolved the \\"great doubt\\" that Cockburn admitted hung over the case. Woodruff wrote in 1957: \\"Probably for ever, now, its key long since lost... a mystery remains\\".Woodruff, pp. 458‚Äì59 A 1998 article in The Catholic Herald suggested that DNA profiling might resolve the mystery. The enigma has launched numerous retellings of the story in book and film, including the short story \\"Tom Castro, the Implausible Imposter\\" from Jorge Luis Borges's Universal History of Infamy,McWilliam 2007, p. 276 and David Yates's 1998 film The Tichborne Claimant. Thus, Woodruff concludes, \\"the man who lost himself still walks in history, with no other name than that which the common voice of his day accorded him: the Claimant\\".

Their Curtis P-40B Warhawk aircraft, marked with Chinese colors, flew under American control. Their mission was to bomb Japan and defend the Republic of China, but many delays meant the AVG flew in combat after the US and Japan declared war. The group consisted of three fighter squadrons of around 30 aircraft each that trained in Burma before the American entry into World War II to defend Republic of China against Japanese forces. The AVG were officially members of the Republic of China Air Force. The group had contracts with salaries ranging from $250 a month for a mechanic to $750 for a squadron commander, roughly three times what they had been making in the U.S. forces. While it accepted some civilian volunteers for its headquarters and ground crew, the AVG recruited most of its staff from the U.S. military. The Flying Tigers began to arrive in China in April 1941. The group first saw combat on 20 December 1941, 12 days after Pearl Harbor (local time). It demonstrated innovative tactical victories when the news in the U.S. was filled with little more than stories of defeat at the hands of the Japanese forces and achieved such notable success during the lowest period of the war for both the U.S. and the Allied Forces as to give hope to America that it might eventually defeat Japan. AVG pilots earned official credit and received combat bonuses for destroying 296 enemy aircraft, while losing only 14 pilots in combat.Ford 1991, pp. 30‚Äì34. The combat records of the AVG still exist and researchers have found them credible. On 4 July 1942 the AVG was disbanded and replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces, which was later absorbed into the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force with General Chennault as commander. The 23rd FG went on to achieve similar combat success, while retaining the nose art on the left-over P-40s. Origin Chennault in his Kunming office, May 1942. He wears a US Army brigadier general's star on his left shoulder but Chinese insignia otherwise. The American Volunteer Group was largely the creation of Claire L. Chennault, a retired U.S. Army Air Corps officer who had worked in China since August 1937, first as military aviation advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in the early months of the Sino- Japanese War, then as director of a Chinese Air Force flight school centered in Kunming. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union supplied fighter and bomber squadrons to China, but these units were mostly withdrawn by the summer of 1940. Chiang then asked for American combat aircraft and pilots, sending Chennault to Washington as an adviser to China's ambassador and Chiang's brother-in-law, T. V. Soong. Chennault spent the winter of 1940‚Äì1941 in Washington, supervising the purchase of 100 Curtiss P-40 fighters and the recruiting of 100 pilots and some 200 ground crew and administrative personnel that would constitute the 1st AVG. He also laid the groundwork for a follow-on bomber group and a second fighter group, though these would be aborted after the Pearl Harbor attack. =Original American volunteer group= 3rd Squadron Hell's Angels, Flying Tigers, over China, photographed in 1942 by AVG pilot Robert T. Smith P-40 Warhawk painted with Flying Tigers shark face at the National Museum of the United States Air Force Of the pilots, 60 came from the Navy and Marine Corps and 40 from the Army Air Corps. (One army pilot was refused a passport because he had earlier flown as a mercenary in Spain, so only 99 actually sailed for Asia. Ten more army flight instructors were hired as check pilots for Chinese cadets, and several of these would ultimately join the AVG's combat squadrons.) The volunteers were discharged from the armed services, to be employed for \\"training and instruction\\" by a private military contractor, the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO), which paid them $600 a month for pilot officers, $675 a month for flight leaders, $750 for squadron leaders (no pilot was recruited at this level), and about $250 for skilled ground crewmen. Some pilots were also orally promised a bounty of $500 for each enemy aircraft shot down, and this was later confirmed by Madame Chiang Kai- shek.Ford 2007, pp. 45‚Äì45, 249-250. Resignation letter from the U.S. Marine Corps, used to accept a position with the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Co. During the summer and fall 1941, some 300 men carrying civilian passports boarded ships destined for Burma. They were initially based at a British airfield in Toungoo for training while their aircraft were assembled and test flown by CAMCO personnel at Mingaladon Airport outside Rangoon. Chennault set up a schoolhouse that was made necessary because many pilots had \\"lied about their flying experience, claiming pursuit experience when they had flown only bombers and sometimes much less powerful aeroplanes.\\"Feltus, Pamela. \\"Claire Chennault and the Flying Tigers of World War II.\\" U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission, 2003. Retrieved: 5 July 2011. They called Chennault \\"the Old Man\\" due to his much older age and leathery exterior obtained from years flying open cockpit pursuit aircraft in the Army Air Corps. Most believed that he had flown as a fighter pilot in China, although stories that he was a combat ace are probably apocryphal.Scott 1973, p. 7. Of the 300 original members of the CAMCO personnel, 9 were Chinese-Americans recruited from America's Chinatowns. All 9 were trained at Allison Engineworks in Indianapolis, Indiana: all were P-40 mechanics. Upon arrival in Kunming, 2 other Chinese-Americans were hired, a Ford Motor truck specialist and a doctor. Total original Chinese-Americans were 11. Prior to 4 July 1942, 3 of the P-40 mechanics resigned. The official AVG roster lists the original 8. The AVG was created by an executive order of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. He did not speak English, however, and Chennault never learned to speak Chinese. As a result, all communications between the two men were routed through Soong Mei-ling, \\"Madame Chiang\\" as she was known to Americans, and she was designated the group's \\"honorary commander.\\" =Chennault fighter doctrine= Chennault preached a radically different approach to air combat based on his study of Japanese tactics and equipment, his observation of the tactics used by Soviet pilots in China, and his judgment of the strengths and weaknesses of his own aircraft and pilots. The actual average strength of the AVG was never more than 62 combat-ready pilots and fighters. Chennault faced serious obstacles since many AVG pilots were inexperienced and a few quit at the first opportunity. However, he made a virtue out of these disadvantages, shifting unsuitable pilots to staff jobs and always ensuring that he had a squadron or two in reserve. (The AVG had no ranks, so no division between officers and enlisted soldiers existed.) Chennault and the Flying Tigers benefited from the country's warning network, called \\"the best air-raid warning system in existence\\": When Japanese aircraft attacked, Chennault's doctrine called for pilots to take on enemy aircraft in teams from an altitude advantage, since their aircraft were not as maneuverable or as numerous as the Japanese fighters they would encounter. He prohibited his pilots from entering into a turning fight with the nimble Japanese fighters, telling them to execute a diving or slashing attack and to dive away to set up for another attack. This \\"dive-and-zoom\\" technique was contrary to what the men had learned in U.S. service as well as what the Royal Air Force (RAF) pilots in Burma had been taught; it had been used successfully, however, by Soviet units serving with the Chinese Air Force.Scott 1973, p. 21. =Curtiss P-40= Kittyhawk Mark III of 112 Squadron, taxiing through scrub at Medenine, Tunisia. The ground crewman on the wing is directing the pilot, whose view ahead is hindered by the aircraft's nose. A ZG 76 Bf 110C with \\"sharks mouth\\" nose paint AVG fighter aircraft came from a Curtiss assembly line producing Tomahawk IIB models for the Royal Air Force in North Africa. The Tomahawk IIB was similar to the U.S. Army's earlier P-40B model, and there is some evidence that Curtiss actually used leftover components from that model in building the fighters intended for China.Ford 2007, p. 36. The fighters were purchased without \\"government- furnished equipment\\" such as reflector gunsights, radios and wing guns; the lack of these items caused continual difficulties for the AVG in Burma and China. The 100 P-40 aircraft were crated and sent to Burma on third country freighters during spring 1941. At Rangoon, they were unloaded, assembled and test flown by personnel of Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO) before being delivered to the AVG training unit at Toungoo.Howard 1991, p. 65. One crate was dropped into the water and a wing assembly was ruined by salt water immersion, so CAMCO was able to deliver only 99 Tomahawks before war broke out. (Many of those were destroyed in training accidents.) The 100th fuselage was trucked to a CAMCO plant in Loiwing, China, and later made whole with parts from damaged aircraft. Shortages in equipment with spare parts almost impossible to obtain in Burma along with the slow introduction of replacement fighter aircraft were continual impediments although the AVG did receive 50 replacement P-40E fighters from USAAF stocks toward the end of its combat tour. AVG fighter aircraft were painted with a large shark face on the front of the aircraft. This was done after pilots saw a photograph of a P-40 of No. 112 Squadron RAF in North Africa,Rossi, J. R. \\"A Flying Tigers Story by Dick Rossi, Pilot.\\" AFG: American Volunteer Group, The Flying Tigers, 1998.

(The AVG nose-art is variously credited to Charles BondRossi, J. R. \\"Charles Bond biography.\\" AFG: American Volunteer Group, The Flying Tigers, 1998. Retrieved: 5 July 2011. and Erik Shilling.) About the same time, the AVG was dubbed \\"The Flying Tigers\\" by its Washington support group, called China Defense Supplies.Ford 2007, pp. 82‚Äì83, 107. The P-40's good qualities included pilot armor, self-sealing fuel tanks, sturdy construction, heavy armament, and a higher diving speed than most Japanese aircraft ‚Äì qualities that could be used to advantage in accordance with Chennault's combat tactics.Smith, Robert T. \\"Tale of a Tiger ‚Äì From The Diary of Robert T. Smith, Flying Tiger, part 4.\\" Planes and Pilots Of World War Two, 1986. Retrieved: 5 July 2011. Chennault created an early warning network of spotters that would give his fighters time to take off and climb to a superior altitude where this tactic could be executed.Scott 1973, pp. 61‚Äì65. Combat history The port of Rangoon in Burma and the Burma Road leading from there to China were of crucial importance. Eastern China was under Japanese occupation, so all military supplies for China arrived via the Burma route. By November 1941, when the pilots were trained and most of the P-40s had arrived in Asia, the Flying Tigers were divided into three squadrons: 1st Squadron (\\"Adam & Eves\\"); 2nd Squadron (\\"Panda Bears\\") and 3rd Squadron (\\"Hell's Angels\\"). They were assigned to opposite ends of the Burma Road to protect this vital line of communications. Two squadrons were based at Kunming in China, and a third at Mingaladon Airport near Rangoon. When the United States officially entered the war, the AVG had 82 pilots and 79 aircraft, although not all were combat-ready. Tiger Erik Shilling, part of the third squadron commented:. \\"This was the beginning of the greatest adventure I would ever hope to experience. It wasn't until years later that I fully realized the magnitude and significance of this first step, to be a lifelong adventure in the mystic Far East.\\" The AVG's first combat mission was on 20 December 1941, when aircraft of the 1st and 2nd squadrons intercepted 10 unescorted Kawasaki Ki-48 \\"Lily\\" bombers of the 21st Hik≈çtai attacking Kunming. The bombers jettisoned their loads before reaching Kunming. Three of the Japanese bombers were shot down near Kunming and a fourth was damaged so severely that it crashed before returning to its airfield at Hanoi. Later, Chinese intelligence intercepted Japanese communications indicating that only 1 out of the 10 bombers ultimately returned to base. Furthermore, the Japanese discontinued their raids on Kunming while the AVG was based there. One P-40 crash-landed; it was salvaged for parts. This mission was one of the earliest American aerial victories in the Pacific War. =Defense of Rangoon= A \\"blood chit\\" issued to the American Volunteer Group Flying Tigers. The Chinese characters read, \\"This foreign person has come to China to help in the war effort. Soldiers and civilians, one and all, should rescue and protect him.\\" (R. E. Baldwin Collection) The first squadron had flown up to Kunming to defend the terminus of the Burma Road and saw some combat action on 20 December 1941 while defending Rangoon from Japanese bombers, taking down four of them and disrupting their attack on the Burma Road.Sherman, Steven. \\"The Flying Tigers\\" Claire Chennault and the American Volunteer Group.\\" Acepilots.com, 27 June 2011. Retrieved: 26 April 2015. At this time, the focus of Japan's offensive efforts in the AVG's coverage area was southern Burma. The 3rd Squadron ‚Äì 18 aircraft strong ‚Äì defended Rangoon from 23‚Äì25 December. On 23 December, Mitsubishi Ki-21 \\"Sally\\" heavy bombers of the 60th, 62nd and 98th Sentai, along with single-engined Mitsubishi Ki-30 \\"Ann\\" attack bombers of the 31st Sentai, sortied against Rangoon. They were escorted by Nakajima Ki-27 \\"Nate\\" fighters of 77th Sentai. The Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (JAAF) formation was intercepted by the AVG and RAF Brewster Buffalos of 67 Squadron. Eight Ki-21s were shot down for the loss of three AVG P-40s. The 60th Sentai was particularly hard hit ‚Äì it lost five out of the 15 bombers it had dispatched. Nevertheless, Rangoon and Mingaladon airfield were successfully bombed, with the city suffering more than 1,000 dead. Two Buffalos and two P-40s were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 crashed when it attempted to land on a bomb-damaged runway. On 25 December, the JAAF returned, reinforced by Ki-21s of 12th Sentai and Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusas (Oscars) of the 64th Sentai (Colonel Tateo Kat≈ç's Flying Squadron). A total of 63 bombers escorted by 25 fighters were committed. These were intercepted by 14 P-40s of the AVG's 3rd Squadron and 15 Buffalos of 67 Squadron. In the two encounters, 35 Japanese bombers and fighters were shot down. The Allies lost two pilots and five P-40s.\\"History of the Flying Tigers.\\" Retrieved: 26 April 2015. Mingaladon airfield was once again damaged, and eight Buffalos were destroyed on the ground. After its losses in the 23‚Äì25 December battles, the 3rd Squadron was relieved by the 2nd Squadron \\"Panda Bears\\", which carried out a series of raids on JAAF airbases in Thailand. The Japanese had moved aircraft to Malaya to finish off Singapore, and its remaining aircraft in the area (the 77th, 31st and 62nd Sentai) launched fighter sweeps and counter raids on the Allied airfield at Mingaladon. On 12 January, the Japanese launched their Burma Campaign. Significantly outnumbered, the AVG was gradually reduced through attrition, but often exacted a disproportionate toll of their attackers. On 24 January, six Ki-21s of the 14th Sentai escorted by Ki-27s attacked Mingaladon. All the Ki-21s were shot down by the AVG and RAF defenders. On 28 January, a fighter sweep of 37 Ki-27s was engaged by 16 AVG P-40s and two RAF fighters. Three \\"Nates\\" were shot down for the loss of two P-40s. The next day, another sweep of 20 Ki-27s of the 70th Sentai was met by 10 Allied fighters (eight P-40s and two Hawker Hurricanes). Four were shot down for the loss of no Allied aircraft. Despite these minor victories and Chennault's reinforcement of the \\"Panda Bears\\" with pilots from the \\"Adam and Eves\\", by mid-February, only 10 P-40s were still operational at Mingaladon. Commonwealth troops retreated before the Japanese onslaught, and the AVG was pressed into the ground attack role to support them. One unfortunate result of these missions was a prolonged air attack on a suspected Japanese column on 21 February that turned out to consist of Commonwealth troops. More than 100 Allied lives were lost in this friendly fire incident. On 27 February, after hearing that the RAF was retreating and pulling out its radar equipment, the AVG withdrew to bases in northern Burma. By 24 January, the Flying Tigers had destroyed 73 Japanese aircraft while losing only five themselves ‚Äì a notable performance, considering the AVG was outnumbered and faced experienced and fully trained Japanese pilots. The main disadvantage of JAAF fighter pilots of this period was the near-obsolescence of their predominant fighter type in the theater, the Ki-27. Though more maneuverable than the P-40, its armament and performance was inferior. Lightly constructed and armed, it could not withstand frontal attacks nor could it out-dive Allied fighters such as the P-40; if it attempted to, it often came apart in the air. In fact, its cruising speed was less than that of the Ki-21 bombers it was intended to escort. =Retreat into China= After Rangoon was lost to the Japanese at the end of February, the AVG relocated to Magwe, a small British airfield more than 300 miles north of Rangoon. Chennault started moving elements of the now reconstituted 3rd Squadron to Magwe as reinforcement to his worn down 1st and 2nd squadrons. Aircraft attrition became so high that at this point, individual squadron distinctions became meaningless, and all three squadrons had elements based there, along with a number of RAF aircraft. In total, the Allies had 38 aircraft, including eight P-40s and 15 Hawker Hurricanes. Opposing them were 271 Japanese aircraft, including 115 fighters. Although the AVG and the RAF scored some successes against the JAAF, Magwe was continuously bombed, including a very heavy raid on 21 March by 151 bombers and fighters. On 23 March with only four aircraft left, the AVG was forced to relocate to Loiwing, just across the Chinese border. The Tigers crossed into China on a rickety suspension bridge over a deep gorge. A few months later, they came back to destroy the bridge so no Japanese soldiers could come across that way into China.Wambold Jr., Donald A.. \\"A Flying Tiger's War.\\" World War II 20, no. 2, 2005, pp. 22‚Äì25. The Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa was a single-engined land- based fighter used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force in World War II Reinforced by new P-40E \\"Kittyhawks\\" and by repaired aircraft from the AVG's excellent maintenance group, 12 P-40s were based at Loiwing on 8 April. Despite the long retreats, their losses and incessant air combat, the AVG still retained their abilities. That day, 12 Oscars from the 64th Sentai raided the base. In the ensuing series of dogfights, four Ki-43s were downed in exchange for one P-40E destroyed on the ground. During this period, Chinese and American commanders pressured Chennault to order his pilots to undertake so-called \\"morale missions\\". These were overflights and ground attacks intended to raise the morale of hard-pressed Chinese soldiers by showing they were getting air support. The AVG's pilots seethed with resentment at these dangerous missions (which some considered useless), a feeling which culminated in the so-called \\"Pilot's Revolt\\" of mid-April. Chennault suppressed the \\"revolt\\" and ordered the ground attack missions to continue. But despite their efforts, the Allied situation in Burma continued to deteriorate. On 29 April the AVG was ordered to evacuate Loiwing and relocate to Baoshan in China. Like the AVG's other bases, Baoshan was repeatedly bombed by the Japanese Army Air Force. Still, the AVG scored against their JAAF tormentors, bringing down four \\"Nates\\" of the 11th Sentai on 5 May and two \\"Anns\\". By 4 May, the successful Japanese Burma offensive was winding down, except for mopping up actions. One of these was an attempt by a regiment of the Japanese 56th Division to drive for Kunming, an effort that was stopped by the Chinese army operating with strong air support from the AVG. On 7 May the Japanese Army began building a pontoon bridge across the upper Salween River, which would allow them to move troops and supplies into China and drive towards Kunming. To stem this tide, 2nd Squadron Leader David Lee \\"Tex\\" Hill led a flight of four new P-40Es bombing and strafing into the mile deep Salween River Gorge. During the next four days, the AVG pilots flew continuous missions into the gorge, effectively neutralizing the Japanese forces. This prevented a Japanese advance on Kunming and Chungking; the Japanese never advanced farther than the west bank of the upper Salween. Claire Chennault later wrote of these critical missions, \\"The American Volunteer Group had staved off China's collapse on the Salween.\\" Despite being on the defensive thereafter, the AVG continued to harass the JAAF with raids on their Vietnamese bases. With the Burma campaign over, Chennault redeployed his squadrons to provide air protection for China. The Doolittle Raid had prompted the Japanese to launch an offensive to seize AVG air bases that could be used for attacks on the Japanese homeland. By 1 June, personnel that would form the nucleus of the new USAAF 23rd Fighter Group (the AVG's replacement) were beginning to trickle into the theater. Some of the last missions the AVG flew were defending Guilin against raids by JAAF Nates, Lilys, and new Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu (\\"Nick\\") heavy fighters. The AVG's last combat was over Hengyang on the day it was disbanded, 4 July 1942. In this final action, the AVG shot down four Ki-27s with no AVG losses.

Retrieved: 5 July 2011. The AVG lacked many resources. Despite its location in areas with malaria and cholera, it had only \\"four doctors, three nurses and a bottle of iodine.\\" Pilots found the food disgusting, and the slow mail from home and lack of women hurt morale. A squadron had 45 maintenance personnel compared to the normal more than 100, and only one base could perform major repairs. Nonetheless, the AVG was officially credited with 297 enemy aircraft destroyed, including 229 in the air.Olynk 1986 Fourteen AVG pilots were killed in action, captured, or disappeared on combat missions. Two died of wounds sustained in bombing raids, and six were killed in accidents during the Flying Tigers' existence as a combat force. The AVG's kill ratio was superior to that of contemporary Allied air groups in Malaya, the Philippines, and elsewhere in the Pacific theater. The AVG's success is all the more remarkable since they were outnumbered by Japanese fighters in almost all their engagements. The AVG's P-40s were superior to the JAAF's Ki-27s, but the group's kill ratio against modern Ki-43s was still in its favor. In Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941‚Äì1942, Daniel Ford attributes the AVG's success to morale and group esprit de corps. He notes that its pilots were \\"triple volunteers\\" who had volunteered for service with the U.S. military, the AVG, and brutal fighting in Burma. The result was a corps of experienced and skilled volunteer pilots who wanted to fight. During their service with the Nationalist Chinese air force, 33 AVG pilots and three ground crew received the Order of the Cloud and Banner, and many AVG pilots received the Chinese Air Force Medal. Each AVG ace and double ace was awarded the Five Star or Ten Star Wing Medal. Members of the AVG * Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington broke his contract with the AVGRossi, J.

Smith: 5 victories Legacy =Transition to the USAAF= The success of the AVG led to negotiations in spring 1942 to induct it into the USAAF. Chennault was reinstated as a colonel and immediately promoted to brigadier general commanding U.S. Army air units in China (initially designated China Air Task Force and later the 14th Air Force), while continuing to command the AVG by virtue of his position in the Chinese Air Force. On 4 July 1942, the AVG was replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group. Most AVG pilots refused to remain with the unit as a result of the strong arm tactics by the USAAF general sent to negotiate with them. However, five pilots accepted commissions in China including \\"Tex\\" Hill, one of Chennault's most loyal devotees, with others remaining for a two-week transition period. (U.S. airmen and the press continued to use the \\"Flying Tiger\\" name to refer to USAAF units in China to the end of the war, and the name continues to be applied to certain air force and army aviation squadrons.) Most AVG pilots became transport pilots in China, went back to America into civilian jobs, or rejoined the military services and fought elsewhere in the war.Ford 2007, ch. 17. One of the pilots drawn to the success of the AVG was Robert Lee Scott, Jr. who was flying supplies into Kunming over the Hump from India. He convinced Chennault to loan him a P-40 which he flew to protect the supply route; his aggressiveness led to Chennault's recruiting him as commander of the 23rd Fighter Group. Scott brought recognition to his exploits and those of the Flying Tigers with his 1943 bestselling autobiography God is My Co-Pilot that was then made by Warner Bros. into a popular film in 1945. =Tributes and memorials= Ocala, Florida Memorial Park Restored P-40 on display at the National World War II Museum There are several museum displays in the United States honoring the Flying Tigers. The National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, has an extensive display dedicated to the AVG, including an A-2 jacket worn by an AVG pilot in China, a banner presented to the AAF by the Chinese government, and a P-40E. The National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida also has a Flying Tiger display. The Chennault Aviation Museum in Monroe, Louisiana has an extensive collection of Flying Tigers and AVG memorabilia. The AVG monument in the National Museum of the United States Air Force Memorial Garden features a marble sculpture of a pagoda crowned with a brass model of a P-40; the monument stands nearly 14 feet tall. The Palm Springs Air Museum has a display of memorabilia inside a mockup of AVG ground facilities, with a P-40N painted in AVG markings. Finally, a memorial to the AVG and 14th AF is located at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, depicting a P-40 in AVG markings with a bronze plaque describing the unit's history and Vandenberg's role as headquarters for the 14th AF. There are also several memorials to the AVG in Asia. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, a marble obelisk was dedicated on 11 November 2003, inscribed to Chennault; to Jack Newkirk, who was killed in North Thailand on 24 March 1942; and to Charles Mott and William McGarry, who were shot down and captured in Thailand. In Taiwan, Madame Chiang Kai-Shek requested a statue of Chennault in the New Park of Taipei to commemorate this wartime friend after his death (the statue has since been relocated to Hualian AFB). A Flying Tigers Memorial is located in the village of Zhijiang, Hunan Province, China and there is a museum dedicated exclusively to the Flying Tigers. The building is a steel and marble structure, with wide sweeping steps leading up to a platform with columns holding up the memorial's sweeping roof; on its back wall, etched in black marble, are the names of all members of the AVG, 75th Fighter Squadron, and 14th Air Force who died in China. In 2005, the city of Kunming held a ceremony memorializing the history of the Flying Tigers in China, and on 20 December 2012, the Flying Tigers Museum opened in Kunming. The date is the 71st anniversary of the first combat from Kunming of the Flying Tigers. The Memorial Cemetery to Anti-Japanese Aviator Martyrs in Nanjing, China features a wall listing the names of Flying Tiger pilots and other pilots who defended China in World War II, and has several unmarked graves for such American pilots.Former 'Flying Tigers' Visit Nanjing Memorial Cemetery. china.org (Xinhua News Agency), 25 August 2005.

The aircraft crashed into the rain forest in northern Thailand. McGarry was captured and interrogated, and spent most of the war in a Thai prison. Toward the end of the war the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) arranged for the Free Thai Movement to spirit him out of the prison to a PBY Catalina in the Gulf of Thailand. The wreck of his P-40 was discovered in 1991, and consists of the P-40's Allison engine, Hamilton Standard propeller and parts of the airframe.

The wreck of another AVG P-40 is believed to be in Lake Dianchi (Lake Kunming). The fighter is believed to be a P-40E piloted by John Blackburn when it crashed into the lake on a gunnery training flight on 28 April 1942, killing the pilot. His body was recovered from the aircraft, which was submerged in 20 feet of water. In 1997 a U.S.-Chinese group called the Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation was formed to locate the aircraft and possibly raise and restore it. In March 1998, they contacted the China Expedition Association about conducting the recovery operation. Over 300 aircraft are believed to have crashed into Lake Dianchi (including a second AVG P-40) so locating the aircraft proved difficult. In 2003, an aircraft believed to be Blackburn's was found embedded in nine feet of bottom silt. An effort was made in September 2005 to raise the aircraft, but the recovery was plagued with difficulties and it remains deep under the lake bottom. Since the aircraft was complete and relatively undamaged when John Blackburn's body was removed from it in 1942, it is hoped that the aircraft will be in good condition and capable of being restored, possibly to flying condition. =Recognition by the United States= Just before their 50th reunion in 1992, the AVG veterans were retroactively recognized as members of the U.S. military services during the seven months the group was in combat against the Japanese. The AVG was then awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for \\"professionalism, dedication to duty, and extraordinary heroism.\\" In 1996, the U.S. Air Force awarded the pilots the Distinguished Flying Cross and the ground crew were all awarded the Bronze Star Medal.Ford 2007, p. 349. =Popular culture= A number of feature films have referenced the AVG directly or indirectly, the most famous being Flying Tigers, a 1942 black-and-white film from Republic, starring John Wayne and John Carroll as fighter pilots. Other wartime films with an AVG angle included The Sky's the Limit (1943, starring Fred Astaire as a Flying Tiger ace on leave); Hers to Hold (1943, with Joseph Cotten); God is My Co-Pilot, (1945, with Dennis Morgan as Robert Lee Scott, Raymond Massey as Chennault, and John Ridgely as Tex Hill); and China's Little Devils (1945). The two lead characters of the television series Tales of the Gold Monkey, Jake Cutter and Corky, were formerly members of the Flying Tigers, the former a pilot and the latter a mechanic. Several episodes featured flashbacks or characters from their time with the AVG. Similarly, the Flying Tigers have been the focus of several novels, including Tonya, by Pappy Boyington; Remains, by Daniel Ford; Spies in the Garden, by Bob Bergin, Tiger Ten by William D. Blankenship, Wings of a Flying Tiger and Will of a Tiger, both written by Dr. Iris Yang. Tiger, Lion, Hawk, a novel for younger readers, was written by Earle Rice Jr. The Star Wars reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare features an X-wing starfighter squadron named the \\"Lightspeed Panthers\\". Co-author Paul R. Urquhart confirmed in the book's endnotes that the squadron was intended to be a direct reference to the Flying Tigers.Fry, Jason and Paul R.

He published an autobiography, purportedly based on his experience as the son of a Blackfoot chief. He was the first presumed Native American admitted to the Explorers Club in New York City. In reality a non-Native, he had claimed to be of mixed Cherokee, white and black heritage, at a time when Southern society imposed strict binary divisions of black and white in a racially segregated society. After his tribal claims were found to be false, he was dropped by these same social circles to which he had gained entry. Early life and education Long had ambitions that were larger than what he saw of his future in Winston, where his father Joseph S. Long was a janitor in the school system. In that segregated society, African Americans had limited opportunities.Alexander D. Gregor, review of Donald B. Smith, Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance: The Glorious Impersonator, Manitoba Library Association, accessed 18 Apr 2009 Long first left North Carolina to portray Indian characters in a \\"Wild West Show\\". During this time he continued to build upon his (later proven to be fraudulent) stories of being Cherokee.Melinda Micco, \\"Tribal Re-Creations: Buffalo Child Long Lance and Black Seminole Narratives\\", in Re-placing America: Conversations and Contestations, ed. Ruth Hsu, Cynthia Franklin, and Suzanne Kosanke, Honolulu: University of Hawai'i and the East-West Center, 2000, p. 74, accessed 20 Apr 2009 In 1909, Long claimed to be half Cherokee when he applied to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School and was accepted. He also lied about his age to gain admission. He graduated in 1912 at the top of his class, which included prominent Native Americans such as Jim Thorpe and Robert Geronimo, a son of the famous Apache warrior. Long entered the St. John's and Manlius Military academies in Manlius, New York with a full musical scholarship, based on his performance at the Carlisle School. Career Long returned to Canada as an acting sergeant in 1919, requesting discharge at Calgary, Alberta. He worked as a journalist for the Calgary Herald. Canada had de facto segregation and a climate in which the government had discouraged black immigration from the US. During this time in both Canada and the US it was common for those of African heritage to instead make false claims of Cherokee or Blackfoot. \\"It is not surprising that in such a climate...Long Lance felt that he was safer, and that he could go further, by disavowing any connection, cultural or racial, to blackness.\\"Karina Joan Vernon, The Black Prairies: History, Subjectivity, Writing, PhD dissertation, University of Victoria, 2008, p.604, accessed 19 Apr 2009 Long presented himself as a Cherokee from Oklahoma and claimed he was a West Point graduate with the Croix de Guerre earned in World War I. For the next three years as a reporter, he covered Indian issues. He criticized government treatment of Indians and openly criticized Canada's Indian Act, especially their attempts at re- education and prohibiting the practice of tribal rituals. To a friend, Long justified his decision to assume a Blackfoot Indian identity by saying it would help him be a more effective advocate, that he had not lived with his own people since he was sixteen, and now knew more about the Indians of Western Canada.Donald B. Smith, Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance: The Glorious Impersonator, Red Deer Press, 1999, p.148 In 1924, Long Lance became a press representative for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Through these years, Long also entered the civic life of the city, by joining the local Elks Lodge and the militia, and coaching football for the Calgary Canucks.Donald B. Smith, Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance: The Glorious Impersonator, Red Deer Press, 1999, p.91 These activities would not have been possible had he honestly represented himself as a black man.

It published Long Lance in 1928, to quick success. In it, Long claimed to have been born a Blackfoot, son of a chief, in Montana's Sweetgrass Hills. He also said that he had been wounded eight times in the Great War and been promoted to the rank of captain. The popular success of his book and the international press made him a major celebrity. The book became an international bestseller and was praised by literary critics and anthropologists. Karina Joan Vernon, The Black Prairies: History, Subjectivity, Writing, PhD dissertation, University of Victoria, 2008, p. 42, accessed 19 Apr 2009 Long had already been writing and lecturing on the life of Plains Indians. His celebrity gave him more venues and caused him to be taken up as part of the New York party life. More significantly, he was then admitted to the prominent Explorers' Club in New York. The Explorers' Club believed they were admitting their \\"First Indian.\\" He received an average price of $100 for his speeches, a good price in those years. He endorsed a sport shoe for the B.F.

An Indian advisor to the film crew, Chauncey Yellow Robe, became suspicious of Long and alerted the studio legal advisor. Long could not explain his heritage to their satisfaction, and rumors began to circulate. An investigation revealed that his father had not been a Blackfoot chief, but a school janitor in Winston- Salem, North Carolina.Donald B. Smith, Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance: The Glorious Impersonator, Red Deer Press, 1999, pp.243-244 Some neighbors from his home town testified that they thought his background may have included African ancestry, which meant by southern racial standards, he was black.

Clifton called Long \\"a sham\\" who \\"assumed the identity of an Indian\\", \\"an adopted ethnic identity pure and simple.\\" In her book Real Indians: Identity and the Survival of Native Americans (2003), Eva Marie Garroutte uses the controversy over Long's identity to introduce questions surrounding contested Indian identity and authenticity in United States culture. Death \\"To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.\\" After the controversy surrounding his identity, California socialite Anita Baldwin took Long as a bodyguard on her trip to Europe. Because of his behavior, Baldwin abandoned him in New York. For a time, he fell in love with dancer Elisabeth Clapp but refused to marry her. In 1931, he returned to Baldwin. In 1932, Long was found dead in Baldwin's home in Los Angeles, California from a gunshot. His death was ruled a suicide. Long left his assets to St. Paul's Indian Residential School in Southern Alberta. Most of his papers were willed to his friend, Canon S.H. Middleton. They were acquired, along with the Middleton papers, by J.

Stanley Clifford Weyman (November 25, 1890 ‚Äì August 27, 1960), was an American multiple impostor who impersonated public officials, including the United States Secretary of State and various military officers. Weyman was born as Stanley Jacob Weinberg on November 25, 1890 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents could not afford college tuition. He worked mainly in nondescript jobs but on occasion pretended to become somebody higher on the social ladder. In 1910, Weyman's first imposture was as U.S. consul representative to Morocco. He dined in the finest restaurants in New York City, but was eventually arrested for fraud. Next Weyman took on roles as a military attach√© from Serbia and a U.S. Navy lieutenant, with each identity using the other as a reference. He was soon caught. Weyman was released the second time in 1915. He then became Lieutenant Commander Ethan Allen Weinberg, Consul General for Romania. He inspected the USS Wyoming and invited everyone to dinner at the Astor Hotel. The advance publicity alerted the Bureau of Investigation and federal agents arrested him at the party. He was heard to complain that they should have waited until dessert. He got a year in jail. In 1917, he took on the mantle of Royal St. Cyr, a lieutenant in the British Army Air Corps. He was arrested when he was on an inspection tour of the Brooklyn Armory after a suspicious military tailor alerted the police. Weyman was paroled in 1920. Shortly afterwards he forged credentials to become a company doctor in Lima, Peru. There he threw lavish parties until his credit ran out and he was arrested. In 1921 he noticed Princess Fatima of Afghanistan, who was visiting the United States and was trying to get official recognition. The U.S. State Department mainly ignored her. Weyman visited her as a State Department Naval Liaison Officer, apologized for the oversight and promised to arrange an appointment with the President. He managed to convince the princess to give him 10,000 dollars for \\"presents\\" to State Department officials. He used the money for a private railway carriage to Washington, D.C., and an opulent hotel room in the Willard Hotel for the princess and her entourage. Weyman proceeded to visit the State Department, dropped names of prominent senators and succeeded in getting appointments for the princess, first with Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, and, on July 26, 1921, with President Warren G. Harding. Weyman's minor mistakes in protocol aroused some suspicion, but after the press published pictures showing him alongside dignitaries he was indicted for impersonating a naval officer and sentenced to two years in jail. On another occasion the Evening Graphic hired Weyman to get an interview with the visiting Queen Marie of Romania. He gained admittance as the Secretary of State and the paper got its interview. In 1926 Weyman appeared at Rudolph Valentino's funeral and attached himself to Valentino's grieving lover Pola Negri as a personal physician. He issued regular press releases on her condition and established a faith-healing clinic in Valentino's house. Pola Negri did not condemn him after he was exposed. During World War II Weyman was sentenced to seven years in prison for offering advice to draft dodgers on how to feign various medical conditions. In 1948 Weyman made up credentials to become a journalist at the United Nations in Lake Success, New York. He got acquainted with the delegates Warren Austin and Andrei Gromyko. His comeuppance came when the Thai delegation invited him to become their press officer with full diplomatic accreditation. Weyman contacted the State Department and asked whether it would affect his U.S. citizenship, thus drawing attention to himself. In 1954 Weyman tried to get a home improvement loan of 5,000 dollars for a house that did not exist. He failed to convince the judge that he was insane. In August 1960, Weyman was fatally shot when he tried to stop a robbery at a hotel in New York City where he was working as a night porter. The investigating detective said: \\"I've known about the man's past record for years.

Breeding programme In the 1860s the Phylloxera plague cut European wine production by more than two- thirds.Rice, Timothy O. (August 2004) \\"The Phylloxera Plague\\" Winery Insight As the pest originated in the New World, crossing American stock with European Vitis vinifera varieties was one of the promising attempts to contain the disaster. The vines produced by this hybridization did not necessarily produce better wines, but did produce vine stock that could better survive Phylloxera attacks. Seibel and his company produced over 16,000 new hybrids, with nearly 500 varieties that were then grown commercially. He often used as a female parent the hybrid Jaeger 70, a cross between Vitis lincecumii and Vitis rupestris produced by Hermann Jaeger. Some of the most famous Seibel grapes are Aurore (Seibel 5279), Chancellor (Seibel 7053), Chelois (Seibel 10878), De Chaunac (Seibel 9549).

It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Landshut, M√ºhldorf, Ebersberg, Munich and Freising. History The region is one of the oldest parts of Bavaria. Erding was located on the way between two important centres of power in the Wittelsbach state, Munich and Landshut. About 1230 a castle was built on the river Sempt in order to secure the road. This castle grew to become the town of Erding. The district of Erding was founded in 1946. Slight modifications took place in the administrative reform of 1971, when some villages from neighbouring districts were awarded to Erding. Geography The district covers agriculturally used areas northeast of Munich. Several affluents of the Isar River cross the district from south to north, among them the Sempt. In the northwest there is the Erdinger Moos, which was once a large fen. A substantial part of this swampy area was drained in order to build the new airport of Munich, which was opened to the public in 1992.

Vignoles is a complex hybrid wine grape variety that was developed by J.F. Ravat originally named Ravat 51. According to Ravat, \\"Ravat 51\\" was the result of a cross made in 1930 using the complex hybrid wine grape Seibel 6905 (also known as Le Subereux) and a clone of Pinot Noir known as Pinot de corton. Originally named \\"Vignoles\\" by the Finger Lakes Wine Growers Association in 1970, genetic testing has recently proved that Vignoles does not share any major genetic markers in common with Seibel 6905 or Pinot Noir. Thus, Vignoles is unrelated to the \\"Ravat 51\\" grapevine that was imported into the US in 1949 and the parentage of Vignoles is currently unknown. Online version: Viticulturally, Vignoles is described as moderately vigorous with moderate yields, late season bud break, an upright and open growth habit, small very compact bunches that are highly susceptible to Botrytis bunch rot, an average of 105 days from bloom to harvest, high sugar with high acid at maturity, average overall disease resistance, and moderate winter hardiness (). Enologically, Vignoles is often prized for its ability to produce balanced and fruity late-harvest style sweet white wines, including ice wine, although Vignoles is also used to produce fruity dry and off-dry white wines as well. In the United States, Vignoles is most commonly grown in New York state's Finger Lakes region, and in the Midwest including Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa and Kentucky.

They were planted widely in France during the 1950s but have seen decline in recent years because French wine law prohibits hybrid grapes in appellation wine. The grapes are still commonly used as blending grapes in table wine and mass commercial wines. New Zealand, England, and Canada also have plantings of Seibel grapes.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 207 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Almost all of Albert Seibel‚Äôs hybrid grapes were descended from only four parent grapes: two European grapes (Vitis vinifera), Aramon and Alicante Bouchet; one wild American grape, Jaeger 70 (Vitis rupestris x Vitis lincecumii); and one rootstock, AxR1, which was created by crossing Aramon with a wild American V. rupestris. Although Seibel bred tens of thousands of grapes, he did so almost entirely by crossing and re-crossing his original varieties, all of which were descended from the original four vines, so the basic gene pool of his collection remained largely unchanged. Almost all later grapevine hybridizers, such as Bertille Seyve and his father-in-law Victor Villard, would simply breed one or two of Albert Seibel‚Äôs grapes together and name their creations after themselves, e.g., Seyve-Villard 5276 (‚ÄúSeyval Blanc‚Äù).

It depicts a battle between the armies of Alexander the Great and Darius III of Persia and measures .Honour, H. and J. Fleming, (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 178. This work of art is a combination of different artistic traditions such as Italic, Hellenistic, and Roman. The mosaic is considered ‚ÄúRoman‚Äù based on the broader context of its time and location in relation to the later Roman Republic. The original is preserved in the Naples National Archaeological Museum. The mosaic is believed to be a copy of an early 3rd-century BC Hellenistic painting.Woodford, Susan. (1982) The Art of Greece and Rome. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 67. Subject =Battle= The mosaic illustrates a battle in which Alexander charges the Persian king Darius. The battle scene comprises over 50 men. Alexander defeated him at the Battle of Issus and again two years later at the Battle of Gaugamela. The work is traditionally believed to show the Battle of Issus.Battle of Issus, History.com The Alexander Mosaic is believed to be a copy of a Hellenistic Greek painting made during the 4th century BC. The style of the mosaic is distinctly Greek in that it depicts close up portraits of the main heroes of the battle. Typically within Greek battle scenes the heroes are difficult to define within the commotion. It is a commonly accepted belief of the Alexander mosaic that one must use the Greek original to interpret the meaning of the Roman copy. The debate among scholars over the significance of the Roman copy is that it cannot and should not be interpreted in the same cultural and historical context as the Greek original. Some believe that in doing so, it takes away both context and achievement from Roman artists. The mosaic is held to be a copy either of a painting by Aristides of Thebes, or of a lost late 4th-century BC fresco by the painter Philoxenus of Eretria. The latter is mentioned by Pliny the Elder (XXXV, 110) as a commission for the Macedonian king Cassander. =Alexander and Darius=  Description and analysis  The mosaic features many figures in a very large space. The two most distinguished and recognizable figures are Alexander the Great and King Darius III of Persia. Alexander is depicted in a profile view facing the left side of the mosaic. He is posed in action killing a man with a spear or javelin in his right arm. He features a Roman nose and a stoic look in combat. Alexander wears a breastplate with the head of Medusa, a famous Gorgon. This can be seen as a reference to the gorgon‚Äôs magical head. The head of Medusa‚Äôs power to turn people to stone was used as a protection in Greek mythology. One other interpretation of the head of the Medusa is its use as a reference to divine birth. Both of these theories contribute to the power presented in the mosaic of Alexander the Great. Alexander rides his horse Bucephalus. He is shown with a lot of curly soft-textured hair. His hair is typical of Greek royal portraiture that was established in the 4th century BC. Alexander‚Äôs gaze is trained on the Persian King Darius. Note that Alexander does not wear a battle helmet in the mosaic so that he could be recognized as the great conqueror. After Alexander the Great was declared king of Asia around 330 BC, he adopted a new royal court style. His costume was rethought and redesigned with a new royal insignia and an emphasis on decadence. Scholars believe Alexander had a specific notion of what it was to be a king in Asia and to be the Great King, therefore he required his dress to be magnificent to command his new conquered people. Alexander intended to replace Darius as king of Persia with a highly expanded autocracy while commanding respect and authority. Darius can be recognized as the other large figure in the mosaic. Darius and his charioteer takes up a large portion of the mosaic in the right half of the depiction. There are various precarious elements surrounding him. In the background Darius‚Äô charioteer whips the horses to flee from the battle scene. There is visible fear and anxiety in the Persian king's face, seen especially in his furrowed brows and deep frown. Darius is positioned holding a rope or rein in his left arm while his right arm is outstretched towards Alexander. Directly in front of the king‚Äôs chariot is a soldier holding the reins to his horse. The horse is a large figure that draws much attention because of its backward facing positioning. The horse's hindquarters are facing the audience with a raised tail. This may be seen as a reference to the Persian defeat and weak leadership displayed.Detail showing Alexander 1893 Reconstruction of the mosaic depiction. =Other features= Darius's brother Oxyathres is also portrayed, sacrificing himself to save the King. Radical foreshortening ‚Äì as in the central horse, seen from behind ‚Äì and the use of shading to convey a sense of mass and volume enhance the naturalistic effect of the scene. Repeated diagonal spears, clashing metal, and the crowding of men and horses evoke the din of battle. At the same time, action is arrested by dramatic details such as the fallen horse and the Persian soldier in the foreground who watches his own death throes reflected in a shield. History of the mosaic =Production= The mosaic is made of about one and a half million tiny colored tiles called tesserae, arranged in gradual curves called opus vermiculatum, (also known as \\"worm work,\\" because they seem to replicate the slow motion of a crawling worm). The color scale of Roman mosaics are extremely rich in gradation. The process of gathering materials for mosaics was a complex undertaking since the color scale was based solely on the pieces of marble that could be found in nature. The mosaic is an unusually detailed work for a private residence and was likely commissioned by a wealthy person or family. The fact that this scene was made to be viewed in the house of a Roman civilian reveals that Alexander the Great was more than just a heroic image to the Romans. Because Roman leaders followed after Alexander's image, Roman civilians also aspired to emulate the power he represented. Since the mosaic was arranged on the floor where the patron could receive guests, it was the first decorative object a visitor would see upon entering that room. = Contextualizing both Greek and Roman versions = There is limited evidence in existence today to contextualize many if not most of rediscovered Roman artworks. The Alexander Mosaic depicts a rich subject narrative of two historical figures engaged in a defining battle. This imagery was most likely placed in the House of the Faun to incorporate and evoke the power of Alexander the Great into Roman canonical depictions. This mosaic is fully capable of communicating a broader message due to its find date and location site. The mosaic communicates a rich Greek and Roman historical background, especially through its commemoration of a Greek decisive win over the Persians. There are many specific and intricate details in the Alexander Mosaic. These details can be used as clues to contextualize the scene and to learn more about this historical event. The limitations with this body of knowledge are that these details do not provide full contextualization for the significance of this battle scene inside an ancient Italian home. =Modern history= The Alexander Mosaic was preserved due to the volcanic ash that collected over the mosaic during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the city of Pompeii in 79 AD. This Roman artwork was found inlaid into the ground of the House of the Faun in between two open peristyles. The mosaic was used to decorate the exedra. An exedra is an open room or area that contains seating that is used for conversing. The House of the Faun was a large estate comprising one whole block in Pompeii; this is an area of about 3,000 square meters. As a significant artwork and piece of history, the scene of the Mosaic remained in the social and cultural sphere. The mosaic was rediscovered in 1831 in Pompeii, Italy, and was later transported to Naples in September 1843. The Alexander Mosaic is now displayed on a wall and preserved in Naples. It is currently on display at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale. In 1956 , the Alexander Mosaic was featured on 1,000 Greek drachma banknotes. =Modern copy= In 2003 the International Center for the Study and Teaching of Mosaic (CISIM) in Ravenna, Italy, proposed creating a copy of the mosaic.Alexander, Piece by Piece. by Marco Merola, Archaeology, Abstracts Vol. 59, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2006. Retrieved 26 May 2013. Archived here. After CISIM received approval for the project, the mosaic master Severo Bignami and his eight- person team took a large photograph of the mosaic, made a tracing of the image with a dark marker and created a negative impression of the mosaic. The team composed the mosaic in sections in 44 clay frames, trying to preserve the pieces of the mosaic in the exact positions they are in the original mosaic. They had to keep the plates wet all the time. Then they pressed a tissue on the clay to create an image of the outlines of the mosaic in the clay. The team recreated the mosaic with about 2 million pieces of various marble types. When they had placed all the pieces, they covered the result with a layer of glue and gauze and pulled it out of the clay. They placed each section on synthetic concrete and then united the sections with the compound of glasswool and plastic. The project took 22 months and a cost equivalent to US$216,000. The copy was installed in the House of the Faun in 2005. Gallery File:Alexander close up.JPGClose up of Alexander. File:Darius close up.JPGClose up of Darius.

It is a cross of Petit Bouschet (itself a cross of the very old variety Teinturier du Cher and Aramon) and Grenache.Alicante Henri Bouschet , Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed on June 26, 2010 Alicante is a teinturier, a grape with red flesh. It is one of the few teinturier grapes that belong to the Vitis vinifera species. Its deep colour makes it useful for blending with light red wine. It was planted heavily during Prohibition in California for export to the East Coast. Its thick skin made it resistant to rot during the transportation process. The intense red color was also helpful for stretching the wine during prohibition, as it could be diluted without detracting from the appearance. At the turn of the 21st century, Alicante Bouschet was the 12th most planted red wine grape in France with sizable plantings in the Languedoc, Provence and Cognac regions.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 13 Oxford University Press 2006 In 1958, Alicante Bouschet covered 24,168 hectares (mainly across southern France); by 2011, plantings represented less than 4,000 hectares. This scenario is largely reversed in other regions of Europe, and in southern Portugal, where its wines are highly prized and frequently outscore traditional autochthonous varieties. History and breeding The grape was first cultivated in France in 1866 by Henri Bouschet as a cross of Petit Bouschet and Grenache. The Petit Bouschet grape was created by his father Louis Bouschet. The result was to produce a grape with deep color and of higher quality than the Teinturier du Cher. Several varieties of Alicante Bouschet were produced of varying quality. The grape's high yields and easy maintenance encouraged its popularity among French wine growers, especially in the years following the Phylloxera epidemic. By the end of the 19th century there were Alicante Bouschet plantings in Bordeaux, Burgundy, Loire Valley and Alentejo, Portugal The grape was widely popular in the United States during the years of Prohibition. Grape growers in California's Central Valley found that its pulp was so fleshy and juicy that fermentable juice could be retrieved even after the third pressing. In contrast, wines made from grapes like Chardonnay and Merlot typically only include the juice from the free run (before pressing) and first or second pressing. The grape's thick skin also meant that it could survive the long railway transportation from California to New York City's Pennsylvania Station which had auction rooms where the grapes were sold. The superior transportability of this variety was significant because of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service on July 25, 1920 in connection with original wording in the Volstead Act, which allowed up to 200 gallons of home-made wine per year, per household, for consumption in the home only. In 1928, one single auction lot of 225 carloads of grapes were purchased by a single buyer. The amount of grapes was enough to make more than of wine. Wine regions In Portugal's Alentejo region, Alicante Bouschet is often made into a varietal wine. In France, the grape was historically a blending partner with Aramon but in recent times has been made more into its own varietal. However, planting of new vines has steadily declined. In some areas of France the grape is now extinct. According to international wine guru and Master of Wine, Jancis Robinson, Alicante Bouschet is thought to have found its true home in Portugal's Alentejo where it was first planted at Herdade do Mouch√£o in the late 1800s. Widely planted across the Alentejo wine region today (having grown exponentially in popularity from the late 1990s) it is frequently expensive, surpassing the quality and personality of other noble varieties. These top-end wines are prized for their 'size', dense colour and phenolic content. In Chile the grape is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and to make concentrated varietal wines. In California the grape was popular among home winemakers during Prohibition and still grown today in Napa, Sonoma and Madera counties. Other areas with notable Alicante Bouschet plantings include Algeria, Israel and parts of central and southern Italy.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 35 Harcourt Books 2001 In Spain Alicante Bouschet is called garnacha tintorera or negral and it is the fifth most planted red grape variety in with 22,572 ha (55,776 acres) grown in 2015. Viticulture and wine A red wine from the Alentejo that is a blend of several Portuguese grape varieties including Aragonez (Tinta Roriz/Tempranillo), Alicante Bouschet and Alfrocheiro. Recognised by many today as a noble red variety (particularly in southern Iberia), Alicante Bouschet is known for its deep dark color, more than 15 times the color of Aramon and twice the darkness of the Grand Noir de la Calmette. Under specific conditions, the grape can produce high yields of up to 80 hl/ha. It buds and ripens early-to-mid season to produce wines high in alcohol, particularly where jamminess is valued and extended 'hang-time' is practiced. The wines tend to be short on primary aromas and can lack character and complexity when young. Alicante Bouschet performs best under specific conditions and where tertiary aromas are allowed to predominate through ageing. The grape vine is thought to be prone to grape diseases like anthracnose, downy mildew and occasionally bunch rots in rare instances where bunches are tight at harvest.J.

The common eider (pronounced ) (Somateria mollissima), also called St. Cuthbert's duck or Cuddy's duck, is a large ( in body length) sea- duck that is distributed over the northern coasts of Europe, North America and eastern Siberia. It breeds in Arctic and some northern temperate regions, but winters somewhat farther south in temperate zones, when it can form large flocks on coastal waters. It can fly at speeds up to . The eider's nest is built close to the sea and is lined with eiderdown, plucked from the female's breast. This soft and warm lining has long been harvested for filling pillows and quilts, but in more recent years has been largely replaced by down from domestic farm-geese and synthetic alternatives. Although eiderdown pillows or quilts are now a rarity, eiderdown harvesting continues and is sustainable, as it can be done after the ducklings leave the nest with no harm to the birds.

It is characterized by its bulky shape and large, wedge-shaped bill. The male is unmistakable, with its black and white plumage and green nape. The female is a brown bird, but can still be readily distinguished from all ducks, except other eider species, on the basis of size and head shape. The drake's display call is a strange almost human-like \\"ah-ooo,\\" while the hen utters hoarse quacks. The species is often readily approachable. Drakes of the European, eastern North American and Asia/western North American races can be distinguished by minor differences in plumage and bill colour. Some authorities place the subspecies v-nigra as a separate species. This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. The eider will eat mussels by swallowing them whole; the shells are then crushed in their gizzard and excreted. When eating a crab, the eider will remove all of its claws and legs, and then eat the body in a similar fashion. It is abundant, with populations of about 1.5‚Äì2 million birds in both North America and Europe, and also large but unknown numbers in eastern Siberia (HBW). A particularly famous colony of eiders lives on the Farne Islands in Northumberland, England. These birds were the subject of one of the first ever bird protection laws, established by Saint Cuthbert in the year 676. About 1,000 pairs still nest there every year. Because St. Cuthbert is the patron saint of Northumberland, it was natural that the eider should be chosen as the county's emblem bird; the birds are still often called Cuddy's ducks in the area, \\"Cuddy\\" being the familiar form of \\"Cuthbert\\". In Canada's Hudson Bay, important eider die-offs were observed in the 1990s by local populations due to quickly changing ice flow patterns. The Canadian Wildlife Service has spent several years gathering up-to-date information on their populations, and preliminary results seem to show a population recovery. The common eider is the object of the 2011 documentary People of a Feather, which studies the historical relationship between the Sanikiluaq community and eiders, as well as various aspects of their ecology. The common eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Social behaviour Eiders are colonial breeders. They nest on coastal islands in colonies ranging in size of less than 100 to upwards of 10,000-15,000 individuals. Female eiders frequently exhibit a high degree of natal philopatry, where they return to breed on the same island where they were hatched. This can lead to a high degree of relatedness between individuals nesting on the same island, as well as the development of kin-based female social structures. This relatedness has likely played a role in the evolution of co-operative breeding behaviours amongst eiders. Examples of these behaviours include laying eggs in the nests of related individuals and cr√®ching, where female eiders team up and share the work of rearing ducklings.

He has written many works, from poetry to stage plays. He began his works in 1970, writing books of poetry. This Canadian poet, who was born in Steinbach, Manitoba, studied at the University of Manitoba. While there, he received a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree and a teaching certificate. After being a resident of Winnipeg for thirty years, Friesen now lives in Victoria, BC and is a teacher of creative writing at the University of Victoria. Friesen often collaborates with dancers, choreographers, composers and musicians. Along with writing poetry, he also writes songs for musicians and texts to Improv Piano. Friesen grew up in a small religious community, and comes from a Mennonite background, but he broke away from that small community physically and spiritually at a young age. His Mennonite upbringing still influences his work such as, ‚ÄúThe Shunning,‚Äù which is about the persecution of a Mennonite farmer questioning his religion. The winner of Manitoba Book of the Year for his work on ‚ÄúBlasphemer‚Äôs Wheel,\\" Friesen was also the runner up in Milton Acorn‚Äôs People‚Äôs Poetry Awards. In a 2004 interview Friesen has noted that, ‚ÄúBeing Mennonite in background had all kinds of effects on [his] content.‚Äù In 1997, his work, ‚ÄúA Broken Bowl,‚Äù was short listed for the Governor General‚Äôs Award. Friesen collaborated with Per Brask on the translation from Danish of Ulrikka S. Gernes' Frayed Opus for Strings & Wind Instruments, which has been shortlisted for the 2016 Griffin Poetry Prize.

They were joined at the head and died immediately after their complicated surgical separation. Coincidentally, the twins were born 100 years to the day of the deaths of Chang and Eng Bunker, also conjoined twins, famously known as the \\"original\\" Siamese twins.  Biography  They were born in Firuzabad, a city in southwest Iran, to Dadollah Bijani and Maryam Safari, members of a farming family from the nearby Lohrasb village. The Bijani sisters were lost in a hospital in 1979 after the doctors responsible for them had to suddenly leave for the United States during the revolution in Iran. The Bijanis' parents did not find the sisters again until several years later in the city of Karaj near Tehran, where Dr. Alireza Safaian had adopted them. While in his custody, Safaian attempted to protect them by ostracizing them from the world as best as he could. In 1996, after years of searching, the girls biological parents finally tracked them down and made contact. Now in their early twenties, the twins lived on their own in an apartment while attending law school. Ladan wanted to be a lawyer, while Laleh wished to become a journalist; in the end, they settled on Ladan's choice. They studied law for four years at Tehran University. Most other personal decisions also had to meet each other's approval. For these and other reasons, they had wanted to be separated since they were children. Laleh hoped that she could then move to Tehran, the capital city of Iran, to study journalism, while Ladan wanted to continue with graduate studies in law and then move to Shiraz. In addition, the sisters had different hobbies. While Laleh liked to, among other things, play computer games, Ladan preferred computer programming. Ladan also described Laleh as more introverted and herself quite talkative.  Separation  In 1996, they traveled to Germany, trying to convince doctors there to separate them; the German doctors however declined to operate, saying that the risk of separation surgery would be too high for both of them. In November 2002, after meeting Dr. Keith Goh, the Bijani sisters travelled to Singapore to undergo the controversial operation. Even though they were warned by the doctors that the surgery to separate them would still be very risky, the sisters were very determined. Their decision to go ahead with the operation caused an international media blitz. After eight months in Singapore, doing extensive psychiatric and legal evaluations, they underwent surgery on July 6, 2003, under the care of a large team of international specialists at Raffles Hospital, composed of 28 surgeons and more than 100 support staff working in shifts. A specially-designed chair was required that allowed the operation to be performed with both sisters in a sitting position. The attempt to separate the twins turned out to be very difficult, because their brains not only shared a major vein (the superior sagittal sinus), but had fused together. The separation was achieved on July 8, 2003, but it was announced then that the twins were in critical condition, both having lost a large volume of blood due to complications of the operation. The separation stage of the surgery was completed at 13:30 (Singapore time, UTC +8), but there was significant blood loss during the blood vessel repairing process, and Ladan died at around 14:30 on the operating table; her sister Laleh died 90 minutes later. Their deaths were announced by the chairman of Raffles Hospital, Dr. Loo Choon Yong.  Burials  The sisters were buried in accordance to Shiite Muslim traditions in separate tombs, side by side, in Lohrasb. The sisters willed their property to blind and orphaned children. A documentary about the operation was broadcast soon after. Later, people named January 17 as Hope's day.

Between 2002 and 2007, Luo was one of China's top leaders, serving as a member of the nine- man Politburo Standing Committee, and as the Secretary of Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei), which became one of China's most powerful political offices, and well-funded bureaucracies, during Luo's term. In his Zhengfawei role, Luo held oversight for many law-enforcement institutions, including the police, public security officers, armed police, labor camps, prisons, and the judicial system. Luo retired from politics in 2007. Early career Luo Gan was born in Jinan, Shandong province. In 1953, he began studying engineering at the Beijing Steel and Iron Institute. A year later, he was selected as part of a Chinese contingent to go study at Karl Marx University in Leipzig, East Germany where he studied German language. He interned at the Leipzig steel and metalworks plant. He then continued studying machine works at Technische Universit√§t Bergakademie Freiberg. Luo joined the Communist Party of China in 1960, while still in Germany. It was said that Luo had stellar grades and won the Agricola prize for academic achievement while studying in Germany. Upon returning to China, Luo continued to work in the steel industry, first being sent to the First Ministry of Machine-Building, a state-run department in charge of machines, telecommunications, and shipbuilding. There he worked as a technician and project leader in its mechanics department. As a technical specialist, Luo, like many others in his field, were displaced from their posts during much of the Cultural Revolution, and sent to perform manual labour at a May 7 Cadre School. In 1970, Luo returned to work in Henan province, working for a government machine-building project in Luohe, then transferred to Zhengzhou. Rise to power In October 1978, as part of a nationwide reshuffle following the demise of the Gang of Four, former First Machine-Building minister Duan Junyi took on the post of party chief of central Henan Province. While in Henan, Duan was eager to promote his former associates, including Luo Gan. In 1980, Luo was made head of the provincial science and technology commission, and also a leader in the provincial trade office. A year later, Luo was made Vice Governor of Henan. In 1983, Luo was sent to Beijing and became deputy chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the state-sponsored trade union group. As a major leader of the ACFTU, Luo was in charge of the day-to-day management of the organization. As a result of his tenure in the union, Luo was made Minister of Labour in March 1988. In December 1988, Luo took over duties of the Secretary- General of the State Council as a result of the illness of his predecessor Chen Junsheng.Profile of Luo Gan , Xinhua. During his term as a minister, Luo had developed a close relationship with Li Peng came to be considered one of Li's prot√©g√©s. Luo was appointed a State Councilor, a position with equivalent rank but slightly lesser responsibility compared as a Vice-Premier, in 1993. He served in the position until 2003. In September 1997 at the 15th Party Congress, Luo advanced further, being named a Secretary of the Central Secretariat, the Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei), and a member of the 15th Politburo of the Communist Party of China, joining the inner sanctum of party leaders. Luo oversaw a diverse portfolio with jurisdiction over law enforcement and internal security, as well as \\"comprehensive social management\\", a nebulous new phrase that essentially meant asserting control and preventing organized protests and social disturbances; as part of his responsibilities, he was tasked by Jiang Zemin to head the 610 Office, an extrajudicial organ established to suppress the spiritual group Falun Gong. As a result of his role, Luo faced heavy criticism from Falun Gong adherents. Standing Committee Luo entered the Politburo Standing Committee in 2002, at the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China at the age of 67. The Standing Committee was expanded from seven members to nine in 2002, some say as a result of then-Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin attempting to stack the body with his supporters. Luo, then branded by overseas media as an associate of Li Peng, became a major beneficiary of this increase in membership. That he held a seat on the nation's highest ruling council, coupled with the relative weakness of the new party General Secretary Hu Jintao, as well as the general focus placed by the Communist Party on internal security and combating dissent to party authority, vastly increased the power of the Zhengfawei portfolio. Regarded as the \\"security chief\\" of the country, Luo implemented the \\"strike hard\\" anti-crime campaign, increasing the harshness of sentences; some suggest that this policy led to increased executions; it was said that Luo had personally directed the suppression of illegal organisations and protests such as that at the Pubugou Dam protest in 2004. Luo's term as Zhengfawei chief was also characterized by proponents of the Weiquan movement as having further solidified party control over legal and judicial affairs, and thus impeding progress on human rights and legal freedoms. During his tenure, Luo was seen to have warned party officials to rein in judicial independence and but also pay heed to the international implications of legal activities in China, while also expanding \\"rule by law\\". Luo retired from public life at the age of 72, after the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. By 2007, rules related to mandated retirement age have been largely entrenched within the Communist Party hierarchy. Luo, as the oldest member of the Standing Committee by that time, naturally must retire. His Zhengfawei portfolio was then inherited by Zhou Yongkang, a former oil baron who went on to oversee an even greater expansion of powers of the portfolio. Zhou was eventually convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to prison. Luo largely disappeared from the public eye following his retirement in 2007. In 2015, the Chinese authorities published Luo Gan on Law and Politics Work in China (), a compilation of Luo's thoughts on law enforcement work during his tenure. Luo also made a public appearance at the 2015 China Victory Day Parade.

The most prominent member of this group is Claviceps purpurea (\\"rye ergot fungus\\"). This fungus grows on rye and related plants, and produces alkaloids that can cause ergotism in humans and other mammals who consume grains contaminated with its fruiting structure (called ergot sclerotium).ergot , online medical dictionaryergot , Dorland's Medical Dictionary Claviceps includes about 50 known species, mostly in the tropical regions. Economically significant species include C. purpurea (parasitic on grasses and cereals), C. fusiformis (on pearl millet, buffel grass), C. paspali (on dallis grass), C. africana (on sorghum), and C. lutea (on paspalum). C. purpurea most commonly affects outcrossing species such as rye (its most common host), as well as triticale, wheat, and barley. It affects oats only rarely. C. purpurea has at least three races or varieties, which differ in their host specificity: *G1 -- land grasses of open meadows and fields; *G2 -- grasses from moist, forest, and mountain habitats; *G3 (C. purpurea var. spartinae) -- salt marsh grasses (Spartina, Distichlis). Life cycle An ergot kernel, called a sclerotium, develops when a spore of fungal species of the genus Claviceps infects a floret of flowering grass or cereal. The infection process mimics a pollen grain growing into an ovary during fertilization. Infection requires that the fungal spore have access to the stigma; consequently, plants infected by Claviceps are mainly outcrossing species with open flowers, such as rye (Secale cereale) and ryegrasses (genus Lolium). The proliferating fungal mycelium then destroys the plant ovary and connects with the vascular bundle originally intended for seed nutrition. The first stage of ergot infection manifests itself as a white soft tissue (known as sphacelia) producing sugary honeydew, which often drops out of the infected grass florets. This honeydew contains millions of asexual spores (conidia), which insects disperse to other florets. Later, the sphacelia convert into a hard dry sclerotium inside the husk of the floret. At this stage, alkaloids and lipids accumulate in the sclerotium. Claviceps species from tropic and subtropic regions produce macro- and microconidia in their honeydew. Macroconidia differ in shape and size between the species, whereas microconidia are rather uniform, oval to globose (5x3Œºm). Macroconidia are able to produce secondary conidia. A germ tube emerges from a macroconidium through the surface of a honeydew drop and a secondary conidium of an oval to pearlike shape is formed, to which the contents of the original macroconidium migrates. Secondary conidia form a white, frost-like surface on honeydew drops and spread via the wind. No such process occurs in Claviceps purpurea, Claviceps grohii, Claviceps nigricans, and Claviceps zizaniae, all from northern temperate regions. When a mature sclerotium drops to the ground, the fungus remains dormant until proper conditions (such as the onset of spring or a rain period) trigger its fruiting phase. It germinates, forming one or several fruiting bodies with heads and stipes, variously coloured (resembling a tiny mushroom). In the head, threadlike sexual spores form, which are ejected simultaneously when suitable grass hosts are flowering. Ergot infection causes a reduction in the yield and quality of grain and hay, and if livestock eat infected grain or hay it may cause a disease called ergotism. Black and protruding sclerotia of C. purpurea are well known. However, many tropical ergots have brown or greyish sclerotia, mimicking the shape of the host seed. For this reason, the infection is often overlooked. Insects, including flies and moths, carry conidia of Claviceps species, but it is unknown whether insects play a role in spreading the fungus from infected to healthy plants. Evolution The evolution of plant parasitism in the Clavicipitaceae dates back at least 100 million years, to the early-mid Cretaceous. An amber fossil discovered in 2014 preserves a grass spikelet and an ergot-like parasitic fungus. The fossil shows that the original hosts of the Clavicipitaceae could have been grasses. The discovery also establishes a minimum time for the conceivable presence of psychotropic compounds in fungi. Several evolutionary processes have acted to diversify the array of ergot alkaloids produced by fungi; these differences in enzyme activities are evident at the levels of substrate specificity (LpsA), product specification (EasA, CloA) or both (EasG and possibly CloA). The ‚Äúold yellow enzyme,‚Äù EasA, presents an outstanding example. This enzyme catalyzes reduction of the C8=C9 double-bond in chanoclavine I, but EasA isoforms differ in whether they subsequently catalyze reoxidation of C8‚ÄìC9 after rotation. This difference distinguishes most Clavicipitaceae from Trichocomaceae, but in Clavicipitaceae it is also the key difference dividing the branch of classical ergot alkaloids from dihydroergot alkaloids, the latter often being preferred for pharmaceuticals due to their relatively few side effects. Effects on humans, other mammals and LSD Ergot-derived drug to stop postpartum bleeding The ergot sclerotium contains high concentrations (up to 2% of dry mass) of the alkaloid ergotamine, a complex molecule consisting of a tripeptide-derived cyclol-lactam ring connected via amide linkage to a lysergic acid (ergoline) moiety, and other alkaloids of the ergoline group that are biosynthesized by the fungus. Ergot alkaloids have a wide range of biological activities including effects on circulation and neurotransmission. Ergot alkaloids are classified as: # derivatives of 6,8-dimethylergoline and # lysergic acid derivatives.Pharmacognosy of Ergot Ergotism is the name for sometimes severe pathological syndromes affecting humans or other animals that have ingested plant material containing ergot alkaloid, such as ergot-contaminated grains. The Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony, an order of monks established in 1095, specialized in treating ergotism victims with balms containing tranquilizing and circulation-stimulating plant extracts. The common name for ergotism is \\"St. Anthony's Fire\\", in reference to this order of monks and the severe burning sensations in the limbs which was one of the symptoms. There are two types of ergotism, the first is characterized by muscle spasms, fever and hallucinations and the victims may appear dazed, be unable to speak, become manic, or have other forms of paralysis or tremors, and suffer from hallucinations and other distorted perceptions. This is caused by serotonergic stimulation of the central nervous system by some of the alkaloids. The second type of ergotism is marked by violent burning, absent peripheral pulses and shooting pain of the poorly vascularized distal organs, such as the fingers and toes, and are caused by effects of ergot alkaloids on the vascular system due to vasoconstriction, sometimes leading to gangrene and loss of limbs due to severely restricted blood circulation. The neurotropic activities of the ergot alkaloids may also cause hallucinations and attendant irrational behaviour, convulsions, and even death. Other symptoms include strong uterine contractions, nausea, seizures, high fever, vomiting, loss of muscle strength and unconsciousness. Since the Middle Ages, controlled doses of ergot were used to induce abortions and to stop maternal bleeding after childbirth. Klotz offers a detailed overview of the toxicities in mammalian livestock, stating that the activities are attributable to antagonism or agonism of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. As well, he shares that the adrenergic blockage by ergopeptines (e.g., ergovaline or ergotamine) leads to potent and long-term vasoconstriction, and can result in reduced blood flow resulting in intense burning pain (St. Anthony‚Äôs fire), edema, cyanosis, dry gangrene and even loss of hooves in cattle or limbs in humans. Reduced prolactin due to ergot alkaloid activity on dopamine receptors in the pituitary is also common in livestock. Reduced serum prolactin is associated with various reproductive problems in cattle, and especially in horses, including agalactia and poor conception, and late-term losses of foals and sometimes mares due to dystocia and thickened placentas. Although both gangrenous and convulsive symptoms are seen in naturally occurring ergotism resulting from the ingestion of fungus infected rye, only gangrenous ergotism has been reported following the excessive ingestion of ergotamine tartrate. Ergot extract has been used in pharmaceutical preparations, including ergot alkaloids in products such as Cafergot (containing caffeine and ergotamine or ergoline) to treat migraine headaches, and ergometrine, used to induce uterine contractions and to control bleeding after childbirth. Clinical ergotism as seen today results almost exclusively from the excessive intake of ergotamine tartrate in the treatment of migraine headache. In addition to ergot alkaloids, Claviceps paspali also produces tremorgens (paspalitrem) causing \\"paspalum staggers\\" in cattle. The fungi of the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus also produce ergot alkaloids, notably some isolates of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, and have been isolated from plants in the family Convolvulaceae, of which morning glory is best known. The causative agents of most ergot poisonings are the ergot alkaloid class of fungal metabolites, though some ergot fungi produce distantly related indole- diterpene alkaloids that are tremorgenic. Ergot does not contain lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) but instead contains lysergic acid as well as its precursor, ergotamine. Lysergic acid is a precursor for the synthesis of LSD. Their realized and hypothesized medicinal uses have encouraged intensive research since the 1950s culminating on the one hand in development of drugs both legal (e.g., bromocriptine) and illegal (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide= LSD), and on the other hand in extensive knowledge of the enzymes, genetics, and diversity of ergot alkaloid biosynthetic pathways. The January 4, 2007 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine includes a paper that documents a British study of more than 11,000 Parkinson's disease patients. The study found that two ergot-derived drugs, pergolide and cabergoline, commonly used to treat Parkinson's Disease may increase the risk of leaky heart valves by up to 700%. History Ergot on wheat heads Ergotism is the earliest recorded example of mycotoxicosis, or poisoning caused by toxic molds. Early references to ergot poisoning (ergotism) date back as far as 600 BC, an Assyrian tablet referred to it as a 'noxious pustule in the ear of grain'. In 350 BC, the Parsees described 'noxious grasses that cause pregnant women to drop the womb and die in childbed'. In ancient Syria, ergot was called 'Daughter of Blood'. Radulf Glaber described an ailment he called 'hidden fire' or ignus ocultus, in which a burning of the limb is followed by its separation from the body, often consuming the victim in one night. In 1588, Johannes Thallius wrote that it is called 'Mother of Rye', or rockenmutter, and is used to halt bleeding. Human poisoning due to the consumption of rye bread made from ergot-infected grain was common in Europe in the Middle Ages. The first mention of a plague of gangrenous ergotism in Europe comes from Germany in 857, following this France and Scandinavia experienced similar outbreaks; England is noticeably absent from the historical regions affected by ergotism as their main source of food was wheat, which is resistant to ergot fungi. In 944, a massive outbreak of ergotism caused 40,000 deaths in the regions of Aquitaine, Limousin, Perigord, and Angoumois in France. In Hesse in 1596, Wendelin Thelius was one of the first to attribute ergotism poisoning to grain. In 1778, S. Tessier, observing a huge epidemic in Sologne, France in which more than 8,000 people died, recommended drainage of fields, compulsory cleaning of grain, and the substitution of potatoes for affected grain. =Saint Anthony's fire and the Antonites= In 1722, the Russian Tzar Peter the Great was thwarted in his campaign against the Ottoman Empire as his army, traveling down the Terek steppe, were struck by ergotism and were forced to retreat in order to find edible grains. A diary entry from the time describes that as soon as people ate the poisoned bread they became dizzy, with such strong nerve contractions that those who did not die from the first day found their hands and feet falling off, akin to frostbite. The epidemic was known as Saint Anthony's fire, or ignis sacer, and some historical events, such as the Great Fear in France during the French Revolution have been linked to ergot poisoning.Matossian, Mary Kilbourne, Poisons of the Past: Molds, Epidemics, and History. New Haven: Yale, 1989 (reedited in 1991) Saint Anthony was a 3rd Century Egyptian ascetic who lived by the Red Sea and was known for long fasting in which he confronted terrible visions and temptations sent from the Devil. He was credited by two noblemen for assisting them in recovery from the disease; they subsequently founded the Order of St. Anthony in honor of him. Anthony was a popular subject for art in the Middle Ages and his symbol is a large blue \\"T\\" sewn onto the shoulder of the order's monks, symbolizing the crutch used by the ill and injured. The Order of St. Anthony, who were also known as Antonites, grew quickly and hospitals spread through France, Germany, and Scandinavia and gained wealth and power as grateful patrons bestowed money and charitable goods to the hospitals. By the end of the Middle Ages, there were 396 settlements and 372 hospitals owned by the order and pilgrimages to such hospitals became popular as well as the donation of limbs lost to ergotism, which were displayed near shrines to the saint. These hagiotherapeutic centers were the first specialized European medical welfare systems and the friars of the order were knowledgeable about treatment of ergotism and the horrifying effects of the poison. The sufferers would receive ergot-free meals, wines containing vasodilating and analgesic herbs, and applications of Antonites-balsalm, which was the first transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) in medical history. Their medical recipes have been lost to time, though some recorded treatments still remain. After 1130 AD, the monks were no longer permitted to perform operations, and so barber surgeons were employed to remove gangrenous limbs and treat open sores. Three barbers founded a hospital in Memmingen in 1214 and accepted those who were afflicted with the gangrenous form of ergotism. Patients were fed and housed with the more able- bodied individuals acting as orderlies and assistants. Patients with the convulsive form of ergotism, or ergotismus convulsivus, were welcomed for only nine days before they were asked to leave as convulsive ergotism was seen as less detrimental. Though the sufferers often experienced irreversible effects, they most often returned to their families and resumed their livelihoods. An important aspect to the Order of St. Anthony's treatment practices was the exclusion of rye bread and other ergot-containing edibles, which halted the progression of ergotism. There was no known cure for ergotism itself, however there was treatment of the symptoms, which often included blood constriction, nervous disorder, and/or hallucinations; if the sufferer survived the initial poisoning, his limbs would often fall off and he or she would continue to improve in health if they halted consumption of ergot. The trunk of the body remained relatively untouched by the disease until its final stages and the victims, not understanding the cause of their ailment, would continue to imbibe ergot-laden food for weeks until the condition reached their digestive system. It is believed that the peasantry and children were most susceptible to ergotism, though the wealthy were afflicted as well, as at times entire villages relied on tainted crops for sustenance and during times of famine, ergotism reached into every house. Ergot fungus is impervious to heat and water, thus it was most often baked into bread through rye flour; though other grasses can be infected, it was uncommon in Medieval Europe to consume grasses other than rye. The physiological effects of ergot depended upon the concentration and combinations of the ingested ergot metabolites, as well as the age and nutritional status of the afflicted individual. The Antonites began to decline after physicians discovered the genesis of ergotism and recommended methods for removing the sclerotium from the rye crops. In 1776, the cloisters of the Antonites were incorporated into the Maltese Knights Hospitaller, losing much of their medical histories in the process and losing the ergotism cures and recipes due to lack of use and lack of preservation. =Usage in gynaecology and obstetrics= Midwives and very few doctors in Europe have used extracts from ergot for centuries: # In a N√ºrnberg manuscript of 1474 powdered ergot was prescribed together with Laurel-fruits and rhizomes of Salomon‚Äôs seals to cure ¬ªpermutter¬´ or ¬ªheffmutter¬´, that means pain in the lower abdomen caused by the ¬ªuprising of the womb¬´ Cod.

Camerarius . Frankfurt am Main 1586, Blatt 109v, (Digitalisat) To prove, that ergot is a harmless sort of grain, in 1774 the French pharmacist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier edited a letter, he had received from Madame Dupile, a midwife of Chaumont-en-Vexin. She had told him, that if uterine contractions were too weak in the expulsion stage of childbirth she and her mother gave peeled ergot in an amount of the filling of a thimble solved in water, wine or broth. The administration of ergot was followed by a mild childbirth within 15 minutes.Journal de Physique, 1774, S. 144‚Äì155 (Digitalisat) The French physician Jean-Baptiste Desgranges (1751‚Äì1831) published in 1818, that in 1777 he had met midwives in Lyon, who successfully treated feeble uterine contractions by administering the powder of ergot. Desgranges joined this remedy into his therapeutic arsenal. From 1777 to 1804 he was successful in alleviating childbirth for more than twenty women by the administration of the powder of ergot. He never saw any side- effect of this treatment.Jean-Baptiste Desgranges (1751‚Äì1831).

The Dispensatory of the United States of America, third edition Philadelphia 1836, p. 588 (Digitalisat) In 1837 the French Codex Pharmacopee Francaise required ergot to be kept in all pharmacies.Codex, pharmacop√©e fran√ßaise 1837, p. 215 : Poudre de seigle ergot√© (Digitalisat) Low to very low evidence from clinical trials suggests that prophylactic use of ergot alkaloids, administered by intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) in the third stage of labor, may reduce blood loss and may reduce the risk of moderate to severe hemorrhage following delivery, however this medication may also be associated with higher blood pressure and higher pain. It is not clear of oral ergo alkaloids are beneficial or harmful as they have not been well studied. A 2018 Cochrane Systematic Review concluded that other medications such as oxytocin, syntometrine and prostaglandins, may be preferred over ergot alkaloids. Though ergot was known to cause abortions in cattle and humans, it was not a recognized use for it as abortion was illegal in most countries, thus evidence for its use in abortion is unknown. Most often, ergot was used to speed the process of parturition or delivery, and was not used for the purpose of halting postpartum bleeding, which is a concern of childbirth. However, until anesthesia became available, there was no antidote or way of controlling the effects of ergot. So if the fetus did not move as expected, the drug could cause the uterus to mold itself around the child, rupturing the uterus and killing the child. David Hosack, an American physician, noted the large number of stillbirths resulting from ergot use and stated that rather than pulvis ad partum, it should be called pulvis ad mortem. He began advocating for its use to halt postpartum bleeding. Eventually, doctors determined that the use of ergot in childbirth without an antidote was too dangerous. They ultimately restricted its use to expelling the placenta or stopping hemorrhage. Not only did it constrict the uterus, ergot had the ability to increase or decrease blood pressure, induce hypothermia and emesis, and influence pituitary hormone secretions. In 1926, Swiss psychiatrist Hans Maier suggested to use ergotamine for the treatment of vascular headaches of the migraine type. In the 1930s, abortifacient drugs were marketed to women by various companies under various names such as Molex pills and Cote pills. Since birth control devices and abortifacients were illegal to market and sell at the time, they were offered to women who were \\"delayed\\". The recommended dosage was seven grains of ergotin a day. According to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) these pills contained ergotin, aloes, Black Hellebore, and other substances. The efficacy and safety of these pills are unknown. The FTC deemed them unsafe and ineffective and demanded that they cease and desist selling the product. Currently, over a thousand compounds have been derived from ergot ingredients. =Speculated cause of hysterics and hallucinations= It has been posited that Kykeon, the beverage consumed by participants in the ancient Greek Eleusinian Mysteries cult, might have been based on hallucinogens from ergotamine, a precursor to the potent hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and ergonovine. British author John Grigsby contends that the presence of ergot in the stomachs of some of the so-called 'bog-bodies' (Iron Age human remains from peat bogs Northeast Europe, such as the Tollund Man) is indicative of use of Claviceps purpurea in ritual drinks in a prehistoric fertility cult akin to the Greek Eleusinian Mysteries. In his 2005 book Beowulf and Grendel, he argues that the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf is based on a memory of the quelling of this fertility cult by followers of Odin. He writes that Beowulf, which he translates as barley-wolf, suggests a connection to ergot which in German was known as the 'tooth of the wolf'. Linnda R. Caporael posited in 1976 that the hysterical symptoms of young women that had spurred the Salem witch trials had been the result of consuming ergot-tainted rye. However, Nicholas P. Spanos and Jack Gottlieb, after a review of the historical and medical evidence, later disputed her conclusions. Other authors have likewise cast doubt on ergotism as the cause of the Salem witch trials. Claviceps purpurea Mankind has known about Claviceps purpurea for a long time, and its appearance has been linked to extremely cold winters that were followed by rainy summers. The sclerotial stage of C. purpurea conspicuous on the heads of ryes and other such grains is known as ergot. Favorable temperatures for growth are in the range of 18‚Äì30 ¬∞C. Temperatures above 37 ¬∞C cause rapid germination of conidia. Sunlight has a chromogenic effect on the mycelium, with intense coloration. Cereal mashes and sprouted rye are suitable substrates for growth of the fungus in the laboratory. Claviceps africana Claviceps africana infects sorghum. In sorghum and pearl millet, ergot became a problem when growers adopted hybrid technology, which increased host susceptibility. It only infects unfertilized ovaries, so self-pollination and fertilization can decrease the presence of the disease, but male-sterile lines are extremely vulnerable to infection. Symptoms of infection by C. africana include the secretion of honeydew (a fluid with high concentrates of sugar and conidia), which attracts insects like flies, beetles, and wasps that feed on it. This helps spread the fungus to uninfected plants. In Sorghum this honeydew can be spotted coming out of head flowers. A whitish sticky substance can also be observed on leaves and on the ground. C. africana caused ergot disease that caused a famine in 1903-1906 in Northern Cameroon, West Africa, and also occurs in eastern and southern Africa, especially Zimbabwe and South Africa. Male sterile sorghums (also referred to as A-lines) are especially susceptible to infection, as first recognized in the 1960s, and massive losses in seed yield have been noted. Infection is associated with cold night temperatures that are below 12 ¬∞C occurring two to three weeks before flowering. Sorghum ergot caused by Claviceps africana Frederickson, Mantle and De Milliano is widespread in all sorghum growing areas, whereas the species was formerly restricted to Africa and Asia where it was first recorded more than 90 years ago, it has been spreading rapidly and by the mid-1990s it reached Brazil, South Africa, and Australia. By 1997, the disease had spread to most South American countries and the Caribbean including Mexico, and by 1997 had reached Texas in the United States. = Management = Partners of the CABI-led programme, Plantwise including the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock in Zambia have several recommendations for managing the spread of ergot, these include; planting tolerant varieties, disk fields after harvest to prevent sorghum ratoon and volunteer plants from developing, remove any infected plants, and carrying out 3 year crop rotations with legumes.  Claviceps paspali  Claviceps paspali infects wild grasses and could be found on the common grass Paspalum. Like the C. africana, C. paspali also secretes honeydew which is consumed by bees. The bees then create a honey called fic'e (Paraguayan Makai Indian language), which is infused with secretions from the plants and has a pungent aroma. If consumed in high amounts, the honey can cause drunkenness, dizziness and even death. .

A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from the surface; it may discharge from the surface naturally at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology. Typically, groundwater is thought of as water flowing through shallow aquifers, but, in the technical sense, it can also contain soil moisture, permafrost (frozen soil), immobile water in very low permeability bedrock, and deep geothermal or oil formation water. Groundwater is hypothesized to provide lubrication that can possibly influence the movement of faults. It is likely that much of Earth's subsurface contains some water, which may be mixed with other fluids in some instances. Groundwater may not be confined only to Earth. The formation of some of the landforms observed on Mars may have been influenced by groundwater. There is also evidence that liquid water may also exist in the subsurface of Jupiter's moon Europa. Groundwater is often cheaper, more convenient and less vulnerable to pollution than surface water. Therefore, it is commonly used for public water supplies. For example, groundwater provides the largest source of usable water storage in the United States, and California annually withdraws the largest amount of groundwater of all the states.National Geographic Almanac of Geography, 2005, , p. 148. Underground reservoirs contain far more water than the capacity of all surface reservoirs and lakes in the US, including the Great Lakes. Many municipal water supplies are derived solely from groundwater. Polluted groundwater is less visible and more difficult to clean up than pollution in rivers and lakes. Groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land. Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills, excessive fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture, industrial waste lagoons, tailings and process wastewater from mines, industrial fracking, oil field brine pits, leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, sewage sludge and septic systems.  Aquifers  Groundwater withdrawal rates from the Ogallala Aquifer in the Central United States An aquifer is a layer of porous substrate that contains and transmits groundwater. When water can flow directly between the surface and the saturated zone of an aquifer, the aquifer is unconfined. The deeper parts of unconfined aquifers are usually more saturated since gravity causes water to flow downward. The upper level of this saturated layer of an unconfined aquifer is called the water table or phreatic surface. Below the water table, where in general all pore spaces are saturated with water, is the phreatic zone. Substrate with low porosity that permits limited transmission of groundwater is known as an aquitard. An aquiclude is a substrate with porosity that is so low it is virtually impermeable to groundwater. A confined aquifer is an aquifer that is overlain by a relatively impermeable layer of rock or substrate such as an aquiclude or aquitard. If a confined aquifer follows a downward grade from its recharge zone, groundwater can become pressurized as it flows. This can create artesian wells that flow freely without the need of a pump and rise to a higher elevation than the static water table at the above, unconfined, aquifer. The characteristics of aquifers vary with the geology and structure of the substrate and topography in which they occur. In general, the more productive aquifers occur in sedimentary geologic formations. By comparison, weathered and fractured crystalline rocks yield smaller quantities of groundwater in many environments. Unconsolidated to poorly cemented alluvial materials that have accumulated as valley-filling sediments in major river valleys and geologically subsiding structural basins are included among the most productive sources of groundwater. The high specific heat capacity of water and the insulating effect of soil and rock can mitigate the effects of climate and maintain groundwater at a relatively steady temperature. In some places where groundwater temperatures are maintained by this effect at about 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F), groundwater can be used for controlling the temperature inside structures at the surface. For example, during hot weather relatively cool groundwater can be pumped through radiators in a home and then returned to the ground in another well. During cold seasons, because it is relatively warm, the water can be used in the same way as a source of heat for heat pumps that is much more efficient than using air. The volume of groundwater in an aquifer can be estimated by measuring water levels in local wells and by examining geologic records from well-drilling to determine the extent, depth and thickness of water-bearing sediments and rocks. Before an investment is made in production wells, test wells may be drilled to measure the depths at which water is encountered and collect samples of soils, rock and water for laboratory analyses. Pumping tests can be performed in test wells to determine flow characteristics of the aquifer.  Water cycle  Relative groundwater travel times Ukrainian village Groundwater makes up about thirty percent of the world's fresh water supply, which is about 0.76% of the entire world's water, including oceans and permanent ice.Gleick, P. H. (1993). Water in crisis. Pacific Institute for Studies in Dev., Environment & Security. Stockholm Env. Institute, Oxford Univ. Press. 473p, 9. Global groundwater storage is roughly equal to the total amount of freshwater stored in the snow and ice pack, including the north and south poles. This makes it an important resource that can act as a natural storage that can buffer against shortages of surface water, as in during times of drought. Groundwater is naturally replenished by surface water from precipitation, streams, and rivers when this recharge reaches the water table. Groundwater can be a long-term 'reservoir' of the natural water cycle (with residence times from days to millennia), as opposed to short-term water reservoirs like the atmosphere and fresh surface water (which have residence times from minutes to years). The figure:File:Groundwater flow.svg shows how deep groundwater (which is quite distant from the surface recharge) can take a very long time to complete its natural cycle. The Great Artesian Basin in central and eastern Australia is one of the largest confined aquifer systems in the world, extending for almost 2 million km2. By analysing the trace elements in water sourced from deep underground, hydrogeologists have been able to determine that water extracted from these aquifers can be more than 1 million years old. By comparing the age of groundwater obtained from different parts of the Great Artesian Basin, hydrogeologists have found it increases in age across the basin. Where water recharges the aquifers along the Eastern Divide, ages are young. As groundwater flows westward across the continent, it increases in age, with the oldest groundwater occurring in the western parts. This means that in order to have travelled almost 1000 km from the source of recharge in 1 million years, the groundwater flowing through the Great Artesian Basin travels at an average rate of about 1 metre per year. Reflective carpet trapping soil water vapor Recent research has demonstrated that evaporation of groundwater can play a significant role in the local water cycle, especially in arid regions. Scientists in Saudi Arabia have proposed plans to recapture and recycle this evaporative moisture for crop irrigation. In the opposite photo, a 50-centimeter-square reflective carpet, made of small adjacent plastic cones, was placed in a plant-free dry desert area for five months, without rain or irrigation. It managed to capture and condense enough ground vapor to bring to life naturally buried seeds underneath it, with a green area of about 10% of the carpet area. It is expected that, if seeds were put down before placing this carpet, a much wider area would become green.  Issues  = Overview = Certain problems have beset the use of groundwater around the world. Just as river waters have been over-used and polluted in many parts of the world, so too have aquifers. The big difference is that aquifers are out of sight. The other major problem is that water management agencies, when calculating the \\"sustainable yield\\" of aquifer and river water, have often counted the same water twice, once in the aquifer, and once in its connected river. This problem, although understood for centuries, has persisted, partly through inertia within government agencies. In Australia, for example, prior to the statutory reforms initiated by the Council of Australian Governments water reform framework in the 1990s, many Australian states managed groundwater and surface water through separate government agencies, an approach beset by rivalry and poor communication. In general, the time lags inherent in the dynamic response of groundwater to development have been ignored by water management agencies, decades after scientific understanding of the issue was consolidated. In brief, the effects of groundwater overdraft (although undeniably real) may take decades or centuries to manifest themselves. In a classic study in 1982, Bredehoeft and colleagues modeled a situation where groundwater extraction in an intermontane basin withdrew the entire annual recharge, leaving ‚Äònothing‚Äô for the natural groundwater-dependent vegetation community. Even when the borefield was situated close to the vegetation, 30% of the original vegetation demand could still be met by the lag inherent in the system after 100 years. By year 500, this had reduced to 0%, signalling complete death of the groundwater-dependent vegetation. The science has been available to make these calculations for decades; however, in general water management agencies have ignored effects that will appear outside the rough timeframe of political elections (3 to 5 years). Marios Sophocleous argued strongly that management agencies must define and use appropriate timeframes in groundwater planning. This will mean calculating groundwater withdrawal permits based on predicted effects decades, sometimes centuries in the future. As water moves through the landscape, it collects soluble salts, mainly sodium chloride. Where such water enters the atmosphere through evapotranspiration, these salts are left behind. In irrigation districts, poor drainage of soils and surface aquifers can result in water tables' coming to the surface in low- lying areas. Major land degradation problems of soil salinity and waterlogging result, combined with increasing levels of salt in surface waters. As a consequence, major damage has occurred to local economies and environments. Four important effects are worthy of brief mention. First, flood mitigation schemes, intended to protect infrastructure built on floodplains, have had the unintended consequence of reducing aquifer recharge associated with natural flooding. Second, prolonged depletion of groundwater in extensive aquifers can result in land subsidence, with associated infrastructure damage ‚Äì as well as, third, saline intrusion.Zektser et al. Fourth, draining acid sulphate soils, often found in low-lying coastal plains, can result in acidification and pollution of formerly freshwater and estuarine streams. Another cause for concern is that groundwater drawdown from over-allocated aquifers has the potential to cause severe damage to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems ‚Äì in some cases very conspicuously but in others quite imperceptibly because of the extended period over which the damage occurs. = Overdraft = Wetlands contrast the arid landscape around Middle Spring, Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge, Utah Groundwater is a highly useful and often abundant resource. However, over-use, over-abstraction or overdraft, can cause major problems to human users and to the environment. The most evident problem (as far as human groundwater use is concerned) is a lowering of the water table beyond the reach of existing wells. As a consequence, wells must be drilled deeper to reach the groundwater; in some places (e.g., California, Texas, and India) the water table has dropped hundreds of feet because of extensive well pumping. In the Punjab region of India, for example, groundwater levels have dropped 10 meters since 1979, and the rate of depletion is accelerating. A lowered water table may, in turn, cause other problems such as groundwater- related subsidence and saltwater intrusion. Groundwater is also ecologically important. The importance of groundwater to ecosystems is often overlooked, even by freshwater biologists and ecologists. Groundwaters sustain rivers, wetlands, and lakes, as well as subterranean ecosystems within karst or alluvial aquifers. Not all ecosystems need groundwater, of course. Some terrestrial ecosystems ‚Äì for example, those of the open deserts and similar arid environments ‚Äì exist on irregular rainfall and the moisture it delivers to the soil, supplemented by moisture in the air. While there are other terrestrial ecosystems in more hospitable environments where groundwater plays no central role, groundwater is in fact fundamental to many of the world's major ecosystems. Water flows between groundwaters and surface waters. Most rivers, lakes, and wetlands are fed by, and (at other places or times) feed groundwater, to varying degrees. Groundwater feeds soil moisture through percolation, and many terrestrial vegetation communities depend directly on either groundwater or the percolated soil moisture above the aquifer for at least part of each year. Hyporheic zones (the mixing zone of streamwater and groundwater) and riparian zones are examples of ecotones largely or totally dependent on groundwater. =Subsidence= Subsidence occurs when too much water is pumped out from underground, deflating the space below the above- surface, and thus causing the ground to collapse. The result can look like craters on plots of land. This occurs because, in its natural equilibrium state, the hydraulic pressure of groundwater in the pore spaces of the aquifer and the aquitard supports some of the weight of the overlying sediments. When groundwater is removed from aquifers by excessive pumping, pore pressures in the aquifer drop and compression of the aquifer may occur. This compression may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound, but much of it is not. When the aquifer gets compressed, it may cause land subsidence, a drop in the ground surface. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana is actually below sea level today, and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of groundwater from the various aquifer/aquitard systems beneath it. In the first half of the 20th century, the San Joaquin Valley experienced significant subsidence, in some places up to 8.5 metres (28 feet) due to groundwater removal. Cities on river deltas, including Venice in Italy, and Bangkok in Thailand, have experienced surface subsidence; Mexico City, built on a former lake bed, has experienced rates of subsidence of up to 40 cm (1'3\\") per year. = Seawater intrusion = Seawater intrusion is the flow or presence of seawater into coastal aquifers; it is a case of saltwater intrusion. It is a natural phenomenon but can be caused or worsened by anthropogenic factors. In the case of homogeneous aquifers, seawater intrusion forms a saline wedge below a transition zone to fresh groundwater, flowing seward on the top,. = Pollution = Iron (III) oxide staining (after water capillary rise in a wall) caused by oxidation of dissolved iron (II) and its subsequent precipitation, from an unconfined aquifer in karst topography. Perth, Western Australia. Polluted groundwater is less visible, but more difficult to clean up, than pollution in rivers and lakes. Groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land. Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills, industrial waste lagoons, tailings and process wastewater from mines, oil field brine pits, leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, sewage sludge and septic systems. Polluted groundwater is mapped by sampling soils and groundwater near suspected or known sources of pollution, to determine the extent of the pollution, and to aid in the design of groundwater remediation systems. Preventing groundwater pollution near potential sources such as landfills requires lining the bottom of a landfill with watertight materials, collecting any leachate with drains, and keeping rainwater off any potential contaminants, along with regular monitoring of nearby groundwater to verify that contaminants have not leaked into the groundwater. Groundwater pollution, from pollutants released to the ground that can work their way down into groundwater, can create a contaminant plume within an aquifer. Pollution can occur from landfills, naturally occurring arsenic, on-site sanitation systems or other point sources, such as petrol stations with leaking underground storage tanks, or leaking sewers. Movement of water and dispersion within the aquifer spreads the pollutant over a wider area, its advancing boundary often called a plume edge, which can then intersect with groundwater wells or daylight into surface water such as seeps and springs, making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife. Different mechanism have influence on the transport of pollutants, e.g. diffusion, adsorption, precipitation, decay, in the groundwater. The interaction of groundwater contamination with surface waters is analyzed by use of hydrology transport models. The danger of pollution of municipal supplies is minimized by locating wells in areas of deep groundwater and impermeable soils, and careful testing and monitoring of the aquifer and nearby potential pollution sources.  Arsenic and fluoride  Around one- third of the world's population drinks water from groundwater resources. Of this, about 10 percent, approximately 300 million people, obtains water from groundwater resources that are heavily polluted with arsenic or fluoride.Eawag (2015) Geogenic Contamination Handbook ‚Äì Addressing Arsenic and Fluoride in Drinking Water.

In 2016, the research group made its knowledge freely available on the Groundwater Assessment Platform GAP. This offers specialists worldwide the possibility of uploading their own measurement data, visually displaying them and producing risk maps for areas of their choice. GAP also serves as a knowledge-sharing forum for enabling further development of methods for removing toxic substances from water.  Regulations  = United States = In the United States, laws regarding ownership and use of groundwater are generally state laws; however, regulation of groundwater to minimize pollution of groundwater is by both states and the federal-level Environmental Protection Agency. Ownership and use rights to groundwater typically follow one of three main systems: * The Rule of Capture provides each landowner the ability to capture as much groundwater as they can put to a beneficial use, but they are not guaranteed any set amount of water. As a result, well-owners are not liable to other landowners for taking water from beneath their land. State laws or regulations will often define \\"beneficial use\\", and sometimes place other limits, such as disallowing groundwater extraction which causes subsidence on neighboring property. * Limited private ownership rights similar to riparian rights in a surface stream. The amount of groundwater right is based on the size of the surface area where each landowner gets a corresponding amount of the available water. Once adjudicated, the maximum amount of the water right is set, but the right can be decreased if the total amount of available water decreases as is likely during a drought. Landowners may sue others for encroaching upon their groundwater rights, and water pumped for use on the overlying land takes preference over water pumped for use off the land. * In November 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency published the groundwater Rule in the United States Federal Register. The EPA was worried that the groundwater system would be vulnerable to contamination from fecal matter. The point of the rule was to keep microbial pathogens out of public water sources.Ground Water Rule (GWR)  Ground Water Rule  US EPA. Water.epa.gov. Retrieved on 2011-06-09. The 2006 groundwater Rule was an amendment of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act. Other rules in the United States include: * Reasonable Use Rule (American Rule): This rule does not guarantee the landowner a set amount of water, but allows unlimited extraction as long as the result does not unreasonably damage other wells or the aquifer system. Usually this rule gives great weight to historical uses and prevents new uses that interfere with the prior use. * Groundwater scrutiny upon real estate property transactions in the US: In the US, upon commercial real estate property transactions both groundwater and soil are the subjects of scrutiny. For brownfields sites (formerly contaminated sites that have been remediated), Phase I Environmental Site Assessments are typically prepared, to investigate and disclose potential pollution issues.EPA; In the San Fernando Valley of California, real estate contracts for property transfer below the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) and eastward have clauses releasing the seller from liability for groundwater contamination consequences from existing or future pollution of the Valley Aquifer. = India = In India, 65% of the irrigation is from groundwater.PM Launches Rs 6,000 Crore Groundwater Management Plan, NDTV, 25 December 2019. The groundwater regulation is controlled and maintained by the central government and four organizations; 1) Central Water Commission, 2) Central Ground Water, 3) Central Ground Water Authority, 4) Central Pollution Control Board. Laws, regulations and scheme regarding India's groundwater: * 2019 Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal groundwater scheme), a 5 years (2020-21 to 2024-25) scheme costing INR 6 billion (US$854 million) for managing demand side with village panchayat level water security plans, was approved for implementation 8,350 water-stressed villages across 7 states, including Haryana, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.Centre approves Rs 6,000 crore scheme to manage groundwater, Times of India, 24 December 2019. * 2013 National Water Framework Bill ensures that India's groundwater is a public resource, and is not to be exploited by companies through privatization of water. The National Water Framework Bill allows for everyone to access clean drinking water, of the right to clean drinking water under Article 21 of 'Right to Life' in India's Constitution. The bill indicates a want for the states of India to have full control of groundwater contained in aquifers. So far Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana, Maharashtra, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli are the only ones using this bill. * In 2012, National Water Policy was updated, which had previously been launched in 1987 and updated in 2002 and later in 2012. * In 2011, the Indian Government created a Model Bill for Groundwater Management; this model selects which state governments can enforce their laws on groundwater usage and regulation. * 1882 Easement Act gives landowners priority over surface and groundwater that is on their land and allows them to give or take as much as they want as long as the water is on their land. This act prevents the government from enforcing regulations of groundwater, allowing many landowners to privatize their groundwater instead accessing it in community areas. 1882 Easement Act's Section 7(g) states that every landowner has the right to collect within his limits, all water under the land and on its surface which does not pass in a defined channel. = Canada = A significant portion of Canada‚Äôs population relies on the use of groundwater. In Canada, roughly 8.9 million people or 30% of Canada's population rely on groundwater for domestic use and approximately two thirds of these users live in rural areas. * The Constitution Act, 1867, does not give authority over groundwater to either order of Canadian government; therefore, the matter largely falls under provincial jurisdiction * Federal and Provincial governments can share responsibilities when dealing with agriculture, health, inter-provincial waters and national water-related issues. * Federal jurisdiction in areas as boundary/trans-boundary waters, fisheries, navigation, and water on federal lands, First Nations reserves and in Territories. * Federal jurisdiction over groundwater when aquifers cross inter-provincial or international boundaries. A large federal government groundwater initiative is the development of the multi-barrier approach. The multi-barrier approach is a system of processes to prevent the deterioration of drinking water from the source. The multi-barrier consists of three key elements: * Source water protection, * Drinking water treatment, and * Drinking water distribution systems. = Iran = According to The Law of Distribution of Water (5th chapter), these items are crime (punishment :10 to 50 lashes or from 15 days to three months imprisonment): # Person who does well digging for accessing water. # Person who extracts from groundwater.

(EA) is an American video game company headquartered in Redwood City, California. It is the second-largest gaming company in the Americas and Europe by revenue and market capitalization after Activision Blizzard and ahead of Take-Two Interactive, CD Projekt, and Ubisoft as of May 2020.{{cite weburl=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cd-projekt-is- now-europes-most-valuable-game-company-ahead-of-ubisoft/ Founded and incorporated on May 27, 1982, by Apple employee Trip Hawkins, the company was a pioneer of the early home computer game industry and promoted the designers and programmers responsible for its games as \\"software artists\\". EA published numerous games and some productivity software for personal computers, all of which were developed by external individuals or groups until 1987's Skate or Die!. The company shifted toward internal game studios, often through acquisitions, such as Distinctive Software becoming EA Canada in 1991. Currently, EA develops and publishes games of established franchises, including Battlefield, Need for Speed, The Sims, Medal of Honor, Command & Conquer, Dead Space, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Army of Two, Titanfall, and Star Wars, as well as the EA Sports titles FIFA, Madden NFL, NBA Live, NHL, and EA Sports UFC. Their desktop titles appear on self-developed Origin, an online gaming digital distribution platform for PCs and a direct competitor to Valve's Steam and Epic Games' Store. EA also owns and operates major gaming studios such as EA Tiburon in Orlando, EA Vancouver in Burnaby, DICE in Stockholm and Los Angeles, BioWare in Edmonton and Austin, and Respawn Entertainment in Los Angeles. History =Trip Hawkins era: origins, founding, success (1982‚Äì1990)= Electronic Arts' founder, Trip Hawkins, in 2013 Trip Hawkins had been an employee of Apple since 1978, at a time when the company had only about fifty employees. Over the next four years, the market for home personal computers skyrocketed. By 1982, Apple had completed its initial public offering (IPO) and become a Fortune 500 company with over one thousand employees. In February 1982, Trip Hawkins arranged a meeting with Don Valentine of Sequoia Capital to discuss financing his new venture, Amazin' Software. Valentine encouraged Hawkins to leave Apple, where Hawkins served as Director of Product Marketing, and allowed Hawkins use of Sequoia Capital's spare office space to start the company. On May 27, 1982, Trip Hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated . For more than seven months, Hawkins refined his Electronic Arts business plan. With aid from his first employee (with whom he worked in marketing at Apple), Rich Melmon, the original plan was written, mostly by Hawkins, on an Apple II in Sequoia Capital's office in August 1982. During that time, Hawkins also employed two of his former staff from Apple, Dave Evans and Pat Marriott, as producers, and a Stanford MBA classmate, Jeff Burton from Atari for international business development. The business plan was again refined in September and reissued on October 8, 1982. By November, employee headcount rose to 11, including Tim Mott, Bing Gordon, David Maynard, and Steve Hayes. Having outgrown the office space provided by Sequoia Capital, the company relocated to a San Mateo office that overlooked the San Francisco Airport landing path. Headcount rose rapidly in 1983, including Don Daglow and Richard Hilleman. When he incorporated the company, Hawkins originally chose Amazin' Software as their company name, but his other early employees of the company universally disliked the name and it changed its name to Electronic Arts in November 1982. He scheduled an off-site meeting in the Pajaro Dunes, where the company once held such off-site meetings. Hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers, \\"software artists\\". Hence, the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name \\"SoftArt\\". However, Hawkins and Melmon knew the founders of Software Arts, the creators of VisiCalc, and thought their permission should be obtained. Dan Bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar (perhaps \\"confusingly similar\\") to Software Arts. However, the name concept was liked by all the attendees. Hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio United Artists, and liked the reputation that the company had created. Hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleep. Electronic Arts' original corporate logo, designed by Barry Deutsch, 1982‚Äì1999. Hawkins liked the word \\"electronic\\", and various employees had considered the phrases \\"Electronic Artists\\" and \\"Electronic Arts\\". When Gordon and others pushed for \\"Electronic Artists\\", in tribute to the film company United Artists, Steve Hayes opposed, saying, \\"We're not the artists, they [the developers] are...\\" This statement from Hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards Electronic Arts and the name was unanimously endorsed and adopted later in 1982. He recruited his original employees from Apple, Atari, Xerox PARC, and VisiCorp, and got Steve Wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors.Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution By Steven Levy, page 335 Hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers. Combined with the fact that Hawkins was pioneering new game brands, this made sales growth more challenging. Retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners. Former CEO Larry Probst arrived as VP of Sales in late 1984 and helped expand the already successful company. This policy of dealing directly with retailers gave EA higher margins and better market awareness, key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors. A novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of EA's trademarks in its early days. This characterization was even further reinforced with EA's packaging of most of their games in the \\"album cover\\" pioneered by EA because Hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling. EA routinely referred to their developers as \\"artists\\" and gave them photo credits in their games and numerous full-page magazine ads. Their first such ad, accompanied by the slogan \\"We see farther,\\" was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers. EA also shared lavish profits with their developers, which added to their industry appeal. The square \\"album cover\\" boxes (such as the covers for 1983's M.U.L.E. and Pinball Construction Set) were a popular packaging concept by Electronic Arts, which wanted to represent their developers as \\"rock stars\\". In the mid-1980s, Electronic Arts aggressively marketed products for the Amiga, a home computer introduced in 1985. Commodore had given EA development tools and prototype machines before Amiga's actual launch. For Amiga EA published some notable non-game titles. A drawing program Deluxe Paint (1985) and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for Amiga platform. In addition, EA's Jerry Morrison conceived the idea of a file format that could store images, animations, sounds, and documents simultaneously, and would be compatible with third-party software. He wrote and released to the public the Interchange File Format, which would soon become an Amiga standard. Other Amiga programs released by EA included Deluxe Music Construction Set, Instant Music and Deluxe Paint Animation. Some of them, most notably Deluxe Paint, were ported to other platforms. For Macintosh EA released a black & white animation tool called Studio/1, and a series of Paint titles called Studio/8 and Studio/32 (1990). Relationships between Electronic Arts and their external developers often became difficult when the latter missed deadlines or diverged from the former's creative directions. In 1987, EA released Skate or Die!, their first internally developed game. EA would continue publishing their external developers' games while experimenting with their internal development strategy. This led to EA's decision of purchasing out a series of companies they identify as successful, as well as the decision to release annualized franchises to cut budget costs. Because of Trip Hawkins' obsession of simulating a sports game, he signed a contract with football coach John Madden that would lead to EA's developing and releasing annual Madden NFL games. In 1988 EA published a flight simulator game exclusively for Amiga, F/A-18 Interceptor, with filled-polygon graphics that were advanced for the time. Another significant Amiga release (also initially available for Atari ST, later converted for numerous other platforms) was Populous (1989) developed by Bullfrog Productions. It was a pioneering and influential title in the genre that was later called \\"god games\\". =Hawkins stepping down, Larry Probst rising (1990‚Äì1999)= In 1990, Electronic Arts began producing console games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, after previously licensing its computer games to other console-game publishers. A year later, Trip Hawkins stepped down as EA's CEO and was succeeded by Larry Probst to found the now-defunct 3DO Company, while remaining the former company's chair until July 1994. There, once a critic of game consoles, Hawkins conceived a console that unlike its competitors would not require a first-party license to be marketed, and was intended to appeal to the PC market. In October 1993, 3DO developed the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, which at the time was the most powerful game console. Electronic Arts was The 3DO Company's primary partner in sponsoring their console, showcasing on it their latest games. With a retail price of US$700 () compared to its competitors' $100, the console lagged in sales, and with the 1995 arrival to North America of Sony's PlayStation, a cheaper and more powerful alternative, combined with a lower quality of the 3DO's software library as a backfiring of its liberal license policy, it fell further behind and lost competition. Electronic Arts dropped its support for 3DO in favor of the PlayStation, 3DO's production ceased in 1996, and for the remainder of the company's lifetime, 3DO would develop video games for other consoles and the IBM PC until it folded in 2003. In 1995 Electronic Arts won the European Computer Trade Show award for best software publisher of the year. As the company was still expanding, they opted to purchase space in Redwood Shores, California in 1995 for construction of a new headquarters, which was completed in 1998. Early in 1997, Next Generation identified Electronic Arts as the only company to regularly profit from video games over the past five years, and noted it had \\"a critical track record second to none\\". =Continuous expansion and success through the new millennium (1999‚Äì2007)= Headquarters of EA in October 2007. EA is headquartered in the Redwood Shores neighborhood of Redwood City, California. In 1999, EA replaced their long-running Shapes logo with one based on the EA Sports logo used at the time, and Larry Probst took over the reins. EA also started to use a brand-specific structure around this time, with the main publishing side of the company re-branding to EA Games. The EA Sports brand was retained for major sports titles, the new EA Sports Big label would be used for casual sports titles with an arcade twist, and the full Electronic Arts name would be used for co-published and distributed titles. EA began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site Pogo.com in 2001. In 2009, EA acquired the London-based social gaming startup Playfish. In 2004, EA made a multimillion-dollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. On February 1, 2006, Electronic Arts announced that it would cut worldwide staff by 5 percent. On June 20, 2006, EA purchased Mythic Entertainment, who are finished making Warhammer Online. After Sega's ESPN NFL 2K5 successfully grabbed market share away from EA's dominant Madden NFL series during the 2004 holiday season, EA responded by making several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the NFL, and in January 2005, a 15-year deal with ESPN. The ESPN deal gave EA exclusive first rights to all ESPN content for sports simulation games. On April 11, 2005, EA announced a similar, 6-year licensing deal with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) for exclusive rights to college football content. Much of EA's success, both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation, is due to its strategy of platform-agnostic development and the creation of strong multi-year franchises. EA was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises‚ÄîMadden, FIFA, NHL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods, etc.‚Äîwith updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks. Recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers, EA announced in 2006 that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new original intellectual property. In September 2006, Nokia and EA announced a partnership in which EA becomes an exclusive major supplier of mobile games to Nokia mobile devices through the Nokia Content Discoverer. In the beginning, Nokia customers were able to download seven EA titles (Tetris, Tetris Mania, The Sims 2, Doom, FIFA 06, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 and FIFA Street 2) on the holiday season in 2006. Rick Simonson is the executive vice-president and director of Nokia and starting from 2006 is affiliated with John Riccitiello and are partners. =John Riccitiello era (2007‚Äì2013)= In February 2007, Probst stepped down from the CEO job while remaining on the Board of Directors. His handpicked successor is John Riccitiello, who had worked at EA for several years previously, departed for a while, and then returned. Riccitiello previously worked for Elevation Partners, Sara Lee and PepsiCo. In June 2007, new CEO John Riccitiello announced that EA would reorganize itself into four labels, each with responsibility for its own product development and publishing (the city-state model). The goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously, streamline decision-making, increase creativity and quality, and get games into the market faster. This reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by EA of smaller studios, which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of EA titles. In 2008, at the DICE Summit, Riccitiello called the earlier approach of \\"buy and assimilate\\" a mistake, often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent. Riccitiello said that the city-state model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent, and cited Maxis and BioWare as examples of studios thriving under the new structure. Also, in 2007, EA announced that it would be bringing some of its major titles to the Macintosh. EA has released Battlefield 2142, Command & Conquer: Tiberium Wars, Crysis, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Madden NFL 08, Need for Speed: Carbon and Spore for the Mac. All of the new games have been developed for the Macintosh using Cider, a technology developed by TransGaming that enables Intel-based Macs to run Windows games inside a translation layer running on Mac OS X. They are not playable on PowerPC-based Macs. It was revealed in February 2008 that Electronic Arts had made a takeover bid for rival game company Take-Two Interactive. After its initial offer of per share, all cash stock transaction offer was rejected by the Take-Two board, EA revised it to per share, a 64% premium over the previous day's closing price and made the offer known to the public. Rumours had been floating around the Internet prior to the offer about Take-Two possibly being bought over by a bigger company, albeit with Viacom as the potential bidder. In May 2008, EA announced that it will purchase the assets of Hands-On Mobile Korea, a South Korean mobile game developer and publisher. The company will become EA Mobile Korea. In September 2008, EA dropped its buyout offer of Take-Two. No reason was given. As of November 6, 2008, it was confirmed that Electronic Arts is closing their Casual Label & merging it with their Hasbro partnership with The Sims Label. EA also confirmed the departure of Kathy Vrabeck, who was given the position as former president of the EA Casual Division in May 2007. EA made this statement about the merger: \\"We've learned a lot about casual entertainment in the past two years, and found that casual gaming defies a single genre and demographic. With the retirement and departure of Kathy Vrabeck, EA is reorganizing to integrate casual games‚Äîdevelopment and marketing‚Äîinto other divisions of our business. We are merging our Casual Studios, Hasbro partnership, and Casual marketing organization with The Sims Label to be a new Sims and Casual Label, where there is a deep compatibility in the product design, marketing and demographics. [...] In the days and weeks ahead, we will make further announcements on the reporting structure for the other businesses in the Casual Label including EA Mobile, Pogo, Media Sales and Online Casual Initiatives. Those businesses remain growth priorities for EA and deserve strong support in a group that will complement their objectives.\\" This statement comes a week after EA announced it was laying off 6% about 600 of their staff positions and had a net loss for the quarter. Due to the 2008 economic crisis, Electronic Arts had a poorer than expected 2008 holiday season, moving it in February 2009 to cut approximately 1100 jobs, which it said represented about 11% of its workforce. It also closed 12 of their facilities. Riccitiello, in a conference call with reporters, stated that their poor performance in the fourth quarter was not due entirely to the poor economy, but also to the fact that they did not release any blockbuster titles in the quarter. In the quarter ending December 31, 2008, the company lost . As of early May 2009, the subsidiary studio EA Redwood Shores was known as Visceral Games. On June 24, 2009, EA announced it will merge two of its development studios, BioWare and Mythic into one single role-playing video game and MMO development powerhouse. The move will actually place Mythic under control of BioWare as Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk will be in direct control of the new entity. By fall 2012, both Muzyka and Zeschuk had chosen to depart the merged entity in a joint retirement announcement. On November 9, 2009, EA announced layoffs of 1,500 employees, representing 17% of its workforce, across a number of studios including EA Tiburon, Visceral Games, Mythic and EA Black Box. Also affected were \\"projects and support activities\\" that, according to Chief Financial Officer Eric Brown \\"don't make economic sense\\", resulting in the shutdown of popular communities such as Battlefield News and the EA Community Team. These layoffs also led to the complete shutdown of Pandemic Studios. In October 2010, EA announced the acquisition of England- based iPhone and iPad games publisher Chillingo for in cash. Chillingo published the popular Angry Birds for iOS and Cut the Rope for all platforms, but the deal did not include those properties, so Cut the Rope became published by ZeptoLab, and Angry Birds became published by Rovio Entertainment. On May 4, 2011, EA reported $3.8 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending March 2011, and on January 13, 2012, EA announced that it had exceeded $1 billion in digital revenue during the previous calendar year. In a note to employees, EA CEO John Riccitiello called this \\"an incredibly important milestone\\" for the company. In June 2011, EA launched Origin, an online service to sell downloadable games for personal computers directly to consumers. Around this time, Valve, which runs Steam in direct competition with Origin, announced changes to storefront policy disallowing games that used in-game purchases that were not tied to Steam's purchasing process, and removed several of EA's games, including Crysis 2, Dragon Age II, and Alice: Madness Returns in 2012. Though EA released a new packaged version of Crysis 2 that including all the downloadable content without the storefront features, EA would not publish any additional games on Steam until 2019, instead selling all personal computer versions of games through Origin. In July 2011, EA announced that it had acquired PopCap Games, the company behind games such as Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled. EA continued its shift toward digital goods in 2012, folding its mobile-focused EA Interactive (EAi) division \\"into other organizations throughout the company, specifically those divisions led by EA Labels president Frank Gibeau, COO Peter Moore, and CTO Rajat Taneja, and EVP of digital Kristian Segerstrale.\\" =Andrew Wilson era: exclusive partnership with Disney, monetization, expansion (2013‚Äìpresent)= On March 18, 2013, John Riccitiello announced that he would be stepping down as CEO and a member of the Board of Directors on March 30, 2013. Larry Probst was also appointed executive chairman on the same day. Andrew Wilson was named as the new CEO of EA by September 2013. In April 2013, EA announced a reorganization which was to include dismissal of 10% of their workforce, consolidation of marketing functions which were distributed among the five label organizations, and subsumption of Origin operational leadership under the President of Labels. EA acquired the lucrative exclusive license to develop games within the Star Wars universe from Disney in May 2013, shortly after Disney's closure of its internal LucasArts game development in 2013. EA secured its license from 2013 through 2023, and began to assign new Star Wars projects across several of its internal studios, including BioWare, DICE, Visceral Games, Motive Studios, Capital Games and external developer Respawn Entertainment. In April 2015, EA announced that it would be shutting down various free-to-play games in July of that year, including Battlefield Heroes, Battlefield Play4Free, Need for Speed: World, and FIFA World. The reorganization and revised marketing strategy lead to a gradual increase in stock value. In July 2015, Electronic Arts reached an all-time high with a stock value of US$71.63, surpassing the previous February 2005 record of $68.12. This is also up 54% from $46.57 in early January 2015. The surge was partly attributed to EA's then-highly anticipated Star Wars Battlefront reboot, which released one month before Star Wars: The Force Awakens, also highly anticipated. During E3 2015, vice- president of the company, Patrick S√∂derlund, announced that the company will start investing more on smaller titles such as Unravel so as to broaden the company's portfolio. On December 10, 2015, EA announced a new division called Competitive Gaming Division, which focuses on creating competitive game experience and organizing ESports events. It was once headed by Peter Moore. In May 2016, Electronic Arts announced that they had formed a new internal division called Frostbite Labs. The new department specializes in creating new projects for virtual reality platforms, and \\"virtual humans\\". The new department is located in Stockholm and Vancouver. EA announced the closure of Visceral Games in October 2017. Prior, Visceral had been supporting EA's other games but was also working on a Star Wars title named Project Ragtag since EA's acquisition of the Star Wars license, even hiring Amy Hennig to direct the project. While EA did not formally give a reason for the closure, industry pundits believed that EA was concerned about the principally single-player game which would be difficult to monetize, as well as the slow pace of development. EA's original approach to the microtransactions in Star Wars Battlefront II sparked an industry-wide debate on the use of random-content loot boxes. While other games had used loot boxes, EA's original approach within Battlefront II from its early October 2017 launch included using such mechanics for pay to win gameplay elements, as well as locking various Star Wars characters behind expensive paywalls, leading several gaming journalists and players to complain. EA modified some of the costs of these elements in anticipation of the game's full November 2017 launch, but they were reportedly told by Disney to disable all microtransactions until they could come up with a fairer monetization scheme. Ultimately, by March 2018, EA had developed a fairer system that eliminated the pay to win elements and drastically reduced costs for unlocking characters. The controversy over Battlefront II loot boxes led to an 8.5% drop in stock value in one month‚Äîabout $3.1 billion and impacted EA's financial results for the following quarters. Further, the visibility of this controversial led to debate at government levels around the world to determine if loot boxes were a form of gambling and if they should be regulated. In January 2018, EA announced eMLS, a new competitive league for EA Sports' FIFA 18 through its Competitive Gaming Division (CGD) and MLS. That same month, EA teamed up with ESPN and Disney XD in a multi-year pact to broadcast Madden NFL competitive matches across the world through its Competitive Gaming Division arm. On August 14, 2018, Patrick S√∂derlund announced his departure from EA as its vice-president and chief design officer, after serving twelve years with the company. With S√∂derlund's departure, the SEED group was moved as part of EA's studios, while the EA Originals and EA Partners teams were moved under the company's Strategic Growth group. On February 6, 2019, Electronic Arts' stock value was hit by a decline of 13.3%, the worst decline since Halloween 2008. This was largely due to the marketing of their anticipated title Battlefield V, which was released after the holiday season of October 2018. Stocks were already declining since late August, when EA announced that Battlefield Vs release would be delayed until November. Upon release, the game was met with a mixed reception, and EA sold one million fewer copies than their expected figure of 7.3 million. Also attributed to the stock plunge was the game's lack of the game mode Battle Royale, popularized by PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and then Fortnite. Stocks then surged 9.6% with the surprise release of Apex Legends, which garnered 25 million players in just one week, smashing Fortnites record of 10 million players in two weeks. In advance of the end of its financial quarter ending March 31, 2019, Wilson announced they were cutting about 350 jobs, or about 4% of its workforce, primarily from their marketing, publishing, and operations divisions. Wilson stated the layoffs were necessary to \\"address our challenges and prepare for the opportunities ahead\\". EA announced in October 2019 that it would be returning to release games on Steam, starting with the November 2019 release of Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, as well as bringing the EA Access subscription service to Steam. While EA plans to continue to sell games on Origin, the move to add Steam releases was to help get more consumers to see their offerings. Due to COVID-19 lockdowns and growing demand for online games, EA's revenue grew to $1.4bn in the first quarter of 2020. EA rebranded both EA Access and Origin to EA Play on August 18, 2020 but otherwise without changing the subscription price or services offered as part of a streamlining effort.

In addition to traditional packaged-goods games, EA Worldwide Studios also develops massively multiplayer online role-playing games. As of April 2018, the division is led by Laura Miele.  EA Sports  First introduced in 1991 as the Electronic Arts Sports Network, before being renamed due to a trademark dispute with ESPN, EA Sports publishes all the sports games from EA, including FIFA Football, Madden NFL, Fight Night, NBA Live, NCAA Football, Cricket, NCAA March Madness, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, NHL Hockey, NASCAR and Rugby. In 2011, Forbes ranked EA Sports eighth on their list of most valuable sports brands, with a value of .  EA All Play  EA All Play is a mobile-oriented label that, since 2012, publishes digital titles like The Simpsons', Tetris, and Battlefield, as well as Hasbro board games like Scrabble.  EA Competitive Gaming Division  The EA Competitive Gaming Division (CGD), founded in 2015 by Peter Moore and currently headed by Todd Sitrin, is the group dedicated on enabling global eSports competitions on EA's biggest franchises including FIFA, Madden NFL, Battlefield and more.  SEED  The Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division (SEED) was revealed at the 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo as a technology research division and incubator, using tools like deep learning and neural networks to bring in player experiences and other external factors to help them develop more immersive narratives and games. SEED has offices in Los Angeles and Stockholm.  Former labels  * EA Kids ‚Äî A label for educational titles. In January 1995, EA sold the label to and in conjunction with Capital Cities/ABC formed the independent ABC/EA Home Software, which was later absorbed into Creative Wonders in that year's May. * EA Sports Big ‚Äî A label introduced in 2000, and used for arcade-styled extreme sports. In 2008, Electronic Arts retired the EA Sports Big label and replaced it with EA Sports Freestyle, which would focus exclusively on casual sports games, regardless of genre. The label was used for just a few games until being quietly retired. * Electronic Arts Studios * EA Games Partnership and initiatives =EA Partners program (1997‚Äìpresent)= EA Partners co-publishing program was dedicated to publishing and distributing games developed by third-party developers. EA Partners began as EA Distribution, formed in 1997 and led by Tom Frisina, a former executive from Accolade and Three-Sixty who helped both companies find third-party developers as to provide publishing support for them. Frisina's early partners included Looking Glass Studios, MGM Interactive for the rights to the James Bond property, DreamWorks Interactive, and eventually DICE; in the latter two cases, these studios would later be acquired by EA as part of the EA DICE family. In 2003, EA's president John Riccitiello pushed for a renaming of the EA Distribution label, seeing the potential to bring in more independent developers and additional revenue streams. While they rebraned the label as EA Partners in 2003, Riccitiello left EA the following year, which disrupted the direction the label had been aiming to go. Oddworld Inhabitants, who had signed on with EA Partner for their next Oddworld games, found the situation difficult as EA Partners was reluctant to support games where they did not own the intellectual property rights and instead favored internal development. The situation with EA Partners switched gears in 2005 after EA and Valve signed an EA Partners deal for the physical distribution of The Orange Box; EA Partners realized it needed to be flexible to handle the different publishing opportunities presented to them. A similar breakthrough was reached with signing on Harmonix for the distribution of the Rock Band games, requiring them to work closely with MTV Games on the plastic instrument controllers necessary for the titles. A number of major partnerships were made over the next few years, including Namco Bandai, Crytek, Starbreeze Studios, id Software, Epic Games and People Can Fly, Double Fine Productions, Grasshopper Manufacture, Spicy Horse, and Realtime Worlds. While many of these partnerships proved successful, the division had two major marks on its name. It was associated with the situation around Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning developed by 38 Studios, which had been significantly backed by loans from taxpayer funds from the state of Rhode Island. Kingdoms failed to be commercially successful, and EA Partners pulled out of making a sequel, leaving 38 Studios in default of its loan payback to the state. Secondly, while The Secret World from Funcom launched as a paid-for game without subscriptions, Funcom had to switch their monetization model to free-to-play to improve their revenues, which further affected EA Partners. Around April 2013, as part of a large 1000-employee layoff, many reporters claimed that EA Partners was also being shut down for its poor commercial performance, but the program remained active as the company refocused its efforts. The label remained dormant over the next several years, while Letts expanded on the EA Originals program, but following the move of EA Partners and EA Origins into the Strategic Growth group in August 2018, the label was revived on the March 2019 with a publishing deal with Velan Studios, formed from the former heads of Vicarious Visions. Notable publishing/distribution agreements include: * Alice: Madness Returns ‚Äì Spicy Horse * APB ‚Äì Realtime Worlds * Br√ºtal Legend ‚Äì Double Fine Productions * Bulletstorm ‚Äì Epic Games * Crysis series ‚Äì Crytek * DeathSpank ‚Äì Hothead Games * Fuse ‚Äì Insomniac Games * Hellgate: London ‚Äì Flagship Studios * Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning ‚Äì 38 Studios, Big Huge Games * Rock Band series ‚Äì Harmonix and MTV Games * The Secret World ‚Äì Funcom * Shadows of the Damned ‚Äì Grasshopper Manufacture * Shank series ‚Äì Klei Entertainment * Syndicate ‚Äì Starbreeze Studios * Warp ‚Äì Trapdoor = EA Originals program (2017‚Äìpresent) = EA Originals is a program within Electronic Arts to help support independently developed video games. EA funds the money for development, and once it recoups that, all additional revenue goes to the partner studio that created the game. That studio also gets to keep the intellectual property rights for whatever it creates, and even has creative control over the project. The program was announced at EA's press event at the 2016 E3 Conference, and builds upon the success they had with Unravel by Coldwood Interactive in 2015. The first game to be supported under this program is Fe by Zoink, with plans for release in 2018. It was followed by A Way Out by Hazelight Studios and eventually Sea of Solitude by Jo-Mei Games. In E3 2019 on its EA Play event, EA announced that three new titles would come, with Zoink returning with a new title called Lost in Random, Hazelight Studios returning with a new title and Glowmade entering the initiative with a title called RushHeart. * A Way Out ‚Äì Hazelight Studios (2018) * Fe ‚Äì Zoink (2018) * Sea of Solitude ‚Äì Jo-Mei Games (2019) * Lost in Random ‚Äì Zoink (2021) * It Takes Two - Hazelight Studios (2021) * RustHeart - Glowmade (TBA) Criticism and controversy Since the mid-2000s, Electronic Arts has been in the center of numerous controversies involving acquisitions of companies and alleged anti-consumerist practices in their individual games (which can be further read on their own articles), as well as lawsuits alleging EA's anti-competition when signing sports-related contracts.

As well, he is credited to helped found the methodic school of teachings of medicine in Alexandria whilst opposing traditional humoral theories of Hippocratic ideologies.

Because of their research, Erasistratus and Herophilus were heavily criticized for their utilization of vivisections specifically, namely the author Tertullian who followed Christian values.Tieleman, Teun. ‚ÄúHead and Heart.‚Äù Religion & Theology 21, no. 1/2 (March 2014): 86‚Äì106. doi:10.1163/15743012-02101003. Erasistratus and Herophilus are thought to be the first physicians to perform dissections on the human body systematically until the Renaissance. He is credited for his description of the valves of the heart, and he also concluded that the heart was not the center of sensations, but instead it functioned as a pump. Erasistratus was among the first to distinguish between veins and arteries. He believed that the arteries were full of air and that they carried the \\"animal spirit\\" (pneuma). He considered atoms to be the essential body element, and he believed they were vitalized by the pneuma that circulated through the nerves. He also thought that the nerves moved a nervous spirit from the brain. He then differentiated between the function of the sensory and motor nerves, and linked them to the brain. He is credited with one of the first in-depth descriptions of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Life Erasistratus is generally supposed to have been born at Ioulis on the island of Ceos,Suda, Erasistratos; Strabo, x. though Stephanus of Byzantium refers to him as a native of Cos;Stephanus of Byzantium, Kos Galen, as a native of Chios;Galen, Introd. c. 4, vol. xiv. p. 683 and the emperor Julian, as a native of Samos.Julian, Misopogon Pliny says he was the grandson of Aristotle by his daughter Pythias,Pliny, Hist. Nat., xxix. 3 but this is not confirmed by any other ancient writer; and according to the Suda, he was the son of Cretoxena, the sister of the physician Medius, and Cleombrotus. From the latter it is not quite clear whether Cleombrotus was his father or his uncle. He was a pupil of Chrysippus of Cnidos,Diogenes Laertius, vii. 7. ¬ß 10; Pliny, Hist. Nat., xxix. 3; Galen, de Ven. Sect. adv. Erasistr. c. 7, vol. xi. p. 171 Metrodorus,Sextus Empiricus, adv Mathem. i. 12, and apparently Theophrastus.Galen, de Sang, in Arter. c. 7, vol. iv. p. 729.Mavrodi, Alexandra. \\"Morphology of the Heart Associated with Its Function as Conceived by Ancient Greeks.\\" International Journal of Cardiology. 172, no. 1 (2014): 23-28. He lived for some time at the court of Seleucus I Nicator, where he acquired great reputation by discovering the disease of Antiochus I Soter, the king's eldest son, probably 294 BC. Seleucus in his old age had lately married Stratonice, the young and beautiful daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and she had already borne him one child.Plutarch, Demetr. c. 38; Appian, de Rebus Syr. c. 59. Antiochus fell violently in love with his stepmother, but did not disclose his passion, and chose rather to pine away in silence. The physicians were quite unable to discover the cause and nature of his disease, and Erasistratus himself was at a loss at first, till, finding nothing amiss about his body, he began to suspect that it must be his mind which was diseased, and that he might perhaps be in love. Erasistratus confirmed his conjecture when he observed that the skin of Antiochus grew hotter, his colour deeper, and his pulse quicker whenever Stratonice came near him, while none of these symptoms occurred on any other occasion. Accordingly, he told Seleucus that his son's disease was incurable, for he was in love, and that it was impossible to gratify his passion. The king wondered what the obstacle could be, and asked who the lady was. \\"My wife,\\" replied Erasistratus; upon which Seleucus began to persuade him to give her up to his son. The physician asked him if he would do so himself if it were his wife that the prince was in love with. The king protested that he would most gladly; upon which Erasistratus told him that it was indeed his own wife who had inspired his passion, and that he chose rather to die than to disclose his secret. Seleucus was as good as his word, and not only gave up Stratonice, but also resigned to his son several provinces of his empire. This celebrated story is told with variations by many ancient authors,Appian, de Rebus Syr. c. 59-61; Galen, de Praenot. ad Epig. c. 6. vol. xiv. p. 630; Julian, Misopogon; Lucian, de Syria Dea, ¬ß¬ß 17, 18; Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxix. 3; Plutarch, Demetr. c. 38; Suda, Erasistratos; John Tzetzes, Chil. vii. Hist. 118; Valerius Maximus v. 7 and a similar anecdote has been told of Hippocrates,Soranus, Vita Hippocr. in Hippocr. Opera, vol. iii. p. 852 Galen,Galen, de Praenot. ad Epig. c. 6. vol. xiv. p. 630 Avicenna, and (if the names be not fictitious) PanaciusAristaen.. Epist. i. 13 and Acestinus.Heliod. Aethiop. iv. 7. If this is the anecdote referred to by Pliny,Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxix. 3 as is probably the case, Erasistratus is said to have received one hundred talents for being the means of restoring the prince to health, which would amount to one of the largest medical fees upon record. Another rendition of Antiochus's illness depicting Erasistratus's presence during the ordeal. Very little more is known of the personal history of Erasistratus: he lived for some time at Alexandria, which was at that time beginning to be a celebrated medical school, and gave up practice in his old age, that he might pursue his anatomical studies without interruption.Galen, de Hippocr. et Plat. Decr. vii. 3, vol. v. p. 602. He and fellow physician Herophilus practiced anatomy with great success, and with such ardour that they are supposed to have dissected criminals alive.Celsus, de Medic. i. praef. These criminals were supposedly supplied by the king at the request of Herophilus. By conducting these dissections on live subjects they were able to see the true color and shape of internal organs that were not present in deceased subjects. However, conducting these vivisections did not lead to the discovery that there was blood and not just pneuma present in the arteries, which should have been evident in dissecting a live person. Erasistratus appears to have died in Asia Minor, as the Suda mentions that he was buried by mount Mycale in Ionia. The exact date of his death is not known, but he probably lived to a good old age, as, according to Eusebius, he was alive 258 BC, about forty years after the marriage of Antiochus and Stratonice. He had numerous pupils and followers, and a medical school bearing his name continued to exist at Smyrna in Ionia nearly till the time of Strabo, about the beginning of the 1st century.Strabo, xii. The following are the names of the most celebrated physicians belonging to the sect founded by him: Apoemantes,Galen, de Venae Sect. adv. Erasistr. c. 2, vol. xi. p. 151 Apollonius Memphites, ApollophanesCaelius Aurelianus, de Morb. Acut. ii. 33 Artemidoras, Charidemus, Chrysippus, Heraclides of Smyrna, Hermogenes, Hicesius, Martialius, Menodorus, Ptolemaeus, Strato, Xenophon. An attack on Erasistratus and his followers is preserved in Anonymus Londinensis. Medicine Erasistratus wrote many works on anatomy, practical medicine and pharmacy, of which only the titles remain, together with a great number of short fragments preserved by Galen, Caelius Aurelianus, and other ancient writers. These, however, are sufficient to enable us to form a reasonable idea of his opinions both as a physician and an anatomist. It is as an anatomist that he is most celebrated, and perhaps there is not one ancient physician that did more to promote that branch of medical science than he. He appears to have been very near the discovery of the circulation of the blood, for in a passage preserved by GalenGalen, de Usu Part. vi. 12, vol. iii. p. 465 he says: > The veinThe pulmonary artery, which received the name phleps arteriodorus > from Herophilus. See Rufus of Ephesus, de Appell. Part. Corp. Hum. p. 42 > arises from the part where the arteries, that are distributed to the whole > body, have their origin, and penetrates to the sanguineous [or right] > ventricle [of the heart]; and the artery [or pulmonary vein] arises from the > part where the veins have their origin, and penetrates to the pneumatic [or > left] ventricle of the heart. The description is not very clear, but seems to show that he supposed the venous and arterial systems to be more intimately connected than was generally believed. This idea is confirmed by another passage in which he is said to have differed from the other ancient anatomists, who believed that the veins arise from the liver, the arteries arise from the heart and the heart is the origin both of the veins and the arteries.Galen, de Hippocr. et Plat. Decr. vi. 6, vol. v. p. 552. With these ideas, it can have been only his belief that the arteries contained air and not blood, that hindered his anticipating Harvey's discovery. These views also supported his belief that blood production started in the liver, and not the heart. Erasistratus had a theory that if an artery was traumatized then it would be possible however to find blood at that point, not due to blood being present within the artery itself, but rather because of the body functioning like a vacuum. When a hole would form in an artery, it would create a vacuum that would pull blood into it from a nearby vein. With his discovery of the functioning of the four main valves of the heart, he saw that when material is moved out of the heart, new material moves in, but this does not happen constantly like a water pipe. Once material has left the heart it can not come back in, and material that has entered the heart can not flow back out in the same direction. This is accomplished by membranes that open and close their mouths on the valves of the heart. However, according to Erasistratus the material moving through these valves is pneuma. The tricuspid valves of the heart are generally said to have derived their name from Erasistratus.Smith, W., ed., Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. 2 (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1867), p. 43. This, however, appears to be an oversight, as Galen attributes it not to him, but to one of his followers.Galen, De Hippocr. et Plat. Decr. vi. 6, vol. v. p. 548. Erasistratus also made observations on the morphology of the heart, describing the pulmonary artery and the aorta to have a sigmoid shape, a name which is still used presently. Erasistratus also appears to have paid particular attention to the anatomy of the brain, and in a passage from his works preserved by GalenGalen, De Hippocr. et Plat. Decr. vii. 3, vol. v. p. 603 he speaks as if he had himself dissected a human brain. Galen saysGalen, De Hippocr. et Plat. Decr. vii. 3, vol. v. p. 602 that before Erasistratus had more closely examined into the origin of the nerves, he imagined that they arose from the dura mater and not from the substance of the brain; and that it was not until he was advanced in life that he satisfied himself by actual inspection that such was not the case. According to Rufus of Ephesus, he divided the nerves into those of sensation and those of motion, of which the former he considered to be hollow and to arise from the membranes of the brain and the latter from the substance of the brain itself and of the cerebellum.Rufus of Ephesus, De Appell. Part. etc. p. 65. He asserted that the spleen,Galen, de Atra Bile, c. 7. vol. v. p. 131 the bile,Galen, de Facult. Natur. ii. 2, vol. ii. p. 78 and several other parts of the body,Galen, Comment, in Hippocr. De Alim. iii. 14. vol. xv. p. 308 were entirely useless to animals. Erasistratus believed that fluids, when drunk, passed through the esophagus into the stomach. During his time, there was controversy that was carried on as to whether fluids when drunk passed through the trachea into the lungs, or through the esophagus into the stomach.Plutarch, Symposium, vii. 1; Aulus Gellius, xvii. 11; Macrobius, Saturn. vii. 15. He is also supposed to have been the first person who added to the word arteria, which had hitherto designated the canal leading from the mouth to the lungs, the epithet tracheia, to distinguish it from the arteries, and hence to have been the originator of the modern name trachea. He attributed the sensation of hunger to emptiness of the stomach, and said that the Scythians were accustomed to tie a belt tightly round their middle, to enable them to abstain from food for a longer time without suffering inconvenience.Aulus Gellius, xvi. 3. The pneuma (spiritual substance) played a very important part both in his system of physiology and pathology: he supposed it to enter the lungs by the trachea, thence to pass by the pulmonary veins into the heart, and thence to be diffused throughout the whole body by means of the arteries;Galen, de Differ. Puls. iv. 2, vol. viii. p. 703, et alibi that the use of respiration was to fill the arteries with air;Galen, de Usu, Respir. c. 1. vol. iv. p. 471 and that the pulsation of the arteries was caused by the movements of the pneuma. He accounted for diseases in the same way, and supposed that as long as the pneuma continued to fill the arteries and the blood was confined to the veins, the individual was in good health; but that when the blood from some cause or other got forced into the arteries, inflammation and fever was the consequence.Galen, de Venae Sect. adv. Erasistr. c. 2. vol. xi. p. 153, etc.; Pseudo-Plutarch, de Philosoph. Plac. v. 29. Of his method of cure the most remarkable peculiarity was his aversion to bloodletting and purgative medicines: he seems to have relied chiefly on diet and regimen, bathing, exercise, friction, and the most simple vegetables. Erasistratus was against bloodletting likely due to his theory of plethora. This was a medical term that was commonly used in Hellanistic Greece, and Erasistratus believed it was where one's body parts were full of undigested fragments of food, causing the body to then function improperly. This theory of plethora then was why many of his treatments pertained to diet, fasting, and use of drugs that would change digestion. In surgery he was celebrated for the invention of a catheter that bore his name, and which was S-shaped.Galen, Introd. c. 13. vol. xiv. p. 751. Much to the disagreement that Galen had towards Erasistratus's views regarding phlebotomy, the Alexandrian physician was said by Galen in his work entitled, Bloodletting, against the Erasistrateans at Rome, to have disregarded the importance of the practice and rather suggested alternative methods. Notably. Erasistratus suggests the bandaging of a patient's armpits and groin to achieve the desired results associated with phlebotomy. Galen continues in his work to highly criticize this viewpoint that the Alexandrian physician had regarding the medical practice, and points out that Erasistratus did not give enough evidence to support the avoidance of phlebotomy for other treatments.  Association with Herophilus and Galen  Woodcut of Herophilus and Erasistratus in the Gardens of Adonis Erasistratus is frequently mentioned in historical documents with other significant figures of both his time period of the 3rd and 4th century BC and afterwards thanks to his accomplishments and advancements in the field of medicine.Balalykin, Dmitry A. ‚ÄúWhat Do We Know about Erasistratus? Part 1.‚Äù History of Medicine 5, no. 1 (January 2018): 3‚Äì13. doi:10.17720/2409-5834.v5.1.2018.01a. The most prominent person he is referenced with from when he was living was that of Herophilus, another physician that was an important part of ancient Alexandrian medicine with Erasistratus. Together, Erasistratus and Herophilus attributed to the revolutionary growth of knowledge in the Hellenistic period in not only science but culture as well in accordance to the writings of historians of antiquity. Although, it is noted that Erasistratus and Herophilus did not share similar ideologies in the science of medicine as well as its practice.Balalykin, Dmitry A. ‚ÄúWhat Do We Know about Erasistratus? Part 2.‚Äù History of Medicine 5, no. 2 (April 2018): 154‚Äì67. doi:10.17720/2409-5583.v5.2.2018.01a. One topic the two disagreed on what substance was actually carried by the arteries.Boylan, Michael. \\"Galen: On Blood, the Pulse, and the Arteries.\\" Journal of the History of Biology 40, no. 2 (2007): 207-230. Herophilus believed that the arteries carried a mixture of pneuma and blood, while Erasistratus believed that they solely carried pneuma. Erasistratus is said to have natural philosophical views as compared to others during the time, paving the way for the teaching of methodologists in the field of medicine. The publications of some of Galen's work, from which there are many mentions of Erasistratus and Herophilus, led to further understanding of the differing ideologies. Erasistratus and Galen both supported the theory of pneuma, however their beliefs on how pneuma acquired the air it needed differed. Erasistratus believed that pneuma received the air it needed from the lungs. Galen agreed that air from the lungs was used for pneuma, however in expelling also as much air as was breathed in there wasn't enough air present to account for all the pneuma needed to function. Galen also believed that air was brought in through pores of the skin, and through the nose which would move to the bony cavities of the brain to be used as psychic pneuma. Galen also noted his disagreement with Erasistratus and Herophilus on their view of the composition of organic bodies.Leith, David. 2015. ‚ÄúElements and Uniform Parts in Early Alexandrian Medicine.‚Äù Phronesis 60 (4): 462‚Äì91. doi:10.1163/15685284-12341293. They adopted an Aristotelian view of organic bodies consisting of three levels: elements, uniform, and non-uniform parts. Elements consisted of the elements, earth, wind, water, and fire. Uniform parts consisted of the nature of animals such as bone and flesh. Finally, non- uniform parts of nature were things such as a face or hand. Erasistratus and Herophilus believed that doctors should concern themselves with the uniform and non-uniform levels of the body, but not elements as that was the job of philosophers and scientists. This coincides with the role placed on physicians of the time to not act as scientists. Galen however, believed that to understand the human body one had to understand the mixture of its elements. Much of what is known of Erasistratus and that of his work he did in the 3rd and 4th BC has become known through the work done by Galen. Galen frequently notes the past ideas that had become prevalent from the work of Erasistratus when comparing it to that of his work and ideas. Some historians have suggested that due to Erasistratus's disagreements with the ideologies found within Hippocratic teachings and beliefs, as well as notably phlebotomy, that Galen seems to ridicule some work that Erasistratus had synthesized. However, there are numerous times that Galen backs the ideas of Erasistratus as well, leading to opposing claims that Galen was generally negative when discussing the ideologies produced by Erasistratus.  Downfall and loss of influence after death  By the time both Erasistratus and Herophilus had died, the empiricist school of medicine in Alexandria reigned as the most widely accepted ideology and method for practicing medicine for several centuries. One notable event that historians credit to downfall of Erasistratus's ideas and influence was that of the Syrian War that occurred from 246‚Äì241 BC due to its negative effect on the Alexandrian society, reducing its ability to fund programs that would continue the teachings of Erasistratus. Although, even before the Syrian War devastated the culture and economy of the Alexandrian society, Ptolemy Malefactor in 145 BC negatively impacted the continuation of Erasistratus's teachings and ideas, as well as other Alexandrian teachings, as he pushed for Alexandrian intelligentsia to be removed from the Alexandrian society completely. Ultimately, the destruction of many works, including that of Erasistratus and Herophilus, because of a fire that erupted at the great library in 391 AD may have been the greatest reason why there are limited sources of material to understand the teachings and work of Erasistratus outside that of the references to the Alexandrian physician from Galen's writings. Furthermore, it may also be the event that resulted in none of Erasistratus's original writing remaining.  Discovery of information regarding the Alexandrian physicians  Much of the documentation of the works of Erasistratus and Herophilus was undiscovered until the late 20th century, so the importance of Erasistratus in the advancement of medical knowledge was not fully understood. The only substantial collection of information about their work was several fragments of their writings assembled by K.F.H. Marx and R. Fuchs from German texts. Before that, nearly the only way to learn about the work was by analyzing Galen's works, which mention Erasistratus. Similar sets of fragmented texts were also collected in English by J.F. Dobson. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, H. von Staden and Garofalo also found many important sources of information on the Alexandrian physicians came.

On 26 October 1813, a Canadian force consisting of 1,530 regulars, volunteers, militia and Native Americans from Lower Canada, commanded by Charles de Salaberry, repelled an American force of about 2,600 regulars which was attempting to invade Lower Canada and ultimately attack Montreal. The Battle of the Chateauguay was one of the two battles (the other being the Battle of Crysler's Farm) which caused the Americans to abandon the Saint Lawrence Campaign, their major strategic effort in the autumn of 1813. Prelude =The American plan= Late in 1813, United States Secretary of War John Armstrong devised a plan to capture Montreal, which might have led to the conquest of all Upper Canada. Two divisions were involved. One would descend the St. Lawrence River from Sackett's Harbor on Lake Ontario, while the other would advance north from Plattsburgh on Lake Champlain. The two divisions would unite in front of the city for the final assault.Elting, p.138 Wade Hampton. He took command of the American forces around Lake Champlain on 4 July 1813. The Americans around Lake Champlain were led by Major General Wade Hampton, who had taken command on 4 July 1813. Hampton had several misgivings about the plan. His own troops, encamped at Burlington, Vermont, were raw and badly trained, and his junior officers themselves lacked training and experience. There were insufficient supplies at his forward base at Plattsburgh as the British had controlled the lake since 3 June. On that day, two American sloops pursued British gunboats into the Richelieu River and were forced to surrender after the wind dropped and they were trapped by gunboats and artillery firing from the river banks.Hitsman, p.153 The British took over the sloops and used them in a raid against a number of settlements around Lake Champlain. In particular, they captured or destroyed quantities of supplies in and around Plattsburgh. Although the British crews and troops involved in the raid were subsequently returned to other duties, the American naval commander on the lake, Lieutenant Thomas Macdonough, was unable to construct a flotilla of sloops and gunboats to counter the British vessels until August.Roosevelt, p.157 Hampton, a wealthy southern plantation owner, despised Major General James Wilkinson who commanded the division from Sackett's Harbor and who had a reputation for corruption and treacherous dealings with Spain. The two men, who were the two senior generals in the United States Army after the effective retirement of Major General Henry Dearborn on 6 July 1813, had been feuding with each other since 1808.Elting, p.136 Hampton at first refused to accept orders from Wilkinson, until Armstrong (who had himself moved to Sackett's Harbor) arranged that all correspondence regarding the expedition was to pass through the War Department.Hitsman, p.179 =Hampton's Movements= On 19 September, Hampton moved by water from Burlington to Plattsburgh, escorted by Macdonough's gunboats, and made a reconnaissance in force towards Odelltown on the direct route north from Lake Champlain. He decided that the British forces were too strong in this sector. The garrison of Ile aux Noix, where the British sloops and gunboats were based, numbered about 900Elting, p.144 and there were other outposts and light troops in the area. Also, water on this route was short after a summer drought had caused the wells and streams to dry up,Hitsman, p.183 though this excuse caused some amusement among Hampton's officers as Hampton was known to be fond of drink.Hitsman, p.180 Hampton's force marched west instead to Four Corners, on the Chateauguay River. As Wilkinson's expedition was not ready, Hampton's force waited at Four Corners until 18 October. Hampton was concerned that the delay was depleting his supplies and giving the British time to muster forces against him. Hearing from Armstrong that Wilkinson's force was \\"almost\\" ready to set out, he began advancing down the Chateauguay River.Elting, p.145 A brigade of 1,400 New York militia refused to cross the frontier into Canada, leaving Hampton with two brigades of regulars numbering about 2,600 in total, 200 mounted troops and 10 field guns. Large numbers of loaded wagons accompanied the force. Hampton's advance was slowed because the bridges across every stream had been destroyed and trees had been felled across the roads (which themselves were little more than tracks).Hitsman, p.184 =Canadian counter-moves= The Swiss-born Major- General Louis de Watteville was appointed commander of the Montreal District on 17 September. In response to reports of the American advance, he ordered several units of militia called up. Reinforcements (two battalions of the Royal Marines) were also moving up the St. Lawrence from Quebec. The Governor- General of Canada, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, ordered Lieutenant Colonel George MacDonnell to move from Kingston on Lake Ontario to the front south of Montreal with his 1st Light Battalion of mixed regular and militia companies.Hitsman, p.181 Already though, the commander of the outposts, Lieutenant Colonel Charles de Salaberry, had been organising his defences. In addition to his own corps (the Canadian Voltigeurs) and George MacDonnell's 1st Light Battalion, he had called in several units of the Select Embodied Militia and local militia units. Commanding the outposts along the Chateauguay River, Lt Col Charles de Salaberry organised the defences, initially made up of Canadian Voltigeurs and units from the Canadian militia. De Salaberry had many informants among the farmers in the area who provided accurate information about the strength of Hampton's force and its movements, while Hampton had very poor intelligence about De Salaberry's force. *The road along which Hampton was advancing followed the north bank of the Chateauguay. Facing a ravine where a creek (the English River) joined the Chateauguay, de Salaberry ordered abatis (obstacles made of felled trees) to be constructed, blocking the road. Behind these he posted the light company of the Canadian Fencibles under Captain Richard Ferguson (50); two companies of the Canadian Voltigeurs under Captain Michel-Louis Juchereau Duchesnay and his brother Captain Jean-Baptiste Juchereau Duchesnay, totalling about 100 men; a company from the 2nd Battalion Sedentary Beauharnois Militia under Captain Longuetin (about 100) and perhaps two dozen Native Americans (Abenaki, Algonquin and Iroquois) nominally commanded by Captain Lamothe. *To guard a ford across the Chateauguay behind the abatis, de Salaberry posted the light companies of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of Select Embodied Militia under Captains de Tonnancoeur and Daly, and another company of Beauharnois militia under Captain Brugi√®re (about 160 in total). *In successive reserve positions, stretching a mile and a half along the river from the abatis to the ford and beyond, were another five companies of the Canadian Voltigeurs (about 300); the main body of the 2nd Select Embodied Militia (480), 200 more local \\"sedentary\\" militia; and another 150 Kahnawake and Mohawks and other Native Americans commanded by Captains Lorimier and Ducharme, among others. De Salaberry commanded the front line in person, while the reserves were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel MacDonnell. All of de Salaberry's forces were raised in Lower Canada. The Canadian Fencibles were raised as regulars, though liable for service in North America only. The Voltigeurs were volunteers and were treated as regulars for most purposes. The Select Embodied Militia contained some volunteers but consisted mainly of men drafted by ballot for a year's full-time service.Hitsman, pp.38, 122 De Salaberry had been so confident of victory that he had not informed his superiors of his actions. De Watteville and Sir George Prevost rode forward and \\"approved\\" de Salaberry's dispositions, even as the fighting started.Hitsman, p.187 Battle A Sketch of the battle of the Chateauguay Hampton knew of the existence of the ford and, late on 25 October, he decided to send 1,000 men of his first brigade (including most, if not all, of his light infantry) under Colonel Robert Purdy, to cross to the south bank of the Chateauguay, circle round the British position and outflank it by capturing the ford at dawn, while 1,000 men of his second brigade under Brigadier General George Izard attacked from the front. The remainder of the American force was either sick or left to guard the baggage and artillery. After Purdy set off, Hampton received a letter from Armstrong, dated 16 October, informing him that Armstrong himself was relinquishing overall command of the combined American forces, leaving Wilkinson in charge. Hampton was also ordered to construct winter quarters for 10,000 men on the Saint Lawrence. Hampton interpreted this instruction to mean that there would be no attack on Montreal that year and the entire campaign was pointless. He would probably have retreated immediately, except that Purdy would then have been left isolated.Elting, p.146 Purdy's men spent a miserable night marching through swampy woods in pouring rain, becoming quite lost. As dawn broke on 26 October, they located the correct trail, but inexperienced or unwilling guides first led them about mid-morning to a point on the river opposite de Salaberry's forward defences. Some time after noon, Purdy's brigade encountered the detachment de Salaberry had posted to guard the ford. Captain Daly, leading the light company of the 3rd Select Embodied Militia, launched an immediate attack against the Americans, while other Canadian troops engaged them from across the river.Hitsman, p.186 Captain Daly and Captain Brugi√®re were severely wounded but the Americans were driven back. After Purdy's force had been in action for some time with no obvious signs of American success, Izard's force marched into the ravine facing de Salaberry's defences and deployed into line. Legend has it that at this point, an American officer rode forward to demand the Canadians' surrender. As he had omitted to do so under a flag of truce, he was shot down by de Salaberry himself. Izard's troops began steady, rolling volleys into the abatis and trees. These conventional tactics, better suited to pitched battles between regular forces in open terrain, were almost entirely ineffective against the Canadians. The defenders replied with accurate individual fire. Lieutenant Pinguet of the Canadian Fencibles later related \\"All our men fired from thirty-five to forty rounds so well aimed that the prisoners told us next day that every shot seem to pass at about the height of a man's breast or head. Our company was engaged for about three- quarters of an hour before reinforcements came up.\\" Surprisingly few Americans were hit however. On the Canadian right, the light company of the Fencibles were outflanked and fell back, but either on de Salaberry's orders or on their own initiative, several companies from the reserve were already making their way forward. They did so with bugle calls, cheers and Indian war whoops. De Salaberry is also credited in several accounts with sending buglers into the woods to sound the \\"Advance\\" as a ruse de guerre. The unnerved Americans thought themselves outnumbered and about to be outflanked and fell back .Elting p.147 Hampton did not order any guns to be brought forward to destroy the abatis. Purdy first fell back to the river bank opposite De Salaberry's front line, expecting to find Izard still in action, so that he could ferry his wounded across the river. Instead, he once again found himself under fire from De Salaberry and was forced to retreat through the woods to his starting- place. Once Purdy had extricated himself after another dismal night in the woods, the American army withdrew in good order. De Salaberry did not pursue. Casualties De Salaberry reported 5 killed, 16 wounded and 4 missingBorneman p.166 but 3 of the men who had been returned as \\"killed\\" later rejoined the ranks unharmed,James, p. 312 giving a revised Canadian loss of 2 killed, 16 wounded and 4 missing. The American losses were officially reported by Hampton's Adjutant-General (Colonel Henry Atkinson) as 23 killed, 33 wounded and 29 missing. Salaberry reported that 16 American prisoners were taken.Wood, p. 397 Aftermath Having reunited his forces, Hampton held a council of war. This unanimously concluded that a renewed advance stood no chance of success. Furthermore, the roads were becoming impassable under the autumn rains, and Hampton's supplies would soon be exhausted. Hampton ordered a withdrawal to Four Corners and sent Colonel Atkinson to Wilkinson with a report of his situation.Way, in Zaslow p.66 Wilkinson's own force had reached a settlement named Hoags, on the Saint Lawrence River a few miles upstream from Ogdensburg, when they received this news. Wilkinson replied with orders for Hampton to advance to Cornwall, bringing sufficient supplies for both his own and Wilkinson's division. When he received these orders, Hampton was convinced that they could not be executed and declined to comply, retreating instead to Plattsburgh.Elting, p.150 Before Hampton's reply could reach Wilkinson, the latter's own force was defeated at the Battle of Crysler's Farm on 11 November. Wilkinson nevertheless used Hampton's refusal to move on Cornwall (which he received by letter on 12 November) as a pretext to abandon his own advance, and the campaign to capture Montreal was called off.Way, in Zaslow, p.81 Hampton had already submitted his resignation the day before the battle of Chateauguay, in his reply to Armstrong's letter of 16 October. He was not employed again in the field.Elting, p.146 On the British side, the victorious troops at Chateauguay held their existing positions and endured much discomfort for several days before Indians reported that the Americans were retreating, which allowed them to retire to more comfortable billets. The hot-tempered de Salaberry was furious that Major General de Watteville and especially Sir George Prevost had arrived on the field too late to take part in the fighting but in time to submit their own dispatches claiming the victory for themselves.Charles de Salaberry; Dictionary of Canadian Biography online He considered resigning his commission but was later officially thanked by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. He and Lieutenant Colonel MacDonnell were made Companions of the Bath after the war for their parts in the battle. Sir George Prevost's dispatch, which claimed that 300 Canadians had put 7,500 Americans to flight nevertheless contributed to the battle becoming legendary in Canadian folklore.

In 2014, it had a population of 75,701. B√©ziers hosts the famous Feria de B√©ziers, centred on bullfighting, every August. A million visitors are attracted to the five-day event.B√©ziers Tourist Site B√©ziers is also a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network. Geography Map The town is located on a small bluff above the river Orb, about from the Mediterranean coast, and 75 km southwest of Montpellier. At B√©ziers, the Canal du Midi spans the river Orb as an aqueduct called the Pont-canal de l'Orb, claimed to be the first of its kind.Beyond.fr tourist site History B√©ziers is one of the oldest cities in France. Research published in March 2013 shows that B√©ziers dates from 575 BC, making it older than Agde (Greek Agathe Tyche, founded in 525 BC) and a bit younger than Marseille (Greek Massalia, founded in 600 BC) The site has been occupied since Neolithic times, before the influx of Celts. Roman Betarra was on the road that linked Provence with Iberia. The Romans refounded the city as a new colonia for veterans in 36‚Äì35 BC and called it Colonia Julia Baeterrae Septimanorum. Stones from the Roman amphitheatre were used to construct the city wall during the 3rd century. White wine was exported to Rome. A dolia discovered in an excavation near Rome is marked \\"I am a wine from Baeterrae and I am five years old\\"; another simply \\"white wine of Baeterrae\\". It was occupied by the Moors between 720 and 752. From the 10th to the 12th century, B√©ziers was the centre of a Viscountship of B√©ziers. The viscounts ruled most of the coastal plain around B√©ziers, including the town of Agde. They also controlled the major east‚Äìwest route through Languedoc, which roughly follows the old Roman Via Domitia, with the two key bridges over the Orb at B√©ziers and over the H√©rault at Saint-Thib√©ry. After the death of Viscount William around 990, the viscounty passed to his daughter Garsendis and her husband, count Raimond-Roger of Carcassonne (d. 1012). It was then ruled by their son Peter-Raimond (d. 1060) and his son Roger (d. 1067), both of whom were also Counts of Carcassonne. Roger died without issue and B√©ziers passed to his sister Ermengard and her husband Raimond-Bertrand Trencavel. The Trencavels ruled for the next 142 years, until the Albigensian Crusade, a formal crusade (holy war) authorised by Pope Innocent III. =Massacre at B√©ziers= B√©ziers was a Languedoc stronghold of Catharism, which the Catholic Church condemned as heretical and which Catholic forces exterminated in the Albigensian Crusade. The old bridge B√©ziers was the first place to be attacked. The crusaders reached the town on 21 July 1209. B√©ziers' Catholics were given an ultimatum to hand over the heretics or leave before the crusaders besieged the city and to \\"avoid sharing their fate and perishing with them\\". However, many refused and resisted with the Cathars. The town was sacked the following day and in the bloody massacre no one was spared, not even Catholic priests and those who took refuge in the churches. One of the commanders of the crusade was the Papal legate Arnaud-Amaury (or Arnald Amalaricus, Abbot of Citeaux). When asked by a crusader how to tell Catholics from Cathars once they had taken the city, the abbot supposedly replied, \\"Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius\\" (\\"Kill them all, for the Lord knoweth them that are His\\"). (This oft quoted phrase is sourced from Caesarius of Heisterbach along with a story of all the heretics who desecrated a copy of the Gospels and threw it down from the town's walls.) Amalric's own version of the siege, described in his letter to Pope Innocent III in August 1209 (col. 139), states: > While discussions were still going on with the barons about the release of > those in the city who were deemed to be Catholics, the servants and other > persons of low rank and unarmed attacked the city without waiting for orders > from their leaders. To our amazement, crying \\"to arms, to arms!\\", within the > space of two or three hours they crossed the ditches and the walls and > B√©ziers was taken. Our men spared no one, irrespective of rank, sex or age, > and put to the sword almost 20,000 people. After this great slaughter the > whole city was despoiled and burnt ...Albigensian Crusade The invaders burned the Cathedral of Saint Nazaire, which collapsed on those who had taken refuge inside. The town was pillaged and burnt. By some accounts, none were left alive ‚Äì by others, there were a handful of survivors. (A plaque opposite the cathedral records the \\"Day of Butchery\\" perpetrated by the \\"northern barons\\".) =Later Middle Ages= Despite the massacre, the city was repopulated. A few parts of the Romanesque cathedral of St-Nazaire had survived the carnage, and repairs started in 1215. The restoration, along with that of the rest of the city, continued until the 15th century. B√©ziers became part of the royal domain in 1247. Rule of the city was for a long time divided among three powers: the Bishopric, which reached its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries when it was held by the Bonsi family, allied to the Medici; the consuls, local magistrates created at the end of the 12th century; and finally the king, represented by a \\"Viguier for judicial affairs\\", and from the 17th century onwards by a sub-delegate of the Intendant. B√©ziers was not damaged in the Hundred Years' War. On 8 September 1381, a riot broke out at the seat of the municipal council, rioters setting the Town House on fire. The councillors tried to take refuge in the tower, but fire spread there as well, and they all died either by fire or in jumping from the tower to the square. =Early modern times= King Charles IX passed through the city during his royal tour of France (1564‚Äì1566), accompanied by the Court and the great men of the kingdom: his brother the Duke of Anjou, Henri of Navarre, and the cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine. In 1551, B√©ziers became the seat of a seneschal, being removed from the jurisdiction of the seneschals of Carcassonne. The city served as a rear base during various wars of the modern period, especially those against the Habsburgs. It was only once directly threatened. During the War of the Spanish Succession, the British in 1710 landed at S√®te and moved to within a few kilometres of B√©ziers, before being repulsed by the Duke of Roquelaure. B√©ziers was at the heart of the Montmorency Revolt in 1632. It was in B√©ziers that Gaston d'Orl√©ans and Henri II de Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, met at the beginning of the rebellion. It was also here that the king, by the Edict of Beziers (October 1632) abolished the privileges of the province. (They were restored in 1649.) During the 18th century, B√©ziers prospered, notably thanks to the cultivation of vines which enabled it to become an important centre for alcohol trading. =French Revolution= During the French Revolution, citizens of B√©ziers met in a revolutionary society created in May 1790 and numbering up to 400 members. It had several successive names: first, \\"The Literary and Patriotic Cabinet\\", a name still derived from the social life of the Ancien R√©gime; it then became \\"Society of the Friends of the Constitution and Liberty\\". Later becoming affiliated to the Jacobin Club of Paris, the B√©ziers organization was accordingly renamed the \\"Society of the Jacobins\\"; then, the abolition of the French monarchy precipitated two further changes of name: \\"Society of Brothers and Friends of the Republic\\" and then \\"Regenerated Society of the Jacobins, Friends of the Republic\\". From 1790 to 1800, B√©ziers was the chief town of the district of B√©ziers. The city did not take part in the Girondin (\\"Federalist\\") movement. =Napoleon the Third= In the repression following Louis Napol√©on's coup d'√©tat in 1851, troops fired on and killed Republican protesters in B√©ziers. Others were condemned to death or transported to Guiana, including a former mayor who died at sea attempting to escape from there. In the Place de la R√©volution a plaque and a monument by Jean Antoine Injalbert commemorates these events. (Injalbert also designed the Fontaine du Titan in B√©ziers' Pl√¢teau des Po√®tes park and the Moli√®re monument in nearby P√©zenas.) =The Languedoc vine growers' revolt in B√©ziers= While elsewhere in France, the area planted with vines was decreasing, it increased in the Departments of Aude, Gard, H√©rault and the Pyrenees-Orientales. Together, these supplied some 40% of French wine production. Haut Languedoc, and more particularly the Biterrois and B√©ziers, proclaimed themselves to be \\"The World Capital of Wine\\" and grew rapidly. Great fortunes were made. Large landowners, coming from industry, finance or the liberal professions, gained possession of immense vineyards. There was also a growing foreign competition, with smuggled wines appearing on the market. The fraudsters remained unpunished. In 1892, the winegrowers of the Midi demanded \\"The restoration and enforcement of customs duties\\". But the market remained partly held by wines made from imported dried grapes (such as grapes from Corinth), and wines called \\"wet\\" (adulterated with water). Though the vintners attached great importance to this unfair competition, in fact it did not represent more than 5% of the market. On 12 May 1907, no less than 150,000 protesters gathered in B√©ziers with the declared aim of \\"Defending the Southern Viticulture\\". The crowd spilled into Paul-Riquet and the Champ-de- Mars. The slogans on the banners Proclaimed: \\"Victory or death! Enough of talking, the time has come for action! Death to fraudsters! Bread or death! Live by working or die fighting!\\". The demonstrators, who came from more than 200 communes, were joined by numerous Biterrois employees and shopkeepers. The event ended with speeches on the Place de la Citadelle, (now Place Jean- Jaur√®s). the Speakers included Marcelin Albert who issued an ultimatum to the government, demanding that it raise the price of wine, Ernest Ferroul who advocated tax refusal and the B√©ziers Mayor √âmile Suchon, (close to Clemenceau), who took a stand in support of the winegrowers' struggle. There were some minor incidents during the dispersal of the demonstrators. On 16 May, the B√©ziers municipal council, of Radical and Socialist tendency, resigned. The pressure of the street continued. The police station and the town hall fa√ßade were set on fire. Alerted, Georges Clemenceau decided to launch a counterattack. The 17th regiment of line infantry, composed of reservists and conscripts, was on his orders transferred from Beziers to Agde on 18 June 1907. On the evening of 20 June, learning of the Narbonne shooting, about 500 soldiers of the 6th company of the 17th regiment mutinied, plundered the armory and headed for B√©ziers. They traveled about twenty kilometers by night. On 21 June, in the early morning, they arrived in town. They were warmly welcomed by the Biterrois, \\"fraternizing with the demonstrators, and peacefully opposing the armed forces\\". The soldiers sat down on the All√©es Paul Riquet and the population offered them wine and food. The South was on the brink of insurrection. In Paulhan, the railway was taken out of commission by protesters who stopped a military convoy sent to quell the mutineers. In Lod√®ve, the sub-prefect was taken hostage. The military authorities were not ready to accept this mutiny, apprehensive that the example of the 17th regiment would give similar ideas to other regiments in the region. In Paris, the Republic trembled, as Clemenceau had to face a vote of no confidence. However, he survived by letting the military command urgently negotiate with the mutineers. In the afternoon, after obtaining a guarantee that no sanctions will be imposed on them, the 17th soldiers put down their arms and marched to the station under escort, without any major incident. On 22 June, they returned by train to their barracks. Clemenceau announced the end of the mutiny and gained a parliamentary vote of confidence by 327 votes to 223. On 23 June, a law was finally passed, which repressed the massive chaptalisation of the wines. Negotiations and the scale of the movement prevented collective punishment: the mutineers of the 17th were assigned to Gafsa (Tunisia), a place where soldiers were often sent for \\"disciplinary companies\\", but these soldiers remained outside this framework, and were under ordinary military status. There was therefore no penal sanction for the revolt of the 17th, contrary to the legend that developed on this subject. However, during the First World War, haunted by their reputation as deserters, many of them were sent to the front line, particularly in the bloody assaults of 1914. The mutiny of soldiers of the 17th has remained in historical memory, especially with the words of Mont√©hus' anti-militarist song \\"Gloire au 17\\", with the refrain: \\"Salute, salute to you / Brave soldiers of the seventeenth....\\" Population The inhabitants of B√©ziers are known as Biterrois, after Baeterrae, the Roman name for the town.

It has a population of 14,048. Forfar dates back to the temporary Roman occupation of the area, and was subsequently held by the Picts and the Kingdom of Scotland. It was occupied by the English before being recaptured by the Scots and presented to Robert the Bruce during the Scottish Wars of Independence. Forfar has been both a traditional market town and a major manufacturing centre for linen and jute. Today the main activities are agriculture and tourism around scenic Strathmore. The local glens are visited by hill-walkers, and there are ski-slopes in the mountains. The town has a League One football club, Forfar Athletic and a National League rugby team, the Strathmore Silverbacks. The Forfar bridie, a Scottish meat pastry snack, is traditionally identified with the town.  Etymology  The genesis of the toponym Forfar is uncertain. One suggestion is that the name is Gaelic and means \\"a cold point\\", involving, fuar meaning \\"cold, chilly\\", and bhar meaning \\"a point\\". History During one of the Roman invasions of modern-day Scotland, the Romans established a major camp at Battledykes, approximately 3 miles (5 km) north of Forfar; this camp was analysed to have held 50,000 to 60,000 men.Alan Reid, The Royal Burgh of Forfar: A Local History, 1902, Houlston & sons; 445 pages From Battledykes northward the Romans established a succession of camps including Stracathro, Raedykes and Normandykes.C. Michael Hogan, Elsick Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed Andy Burnham (2007) During the Middle Ages, a \\"claimant\\" to the throne, the daughter of the leader of the Meic Uilleim, who were descendants of King Duncan II, had her brains dashed out on Forfar market cross in 1230 while still an infant. During the First War of Scottish Independence, the castle of Forfar was held by the English. After Robert the Bruce's victory over the Earl of Buchan, Philip, the Forester of Platane, together with some of his friends raised ladders against the wall and, climbing over, surprised the garrison and slew them. He then yielded the castle to Bruce, who rewarded him and gave instructions for its demolition. The Meffan Museum is in the heart of the town. It was built by a daughter of the Provost Meffan as a bequest in 1898. It is home of the Forfar story. It is also an art gallery and a meeting place for local speakers, summer clubs for children and groups. The story of Forfar takes you from the history of the little cobbler shops to the burning of the witch Helen Guthrie. There is also a good selection of Pictish stones found in and around Forfar and Kirriemuir. The Large Class I Pictish stone, with a rare carving of a flower, is called the Dunnichen Stone. It was found in the early 19th century when a farmer from the East Mains of Dunnichen was ploughing. It was initially displayed at a church in the vicinity, then at Dunnichen House. In 1966 it was relocated at St Vigeans and finally moved to Dundee museum in 1972. After the Meffan Institute had been renovated it was brought to Forfar on a long term loan where it is displayed alongside the Kirriemuir Sculptured Stones. There is also a canoe, excavated from Forfar Loch, that dates back to the 11th century (one of two that were found). Like other parts of Angus, Forfar was home to a very successful textile industry during and after the Industrial Revolution. In the late 18th century the firm of William Don & Co. (later William and John Don & Co) was founded in the town. The firm originally bought and sold webs of linen which were woven in local cottages, although it also operated a small weaving shed. In 1865 the firm merged with A J Buist, a Dundee based firm, and began construction of St James Works in Forfar. The partnership also operated mills in Dundee and later built Station Works in Forfar, which contained some 300 looms. Workers housing was also built by the firm in Forfar. Don Brothers, Buist & Company Ltd, as the firm was known from 1904, built another works in Forfar, at Strang Street, in 1929. In 1960 it merged with another Dundee firm, Low Brothers & Co (Dundee) Ltd, eventually becoming Don & Low (Holdings) Ltd. By the 1980s the Don & Low group was the United Kingdom's biggest polypropylene textile extrusion and weaving unit. The firm retains premises in Forfar, mainly producing woven and non-woven polypropylene industrial textile products and plastic food packaging. In 1958 Don Brothers, Buist & Co Ltd acquired a controlling interest in another Forfar based-textile firm, Moffat & Son Ltd, who operated Haugh Works in South Street. Another important Forfar textile firm was J & A Craik & Company, Linen and Jute Manufacturers, which was based at the Manor Works. Craiks was started in 1863 when James Craik obtained land in Forfar to build the Manor Works and the company survived until 1981, the year in which it became part of the Low and Bonar group. Craiks also owned Forfar Fabrics Ltd, incorporated in 1965, which amalgamated with Low & Bonar Textiles Limited in 1981. The jute manufacturers, John Lowson, Jnr & Co Ltd, also operated in Forfar, operating out of Victoria Works. Memorial plaque to the Polish Army in Forfar. In 1911 more than 20% of workers in Forfar were employed in the jute industry. Employment levels in this industry generally dramatically declined in other parts of Angus, including Dundee, during the next four decades. Notably in Dundee, the centre of the British jute industry, more than 40.4% of the working population had worked in the jute industry in 1911, but by 1951 this had fallen to just 18.5%. In Forfar, however this trend was not followed as percentage of the workforce employed in the jute industry had actually risen to 24.4% by 1951. In the town there is a metal plaque to General Sikorski and the Polish troops commemorating the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to the town on 7 March 1941. The metal plaque is located on a wall on Market Street below the Sheriff Court building. It was here on 7 March 1941 that the Royal couple, along with General Sikorski, took the salute in the march past of the Polish troops. Governance Forfar is a parish, town and former royal burgh. It is the county town of Angus, which was officially known as Forfarshire from the 18th century until 1929. The town is represented within Angus Council by the Forfar & District ward, from which four councillors are elected. The members elected from this ward are, as of 2012; Lynne Devine (Scottish National Party), Glennis Middleton (SNP), Colin Brown (Independent) and Ian McLaren (Independent). Transport =Road= The town is located just off the main A90 Dundee to Aberdeen road which since 1987 has bypassed the town, but once passed through it. =Rail= The town was served by Forfar railway station which ran goods and passenger lines until 3 September 1967 when it closed for passenger transport as part of the Beeching cuts. A goods line from Perth continued until 1982. The station was located on the main line of the Caledonian Railway from Glasgow Buchanan Street to Aberdeen, which was the furthest north link in the chain of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston. Lines also went to Dundee, Arbroath, Brechin and Kirriemuir. The station has been demolished and replaced by a small housing estate. However, a major locomotive shed remains and is in use for vehicle body manufacture. Some bridges and cuttings still survive but the site of the goods station, which was also the town's original railway station before the one near the county buildings was built, is now mainly residential properties. The nearest stations still open are in Dundee, Carnoustie and Arbroath, which are all around away. =Bus= There are Stagecoach Strathtay bus services to Dundee, Arbroath, Kirriemuir, Brechin and other places. Climate As with most of the British Isles, Forfar has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb). The nearest weather station to Forfar is located around 3 miles (5 km) north of Forfar, and is above sea level. Local sport The town is home to senior football club Forfar Athletic, who currently play in SPFL League One and two SJFA clubs, Forfar West End, who currently play in the East Region Super League and Forfar Albion, who currently play in the East Region Premier League North. Forfar Athletic's ground, Station Park, also plays host to matches featuring Dundee United Reserves. Youth and Women's Football is also available in the town, with Forfar Boys F.C (boys only), Lochside Boys F.Chttp://www.lochsideboysfc.co.uk (boys only) and Forfar Farmington F.C (boys, girls and women's) All the clubs have SFA Quality Mark Award at some level. Rugby Union is represented in the town by Strathmore Rugby Football Club, who play their home games at Inchmacoble Park, beside Forfar Loch. Strathmore Cricket Club, founded in 1862, has played at Lochside Park since 1873. Forfar Loch is home to Forfar Sailing Club. The town has a swimming pool and a separate dedicated leisure centre. It also has an ice rink which was built in the early 1990s and this is home to the local curling club. There are also many bowling clubs, and the Forfar Golf Club which is situated at Cunninghill to the east of the town. Angus Gliding Club operates at Roundyhill, between Glamis and Kirriemuir. It also has a newly built skatepark which is near the town's leisure centre. Education Forfar has three primary schools: *Whitehills Primary School on Service Road. Whitehills contains a Gaelic Medium Unit where pupils are educated exclusively through the medium of Scottish Gaelic. The head teachers are Coureen Peters & Elaine Gallon (acting). *Strathmore Primary School on St James' Road. The head teacher is Jennifer Garnes. *Langlands Primary School on Glamis Road. The school reopened in May 2009 after the original buildings were demolished and an extensive period of rebuilding and landscaping. The head teacher is Karen Tough. There is one secondary school in the town: *Forfar Academy on Taylor Street, one of the largest schools in Angus with a roll of around 1,200 pupils. In 2007, the Forfar-Carnoustie Schools Project made major changes to schools in Forfar, with closure of the following primary schools: Chapelpark Primary School on Academy Street (the former Forfar Academy) was closed in 2007 and pupils were re-located to Strathmore Primary and Whitehills Primary. The building continued in use as a school, initially by Whitehills Primary until their new school was completed in early 2008. It was then home to Langlands Primary, until the new school on that site was completed in May 2009. Some locals believe it would have made a great library/museum, but in spring of 2016 it was decided that it would be turned into an apartment block, it was completed in the summer of 2018. Kirkriggs Primary School in St. James' Road was closed in 2007. Pupils were re-located to Langlands until the new school on this site (Strathmore Primary) was completed in early 2008. Wellbrae Primary School closed in 2007. Pupils were sent to Chapelpark Primary School and later to Whitehills Primary School. The play areas of Wellbrae were all concrete. In 2016, it burned to the ground in an arson attack. Healthcare The local community hospital, the Whitehills Health and Community Care Centre, was built on the site of the old Whitehills Hospital building (the former hospital for infectious diseases) and opened in Spring 2005. The new hospital replaced Forfar Infirmary, formerly the town's main hospital, as well as Whitehills Hospital. The Infirmary has since been completely demolished. The Fyfe-Jamieson maternity hospital closed some time ago; it was across the road from the Forfar Academy, but the site has since been built over with houses. Places of worship Lowson Memorial Church Forfar has three Church of Scotland congregations: *East and Old Church, originally the parish kirk, with a tall slender spire, with steeple clock overlooking the town centre. It is a category B listed building and was refurbished in early 2017. The church is situated in the town centre and offers a mixture of traditional and contemporary worship. *Lowson Memorial Church, off Montrose Road. This is a category A listed church in late Scots Gothic style built in 1914 by A Marshall Mackenzie, who also designed Crathie Kirk. The church contains notable stained glass windows by Douglas Strachan. The church serves the east side of Forfar, and provides a mix of traditional and contemporary styles of worship. *St Margaret's Church, in the West High Street, originally a Free Kirk. It had been decided (by a Church of Scotland arbiter) that the East and Old Parish Church would close, and the congregation would be moving to St. Margaret's Church. This was brought back for discussion at Angus Presbytery due to a large vote against this decision. Now the East and Old and St Margaret's are to remain individual churches as they have always have been. The East & Old Church is built on the site of the original place of worship that some of the monks of Restenneth Priory built hundreds of years before the one today. The adjoining graveyard has famous 'residents' such as botanist George Don, quite a few scholars and a man who blamed the witches of Forfar for poisoning him after ill words were exchanged between them. Forfar East and Old Parish Church The steeple is a focal point of Forfar, visible when entering the town from any direction. Although abutting the East & Old building, it is owned by the 'Town' and is not formally part of the church property; it is all but certain to be retained following any disposal of the church building. The town also has churches of other denominations, including: * St John the Evangelist Scottish Episcopal Church, East High Street, designed by Sir R Rowand Anderson and consecrated in 1881. Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later to become Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, was confirmed in this church. *St Fergus Roman Catholic Church. * Forfar Community Church at Wellbraehead on part of the old school site. There is a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's witnesses  Other items of interest  The Stag Forfar Forfar Town Hall The town is traditionally identified with the Forfar Bridie, a meat pastry snack popular with locals and visitors, although strictly it comes from nearby Glamis. The Forfar Bridie has been featured on many TV programmes. A recipe for the Forfar bridie was also featured in \\"Maw Broon's Cookbook\\". Another feature of the town is the Forfar Loch Country Park, which is visited by locals as a walking venue. It is said that the Forfar Loch extended over much more of Forfar in the 1800s, going as far up as Orchardbank and Wellbrae. A drainage project brought the water level down. In about the same time period the loch was used to dump raw sewage; thankfully this practice is no longer continued: it is now treated sewage. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the town and surrounding area in 2004 (the first time in around 30 years) and again in 2011. HRH Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, visited the town in April 2012 to take the salute of the Black Watch during the regiment's homecoming parade, marking its return from a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan. The town lies in Strathmore and is situated just off the main A90 road between Perth and Aberdeen, with Dundee (the nearest city) being 13 miles (21 km) away. It is approximately 5 miles (8 km) from Glamis Castle, seat of the Bowes-Lyon family and ancestral home of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and where the late Princess Margaret, younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, was born in 1930. The town is near to the Angus Glens, including Glen Doll, Glen Clova and Glen Prosen, that are popular with skiers and hill walkers. The town holds many events throughout the year such as the bi-annual Forfar Mara-Fun, which raises money for charity, and the annual Forfar Food Festival highlighting some of the local food. There is also a monthly farmers' market. Agriculture and tourism are some of the town's major industries. It also acts as an administrative centre for Angus Council, with a new multimillion-pound office complex currently on the outskirts of the town. Forfar is also home to the Strathmore Mineral Water Co., Ltd., a bottled mineral water producer now run by AG Barr. The company's products are shipped worldwide. Forfar is also known for the \\"coo o Forfar\\". A householder left a tub of beer in the doorway to cool, and a passing cow drank it. When the owner of the cow was charged for the beer, a baillie ruled that if the beer was drunk at the doorway it was \\"deoch an doras\\" or \\"stirrup cup\\", to charge for which would be an insult to Scots hospitality. This became a byword: \\"Be like the coo o Forfar, an tak a stannin drink\\".Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable Public services Forfar Reid HallForfar and the surrounding area is supplied with water by Scottish Water from Lintrathen and Backwater reservoirs in Glen Isla. Electricity distribution is by Scottish Hydro Electric plc, part of the Scottish and Southern Energy group. Waste management is handled by Angus Council. From June 2014, there has been a comprehensive recycling service in place, succeeding the more limited kerbside recycling scheme introduced in 2005. Recyclable waste (encompassing paper, card, cans, plastics and glass) is now collected fortnightly, on alternate weeks with non-recyclable waste, with households having separate bins for each purpose. (Garden and food waste are also collected for separate processing.) Roughly two-thirds of non-recyclable material is sent to landfill at Angus Council's site at Lochhead, Forfar and the remainder sent for incineration (with energy recovery) outside the council area. A recycling centre is located at Queenswell Road. Items accepted include, steel and aluminium cans, cardboard, paper, electrical equipment, engine oil, fridges and freezers, garden waste, gas bottles, glass, liquid food and drinks cartons, plastic bottles, plastic carrier bags, rubble, scrap metal, shoes and handbags, spectacles, textiles, tin foil, wood and yellow pages. Angus council publishes details of where and how each product is processed. There are also glass banks at the Abbeygate and Tesco car parks. The Angus Council area had a recycling rate of 34.7% in 2007/08. Healthcare is supplied in the area by NHS Tayside. The nearest hospitals with accident and emergency departments are Arbroath Infirmary and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. Primary Health Care in Forfar is supplied by several practices, based at Ravenswood Surgery on New Road, Academy Medical Centre in Academy Street and Lour Road Group Practice. Forfar, along with the rest of Scotland is served by the Scottish Ambulance Service.

A founder-member of the party, he served in a number of Cabinet positions, most notably as the country's longest-serving Minister for Justice. Early life Born in Manchester, Gerald Boland was the son of James Boland and Kate Boland (n√©e Woods) and the brother of Harry Boland. His parents returned to Dublin shortly after his birth. After his national school education Boland attended the O'Brien Institute in Fairview. He left school at fifteen and became an apprentice fitter at Broadstone Station. Instead of attending to his studies to secure an engineering diploma, Boland took Irish language and history classes at night. In spite of this, he passed his engineering exams. Revolutionary years Boland was enrolled in the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) along with his younger brother Harry in 1904, following in the footsteps of his father Jim, uncle Jack and, probably, grandfather Patrick. He subsequently joined the Irish Volunteers when that organisation was established in 1913, serving in the same company as Arthur Griffith. When news broke out of the Easter Rising in 1916 Boland immediately left his job in Crooksling, however, he was bitterly disappointed when he found out that the order was countermanded. When the rebellion began in earnest on Easter Monday, he made his way to Jacob's Mill where he fought under Thomas MacDonagh. Following the official surrender, Boland was arrested and interned at Frongoch in Wales where he came into contact with other notable revolutionary leaders, including his brother Harry's friend Michael Collins. Boland was released after a general amnesty in December 1916, however, he remained involved in revolutionary circles. He was arrested and imprisoned in Belfast from May to December 1918 at a time when a number of his colleagues secured their release by winning seats in the 1918 general election. During the War of Independence, Boland commanded the Third Battalion, No. 2 (South Dublin) Brigade of the IRA and was known as 'Trotsky' for his left-wing views. He and his brothers were opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, though Gerald spent most of the Irish Civil War in prison. Political career =Beginnings= Following the end of the Civil War, during which his brother Harry was killed, Boland helped to build up Sinn F√©in as the main Republican party. While imprisoned, he secured election to D√°il √âireann for Roscommon at the 1923 general election, however, in keeping with the Sinn F√©in abstention policy he refused to take his seat. Upon his release, Boland became secretary of the party. By 1926, some TDs had become disillusioned with the policy of abstention that Sinn F√©in had espoused. Party leader √âamon de Valera proposed that the party abandon this policy and take their seats in the D√°il if changes were made to the oath of allegiance to the British monarch. His proposal was defeated and de Valera and his supporters, including Boland, left Sinn F√©in. Shortly after this split, a new party emerged called Fianna F√°il, with de Valera acting as leader and the other disillusioned Republican TDs joining. The new party also had an abstentionist policy, however, in 1927, a new law forced Fianna F√°il TDs to take the oath of allegiance and take their seats in the D√°il. A general election shortly after saw Fianna F√°il come within four seats of the ruling Cumann na nGaedheal party. The latter formed a coalition of sorts with the Farmers' Party and returned to government. =In cabinet= Boland as part of Fianna F√°il's first ever cabinet Following the 1932 general election Fianna F√°il formed a new government. Boland was appointed chief whip, a position which allowed him to attend cabinet meetings but not vote at them. Fianna F√°il remained in power with an increased mandate following the 1933 general election and Boland was promoted to the position of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. In spite of being the minister in charge of the postal service, Boland did not own a telephone until some time later. During his tenure, the postal service made considerable progress. It was also during this time that the Post Office became a paying concern. A cabinet reshuffle in 1936 saw Boland become Minister for Lands, before later taking on responsibility for Fisheries. The outbreak of The Emergency in 1939 resulted in a number of new cabinet appointments and Boland became Minister for Justice. He took over at a time when the IRA were enjoying a resurgence and Boland was charged with the task of crushing the organisation. Although Boland had been a member of the Old IRA, he had little sympathy and took powers to order the internment of hundreds of IRA members before introducing military courts and special criminal courts. In 1940, a number of imprisoned IRA members went on hunger strike, Boland, however, refused to grant their release. Two of the men eventually died, one of whom was the nephew of one of Boland's Fianna F√°il colleagues. These deaths sparked reprisals by the IRA on the Garda S√≠och√°na. Boland subsequently introduced tougher measures by setting up a military court with the death penalty with no provision for appeal except for a review by the government. In all, twelve men were found guilty with six of them facing death and the remaining six having their sentences changed to imprisonment. During the Emergency, Boland was also responsible for the detention of several foreign agents in pursuit of Ireland's strict policy of neutrality. Following Fianna F√°il's loss of power after the 1948 general election Boland became spokesperson on Justice and was reappointed Minister for Justice when the party returned to government in 1951. =Later years= Boland did not seek ministerial office in 1957 when Fianna F√°il returned to power after its defeat in 1954. Family continuity was retained when his son, Kevin, was instead appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Defence. At the 1961 general election, Boland faced electoral defeat for the first time in fourteen general election campaigns. In spite of losing his D√°il seat he subsequently secured election to Seanad √âireann. Four years later in 1965 he returned to the Seanad, this time as a nominee by the Taoiseach Se√°n Lemass. In 1970 the outbreak of the Arms Crisis saw Kevin Boland resign as minister and as secretary of Fianna F√°il in protest at the government's policy on Northern Ireland and in response to the sackings of Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney from the cabinet. Gerald Boland, in a similar protest, resigned as a vice- president and as a trustee of Fianna F√°il, although he remained a member of the party. He also articulated his loss of confidence in the leadership of Taoiseach Jack Lynch. Boland's grave in the Republican Plot in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. Death Gerald Boland died in Dublin at the age of 87 on 5 January 1973. His wife, Annie Boland, predeceased him in 1970.

He was first elected to D√°il √âireann in 1957 as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Fianna F√°il. He served as Minister for Defence (1957‚Äì1961), Minister for Social Welfare (1961‚Äì1965) and Minister for Local Government (1965‚Äì1970). He is one of six TDs appointed Minister on their first day in the D√°il. Early life and career Born in Dublin in 1917, Kevin Boland attended St. Joseph's C.B.S. in Fairview, leaving in 1933. He was the son of Gerald Boland, a founder-member of Fianna F√°il, and the nephew of Harry Boland. Despite this, the young Boland failed to get elected to D√°il √âireann on his first two attempts, standing in the Dublin County constituency at the 1951 general election and again at the 1954 election. Double success followed at the 1957 general election, when he was not only elected to the 16th D√°il but was appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Defence on his very first day in the D√°il. This was due to the retirement of his father who had served in every Fianna F√°il government since 1932. The Defence portfolio was largely considered a safe and uncontroversial position, so Boland made only a small impact. As a minister he proudly displayed a f√°inne (gold ring) on the lapel of his jacket, which indicated that he was able and willing to speak the Irish language. He frequently conducted his governmental business in Irish, which he was very good at; he had won awards for it in school. In 1961 he was moved from Defence to become the Minister for Social Welfare. He remained there until the retirement in 1966 of the Taoiseach, Se√°n Lemass, when Fianna F√°il faced the first leadership contest in its history. He was then appointed Minister for Local Government which post he held until he left government in 1970. The leadership race immediately erupted as a two-horse battle between Charles Haughey and George Colley. Both of these men epitomised the new kind of professional politician of the 1960s. Things changed when Neil Blaney indicated his interest in running. Boland supported him in his campaign, as both men hailed from the republican wing of the party. There was talk at one point of Boland himself entering the leadership race. In the end Jack Lynch was chosen as a compromise, and he became the new Taoiseach. Boland was made Minister for Local Government in the new cabinet. Arms Crisis In 1969 events in Northern Ireland caused political chaos over the border in the Republic of Ireland. It was the start of The Troubles in Northern Ireland and Fianna F√°il's policy with regard to the North was coming into question. One crisis meeting was held after another, in which the possibility of decisive action was discussed. The \\"hawks\\" in the cabinet urged a symbolic invasion of Northern Ireland to protect nationalists near the border, and to draw international attention, while the \\"doves\\", who ultimately prevailed, urged caution. These cabinet meetings were heated events. On one occasion Boland was alleged to have been so angry that he resigned not only his cabinet position but also his D√°il seat and went home to his farm in County Dublin to make hay. The resignations were rejected by the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, after a calming- down period. In what became known as the Arms Crisis two ministers, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, were sacked from the government in May 1970 for allegedly being involved in a plot to import arms for Republicans in the North. Boland resigned in solidarity with them and in protest about the government's position on the North. Later that year his criticism of the Taoiseach (whom Boland and many others within the Party maintained had authorized the arms importation) led to his expulsion from the Fianna F√°il party. One of Boland's most famous incidents took place at the Fianna F√°il Ardfheis (party conference) in 1971. Just before Jack Lynch's speech Boland stormed a nearby podium, interrupting Patrick Hillery in the middle of his speech. Boland openly defied the party leadership and his opponents, holding his arms wide open and shouting to the crowd, \\"Come on up and put me down.\\" While there was a lot of booing and clapping in an effort to drown him out, many of his supporters started cheering and chanting \\"We want Boland.\\" An enraged Patrick Hillery grabbed his microphone and famously replied, \\"If you want a fight you can have it...You can have Boland, but you can't have Fianna F√°il.\\" At this point the government supporters went ecstatic with cheering and Boland was carried out of the hall. Political decline and retirement After this episode Boland founded his own political party, Aontacht √âireann (Irish Unity). It won very little support and Boland himself failed to be elected to the D√°il in 1973, which effectively ended his political career. Boland and his colleagues resigned from the party in 1976 after it was taken over by a number of far-right individuals.O'Maolain, Ciaran. The Radical Right: A World Directory (Keesing's Reference Publications), pg 164. He remained an outspoken critic of the Republic's Northern Ireland policy, particularly the Sunningdale Agreement. He made one last attempt to reclaim a D√°il seat, standing unsuccessfully in the Dublin South-West constituency at the 1981 general election. He then retired from public life completely. In 1996, he sued the Irish Independent for libel after a 28 January 1993 article incorrectly stated that he had appeared before the court in the Arms Trial in 1970 and had been dismissed as a Minister by Taoiseach Jack Lynch. He was awarded ¬£75,000 in damages.

He was a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1948 to 1982. Early and personal life He was born in Wexford town. His father, Richard Corish, a well-known trade union official and Sinn F√©in member, had been elected to the Second D√°il shortly after the birth of his son and later joined the Labour Party, serving as a local and national politician until his death in 1945. He was educated locally at Wexford CBS and, in his youth, was a member of the 1st Wexford Scout troop (Scouting Ireland). At the age of nineteen, he joined the clerical staff of Wexford County Council. He was married to Phyllis, and they had three sons. Political career Corish was elected to D√°il √âireann as a Labour Party candidate in the Wexford by-election in 1945, necessitated by the death of his father who was the sitting TD. He took a seat on the fractured opposition benches, as Fianna F√°il's grip on power continued. He retained his seat at the 1948 general election in which Fianna F√°il was returned as the largest party in the D√°il once again. However, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the National Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and a number of Independent candidates all came together to form the first inter-party government. Corish was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Defence and Local Government. When the Second Inter-party Government was formed after the 1954 general election, Corish was appointed Minister for Social Welfare. In 1960 Corish succeeded William Norton as Labour Party leader. He introduced new policies which made the party more socialist in outlook and described the party program as Christian socialist. However, the party moved carefully because 'socialism' was still considered a dirty word in 1960s Ireland. Corish claimed that Ireland would be 'Socialist in the Seventies'. To a certain extent he was right because Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed a coalition government between 1973 and 1977.The Dynamics of Irish Politics (1989) page 85 Corish became T√°naiste and Minister for Health and Social Welfare. In 1977, the Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave called a general election, and Fianna F√°il was returned to power in a landslide victory. Corish resigned as leader of the Labour Party, having signalled his intent to do so before the election. He was succeeded as party leader by Frank Cluskey. Corish retired from politics completely at the February 1982 general election. Death Brendan Corish died on 17 February 1990 in Wexford at the age of 71.

Early period Constant was born in Amsterdam on 21 July 1920 as the first son of Pieter Nieuwenhuijs and Maria Cornelissen. Their second son, Jan Nieuwenhuys, was born a year later. Both sons became artists although their parents had no apparent interest in art.Constant, une r√©trospective, Mus√©e Picasso Antibes, 2001 As a young child Constant drew passionately and showed great talent. He read literature with a special preference for poetry and played musical instruments. During his teenage years he learned to sing and to read music while in the church choir at a Jesuit school. In his later years, greatly inspired by gypsy music, he only played improvised music. He played guitar, violin and at 45 years of age also mastered playing the cimbalon.Trudy van der Horst, Constant. De Late Periode, BnM uitgevers, Nijmegen, 2008 Constant painted his first oil painting, De Emma√ºsgangers, at age sixteen. It depicted the revelation of Jesus to two of his followers in Emmaus. With no money to buy materials he painted this painting on a jute sugar bag with pigments he had bought from a house painter. Many of Constant's early drawings and paintings are religiously inspired, due to his Jesuit schooling. Yet at the age of twenty Constant turned his back on Catholicism. After one year studying at the Kunstnijverheidsschool (Arts and Crafts School), Constant attended the Rijksakademie voor Beeldende Kunst (State Academy of Fine Arts) from 1939 to 1941. This education in craftmanship was put to use especially during his \\"New Babylon\\" period, when Constant built many constructions and models. Constant lived and worked in Bergen from 1941 to 1943. Through the Bergense School he was introduced to the work of Paul C√©zanne, which impacted him deeply, as evident in Zelfportret (Self Portrait), 1942.M. Hummelink, Apr√®s Nous La Libert√©. Constant en de artistieke avant- garde in de jaren 1946-1960, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2002 On 13 July 1942 he married Matie van Domselaer, the daughter of the composer Jakob van Domselaer. The city of Bergen was evacuated by the Germans in 1943 and so Constant and Matie moved back to Amsterdam. During this period Constant went into hiding and refrained from registering at the Kulturkammer (Nazi Chamber of Culture) to avoid the Arbeitseinsatz (labour supply for the Germans). Because of this he was unable to conventionally exercise his craft or to buy art supplies. To paint Constant used tablecloths and bed linen and had to rinse them out to start again. During the war Constant's brother in law, Jaap van Domselaer, moved into the apartment to hide from the 'Arbeitseinsatz.' He introduced Constant to Plato, Spinoza, Descartes, Kant, Hegel and Marx. Especially the latter provided great inspiration to Constant regarding his later ideas on art and society. During the winter famine of 1944 Constant's first son, Victor Nieuwenhuys, was born. After the war, Constant, his wife and son moved back to Bergen only to return to Amsterdam in 1946 where they lived in an apartment across from the zoo Artis. When the war ended Constant was able to expand and grow as an artist after years of captivity and limitations. He liberated himself artistically and experimented with multiple techniques of art-making. He was inspired by Cubism, especially by Georges Braque. In 1946 his daughter Martha was born, followed by his daughter Olga in 1948. CoBrA In 1946 Constant travelled to Paris for the first time where he met the young Danish painter Asger Jorn. The friendship between Jorn and Constant later formed the basis for the avant-garde movement CoBrA.Fanny Kelk, Constant, G.I.N. Gallery, Amsterdam 1977 July 1948 Constant founded Reflex ' with Corneille, Karel Appel and his brother Jan Nieuwenhuys. The first edition of the magazine Reflex was published with a manifesto written by Constant. For Constant art had to be experimental. He had deducted this from the French word 'exp√©rience' and believed that art springs from experience of the artist and is continuously changing. In the manifesto he stated that the process of creation is more important to the experimental artist than the work itself; it is a means to reach spiritual and mental enrichment. Also, the work of experimental artists is a mirror image of changes in the general perception of beauty.M. Hummelink, Constant. Paintings 1948-1995, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 1995 Constant, Corneille and Appel, three totally different characters and artists, were united in their quest for innovation. They exhibited their work together and were often seen together in the European art scene. The wanderlust of the three is especially notorious.De A van CoBrA in Woord en Beeld, Jaski Art Gallery, Amsterdam, 1998 Later in the year 1948 on the terrace of caf√© Notre Dame in Paris the Experimentele Groep in Holland linked up with Christian Dotremont and Joseph Noiret from Belgium and Asger Jorn from Denmark to form CoBrA, a name which was made by Dotremont, formed by the first letters of their hometowns: Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam. The members opposed aesthetics in painting and bourgeois art in general. Constant had already outlined their ideas in his manifesto in Reflex magazine. This manifesto contains another of his famous quotes: \\"A painting is not a structure of colours and lines, but an animal, a night, a cry, a man, or all of these together\\".Fanny Kelk, Constant, G.I.N. Gallery, Amsterdam 1977, p1 Constant was productive during the CoBrA period. White Bird (1948), Ladder (1949) and Scorched Earth I (1951) are some of his noted works from this period. At this time CoBrA published bulletin additional artists from several different disciplines joined their ranks. In 1948 Constant, together with poet Gerrit Kouwenaar, published a poetry album Goede Morgen Haan. Additionally there were two large CoBrA exhibitions, one in Amsterdam in 1949 and one in Li√®ge in 1951. The director of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (Municipal Museum of Amsterdam), Willem Sandberg, was very supportive of young artists and fully supported the CoBrA group by giving them seven large rooms to exhibit their work in. Most of the CoBrA works had been fairly small due to their lack of money and so Sandberg gave the artists an advance to create some larger works in the week before the exhibition. Constant, Corneille, Appel and Eug√®ne Brands created several large pieces of art that have become iconic for the movement. The architect Aldo van Eyck was commissioned to shape the exhibition. The works of art as well as the way they were presented give rise to harsh critique from press and public. A critic from Het Vrije Volk wrote: \\"Geklad, geklets en geklodder in het Stedelijk Museum\\" (\\"Smirch, twaddle and mess in the Municipal Museum\\"). The CoBrA artists were considered scribblers and con artists. In the Li√®ge exhibition in 1951, even larger than the Stedelijk exhibition, the CoBrA group dissolved itself and with its tenth edition bulletin publication. As Christian Dotremont, the international secretary, stated in Museum News in 1962 the group would rather \\"mourir en beaut√©\\" (die in beauty) than become a regular artist interest group. Situationist International Alderman Van der Berg received wire sculpture of Constant Nieuwenhuis, 1956 After CoBrA Constant's work became more abstract. Back in Amsterdam in the summer of 1952 he developed an interest in spatial architecture and three-dimensional works. With Aldo van Eyck, whom he met during his CoBrA time, he created a space for the exhibition 'Man and House' at the Urban Museum Amsterdam from 1952-1953. In 1954 he worked on a project with Gerrit Rietveld. Together they created a model house for warehouses de Bijenkorf. In 1952 Constant received a scholarship from the Arts Council of Great Britain to study in London for three months. There he met, amongst others, Henry Moore, Anthony Hill, Kenneth Martin, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Roger Hilton and Victor Pasmore. He found the art climate in London very welcoming. As opposed to Paris, Constant felt that art was judged more objectively. At that time Constant lived near Kensington Gardens and as he walked through the bombed city every day he started to wonder how people live and how cities should be built. His stay in London raised his awareness of how the constructions that surround us influence us. He felt that the constructions of his time were mostly practical, immensely dull and provided no room to develop playful and creative lifestyles. In the summer of 1956 Asger Jorn invited Constant to Alba, Piedmont, Italy, for a congress dedicated to 'Industry and the Fine Arts' initiated by 'Mouvement pour un Bauhaus Imaginiste' (International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus). At this congress Constant presented his lecture Demain la po√©sie logera la vie in which he pleaded for a free architecture which could stimulate a creative lifestyle rather than impede it.In 1952 Debord had founded the Lettrist International for which he was a writer, filmmaker and strategic activist. The 'Lettrist International' were also at the Alba congress and they pleaded for a unitary urbanism (the synthesis of art and technology). Later that year Constant visited Debord in Alba, which proved to be an inspiration for both. Debord wanted to establish an even more radical movement which would totally abandon the arena of fine art while solely focusing on questions of psychogeography, a total dissolution of boundaries between art and life. In 1957 he and Asger Jorn brought together the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus and the Lettrist International by establishing Situationist International. They specifically denied their status as an art movement.Libero Andreotti, Situacionistes, Situationists, Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, 1996 Constant did not join SI at that time. He objected to the SI on the ground that the movement seemed to be established mainly by artists who have their own interest at heart more than a common goal. When SI openly pleaded for 'unitary urbanism', as defined by Constant and Debord, Constant joined. An intensive correspondence between him and Debord followed. Constant wrote several theoretical articles for the French SI journal and staged events at several museums in Paris as well as the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where he showed his New Babylon series in 1959. The success of the New Babylon show in 1959 prompted SI to plan a group exhibition there in April‚ÄìMay 1960. This exhibition would never take place. Disagreements in the group resulted in a split and several expulsions. In 1960 Constant left the group for the same reason he initially objected to joining. By 1961 no one remained of the original artistic core or tendency except Debord himself. though members more allied to the SI's political tendency remained. New Babylon Back in Amsterdam after his stay in London, Nieuwenhuys started to focus mainly on architecture and the urban environment. The focal point of his work was finding out what potential added value art can provide in intensifying daily life, in which there is room for creative expression. He abandoned painting to work solely on his New Babylon project from 1956 to 1974. With New Babylon Nieuwenhuys envisioned a \\"world wide city for the future\\" where land is owned collectively, work is fully automated and the need to work replaced with a nomadic life of creative play. New Babylon is inhabited by homo ludens, who, freed from labor, will not have to make art, for he can be creative in the daily practice of his life.Drawing Papers 3, Another City for Another Life: Constant's New Babylon. An Homage to Constant by Catherine de Zegher, The Drawing Center, New York, 1999, p.3 In Nieuwenhuys' own words: > The project of New Babylon only intends to give the minimum conditions for a > behaviour that must remain as free as possible. Any restriction of the > freedom of movement, any limitation with regard to the creation of mood and > atmosphere, has to be avoided. Everything has to remain possible, all is to > happen, the environment has to be created by the activity of life, and not > inversely.Constant, The Decomposition of the Artist: Five Texts by Constant, > The Drawing Center, New York, 1999, a12 The New Babylon project consisted of a series of models, constructions, maquettes, collages, drawings, graphics and texts expressing Constant's theories of urban development and social interaction. A few examples of spatial constructions for which he used modern materials like stainless steel, aluminum and perspex are Het Ruimtecircus (1956) (Spatial Circus) and Het Zonneschip (1956) (Sunvessel). In 1974 the New Babylon project officially came to an end with a large exhibition in the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. Because he lacked room to store the vast collection of constructions, maquettes, maps and structures he sold them all to the museum. In 1999 Constant's New Babylon: City for Another Life, opened at the Drawing Center in New York. It was his first solo exhibition in the United States and was curated by Mark Wigley. There was a symposium conducted in conjunction with the exhibition. According to the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, Nieuwenhuys has made a lot of architects think with his New Babylon: \\"He was an example of courage\\". Colorism Constant returned to painting, watercoloring and graphics in 1969. Until the mid-1970s, the subjects of his imaginary world New Babylon still crowded his work. However, more and more, he was inspired by contemporary and political issues, including such things as the Vietnam War, African famine and Kosovo refugees. Marxism was a strong influence. Rudi Fuchs said in his foreword to the Catalogue of Constant Paintings in 1995: \\"there are people who consider Constant's later work as a return to tradition. I, however, do not share this opinion. Because I consider his later development from the 1970s as greater penetration into the garden of painting.\\"M. Hummelink, Constant. Paintings 1948-1995, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 1995, p.4 In the tradition of the Venetian Renaissance painters, Titian and Tintoretto, Constant applied himself to the technique of colorism. Following this technique the artist doesn't make use of charcoal or pencil sketches but applies colour directly on the canvas with the paintbrush, constructing soft transitions instead of sharp contours. The most important feature of this technique is the way light is expressed in the painting by integrating it into the colour. This technique is laborious. The painting comes to life layer by layer. Constant painted with oil on canvas and every layer he applied then needed to dry. In this period Constant produced a mere three to four paintings per year.Trudy van der Horst, Constant, De Late Periode, BnM uitgevers, 2008 Public space Constant Nieuwenhuis fountain - 1970, Kooiplein in Leiden In 1949 Constant decorated a garden wall in Tibirkelunde, Sjelland, Denmark. In 1963 The Gate of Constant was placed at the entry of a sports park in the west side of Amsterdam. Constant designed the forty-foot-high concrete structure as a commission for the Municipality of Amsterdam. For almost three decades the structure adorned the entry in anonymity until Rita Doets, a former employee of the municipality, left money in her legacy to construct an information sign next to the gate. Constant's widow, Trudy Nieuwenhuijs, was present at the inauguration. In 1966 Constant designed a fountain for the Kooiplein in Leiden. For years the structure didn't function and slowly withered. When the square was redesigned in 1999, the fountain was repaired. New equipment made sure that the shoppers were not bothered by the water. Death Constant died on 1 August 2005 and was survived by his son and his three daughters, and by his widow and her daughter.

The history of Sesame Street has reflected changing attitudes to developmental psychology, early childhood education, and cultural diversity. Featuring Jim Henson's Muppets, animation, live shorts, humor and celebrity appearances, it was the first television program of its kind to base its content and production values on laboratory and formative research, and the first to include a curriculum \\"detailed or stated in terms of measurable outcomes\\".Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 9 Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversyMorrow, p. 3 and high ratings. By its 40th anniversary in 2009, Sesame Street was broadcast in over 120 countries, and 20 independent international versions had been produced. It has won eleven Grammys and over 150 Emmys in its history‚Äîmore than any other children's show. The show was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Corporation vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children's television show that would \\"master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them\\", such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of $8 million from the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation and the U.S. federal government to create and produce a new children's television show. By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily, and several studies showed it was having a positive educational impact. The cast and crew expanded during this time, including the hiring of women in the crew and additional minorities in the cast. In 1981, the federal government withdrew its funding, so the CTW turned to other sources, such as its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing and foreign income. During the 1980s, Sesame Streets curriculum expanded to include topics such as relationships, ethics and emotions. Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast and crew, most notably the death of Will Lee‚Äîwho played Mr. Hooper‚Äîand the marriage of Luis and Maria. In recent decades, Sesame Street has faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in the viewing habits of young children, more competition from other shows, the development of cable television and a drop in ratings. After the turn of the 21st century, the show made major structural adaptations, including changing its traditional magazine format to a narrative format. Because of the popularity of the Muppet Elmo, the show incorporated a popular segment known as \\"Elmo's World\\". In late 2015, in response to \\"sweeping changes in the media business\\", HBO began airing first-run episodes of Sesame Street. Episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. As of its 50th anniversary in 2019, Sesame Street has produced over 4,500 episodes, 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel had almost 5 million subscribers, and the show had 24 million followers on social media. Background In the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week;Hellman, p. 50 programs created for them were widely criticized for being too violent and for reflecting commercial values.Borgenicht, p. 9 Producer Joan Ganz Cooney called children's programming a \\"wasteland\\", and she was not alone in her criticism. Many children's television programs were produced by local stations, with little regard for educational goals, or cultural diversity.Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 7See Davis, pp. 30‚Äì41, and Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 6‚Äì7, for a discussion about the state of children's television programming. As writer David Borgenicht stated, the use of children's programming as an educational tool was \\"unproven\\" and \\"a revolutionary concept\\". According to children's media experts Edward Palmer and Shalom M. Fisch, children's television programs of the 1950s and 1960s duplicated \\"prior media forms\\".Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 6 For example, they tended to show simple shots of a camera's-eye view of a location filled with children, or they recreated storybooks with shots of book covers and motionless illustrated pages. The hosts of these programs were \\"insufferably condescending\\", though one exception was Captain Kangaroo, created and hosted by Bob Keeshan, which author Michael Davis described as having a \\"slower pace and idealism\\" that most other children's shows lacked.Davis, p. 30 Early childhood educational research had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned higher grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families had fewer resources than children from higher-income families to prepare them for school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested \\"substantially lower\\"Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 5 than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school.Lesser & Schneider in Fisch & Truglio, p. 26 The field of developmental psychology had grown during this period, and scientists were beginning to understand that changes in early childhood education could increase children's cognitive growth. Because of these trends in education, along with the great societal changes occurring in the United States during this era, the time was ripe for the creation of a show like Sesame Street.Morrow, p. 5 Pre-production (1966‚Äì1969) =Beginnings= Since 1962, Cooney had been producing talk shows and documentaries at educational television station WNDT, and in 1966 had won an Emmy for a documentary about poverty in America.O'Dell, p. 68 In early 1966, Cooney and her husband Tim hosted a dinner party at their apartment in New York; experimental psychologist Lloyd Morrisett, who has been called Sesame Street's \\"financial godfather\\",Davis, p. 317 and his wife Mary were among the guests. Cooney's boss, Lewis Freedman, whom Cooney called \\"the grandfather of Sesame Street\\", also attended the party, as did their colleague Anne Bower.Davis, pp. 11‚Äì13 As a vice-president at the Carnegie Corporation, Morrisett had awarded several million dollars in grants to organizations that educated poor and minority preschool children. Morrisett and the other guests felt that even with limited resources, television could be an effective way to reach millions of children.Hellman, p. 51 Lloyd Morrisett, co-creator of Sesame Street and co- founder of Sesame Workshop, shown here in 2010. A few days after the dinner party, Cooney, Freedman, and Morrisett met at the Carnegie Corporation's offices to make plans; they wanted to harness the addictive power of television for their own purposes, but did not yet know how. The following summer, despite Cooney's lack of experience in the field of education, Morrisett hired her to conduct research on childhood development, education and media, and she visited experts in these fields across the United States and Canada. She researched their ideas about the viewing habits of young children and wrote a report on her findings.Davis, p. 65 Cooney's study, titled \\"The Potential Uses of Television for Preschool Education\\", spelled out how television could be used to help young children, especially from low- income families, prepare for school.Finch, p. 53Truglio & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. xvi The focus on the new show was on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but Cooney and the show's creators recognized that in order to achieve the kind of success they wanted, it had to be equally accessible to children of all socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. At the same time, they wanted to make the show so appealing to inner-city children that it would help them learn as much as children with more educational opportunities.Lesser, p. 81Lesser, p. 8 Cooney proposed that public television, even though it had a poor track record in attracting inner-city audiences,Lesser, p. 28 could be used to improve the quality of children's programming. She suggested using the television medium's \\"most engaging traits\\",Cooney in Fisch & Truglio, p. xi including high production values, sophisticated writing, and quality film and animation, to reach the largest audience possible. In the words of critic Peter Hellman, \\"If [children] could recite Budweiser jingles from TV, why not give them a program that would teach the ABCs and simple number concepts?\\" Cooney wanted to create a program that would spread values favoring education to nonviewers‚Äîincluding their parents and older siblings, who tended to control the television set.Gladwell, p. 89 To this end, she suggested that humor directed toward adults be included,Gladwell, p. 112 which, as Lesser reported, \\"may turn out to be a pretty good system in forcing the young child to stretch to understand programs designed for older audiences\\".Lesser, p. 80 Cooney also believed cultural references and guest appearances by celebrities would encourage parents and older siblings to watch the show together. =Development= As a result of Cooney's proposal, the Carnegie Corporation awarded her a $1 million grant in 1968 to establish the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 3 to provide support to the creative staff of the new show.Lesser, p. 237 Morrisett, who was responsible for fundraising,Davis, p. 105 procured additional grants from the United States federal government, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Ford Foundation for the CTW's initial budget, which totaled $8 million; obtaining funding from this combination of government agencies and private foundations protected the CTW from economic pressures experienced by commercial networks.Lesser, p. 17 Sesame Street was an expensive program to produce because the creators decided they needed to compete with other programs that invested in professional, high quality production.Lesser, p. 103 Jim Henson, (1989), creator of the Muppets. Henson was initially reluctant to become involved with a children's show, but agreed to do so. The producers spent eighteen months preparing the new show, something unprecedented in children's television.Lesser, p. 151 The show had a budget of $28,000 per episode. After being named executive director of the CTW, Cooney began to assemble a team of producers: Jon Stone was responsible for writing, casting, and format; David Connell took over animation and volume; and Samuel Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team.Davis, p. 147 Stone, Connell, and Gibbon had worked on Captain Kangaroo together, but were not involved in children's television when Cooney recruited them.Davis, pp. 130‚Äì145 At first, Cooney planned to divide the show's production of five episodes a week among several teams, but she was advised by CBS vice-president Mike Dann to use only one. This production team was led by Connell, who had gained experience producing many episodes in a short period of time, a process called \\"volume production\\", during his eleven years working on Captain Kangaroo.Hellman, p. 52Lesser, p. 36 The CTW hired Harvard University professor Gerald S. Lesser to design the show's educational objectives and establish and lead a National Board of Advisers.Lesser, p. 5 Instead of providing what Lesser called \\"window dressing\\",Lesser, p. 43 the Board actively participated in the construction of educational goals and creative methods.Lesser, pp. 42‚Äì43 At the Board's direction, Lesser conducted five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston and New York City in summer 1968.Lesser & Schneider in Fisch & Truglio, p. 27See Lesser, pp. 42‚Äì59, for Lesser's lengthy description of the seminars. The purpose of the seminars was to ascertain which school-preparation skills to emphasize in the new show. The producers gathered professionals with diverse backgrounds to obtain ideas for educational content. They reported that the seminars were \\"widely successful\\", and resulted in long and detailed lists of possible topics for inclusion in the Sesame Street curriculum; in fact, the seminars produced more suggested educational objectives than could ever be addressed by one television series.Lesser, pp. 61‚Äì62 Instead of focusing on the social and emotional aspects of development, the producers decided to follow the suggestions of the seminar participants and emphasize cognitive skills, a decision they felt was warranted by the demands of school and the wishes of parents. The objectives developed during the seminars were condensed into key categories: symbolic representation, cognitive processes, and the physical and social environment.Lesser & Schneider in Fisch & Truglio, p. 28See Lesser, pp. 62‚Äì74 for a detailed list of the CTW's learning objectives. The seminars set forth the new show's policy about race and social issuesDavis, p. 142 and provided the show's production and creative team with \\"a crash course\\" in psychology, child development, and early childhood education.Davis, p. 143 They also marked the beginning of Jim Henson's involvement in Sesame Street. Cooney met Henson at one of the seminars; Stone, who was familiar with Henson's work, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should \\"make do without puppets\\". The producers and writers decided to build the new show around a brownstone or an inner-city street, a choice Davis called \\"unprecedented\\".Davis, p. 156 Stone was convinced that in order for inner-city children to relate to Sesame Street, it needed to be set in a familiar place. Despite its urban setting, the producers decided to avoid depicting more negativity than what was already present in the child's environment. Lesser commented, \\"[despite] all its raucousness and slapstick humor, Sesame Street became a sweet show, and its staff maintains that there is nothing wrong in that\\".Lesser, p. 95 The new show was called the \\"Preschool Educational Television Show\\" in promotional materials; the producers were unable to agree on a name they liked and waited until the last minute to make a decision. In a short, irreverent promotional film shown to public television executives, the producers parodied their \\"naming dilemma\\".Gikow, p. 30 The producers were reportedly \\"frantic for a title\\"; they finally settled on the name that they least disliked:Lesser, p. 168 Sesame Street, inspired by Ali Baba's magical phrase, although there were concerns that it would be too difficult for young children to pronounce. Stone was one of the producers who disliked the name, but, he said, \\"I was outvoted, for which I'm deeply grateful\\".Finch, p. 55 The responsibility of casting for Sesame Street fell to Jon Stone, who set out to form a cast where white actors were in the minority. He did not begin auditions until spring 1969, several weeks before five test shows were due to be produced. He filmed the auditions, and Palmer took them into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the \\"most enthusiastic thumbs up\\" were cast. For example, Loretta Long was chosen to play Susan when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of \\"I'm a Little Teapot\\".Davis, p. 172 Stone reported that casting was the only aspect that was \\"just completely haphazard\\".Davis, p. 167 Most of the cast and crew found jobs on Sesame Street through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers. Stone hired Bob McGrath (an actor and singer best known at the time for his appearances on Mitch Miller's sing-along show on NBC) to play Bob, Will Lee to play Mr. Hooper, and Garrett Saunders to play Gordon. =Use of research in production= Sesame Street was the first children's television program that used a curriculum with clear and measurable outcomes, and was the first to use research in the creation of the show's design and content.Lesser, p. 154 Research in Sesame Street had three functions: to test if the show was appealing to children, to discover what could be done to make the show more appealing, and to report to the public and the investors what impact the show had on its young viewers. Ten to fifteen percent of the show's initial budget of $8 million was devoted to research,Lesser, p. 132 and researchers were always present in the studio during the show's filming. A \\"Writer's Notebook\\" was developed to assist writers and producers in translating the research and production goals into televised material; this connected the show's curriculum goals and its script development.Lesser, p. 101 The Muppet characters were created to fill specific curriculum needs: Oscar the Grouch, for example, was designed to teach children about their positive and negative emotions.Borgenicht, p. 16 Lesser called the collaboration between researchers and producers, as well as the idea of using television as an educational tool, the \\"CTW model\\".Lesser, p. 133 Cooney agreed, commenting, \\"From the beginning, we‚Äîthe planners of the project‚Äîdesigned the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners\\". Welcome sign at entrance to ETS headquarters. The ETS conducted the early summative studies about Sesame Street. The producers of Sesame Street believed education through television was possible if they captured and sustained children's attention;Gladwell, p. 100Lesser, p. 116 this meant the show needed a strong appeal. Edward Palmer, the CTW's first Director of ResearchCooney in Fisch & Truglio, p. xii and the man Cooney credited with building the CTW's foundation of research,Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 4 was one of the few academics in the late 1960s researching children's television.Gladwell, p. 102 He was recruited by the CTW to test if the curricula developed in the Boston seminars were reaching their audience effectively. Palmer was also tasked with designing and executing the CTW's in- house research and with working with the Educational Testing Service (ETS). His research was so crucial to Sesame Street that Gladwell asserted, \\"... without Ed Palmer, the show would have never lasted through the first season\\". Palmer and his team's approach to researching the show's effectiveness was innovative; it was the first time formative research was conducted in this way.Fisch & Bernstein in Fisch & Truglio, p. 40 For example, Palmer developed \\"the distractor\\", which he used to test if the material shown on Sesame Street captured young viewers' attention. Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory; they were shown an episode on a television monitor and a slide show next to it. The slides would change every seven seconds, and researchers recorded when the children's attention was diverted away from the episode.Lesser, p. 153Gladwell, pp. 102‚Äì103 They were able to record almost every second of Sesame Street this way; if the episode captured the children's interest 80‚Äì90% of the time, the producers would air it, but if it only tested 50%, they would reshoot. By the fourth season of the show, the episodes rarely tested below 85%.Gladwell, p. 103 =July 1969 test episodes= During the production of Sesame Street's first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969.Lesser, p. 164 The results were \\"generally very positive\\";Fisch & Bernstein in Fisch & Truglio , p. 39 children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and their attention was sustained over the full hour. However, the researchers found that although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the \\"Street\\" segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.Gladwell, p. 105 The Street scenes, as Palmer described them, were \\"the glue\\" that \\"pulled the show together\\",Gladwell, p. 106 so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. On the basis of their experience on Captain Kangaroo, Cannell, Stone, and Gibbon thought the experts' opinions were \\"nonsense\\";Davis, p. 363 Cooney agreed. Lesser called their decision to defy the recommendations of their advisers \\"a turning point in the history of Sesame Street\\". The producers reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors,Fisch & Bernstein, pp. 39‚Äì40 specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird, who became two of the show's most enduring characters. In addition, the producers found Saunders' role as Gordon not to be as likable by children watching the show, resulting in the character being recast by Matt Robinson, who was initially the show's filmed segments producer. These test episodes were directly responsible for what Gladwell called \\"the essence of Sesame Street‚Äîthe artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults\\". Premiere and first season (1969‚Äì1970) Two days before the show's premiere, a thirty- minute preview entitled This Way to Sesame Street aired on NBC. The show was financed by a $50,000 grant from Xerox. Written by Stone and produced by CTW publicist Bob Hatch, it was taped the day before it aired.Davis, p. 189 Newsday called the preview \\"a unique display of cooperation between commercial and noncommercial broadcasters\\". Joan Ganz Cooney, co-creator of Sesame Street and co-founder of the Children's Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop), in 1985 Sesame Street premiered November 10, 1969. It was widely praised for its originality, and was well received by parents as well as children.Davis, p. 197 The show reached only 67.6% of the nation, but earned a 3.3 Nielsen rating, meaning 1.9 million households and 7 million children watched it each day. In Sesame Street's first season, the ETS reported that children who watched the show scored higher in tests than less-frequent viewers.Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, p. 87 In November 1970, the cover of Time magazine featured Big Bird, who had received more fan mail than any of the show's human hosts. The magazine declared, \\"... It is not only the best children's show in TV history, it is one of the best parents' shows as well\\".Davis, p. 198 An executive at ABC, while recognizing that Sesame Street was not perfect, said the show \\"opened children's TV to taste and wit and substance\\" and \\"made the climate right for improvement\\". Other reviewers predicted commercial television would be forced to improve its children's programming, something that did not substantially occur until the 1990s.Lesser, pp. 168‚Äì169Morrow, p. 127 Sesame Street won a Peabody Award, three Emmys, and the Prix Jeunesse award in 1970. President Richard Nixon sent Cooney a congratulatory letter,Davis, pp. 198-199 and Dr. Benjamin Spock predicted the program would result in \\"better-trained citizens, fewer unemployables in the next generation, fewer people on welfare, and smaller jail populations\\". Sesame Street was not without its detractors; there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season.Lesser, p. 174See Lesser, pp. 175‚Äì201, for his response to the early critics of Sesame Street. In May 1970, a state commission in Mississippi voted to not air the show on the state's newly launched public television network. A member of the commission leaked the vote to The New York Times, stating that \\"Mississippi was not yet ready\\" for the show's integrated cast. Cooney called the ban \\"a tragedy for both the white and black children of Mississippi\\". The state commission reversed its decision after the vote made national news. The producers of Sesame Street made a few changes in its second season. Segments that featured children became more spontaneous and allowed more impromptu dialogue, even when it meant cutting other segments. Since federal funds had been used to produce the show, more segments of the population insisted upon being represented on Sesame Street; for example, the show was criticized by Hispanic groups for the lack of Latino characters in the early years of production. A committee of Hispanic activists, commissioned by the CTW in 1970, called Sesame Street \\"racist\\" and said the show's bilingual aspects were of \\"poor quality and patronizing\\". The CTW responded to these critics by hiring Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers. By the mid-70s, Morrow reported that \\"the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words\\".Morrow, p. 155 While New York Magazine reported criticism of the presence of strong single women in the show, organizations like the National Organization for Women (NOW) expressed concerns that the show needed to be \\"less male-oriented\\". For example, members of NOW took exception to the character Susan, who was originally a housewife.Davis, p. 213 They complained about the lack of, as Morrow put it, \\"credible female Muppets\\" on the show; Morrow reported that Henson's response was that \\"women might not be strong enough to hold the puppets over the long hours of taping\\".Morrow, p. 84 The show's producers responded by making Susan a nurse and by hiring a female writer. 1970s By the mid-1970s, Sesame Street, according to Davis, had become \\"an American institution\\".Davis, p. 220 ETS conducted two \\"landmark\\"Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, p. 88 studies of the show in 1970 and 1971 which demonstrated Sesame Street had a positive educational impact on its viewers. The results of these studies led to the producers securing funding for the show over the next several years, and provided the CTW with additional ways to promote it. By the second season, Sesame Street had become so popular that the design of ETS' experiments to track the show's educational outcomes had to be changed:Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, p. 86 instead of comparing viewers with a control group of non-viewers, the researchers studied the differences among levels of viewing. They found that children who watched Sesame Street more frequently had a higher comprehension of the material presented.Mielke in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 86‚Äì87 Producer Jon Stone was instrumental in guiding the show during these years. According to Davis, Stone \\"gave Sesame Street its soul\\"; without him \\"there would not have been Sesame Street as we know it\\".Davis, p. 271 Frank Oz regarded Stone as \\"the father of Sesame Street\\",Gikow, p. 24 and Cooney considered Stone \\"the key creative talent on Sesame Street and \\"probably the most brilliant writer of children's material in America\\". Stone was able to recognize and mentor talented people for his crew. He actively hired and promoted women during a time when few women earned top production jobs in television. His policies provided the show with a succession of female producers and writers, many of whom went on to lead the boom in children's programming at Nickelodeon, the Disney Channel, and PBS in the 1990s and 2000s. One of these women was Dulcy Singer, who later became the first female executive producer of Sesame Street.Davis, p. 221 After the show's initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources.Davis, p. 203 The CTW decided to depend upon government agencies and private foundations to develop the show. This would protect it from the financial pressures experienced by commercial networks, but created problems in finding continued support. This era in the show's history was marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales for its funding.O'Dell, pp. 73‚Äì74 Henson owned the trademarks to the Muppet characters: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control over all products and product decisions; any product line associated with the show had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during its airings.Davis, pp. 203‚Äì205 The CTW approached Random House to establish and manage a non- broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named Christopher Cerf to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the curriculum.Davis, p. 205 In 1980, the CTW began to produce a touring stage production based upon the show, written by Connell and performed by the Ice Follies. Shortly after the premiere of Sesame Street, the CTW was approached by producers, educators, and officials in other nations, requesting that a version of the show be aired in their countries. Former CBS executive Mike Dann left commercial television to become vice-president of the CTW and Cooney's assistant; Dann began what Charlotte Cole, vice president for the CTW's International Research department, called the \\"globalization\\" of Sesame Street. A flexible model was developed, based upon the experiences of the creators and producers of the original show. The shows came to be called \\"co- productions\\", and they contained original sets, characters, and curriculum goals. Depending upon each country's needs and resources, different versions were produced, including dubbed versions of the original show and independent programs. By 2016, 39 different coproductions have been created and produced, \\"each with its own local name, its own Muppets..., and its own educational objectives designed to meet the educational needs of local children\\". By its 50th anniversary in 2019, 150 million children viewed over 150 versions of Sesame Street in 70 languages. The New York Times reported in 2005 that income from the CTW's international co-productions of the show was $96 million. Sesame Street's cast expanded in the 1970s, better fulfilling the show's original goal of greater diversity in both human and Muppet characters. The cast members who joined the show were Sonia Manzano (Maria), who also wrote for the show,Gikow, p. 74 Northern Calloway (David), Alaina Reed (Olivia), Emilio Delgado (Luis), Linda Bove (Linda), and Buffy Sainte-Marie (Buffy).Davis, pp. 226‚Äì237 In 1973, Roscoe Orman became the third actor to play Gordon. New Muppet characters were introduced during the 1970s. Count von Count was created and performed by Jerry Nelson, who also voiced Mr. Snuffleupagus, a large Muppet that required two puppeteers to operate.Davis, pp. 239-240 Richard Hunt, who, in Jon Stone's words, joined the Muppets as a \\"wild-eyed 18-year-old and grew into a master puppeteer and inspired teacher\\", created Gladys the Cow, Forgetful Jones, Don Music, and the construction worker Sully. Telly Monster was performed by Brian Muehl; Marty Robinson took over the role in 1984.Davis, p. 245 Frank Oz created Cookie Monster. Matt Robinson created the \\"controversial\\" (as Davis called him) character Roosevelt Franklin.See Davis, pp. 247‚Äì250, for a discussion about Roosevelt Franklin. Fran Brill, the first female puppeteer for the Muppets, joined the Henson organization in 1970,Davis, p. 251 and originated the character Prairie Dawn. In 1975, Henson created The Muppet Show, which was filmed and produced in London; Henson brought many of the Muppet performers with him, so opportunities opened up for new performers and puppets to appear on Sesame Street.Gikow, p. 90 The CTW wanted to attract the best composers and lyricists for Sesame Street, so songwriters like Joe Raposo, the show's music director, and writer Jeff Moss were allowed to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. The writers earned lucrative profits, and the show was able to sustain public interest.Davis, p. 256 Raposo's \\"I Love Trash\\", written for Oscar the Grouch, was included on the first album of Sesame Street songs, The Sesame Street Book & Record, recorded in 1970.Davis, p. 255 Moss' \\"Rubber Duckie\\", sung by Henson for Ernie, remained on the Top-40 Billboard charts for seven weeks that same year.Whitburn, p. 259 Another Henson song, written by Raposo for Kermit the Frog in 1970, \\"Bein' Green\\", which Davis called \\"Raposo's best- regarded song for Sesame Street\\", was later recorded by Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles. \\"Sing\\", which became a hit for The Carpenters in 1973, and \\"Somebody Come and Play\\", were also written by Raposo for Sesame Street.Whitburn, p. 788Davis, pp. 257‚Äì258 In 1978, Stone and Singer produced and wrote the show's first special, the \\"triumphant\\" Christmas Eve on Sesame Street,Davis, p. 273 which included an O Henry-inspired storyline in which Bert and Ernie gave up their prized possessions‚ÄîErnie his rubber ducky and Bert his paper clip collection‚Äîto purchase each other Christmas gifts. Bert and Ernie were played by Frank Oz and Jim Henson, who in real life were, like the puppets they played, colleagues and friends. To Davis, this demonstrated the puppeteers' remarkable ability to play \\"puppetry's Odd Couple\\".Davis, p. 275 In Singer's opinion, the special‚Äîwhich Stone also wrote and directed‚Äîdemonstrated Stone's \\"soul\\", and Sonia Manzano called it a good example of what Sesame Street was all about. The special won Emmys for Stone and Singer in 1979, beating, among others, the independently produced A Special Sesame Street Christmas for CBS.Gikow, p. 84 By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show.Davis, p. 277 1980s In 1984, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deregulated commercial restrictions on children's television. Advertising during network children's programs almost doubled, and deregulation resulted in an increase in commercially oriented programming. Sesame Street was successful during this era of deregulation despite the fact that the United States government terminated all federal funding of the CTW in 1981. By 1987, the show was earning $42 million per year from its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing, and foreign income‚Äîenough to cover two-thirds of its expenses. Its remaining budget, plus a $6 million surplus, was covered by revenue from its PBS broadcasts. According to Davis, Sesame Streets second decade was spent \\"turning inward, expanding its young viewers' world\\". The show's curriculum grew to include more \\"affective\\" teaching‚Äîrelationships, ethics, and positive and negative emotions. Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew. In 1982, Will Lee, who had played Mr. Hooper since the show's premiere, died. For the 1983 season, the show's producers and research staff decided they would explain Mr. Hooper's death to their preschool audience, instead of recasting the role: the writer of that episode, Norman Stiles, said, \\"We felt we owed something to a man we respected and loved\\". They convened a group of psychologists, religious leaders, and other experts in the field of grief, loss, and separation. The research team conducted a series of studies before the episode to ascertain if children were able to understand the messages they wanted to convey about Mr. Hooper's death; the research showed most children did understand. Parents' reactions to the episode were, according to the CTW's own reports, \\"overwhelmingly positive\\".Truglio, et al. in Fisch & Truglio, p. 74 The episode, which won an Emmy,Gikow, p. 282 aired on Thanksgiving Day in 1983 so parents could be home to discuss it with their children. Author David Borgenicht called the episode \\"poignant\\";Borgenicht, p. 42 Davis called it \\"a landmark broadcast\\"Davis, p. 284 and \\"a truly memorable episode, one of the show's best\\".Davis, p. 281 Caroll Spinney, who played Big Bird and who drew the caricatures prominently used in the episode, reported the cast and crew were moved to tears during filming.For a description of this episode, see Borgenicht, p. 42, and Davis, pp. 281‚Äì285. In the mid-1980s, Americans were becoming more aware of the prevalence of child abuse, so Sesame Streets researchers and producers decided to \\"reveal\\" Mr. Snuffleupagus in 1985. \\"Snuffy\\" had never been seen by any of the adults on the show and was considered Big Bird's \\"imaginary friend\\".Borgenicht, pp. 38‚Äì41 The show's producers were concerned about the message being sent to children; \\"If children saw that the adults didn't believe what Big Bird said (even though it was true), they would be afraid to talk to adults about dramatic or disturbing things that happened to them\\".Borgenicht, p. 41 For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the topics of love, marriage, and childbirth were addressed when the show presented a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love, marry, and have a child named Gabi. Sonia Manzano, the actress who played Maria, had married and become pregnant; according to the book Sesame Street Unpaved, published after the show's thirtieth anniversary in 1999, Manzano's real-life experiences gave the show's writers and producers the idea.Borgenicht, p. 80 Before writing began, research was done to gain an understanding of what previous studies had revealed about preschoolers' understanding of love, marriage, and family. The show's staff found that at the time that there was very little relevant research done about children's understanding of these topics, and no books for children had been written about them. Studies done after the episodes about Maria's pregnancy aired showed that as a result of watching these episodes, children's understanding of pregnancy increased.Truglio et al. in Fisch & Truglio, p. 76See Truglio et al. in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 74‚Äì76, for a more detailed discussion. For a description of the wedding episode, which was written by Jeff Moss, see Hellman, p. 53 and Davis, pp. 293‚Äì294. Borgenicht, pp. 80‚Äì81, gives descriptions of the wedding and of Gabi's birth. 1990s Davis called the 1990s a \\"time of transition on Sesame Street\\".Davis, p. 295 Several people involved in the show from its beginnings died during this period: Jim Henson in 1990 at the age of 53 \\"from a runaway strep infection gone stubbornly, foolishly untreated\\";Davis, p. 1Davis described Henson's death as \\"shocking\\". See Davis, pp. 300‚Äì307 for a description of Henson's \\"moving\\" memorial service, held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan on May 21, 1990. songwriter Joe Raposo from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma fifteen months earlier;Davis, pp. 307‚Äì308 long-time cast member Northern Calloway of cardiac arrest in January 1990; puppeteer Richard Hunt of AIDS in early 1992; CTW founder and producer David Connell of bladder cancer in 1995;Davis, p. 327 director Jon Stone of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 1997;Davis, p. 331 and writer Jeff Moss of colon cancer in 1998.Davis, p. 335 By the early 1990s, Sesame Street was, as Davis put it, \\"the undisputed heavyweight champion of preschool television\\". Parade Magazine reported in 2019 that the show's music had been honored with 11 children's Grammys. The show's dominance, however, was soon challenged by another PBS television show for preschoolers, Barney & Friends, and Sesame Street's ratings declined. The producers of Sesame Street responded, at the show's twenty-fifth anniversary in 1993, by expanding and redesigning the show's set, calling it \\"Around the Corner\\".Davis, p. 320 With Michael Loman as the new executive producer of the show, new human and Muppet characters were introduced, including Zoe (performed by Fran Brill), baby Natasha and her parents Ingrid and Humphrey, and Ruthie (played by comedian Ruth Buzzi). The \\"Around the Corner\\" set was dismantled in 1997. Zoe, one of the few characters that survived, was created to include another female Muppet on the show, to break stereotypes of girls, and to provide female viewers with a positive role model.Davis, p. 330 According to Davis, she was the first character developed on the show by marketing and product development specialists, who worked with the researchers at the CTW.Davis, p. 321 (The quest for a \\"break-out\\" female Muppet character continued into 2006 with the creation of Abby Cadabby, who was created after nine months of research.) In 1998, for the first time in the show's history, Sesame Street pursued funding by accepting corporate sponsorship. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader urged parents to protest the move by boycotting the show. Elmo and his portrayer, Kevin Clash, in 2010. For Sesame Streets 30th anniversary in 1999, its producers researched the reasons for the show's lower ratings. For the first time since the show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed Sesame Street content and structure during a series of two-week-long workshops. They also studied how children's viewing habits had changed since the show's premiere. They found that although Sesame Street was produced for three -to five-year olds, children began watching it at a younger age. Preschool television had become more competitive, and the CTW's research showed the traditional magazine format was not the best way to attract young children's attention. The growth of home videos during the '80s and the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable had demonstrated that children's attention could be sustained for longer periods of time, but the CTW's researchers found that their viewers, especially the younger ones, lost attention in Sesame Street after 40 to 45 minutes.Davis, p. 338Fisch & Bernstein, in Fisch & Truglio, pp. 44‚Äì45 Beginning in 1998, a new 15-minute segment shown at the end of each episode, \\"Elmo's World\\", used traditional elements (animation, Muppets, music, and live-action film), but had a more sustained narrative.Fisch & Bernstein in Fisch & Truglio, p. 45 \\"Elmo's World\\" followed the same structure each episode, and depended heavily on repetition. Unlike the realism of the rest of the show, the segment took place in a stylized crayon-drawing universe as conceived by its host.Clash, p. 75 Elmo, who represented the three- to four-year-old child, was chosen as host of the closing segment because he had always tested well with this segment of their audience. He was created in 1980 and originally performed by Brian Muehl, and later Richard Hunt, but did not become what his eventual portrayer, Kevin Clash, called a \\"phenomenon\\" until Clash took over the role in 1985.Davis, p. 285 Eventually, Elmo became, as Davis reported, \\"the embodiment\\" of Sesame Street, and \\"the marketing wonder of our age\\"Davis, p. 349 when five million \\"Tickle Me Elmo\\" dolls were sold in 1996. Clash believed the \\"Tickle Me Elmo\\" phenomenon made Elmo a household name and led to the \\"Elmo's World\\" segment.Clash, p. 47 2000s In 2000, the Children's Television Workshop changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better reflect its entry into non- television and interactive media. In 2002, Sesame Streets producers went further in changing the show to reflect its younger demographic by fundamentally changing the show's structure, which had relied on \\"Street scenes\\" interrupted by live-action videos and animation. The target age for Sesame Street shifted downward, from four years to three years, after the show's 33rd season. As co-executive producer Arlene Sherman stated, \\"We basically deconstructed the show\\". The producers expanded upon the \\"Elmo's World\\" by changing from a magazine format to a narrative format, which made the show easier for young children to navigate. Sherman called the show's new look \\"startlingly different\\". Following its tradition of addressing emotionally difficult topics, Sesame Street's producers chose to address the attacks of 9/11 during this season on its premiere episode, which aired February 4, 2002. This episode, as well as a series of four episodes that aired after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, were used in Sesame Workshop's Community Outreach program.Gikow, p. 165 In 2006, the United States Department of State called Sesame Street \\"the most widely viewed children's television show in the world\\". Over half of the show's international co-productions were made after 2001; according to the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street, the events of 9/11 inspired the producers of these co- productions. In 2003, Takalani Sesame, a South African co-production, elicited criticism in the United States when its producers created Kami, the first HIV- positive Muppet, whose purpose was educating children in South Africa about the epidemic of AIDS. The controversy, which surprised Sesame Workshop, was short-lived and died down after Kofi Annan and Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts. By 2006, Sesame Street had won more Emmy Awards than any other children's show, including winning the outstanding children's series award for twelve consecutive years‚Äîevery year the Emmys included the category. By 2009, the show had won 118 Emmys throughout its history, and was awarded the Outstanding Achievement Emmy for its 40 years on the air. The 2008‚Äì2009 recession, which led to budget cuts for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected Sesame Street; in spring 2009, Sesame Workshop had to lay off 20% of its staff. By the show's 40th anniversary, it was ranked the fifteenth most popular children's show on television. When the show premiered in 1969, 130 episodes a year were produced; in 2009, because of rising costs, twenty-six episodes were made. According to the Hollywood Reporter, corporate funding \\"dried up\\" and DVD sales \\"bottomed up\\". Also by 2009, Sesame Workshop started a new website containing a large library of classic and more recent free video clips, as well as a series of podcasts. Starting in 2009, the producers of Sesame Street took steps to bring back older viewers; it was also successful in increasing its audience viewership among 3-to-5 year-olds by the end of the 40th season. In 2012, the show's 43rd season, Elmo's World was replaced with Elmo the Musical, which was targeted at the program's older viewers. 2010s In 2014, in response to increased online and mobile viewing and to the increase in competition from other preschool programs, Sesame Workshop and PBS began producing, airing, and streaming a half-hour version of the program. The hour-long version continued to air on PBS in the mornings and the new version, which consisted of fewer segments, aired in the afternoons, when more children watched television. PBS also began to stream full-length episodes on its website, mobile app, and Roku channel. Also in 2014, Sesame Workshop began an online streaming subscription service called Sesame Go, which aired both old and new episodes of the show. In late 2015, as part of a five-year programming and development deal, it was announced that premium television service HBO would air first-run episodes of Sesame Street. Episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. The move came after \\"sweeping changes in the media business\\". Sesame Street was operating at a loss of $11 million in 2014; according to the Hollywood Reporter in 2019, it was one of the reasons for the move to HBO the following year. The deal allowed Sesame Workshop to produce more episodes, about 35 new episodes per season, compared to the 18 episodes per season it aired previously, and provided the opportunity to create a spinoff series with the Sesame Street Muppets and a new educational series. Steve Youngwood, SW's Chief Operating Officer, called the move \\"one of the toughest decisions we ever made\\". According to The New York Times, the move \\"drew an immediate backlash\\". Critics claimed that it favored privileged children over less- advantaged children and their families, the original focus of the show. They also criticized choosing to air first-run episodes on HBO, a network with adult dramas and comedies. In 2017, in response to the changing viewing habits of toddlers, the show's producers decreased its length of episodes presented on all platforms from one hour to thirty minutes, focused on fewer characters, reduced the pop culture references \\"once included as winks for their parents\\", and focused \\"on a single backbone topic\\". In April 2017, Sesame Street introduced Julia, the first Muppet with autism. Her puppeteer, Stacey Gordon, is the mother of an autistic son. The character had already been featured in digital and printed storybooks since 2015. As of its 50th anniversary in 2019, Sesame Street has produced over 4,500 episodes, 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel had almost 5 million subscribers, and the show had 24 million followers on social media. As part of its 50th anniversary PR campaign, Sesame Street conducted a traveling show, featuring some Muppets, between February and December 2019. The \\"unofficial slogan\\" of the show's anniversary was \\"50 Years and Counting\\", which Underwood called \\"a nod that we are still going strong\\".

One story has it that the band was conceived when Merritt, observing that there was no tribute album dedicated to him, decided to make one himself. In the group, Merritt writes and plays songs which are then sung by other artists‚Äîa different artist on each track. It has so far produced two well-received albums and many different collaborations. Releases The two albums the band released to date are Wasps' Nests in 1995 (Factory Too via London Records) and Hyacinths and Thistles in 1999. Wasps' Nests was preceded by a 7\\" vinyl single of album track \\"Heaven in a Black Leather Jacket\\" in 1993 on Merge Records that contains a B-side, \\"Rot in the Sun\\", sung by Merritt himself. The song was also later included on Merritt's Obscurities compilation in 2011. The names of both albums, as well as the name of the band, are deliberate tongue-twisters. The words are chosen for their abundance of s and th sounds; sixths alone packs one th and three s sounds into one syllable. The band's website refers to the 6ths as \\"every lisper's nightmare\\".The 6ths home page The list of singers on Wasps' Nests includes many notable mid-90s indie- rockers, including Barbara Manning, Mary Timony, Dean Wareham (Galaxie 500, Luna, Dean & Britta), Lou Barlow, Chris Knox (Tall Dwarfs), Robert Scott (The Bats, The Clean), Georgia Hubley (Yo La Tengo), and Mark Robinson.House of Tomorrow Wasps' Nests Track List Some of the more notable artists appearing on Hyacinths and Thistles are Bob Mould, Sally Timms (The Mekons), Sarah Cracknell (Saint Etienne), Neil Hannon (The Divine Comedy), Gary Numan, Marc Almond, Momus, Clare Grogan (Altered Images), Melanie, Miss Lily Banquette (Combustible Edison), Katharine Whalen (Squirrel Nut Zippers) and the accomplished toy piano player Margaret Leng Tan.

HMIe and Learning and Teaching Scotland were merged in 2011 to create Education Scotland. History The first HM Inspector of Schools (HMI) was appointed in 1840. The rationale for the first appointments of HMI linked inspection to \\"the improvement of elementary education\\" and charged HMI to say \\"what improvements in the apparatus and internal management of schools, in school management and discipline, and in the methods of teaching have been sanctioned by the most extensive experience\\". The particular focus in Scotland on combining inspection with self-evaluation has been central to the drive to raise educational standards. HMIe was headed by Her Majesty's Senior Chief Inspector of Education. Its remit was far wider than its English counterpart, the Office for Standards in Education. HMIe's equivalent in Wales, Estyn, had a similar remit, including adult education. Following the Scotland Act 1998 the Inspectorate was made an Executive Agency of the Scottish Government in 2001, and HMIe was answerable to the Scottish Ministers for the running of the Inspectorate and the whole inspection system in Scotland. In 2003 it employed 178 staff who were based in Edinburgh, Inverness, Glasgow and Dundee. A policy to disperse public sector jobs then led to the relocation of the headquarters from Edinburgh to Livingston, West Lothian along with the opening of new offices in Dunbartonshire and Ayrshire. On 14 October 2010 the Cabinet Secretary for Education announced that HMIe would be brigaded with Learning and Teaching Scotland into a new executive agency of the Scottish Government to be known as the Scottish Education Quality and Improvement Agency. This was later renamed Education Scotland, and came into existence on 30 June 2011. Senior Chief Inspector 1999 to 2002: Bill Clark Senior Chief Inspector in 2009: Graham Donaldson Senior Chief Inspector 2010 to 2017: Dr Bill Maxwell Senior Chief Inspector from December 2017: Gayle Gorman Remit HMIe was charged with inspecting the quality of education in pre-school centres, primary schools, secondary schools, special schools, community learning and development, further education colleges, initial teacher education, residential educational provision and the education functions of local authorities and services for children. Following the passing of the Standards in Scotland‚Äôs Schools etc. 2000 Act the focus of HMIe shifted to how this legislation is being implemented.

He received the decoration for his actions during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Andrew joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force as a private in 1915, having gained military experience while serving with the Territorial Force. He saw action on the Western Front from September 1916 to early 1918, and ended the war as an officer in England. He remained in the military after the cessation of hostilities, and joined the New Zealand Staff Corps. He held staff and administrative positions in New Zealand and, while on an officer exchange program, British India. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Andrew was appointed commander of the 22nd Battalion, which he led during the Battles of Greece and Crete as well as the early part of the North African Campaign. For a short period in late 1941 he commanded an infantry brigade of the 2nd New Zealand Division, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership. He returned to New Zealand in 1942 and commanded the Wellington Fortress Area for the remainder of the war. He retired from the military in 1952 with the rank of brigadier, and died in 1969 aged 71. Early life Leslie Wilton Andrew was born on 23 March 1897 in Ashhurst in the Manawatu region of New Zealand, the son of William Andrew, headmaster of a local school, and his wife, Frances Hannah. He grew up in Wanganui, where his father had moved his family having taken up a position in the area, and was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School. After leaving school in 1913 he worked for a solicitor and was later employed by the New Zealand Railways Department as a clerk. Andrew participated in the cadet program while at school and later joined the Territorial Force. By 1915, he had been promoted to sergeant and had sat the necessary exams to become a commissioned officer in the Territorials. First World War Andrew volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in October 1915, when he was 18. As only men between the ages of 20 to 40 could volunteer for service with the NZEF, he falsified his age to ensure that he would be eligible for duty overseas. A member of the 12th Reinforcements, he embarked for the Western Front via Egypt on 1 May 1916. In France, he was posted to B Company, 2nd Battalion, Wellington Infantry Regiment, with the rank of private. Andrew's arrival at the front coincided with the start of the Somme Offensive. He participated in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, which began on 15 September, and was wounded. Promoted to corporal in January 1917, he took part in the Battle of Messines the following June. Andrew after receiving his VC, in 1918 During the early phase of the Battle of Passchendaele, Andrew's battalion was engaged in fighting around the village of La Basseville, a few kilometres southwest of Messines. Originally captured by the New Zealanders prior to the battle on 26 July, the village had been re-taken by the Germans the next day. Under cover of an artillery barrage, the Wellingtons began an advance towards the village. Andrew was tasked with leading two sections to destroy a machine- gun post. During the advance, he noticed a nearby machine-gun post that was holding up the advance of another platoon. On his own initiative, he promptly diverted his force and removed the newly spotted threat with a flanking attack. He then led his men to the original objective. Despite continuous gunfire, he and his men captured the machine-gun post. While most of his men withdrew with the gun, Andrew and another man continued to scout further forward. Coming across another machine-gun post, the two men destroyed it before returning to their lines with information on the increasing numbers of Germans in the area. During his foray, Andrew received a flesh wound to his back. Andrew was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for his leadership and bravery at La Basseville. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation read as follows: Aged 20, the youngest recipient in the NZEF to receive the VC, Andrew was promoted to sergeant the day after the action at La Basseville. He was presented with his VC by King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 31 October 1917. Andrew continued to serve on the Western Front until he was sent to England for officer training. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in March 1918, and was posted to Sling Camp, the main training facility for the NZEF, as an instructor. He was still in England when the war ended. Interwar period While in England, Andrew met Bessie Ball, of Nottingham, and they were married on 12 November 1918, the day after the Armistice. The couple had five children; one died in infancy. Discharged from the NZEF on his return to New Zealand in August 1919, Andrew opted to become a professional soldier and joined the New Zealand Staff Corps despite a poor assessment of his administrative skills by a senior officer. He served in staff positions for the next several years. From 1927 to 1929 he served with the Highland Light Infantry, then based in British India, on an officer exchange program. On his return to New Zealand he was appointed adjutant of the 1st Wellington Regiment. In 1937, having been promoted to captain, Andrew led the New Zealand contingent sent to London for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. While there, he returned to Buckingham Palace, where he had been presented with the VC, this time as commander of the New Zealand guard at the palace on 11 May 1937. Returning to staff duties in New Zealand, he was assistant adjutant and quartermaster general of the Central Military District. Second World War Leslie Wilton Andrew WWI and WWII Personnel File (1914 - 1945) Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Andrew, a major at the time, was seconded to the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). In early 1940, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed commander of 22nd Battalion, which was then forming at Trentham Military Camp near Wellington. He trained his new command hard, and quickly earned the nickname of February due to his habit of issuing 28-day detentions for any breaches in discipline. In May 1940, the battalion sailed aboard the Empress of Britain as part of a convoy transporting the 5th Infantry Brigade, 2nd New Zealand Division, to the Middle East. The invasion of Holland and Belgium prompted the diversion of the convoy to England. Arriving in June, the battalion, along with the rest of the brigade, formed a mobile reserve for XII Corps, which was tasked with defending England from a possible invasion. In March 1941 it travelled for Egypt and then to Greece. Andrew led the battalion through the subsequent Battle of Greece, during which it saw little action apart from air raids and two minor engagements with the 2nd Panzer Division on 15 and 16 April at Mount Olympus. =Battle of Crete= Evacuated to Crete on 25 April 1941, the 5th Brigade was tasked with the defence of the Maleme airfield. At this stage, 22nd Battalion was regarded as the best of the battalions of the brigade so Andrew was ordered to hold the strategically important Point 107, the dominant hill overlooking the airfield. Forced to disperse the companies of his battalion widely to cover his positions, he closely oversaw the defensive arrangements and ensured sufficient ammunition for his men. On 20 May 1941, the opening day of the Battle of Crete, 22nd Battalion was heavily bombed and strafed, and Andrew was lightly wounded. In the battalion's war diary he noted the bombing was worse than the artillery barrages of Passchendaele and the Somme. German paratroopers began landing in the area, including near his headquarters, and fighting took place at close quarters. Andrew soon lost communications with his forward companies but these were able to drive off the German attackers and hold their positions. The lack of contact with the companies to his front was a concern to Andrew as was the increasing presence of Germans to his rear. He requested support from the adjacent 23rd Battalion but this was refused by his brigade commander, Brigadier James Hargest. Andrew used his battalion reserve to mount a counterattack with the help of two Matilda tanks but this failed. Following this, he advised Hargest that he may have to withdraw from Point 107; \\"If you must you must\\" was the reply. Accordingly Andrew withdrew the remaining units that he was able to contact. As it happened, most of his forward companies remained intact and, after finding they had been abandoned, were able to withdraw from Point 107. The withdrawal to the positions of the 21st and 23rd Battalions came as a major surprise to Hargest, but instead of ordering an immediate counterattack, he directed Andrew take overall command of the defences of 5th Brigade and conceded the airfield was lost. Once senior commanders became aware of the situation, they ordered that it be rectified. Despite a counterattack to recapture the airfield mounted in the evening of 21 May and into the next morning, Maleme airfield remained in the hands of the Germans. This was a significant factor in the German forces becoming established on Crete as it enabled much needed reinforcements to be landed by aircraft. Andrew and the surviving elements of his battalion were withdrawn from the area to Sphakia and, after acting as a defensive cordon, evacuated from Crete. Lieutenant Colonel Andrew (left) with Major General Bernard Freyberg (right), Egypt, July 1941 =North Africa= In Egypt, where the 2nd New Zealand Division was being rebuilt after the losses of Greece and Crete, Andrew and Hargest gave evidence in an inquiry on the conduct of the fighting on Crete. Officially, 5th Brigade was held blameless. Andrew remained as commander of 22nd Battalion during the early phases of the North African Campaign. At one point during the efforts to lift the Siege of Tobruk, his battalion was surrounded at Menastir and fought off elements of the 21st Panzer Division. His leadership during this time was later recognised with a Mention in Despatches. When Hargest, still commanding 5th Brigade, was captured on 27 November 1941, Andrew was given temporary command of the brigade the next day. He led the brigade up until 8 December 1941, including a period, from 1 to 3 December, when it was besieging Bardia and fighting off German attempts to relieve the town. He reverted to command of the battalion on 9 December 1941 but was later rewarded with the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership of the brigade. He relinquished command of 22nd Battalion in February 1942 and returned to New Zealand in response to a need for experienced officers to oversee development of home defences after the entry of Japan into the war. Later life Back in New Zealand, Andrew was promoted to full colonel and appointed commander of the Wellington Fortress Area. He was formally discharged from the 2NZEF in October 1943, reverting to the regular army thereafter. He continued leading the Wellington Fortress Area for the rest of the war. In the immediate postwar period, he commanded the New Zealand contingent for the 1946 Victory Parade in London, and the following year attended the Imperial Defence College. He was promoted to brigadier in 1948 and appointed commander of the Central Military District. He continued in this appointment until his retirement from the military in 1952. He was later invited to run for Parliament but declined. Andrew died on 8 January 1969 at Palmerston North hospital after a brief illness. Survived by his wife and four children, he was buried with full military honours in a ceremony at Levin RSA Cemetery, in Levin. His funeral was attended by three fellow VC recipients, including Reverend Keith Elliott, a former soldier of the 22nd Battalion, who also provided a reading. A barracks at Linton Army Camp is named after him; in Belgium, in the village of Warneton, just south of La Basseville, there is a commemorative plaque in his memory. On 31 July 2017, the 100-year anniversary of the action at La Basseville that earned him the VC, a plaque in Andrew's memory was unveiled at the Wellington railway station. Legacy In 1953, the book Crete, one of the volumes of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War, written by Dan Davin and edited by Howard Kippenberger, the latter a friend and fellow battalion commander in the 2NZEF who was present at Crete, was published. In it, Andrew was criticised for his handling of the action at Maleme that ultimately led to the loss of Crete. In private correspondence to Davin, Kippenberger expressed the view that Andrew should have fought his battalion to the last man. Andrew took offence at the public criticism and his relations with Kippenberger would be distant and cool thereafter. As a result Andrew was also reluctant to contribute to the official history of the 22nd Battalion, implying to its author that Kippenberger would distort events as he believed he had with the Crete book. Andrew did have his supporters, including former soldiers of the 22nd Battalion, and Bernard Freyberg, the overall commander on Crete, did not blame Andrew for the loss of the island. The lethargic and indecisive conduct of his brigade commander, James Hargest, in the early stages of the fighting on the island was also a significant factor in Maleme airfield falling to the Germans. VC Andrew's Victoria Cross was displayed at the QEII Army Memorial Museum in Waiouru. In December 2007 it was one of nine VCs among 96 medals stolen from the museum. On 16 February 2008, New Zealand Police announced that all the medals had been recovered as a result of a NZ$300,000 reward offered by Michael Ashcroft and Tom Sturgess.

They were phased out of ship of the line service during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, as their usefulness was declining; though they were still in service, especially on distant stations such as the East Indies. Fourth-rates took many forms, initially as small two decked warships, later as large frigates raz√©ed from the initial two deck warships, and occasionally even heavily armed merchant ships such as HMS Calcutta. Small two decked warships A fourth-rate was, in the British Royal Navy during the first half of the 18th century, a ship of the line mounting from 46 up to 60 guns. While the number of guns stayed in the same range until 1817, after 1756 the ships of 50 guns and below were considered too weak to stand in the line of battle, although the remaining 60-gun ships were still classed as fit to be ships of the line. However, the 50-gun ship continued to be used largely during the Seven Years' War, and during the time of the American Revolution a whole new group of 50-gun ships was constructed, not for the battlefleet, but to meet the needs of combat in the shallow waters off North America where the larger ships found it difficult to sail. 50-gun ships were also suitable as convoy escorts and for service on foreign stations, where larger enemy vessels were unlikely to be encountered. Some saw service as flagships since, as two-deckers, they were able to accommodate a flag officer and his retinue, and they also had the physical presence of a flagship. Their usefulness was declining, however, and during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars few 50s were built, although several remained in service, especially on distant stations such as the East Indies. The 60-gun ships were also dying out, superseded initially by the 74-gun third-rates, although by 1793 there were still four 60-gun ships left in harbour service. Some fourth-rates did remain in active service even during the Napoleonic Wars, especially in the shallow North Sea, where the Royal Navy's main opponents were the Baltic powers and the Dutch, whose own fleet consisted mainly of 50- to 64-gun ships (e.g. the 56-gun Delft). However, HMS Leander, 50 guns, was with Horatio Nelson at the Battle of the Nile. As late as 1807, fourth-rates were active in combat zones, illustrated by the fatal incident between HMS Leopard (50 guns), and the US frigate Chesapeake (38 guns), an incident which nearly led to war. Large frigates and spar-decked frigates American 44-gun frigates Constitution, United States and President were never in operational use armed with fewer than 50 guns including carronades, and were generally seen as equivalent to fourth-rates. The larger British 24-pounder frigates such as the later 1813 Leander and Newcastle, were of similar firepower to those big American 44s. The latter were launched (or raz√©ed ‚Äì i.e. converted by cutting down by one deck from existing smaller third-rate 74-gun two-deckers) during the last years of the Napoleonic War and the War of 1812 and were classed as fourth-rates in Royal Naval service under the revised rating system. This convention continued into the 19th century. Any of these later large fourth-rate frigates threw a close-range broadside (including from their heavy carronades) far superior to the earlier two-decker 50s or even to third-rate 64s. Merchant conversions Some ships of commerce such as the East Indiamen were heavily armed to protect themselves from pirates and privateers, effectively making them equivalent to fourth-rate ships of the line. The Royal Navy also converted some East Indiamen into fourth-rates for convoy duty, such as HMS Calcutta.  Bibliography  * Archibald, E.H.H.

He was active in social reform and the municipal affairs of Hull, including housing, sanitation and education, yet allowed a child in his care to be beaten and neglected to such a point that the child was taken into care. Biography St. John's Church, Hull (1890) Malet Lambert was born in Hull in 1853, the son of Joseph Lambert and his second wife, Jane Hudson Malet, of Cork. His mother died when he was young. When he was 11 years old, his father remarried to Rachel Wilson, the daughter of Thomas Wilson, a Hull shipping-line owner. He attended Pocklington Grammar School and later entered his father's ship-broking business in the High Street. Eventually he entered Trinity College, Dublin, graduating with a first rank honors BA in Natural Science 1879. In that same year he was ordained, becoming curate at Tadcaster. In 1881 he became vicar of Newland, Hull, a position he held for the next three decades. Soon after he was instrumental in creating the parish of St. Augustine's, serving the recently built area of The Avenues,Formally opened 1875, mostly built upon by 1910. See The Avenues, Hull for development chronology. and other new urban developments; the district was taken out of his own parish. During his encumbancy the church was expanded with the addition of a chancel (1893), and a north aisle (1902), as well as having the vaults filled in, the nave extended, and other alterations. In February 1882 he married Miss Rose Harrison, eldest daughter of Arthur Harrison of Northgate House, Cottingham. He received an M.A. in 1883, Bachelor of Laws in 1884 and Doctor of Laws in 1885. In the 1880s Malet Lambert was involved in the 'Hull Sanitary Association', a body set up to improve sewage, refuse, and disease treatment in Hull,Edward Gillett; Kenneth A. MacMahon (1980), A History of Hull, pp. 266-7. and was instrumental in instigated an investigation into the housing conditions of the poor.Edward Gillett; Kenneth A.

In the early years the beginning of the 20th century, Lambert and his wife were charged with cruelty and neglect of a ten- year-old female child in their care. The child, who had been taken in to be trained as a servant, was presented to a visiting doctor by concerned servants of the house - the child was ascertained to be malnourished by a doctor, weighing aged 11. In addition to the malnutrition of the child she was said to have been keep secret from visitors by Mrs. Lambert, beaten with a stick and poker by Mrs. Lambert, who had instructed her cook to do the same. The contradictions of the Lambert's treatment of their charge, and Malet Lambert's so-called philanthropic work were noted at the trial, as was the differences in well being of the child and the Lambert's own offspring. The child was taken into the care of a workhouse, where she made a rapid recovery.The Hull Times. 17 October 1908, p. 10; 21 November 1908, p. 12; 30 January 1909, pp. 8, 9, 12.Sources: * * In 1927 Lambert became the first chairman of the council of the newly established University College (Hull) (see Hull University).K.

The 2011 Census recorded its population as 8,337. It is east of York and northwest of Hull. The town's skyline is marked by the 15th-century west tower of All Saints' parish church. Pocklington is at the centre of the ecclesiastical Parish of Pocklington, which also includes the hamlet of Kilnwick Percy and outlying farms and houses. History All Saints' Church Pocklington gets its name via the Old English \\"Poclintun\\" from the Anglian settlement of Pocel's (or Pocela's) people and the Old English word \\"tun\\" meaning farm or settlement, (based on A Dictionary of English Place-Names, Oxford University Press, 1991). but though the town's name can only be traced back to around 650 AD, the inhabitation of Pocklington as a site is thought to extend back a further 1,000 years or more to the Bronze Age. Pocklington appears on the 14th century Gough Map, the oldest route map in Great Britain. In the Iron Age Pocklington was a major town of the Parisi tribe. In 2017, a Celtic warrior‚Äôs grave, dated to about BC 320 to 174, was discovered at a housing development under construction. After archeologists had completed a very long excavation project, the site was found to include a bronze shield, remains of a chariot and the skeletons of ponies. The shield's boss bears a resemblance to the Wandsworth shield boss (circa BC 350 to 150), owned by the British Museum. One design element on the extremely-well preserved Pocklington shield, a scalloped border, \\"is not comparable to any other Iron Age finds across Europe, adding to its valuable uniqueness\\", said Paula Ware, managing director at MAP Archaeological Practice Ltd in late 2019. Horses were rarely included in Iron Age burials, making the find particularly significant. \\"The discoveries are set to widen our understanding of the Arras (Middle Iron Age) culture and the dating of artefacts to secure contexts is exceptional,\\" according to Paula Ware. Burnby Hall Gardens By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, it was the second largest settlement in Yorkshire after York itself. Pocklington developed through the Middle Ages while many similar places fell into dramatic decline. Pocklington owed much of its prosperity in the Middle Ages to the fact that it was a local centre for the trading of wool and lay on the main road to York, an important national centre for the export of wool to the continent. Wool was England's main export in the earlier Middle Ages. =Town heraldry= The town's coat of arms shield is based on that of the Dolman family, founders of Pocklington School. The arms were granted to the town council in 1980. The crown at the base of the shield is the emblem of the saints, along with the gold cross, symbolises the town's historic connection with Paulinus of York and the Archbishop of York. The town's motto is \\"Service with Freedom\\". Governance Old Courthouse Pocklington is under East Riding of Yorkshire Council, a unitary authority. The town is part of the Pocklington Provincial Ward and returns three councillors to the council. Since 2001, Pocklington has been part of the East Yorkshire Parliamentary Constituency. The seat is currently held by Greg Knight for the Conservative Party. Pocklington's Town Council consists of thirteen elected councillors and is responsible for the cemetery, allotments, the Croft play-park and the Arts Centre. Pocklington Fire Station The town council has a policy of naming all new streets using the surnames of the war dead who served at RAF Pocklington. This has given rise to the names Strother Close, Waite Close, Garrick Drive, Turnbull Close and Harper Close. There is some controversy surrounding the policy as a local resident believes that war heroes from Pocklington and nearby Barmby Moor should also be honoured in this way. =Town twinning= Pocklington is twinned with: * Le Pays de Racan, France (Official) * Trendelburg, Germany (unofficial) Geography Market Place, Regent Street, Railway Street Junction Pocklington is a spring line settlement at the foot of the Yorkshire Wolds. The rocks underlying this area were deposited on the bed of a tropical ocean. When the land rose, the chalk wolds were formed from the exoskeletons of micro-organisms covering the sea floor. The landscape around Pocklington therefore varies from flat arable land primarily devoted to agriculture to the south and west, and grassy, chalk hills and dry valleys to the north and east. A lot of the more level farming country was, from the Middle Ages onwards, reclaimed from marshland. Pocklington is bisected by the largely culverted Pocklington Beck, a small brook that feeds into the Pocklington Canal. The beck and canal are usually good fishing grounds but a sewerage overflow in 2003 killed thousands of fish and severely damaged the ecosystem, from which it is now recovered. Demography According to the 2011 UK census, Pocklington parish had a population of 8,337, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 7,632. The civil parish is not very ethnically diverse, with the 2001 UK census reporting 98.4% of the 7,632 inhabitants being white. The East Riding of Yorkshire has a higher than average level of Christian belief and a much lower rate of observance for other faiths and those of no faith. This can be attributed to the aforementioned lack of ethnic diversity in the area. Entertainment and culture Pocklington Arts Centre (formerly the Oak House Cinema) opened in 2000 and offers \\"a mixed programme of film, music, drama, dance, lectures, workshops and exhibitions\\". Previous performers at the arts centre include the comedians Jenny Eclair, Clive James, Dave Gorman and Barry Cryer and the musicians Midge Ure and Steve Harley (in 2-man (2002), 3-man (2012, 2014, 2018-2019) and 4-man (2003) acoustic sets only, no full rock band (i.e. Cockney Rebel shows). The centre also puts on \\"second screenings\\" of recently released films. Victoria Coren used the name of the Pocklington Arts Centre for the Ormerod hoax. In a tribute to Munich's traditional Oktoberfest, Pocklington also hosts its own annual Pocktoberfest. Unlike the original on which it is based, Pocktoberfest is pared down to a single-issue event: beer. In the 2006 event, 19 casks (or about 452 litres) of ale were consumed. Organiser of the 2012 Pocktoberfest, Clare Saunders, arranged for brewers from Germany. Italy, France, Belgium and the Netherlands to attend the festival, which is sponsored by C & N Wines and Swirlz Ice Cream Emporium. The Wellington Oak, one of many Pubs in Pocklington Pocklington celebrates an annual Flying Man Festival with a multitude of themed events from 12 to 14 May, in memory of the showman Thomas Pelling, the \\"Flying Man of Pocklington\\", who, with a pair of homemade wings, tried to fly from the top of the local church, and was killed when he hit one of the church's buttresses. =Sport= Pocklington RUFC rugby team is based on Burnby Lane. The first rugby game in Pocklington was held on West Green on Wednesday 12 November 1879 between Pocklington Town and District and Pocklington Grammar School. The first Pocklington rugby club Pocklington F.C. was formed in 1885. The current club, formed in 1928, plays in the North Premier and also hosts the traditional \\"Good Friday Sevens\\" tournament - Yorkshire's longest-established sevens tournament launched in 1958 and Pocklington's premier sporting event, which sees local, county-based and even international teams compete. The town also has a council-run Francis Scaife Sports Centre, which includes a 20-metre swimming pool and gym. The town also has swimming, football and cricket clubs. Kilnwick Percy Golf Club - locally known as the KP - lies just outside of Pocklington and offers luxury hotel rooms and lodges in addition to its championship golf course. In 2007, Michael Woods, a Pocklingtonian, made his debut for Chelsea. Pocklington Town A.F.C. run four Saturday football teams with the first team competing in the Humber Premier League. There is also an U19s team and girls' team. In the 2012-13 season the club's 1st team won the highest level trophy in the club's history by winning the Whitehead's Fish & Chips Humber League Cup at North Ferriby United's Rapid Solicitors Stadium. The club had floodlights installed during July 2008, allowing the club to make progress in the football league pyramid. Pocklington Tennis Club, which has 6 astro-turf style courts and plays in both the York & District Tennis League and the Driffield & District Lawn Tennis League, is located on West Green. Pocklington is a control point at the quadrennial London-Edinburgh-London long-distance bicycle event. =Media= Pocklington has a local weekly newspaper, the Pocklington Post, owned by Johnston Press. A full-time community radio station, Vixen FM, based in nearby Market Weighton, broadcasts to the town. Also in the area is Beverley FM which serves Beverley and all of its surrounding areas, including Pocklington. A Pocklington-based community radio station, West Wolds Radio, went on-air in November 2015 but closed in September 2016. Education Pocklington School *Pocklington School *Woldgate School and Sixth Form College Religion Churches in Pocklington include: *The Church of England parish church of All Saints, nicknamed the Cathedral of the Wolds. The Grade I listed building is 12th- and 13th-century and has a 15th-century west tower. *Pocklington Christian Fellowship, formerly Pocklington Pentecostal Church, meets in the former Ebenezer Independent Chapel built for Dissenters in 1807. *Pocklington Methodist Church, whose red brick Neoclassical building was completed in 1864 as a Wesleyan Methodist Church. Church of St Mary & St Joseph *The Roman Catholic church of SS Mary and Joseph, whose Gothic Revival brick building was completed in 1863 to replace a chapel dating from 1807. There are no non-Christian houses of worship in Pocklington, but Kilnwick Percy Hall, just outside Pocklington, is now a large residential Buddhist Centre called Madhyamaka Kadampa Meditation Centre. It runs regular Buddhist meditation classes. Freemasonry Pocklington has its own Masonic Hall which is situated on the Mile. It is home to several lodges and orders including: *Beacon Lodge No. 4362 *Old Pocklingtonian Lodge No. 7867 - formed by former pupils of Pocklington School but membership is no longer restricted to those with a connection to the school. *Beacon Chapter No. 4362 Transport =Car= Pocklington lies on the A1079 road, the main arterial route between the cities of York and Hull. =Bus= Pocklington Bus station Pocklington is served by a number of bus routes provided by East Yorkshire Motor Services who have a depot in the town centre. York Pullman also serve the town with their route X36 service 6 days a week. =Air= Pocklington Airfield Pocklington Airfield has three concrete and tarmac runways of , sufficient in length to take RAF bombers during the Second World War, but in September 1946 the airfield was closed. Although the site remains in use with gliders - and occasionally hot air balloonists - a lot of the concrete runway surface has gone, and the control tower is not in operation. It is therefore classified as \\"limited flying\\". The airfield is now wholly owned by the Wolds Gliding Club. The nearest commercial airport is Humberside Airport, another former RAF airfield. =Rail= Pocklington Railway Station Pocklington was once part of the rail network, with a railway station dating back to 1847. This was closed as a result of the Beeching Report in November 1965. There is a small but vocal pressure group that is trying to get the railway station and line re-opened. The City of York Local Transport Plan for 2006 notes that: \\"work has recently been undertaken by East Riding of Yorkshire Council to examine the feasibility of reopening the former direct York ‚Äì Pocklington - Beverley line that closed in 1965... given the unavailability of funding for such a scheme at present and the extensive time required for any reinstatement of a rail line, the scheme remains a longer- term aspiration.\\" The Minsters Rail Campaign is campaigning to re-open the railway line between Beverley and York (with stops at Stamford Bridge, Pocklington and Market Weighton). The re-opened railway would skirt the southern edge of the town as the former alignment has since been developed. In 2006, the issue of re-opening the line has been raised in Parliament and, although still prohibitively expensive, was otherwise considered favourably. However, in 2013, East Riding of Yorkshire Council decided that the line could not be funded at that time. The old railway building, designed by George Townsend Andrews, was saved from demolition due to its interesting architecture. It now serves both as a bus shelter, and also a sports hall for nearby Pocklington School. =Boat= Pocklington Canal The Pocklington Canal, previously in commercial use in the 19th century by barges, is now navigable as far as Bielby Basin. Full restoration of the canal is one of the aims of the Pocklington Canal Amenity Society, which was formed in 1969.

It was written some time in the middle of the 18th century during the Qing dynasty. Long considered a masterpiece of Chinese literature, the novel is generally acknowledged to be one of the pinnacles of Chinese fiction. \\"Redology\\" is the field of study devoted exclusively to this work.Jonathan Spence, The Search for Modern China (New York: Norton, 1990), 106‚Äì110. The title has also been translated as Red Chamber Dream and A Dream of Red Mansions. The novel circulated in manuscript copies with various titles until its print publication, in 1791. Gao E, who prepared the first and second printed editions with his partner Cheng Weiyuan () in 1791‚Äì92, added 40 additional chapters to complete the novel.David Hawkes, \\"Introduction\\", The Story of the Stone Volume I (Penguin Books, 1973), pp. 15‚Äì19. Red Chamber is believed to be semi-autobiographical, mirroring the rise and decline of author Cao Xueqin's own family and, by extension, of the Qing dynasty.Jonathan D. Spence, Ts'ao Yin [Cao Yin] and the K'ang-Hsi Emperor: Bondservant and Master (New Haven,: Yale University Press, 1966) is a study of Cao's grandfather. As the author details in the first chapter, it is intended to be a memorial to the women he knew in his youth: friends, relatives and servants. The novel is remarkable not only for its huge cast of characters and psychological scope, but also for its precise and detailed observation of the life and social structures typical of 18th-century Chinese society. It contains within its pages a sampling of all of the major modes and genres of the Chinese literary tradition. Language The novel is composed in written vernacular (baihua) rather than Classical Chinese (wenyan). Cao Xueqin was well versed in Chinese poetry and in Classical Chinese, having written tracts in the semi-wenyan style, while the novel's dialogue is written in the Beijing Mandarin dialect, which was to become the basis of modern spoken Chinese. In the early 20th century, lexicographers used the text to establish the vocabulary of the new standardised language and reformers used the novel to promote the written vernacular. History =Textual history= Dream of the Red Chambers textual history is involved and complex, and has long been a subject of critical scrutiny, debate, and conjecture. Cao Xueqin, a member of an eminent family that had served the Qing dynasty emperors but whose fortunes had begun to decline, began composing Dream of the Red Chamber during the 1740s. By the time of his death in 1763 or 1764, Cao had completed the first 80 chapters of the novel and might possibly have drafted the remaining chapters. The first 80 chapters circulated during Cao's lifetime in hand-copied manuscripts, first among Cao's personal friends and a growing circle of aficionados, then eventually on the open market where they sold for large sums of money. The first printed version, published by Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E in 1791, contains edits and revisions not authorized by the author. It is possible that Cao destroyed the last chapters or that at least parts of Cao's original ending were incorporated into the 120 chapter Cheng-Gao versions,Maram Epstein, \\"Reflections of Desire: The Poetics of Gender in Dream of the Red Chamber,\\" Nan Nu 1.1 (1999): 64. with Gao E's \\"careful emendations\\" of Cao's draft. Rouge versions A page from the \\"Jimao manuscript\\" (one of the Rouge versions) of the novel, 1759. Up until 1791, the novel circulated in hand- copied manuscripts. Even amongst some 12 independent surviving manuscripts, small differences in some characters, rearrangements and possible rewritings cause the texts to vary a little. The earliest manuscripts end abruptly at the latest at the 80th chapter. The earlier versions contain comments and annotations in red or black ink from unknown commentators. These commentators' remarks reveal much about the author as a person, and it is now believed that some of them may even be members of Cao Xueqin's own family. The most prominent commentator is Zhiyanzhai, who revealed much of the interior structuring of the work and the original manuscript ending, now lost. These manuscripts, the most textually reliable versions, are known as \\"Rouge versions\\" (zhƒ´ bƒõn ). The early 80 chapters brim with prophecies and dramatic foreshadowings that give hints as to how the book would continue. For example, it is obvious that Lin Daiyu will eventually die in the course of the novel; that Baoyu and Baochai will marry; that Baoyu will become a monk. A branch of Redology, known as t√†ny√¨ xu√© (Êé¢‰ΩöÂ≠∏), is focused on recovering the lost manuscript ending, based on the commentators' annotations in the Rouge versions, as well as the internal foreshadowings in the earlier 80 chapters. Today, several manuscripts of the novel can be still found in locations in China and Europe. The \\"Jiaxu manuscript\\" (dated to 1754) is currently located in the Shanghai Museum, the \\"Jimao manuscript\\" (1759) is located in the National Library of China, and the \\"Gengchen manuscript\\" (1760) is located in the library of the Peking University. The Beijing Normal University and the Institute of Oriental Studies in St. Petersburg both also held manuscripts of the novel dating before the first print edition of 1791. File:Preface of Shitouji.jpgThe \\"Jiaxu manuscript\\", 1754 File:The first page of Shitouji- gengchen version.pngThe \\"Gongchen manuscript\\", 1760 Cheng‚ÄìGao versions In 1791, Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan brought together the novel's first printed edition. This was also the first \\"complete\\" edition of The Story of the Stone, which they printed as the Illustrated Dream of the Red Chamber (Áπ°ÂÉèÁ¥ÖÊ®ìÂ§¢). While the original Rouge manuscripts have eighty chapters, the 1791 edition completed the novel in 120 chapters. The first 80 chapters were edited from the Rouge versions, but the last 40 were newly published. In 1792, Cheng and Gao published a second edition correcting editorial errors of the 1791 version. In the 1791 prefaces, Cheng claimed to have put together an ending based on the author's working manuscripts. The debate over the last 40 chapters and the 1791‚Äì92 prefaces continues to this day. Many modern scholars believe these chapters were a later addition. Hu Shih, in his 1921 essay Proofs on A Dream of the Red Chamber, argued that the ending was actually written by Gao E, citing the foreshadowing of the main characters' fates in Chapter 5, which differs from the ending of the 1791 Cheng-Gao version. However, during the mid-20th century, the discovery of a 120 chapter manuscript that dates well before 1791 further complicated the questions regarding Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan's involvement‚Äîwhether they simply edited or actually wrote the continuation of the novel. Though it is unclear if the last 40 chapters of the discovered manuscript contained the original works of Cao, Irene Eber found the discovery \\"seems to confirm Cheng and Gao's claim that they merely edited a complete manuscript, consisting of 120 chapters, rather than actually writing a portion of the novel\\".Irene Eber, \\"Riddles in the Dream of the Red Chamber,\\" in Galit Hasan-Rokem, and David Dean Shulman, eds. Untying the Knot : On Riddles and Other Enigmatic Modes (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 237. The book is usually published and read in Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E's 120 chapter version. Some modern editions, such as Zhou Ruchang's, do not include the last 40 chapters. In 2014, three researchers using data analysis of writing styles announced that \\"Applying our method to the Cheng‚ÄìGao version of Dream of the Red Chamber has led to convincing if not irrefutable evidence that the first 80 chapters and the last 40 chapters of the book were written by two different authors.\\" Plot summary A piece from a series of brush paintings by Qing dynasty artist Sun Wen (1818‚Äì1904), depicting a scene from the novel. The novel provides a detailed, episodic record of life in the two branches of the wealthy, aristocratic Jia (Ë≥à) clan‚Äîthe Rongguo House (Ê¶ÆÂúãÂ∫ú) and the Ningguo House (ÂØßÂúãÂ∫ú)‚Äîwho reside in two large, adjacent family compounds in the capital. Their ancestors were made Dukes and given imperial titles, and as the novel begins the two houses are among the most illustrious families in the city. One of the clan's offspring is made a Royal Consort, and a lush landscaped garden is built to receive her visit. The novel describes the Jias' wealth and influence in great naturalistic detail, and charts the Jias' fall from the height of their prestige, following some thirty main characters and over four hundred minor ones. Eventually the Jia clan falls into disfavor with the Emperor, and their mansions are raided and confiscated. In the novel's frame story, a sentient Stone, abandoned by the goddess N√ºwa when she mended the heavens aeons ago, begs a Taoist priest and a Buddhist monk to take it with them to see the world. The Stone, along with a companion (in Cheng-Gao versions they are merged into the same character), is then given a chance to learn from the human existence, and enters the mortal realm. The main character of the novel is the carefree adolescent male heir of the family, Jia Baoyu. He was born with a magical piece of \\"jade\\" in his mouth. In this life he has a special bond with his sickly cousin Lin Daiyu, who shares his love of music and poetry. Baoyu, however, is predestined to marry another cousin, Xue Baochai, whose grace and intelligence exemplify an ideal woman, but with whom he lacks an emotional connection. The romantic rivalry and friendship among the three characters against the backdrop of the family's declining fortunes form the main story in the novel. Characters An 1889 Qing dynasty woodcut print depicting a scene from the novel, where Xue Baochai is chasing after butterflies (chapter 27). Dream of the Red Chamber contains an extraordinarily large number of characters: nearly forty are considered major characters, and there are over four hundred additional ones. The novel is also known for the complex portraits of its many women characters. According to Lu Xun in the appendix to A Brief History of Chinese Fiction, Dream of the Red Chamber broke every conceivable thought and technique in traditional Chinese fiction; its realistic characterization presents thoroughly human characters who are neither \\"wholly good nor wholly bad\\", but who seem to inhabit part of the real world.Chen (2005), pp. 1‚Äì2. The names of the maids and bondservants are given in pinyin transcription and in David Hawkes' translation. =Jia Baoyu and the Twelve Beauties of Jinling= *Jia Baoyu (; Meaning: Precious Jade) The main protagonist is about 12 or 13 years old when introduced in the novel. The adolescent son of Jia Zheng and his wife, Lady Wang, and born with a piece of luminescent jade in his mouth (the Stone), Baoyu is the heir apparent to the Rongguo House. Frowned on by his strict Confucian father, Baoyu reads Zhuangzi and Romance of the Western Chamber on the sly, rather than the Four Books of classic Chinese education. Baoyu is highly intelligent, but dislikes the fawning bureaucrats who frequent his father's house. A sensitive and compassionate individual, he has a special relationship with many of the women in the house. *Lin Daiyu (; Meaning: Blue-black Jade) Jia Baoyu's younger first cousin and his true love. She is the daughter of Lin Ruhai (ÊûóÂ¶ÇÊµ∑), a Yangzhou scholar-official governing salt, and Lady Jia Min (Ë≥àÊïè), Baoyu's paternal aunt. She is an image of spirituality and intelligence in Chinese classical literature: divinely beautiful, sentimental, sarcastic, and with a high level of self-esteem. She also suffers from a respiratory ailment. The novel proper starts in Chapter 3 with Daiyu's arrival at the Rongguo House shortly after the death of her mother. In the frame story of the novel, Daiyu is the reincarnation of the Fairy Crimson Pearl, and the purpose of her mortal birth is to repay Baoyu with tears for watering her in his previous incarnation as the Deity Shenying in the heavens. Sickly and prone to fits of jealousy, Daiyu is nevertheless an extremely talented and accomplished poet. *Xue Baochai (; Meaning: Jeweled Hair Pin) Jia Baoyu's other first cousin. The only daughter of Aunt Xue (ËñõÂß®Â™Ω), sister to Baoyu's mother, Baochai is a foil to Daiyu. Where Daiyu is unconventional and sincere, Baochai is worldly-wise and very tactful: a model Chinese feudal maiden. The novel describes her as beautiful and ambitious. Baochai has a round face, fair skin, large eyes, and, some would say, a more voluptuous figure in contrast to Daiyu's slender willowy daintiness. Baochai carries a golden locket with her which contains words given to her in childhood by a Buddhist monk. Baochai's golden locket and Baoyu's jade contain inscriptions that appear to complement one another perfectly in the material world. Her marriage to Baoyu is seen in the book as predestined. *Jia Yuanchun (; Meaning: First Spring) Baoyu's elder sister by about a decade. Originally one of the ladies-in- waiting in the imperial palace, Yuanchun later becomes an Imperial Consort, having impressed the Emperor with her virtue and learning. Her illustrious position as a favorite of the Emperor marks the height of the Jia family's powers. Despite her prestigious position, Yuanchun feels imprisoned within the four walls of the imperial palace. She dies at the age of forty. The name of four sisters together \\"Yuan-Ying-Tan-Xi\\" is a homophone with \\"Supposed to sigh\\". *Jia Tanchun (; Meaning: Seeking Spring) Baoyu's younger half-sister by Concubine Zhao. Extremely outspoken, she is almost as capable as Wang Xifeng. Wang Xifeng herself compliments her privately, but laments that she was \\"born in the wrong womb\\", since concubine children are not respected as much as those by first wives. She is also a very talented poet. Tanchun is nicknamed \\"Rose\\" for her beauty and her prickly personality. She later marries into a military family on the South Sea far away from home. *Shi Xiangyun (; Meaning: Xiang River Clouds) Jia Baoyu's younger second cousin. Grandmother Jia's grandniece. Orphaned in infancy, she grows up under her wealthy paternal uncle and aunt who treats her unkindly. In spite of this Xiangyun is openhearted and cheerful. A comparatively androgynous beauty, Xiangyun looks good in men's clothes (once she put on Baoyu's clothes and Grandmother Jia thought she was a he), and loves to drink. She is forthright and without tact, but her forgiving nature takes the sting from her casually truthful remarks. She is well educated and as talented a poet as Daiyu or Baochai. Her young husband dies shortly after their marriage. She vows to be a faithful widow for the rest of her life. *Miaoyu (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Adamantina; Meaning: Wonderful/Clever Jade) A young nun from Buddhist cloisters of the Rong-guo house. Extremely beautiful and learned, while also extremely aloof, haughty and unsociable. She also has an obsession with cleanliness. The novel says she was compelled by her illness to become a nun, and shelters herself under the nunnery to dodge political affairs. Her fate is not known after her abduction by bandits. *Jia Yingchun (; Meaning: Welcoming Spring) Second female family member of the generation of the Jia household after Yuanchun, Yingchun is the daughter of Jia She, Baoyu's uncle and therefore his elder first cousin. A kind-hearted, weak-willed person, Yingchun is said to have a \\"wooden\\" personality and seems rather apathetic toward all worldly affairs. Although very pretty and well-read, she does not compare in intelligence and wit to any of her cousins. Yingchun's most famous trait, it seems, is her unwillingness to meddle in the affairs of her family. Eventually Yingchun marries an official of the imperial court, her marriage being merely one of her father's desperate attempts to raise the declining fortunes of the Jia family. The newly married Yingchun becomes a victim of domestic abuse and constant violence at the hands of her cruel, abusive husband. *Jia Xichun (; Meaning: Treasuring Spring) Baoyu's younger cousin from the Ningguo House, but brought up in the Rongguo House. A gifted painter, she is also a devout Buddhist. She is the young sister of Jia Zhen, head of the Ningguo House. At the end of the novel, after the fall of the house of Jia, she gives up her worldly concerns and becomes a Buddhist nun. She is the second youngest of Jinling's Twelve Beauties, described as a pre-teen in most parts of the novel. *Wang Xifeng (; Meaning: Splendid Phoenix), alias Sister Feng. Baoyu's elder cousin-in-law, young wife to Jia Lian (who is Baoyu's paternal first cousin), niece to Lady Wang. Xifeng is hence related to Baoyu both by blood and marriage. An extremely handsome woman, Xifeng is capable, clever, humorous, conversable and, at times, vicious and cruel. Undeniably the most worldly woman in the novel, Xifeng is in charge of the daily running of the Rongguo household and wields remarkable economy as well as political power within the family. Being a favorite of Grandmother Jia, Xifeng keeps both Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia entertained with her constant jokes and amusing chatter, playing the role of the perfect filial daughter-in-law, and by pleasing Grandmother Jia, rules the entire household with an iron fist. One of the most remarkable multi-faceted personalities in the novel, Xifeng can be kind-hearted toward the poor and helpless. On the other hand, Xifeng can be cruel enough to kill. Her feisty personality, her loud laugh, and her great beauty contrast with many frail, weak-willed beauties of 18th-century Chinese literature. She makes a fortune through loan sharking and brings downfall to the family. She dies soon after the family assets are seized by the government. *Jia Qiaojie () Wang Xifeng's and Jia Lian's daughter. She is a child through much of the novel. After the fall of the house of Jia, in the version of Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan, she marries the son of a wealthy rural family introduced by Granny Liu and goes on to lead a happy, uneventful life in the countryside. *Li Wan (; Meaning: White Silk) Baoyu's elder sister-in-law, widow of Baoyu's deceased elder brother, Jia Zhu (Ë≥àÁè†). Her primary task is to bring up her son Lan and watch over her female cousins. The novel portrays Li Wan, a young widow in her late twenties, as a mild-mannered woman with no wants or desires, the perfect Confucian ideal of a proper mourning widow. She eventually attains high social status due to the success of her son at the Imperial Exams, but the novel sees her as a tragic figure because she wasted her youth upholding the strict standards of behavior. *Qin Keqing () Daughter-in-law to Jia Zhen. Of all the characters in the novel, the circumstances of her life and early death are amongst the most mysterious. Apparently a very beautiful and flirtatious woman, she carried on an affair with her father-in-law and dies before the second quarter of the novel. Her bedroom is bedecked with priceless artifacts belonging to extremely sensual women, both historical and mythological. In her bed, Bao Yu first travels to the Land of Illusion where he has a sexual encounter with Two-In-One, who represents Xue Baochai and Lin Daiyu. Two-in-One's name is also Keqing, making Qin Keqing also a significant character in Bao Yu's sexual experience. The original twelve songs hint that Qin Keqing hanged herself.

Also called the Matriarch or the Dowager, the daughter of Marquis Shi of Jinling. Grandmother to both Baoyu and Daiyu, she is the highest living authority in the Rongguo house and the oldest and most respected of the entire clan, yet also a doting person. She has two sons, Jia She and Jia Zheng, and a daughter, Min, Daiyu's mother. Daiyu is brought to the house of the Jias at the insistence of Grandmother Jia, and she helps Daiyu and Baoyu bond as childhood playmates and, later, kindred spirits. She distributes her savings among her relatives after the seizure of their properties by the government shortly before her death. *Jia She () The elder son of the Dowager. He is the father of Jia Lian and Jia Yingchun. He is a treacherous and greedy man, and a womanizer. He is jealous of his younger brother whom his mother favors. He is later stripped of his title and banished by the government. *Jia Zheng () Baoyu's father, the younger son of the Dowager. He is a disciplinarian and Confucian scholar. Afraid his one surviving heir will turn bad, he imposes strict rules on his son, and uses occasional corporal punishment. He has a wife, Lady Wang, and one concubine: Zhao. He is a Confucian scholar who tries to be an upright and decent person. He is out of touch with reality and is a hands-off person at home and in court. *Jia Lian () Xifeng's husband and Baoyu's paternal elder cousin, a notorious womanizer whose numerous affairs cause much trouble with his jealous wife, including affairs with men that are not known by his wife. His pregnant concubine (Second Sister You) eventually dies by his wife's engineering. He and his wife are in charge of most hiring and monetary allocation decisions, and often fight over this power. He is a cad with a flawed character but he still has a conscience. *Xiangling (È¶ôËè±; Hawkes/Minford translation: Caltrop; Meaning: Fragrant Water caltrop) ‚Äì the Xues' maid, born Zhen Yinglian (ÁîÑËã±ËìÆ, a homophone with \\"deserving pity\\"), the kidnapped and lost daughter to Zhen Shiyin (ÁîÑÂ£´Èö±, a homophone with \\"Hiding the truth\\"), the country gentleman in Chapter 1. Her name is changed to Qiuling (ÁßãËè±) by Xue Pan's spoiled wife, Xia Jingui (Â§èÈáëÊ°Ç) who is jealous of her and tries to poison her. Xue Pan makes her the lady of the house after Jingui's death. She soon dies while giving birth. *Ping'er (Âπ≥ÂÖí; Hawkes/Minford translation: Patience; Meaning: Peace) Xifeng's chief maid and personal confidante; also concubine to Xifeng's husband, Jia Lian. Originally Xifeng's maid in the Wang household, she follows Xifeng as part of her dowry when Xifeng marries into the Jia household. She handles her troubles with grace, assists Xifeng capably and appears to have the respect of most of the household servants. She is also one of the very few people who can get close to Xifeng. She wields considerable power in the house as Xifeng's most trusted assistant, but uses her power sparingly and justly. She is supremely loyal to her mistress, but more soft-hearted and sweet- tempered. *Xue Pan (; Meaning: To Coil (as a dragon)) Baochai's older brother, a dissolute, idle rake who was a local bully in Jinling. He was known for his amorous exploits with both men and women. Not particularly well educated, he once killed a man over a servant-girl (Xiangling) and had the manslaughter case hushed up with money. *Granny Liu () A country rustic and distant relation to the Wang family, who provides a comic contrast to the ladies of the Rongguo House during two visits. She eventually rescues Qiaojie from her maternal uncle, who wanted to sell her. *Lady Wang () A Buddhist, primary wife of Jia Zheng. Daughter of one of the four most prominent families of Jinling. Because of her purported ill-health, she hands over the running of the household to her niece, Xifeng, as soon as the latter marries into the Jia household, although she retains overall control over Xifeng's affairs so that the latter always has to report to her. Although Lady Wang appears to be a kind mistress and a doting mother, she can in fact be cruel and ruthless when her authority is challenged. She pays a great deal of attention to Baoyu's maids to make sure that Baoyu does not develop romantic relationships with them. *Aunt Xue (), n√©e Wang Baoyu's maternal aunt, mother to Pan and Baochai, sister to Lady Wang. She is kindly and affable for the most part, but finds it hard to control her unruly son. *Hua Xiren (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Aroma; Meaning: Flower Assails Men) Baoyu's principal maid and his unofficial concubine. While she still has standing as the Dowager's maid, the Dowager gave her to Baoyu so, in practice, Xiren is his maid. Considerate and forever worried about Baoyu, she is the partner of his first adolescent sexual encounter in the real world in Chapter 5. After Baoyu's disappearance, she unknowingly marries actor Jiang Yuhan, one of Baoyu's friends. Qingwen, painted by Xu Baozhuan *Qingwen (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Skybright, Meaning: Sunny Multicolored Clouds) Baoyu's personal maid. Brash, haughty and the most beautiful maid in the household, Qingwen is said to resemble Daiyu very strongly. Of all of Baoyu's maids, she is the only one who dares to argue with Baoyu when reprimanded, but is also extremely devoted to him. She is disdainful of Xiren's attempt to use her sexual relation with Baoyu to raise her status in the family. Lady Wang later suspected her of having an affair with Baoyu and publicly dismisses her on that account; angry at the unfair treatment and of the indignities and slanders that attended her as a result, Qingwen dies of an illness shortly after leaving the Jia household. *Yuanyang (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Faithful; Meaning: \\"Pair of Mandarin Ducks\\") The Dowager's chief maid. She rejects a marriage proposal (as concubine) to the lecherous Jia She, Grandmother Jia's eldest son and commits suicide right after the Dowager's death. *Mingyan (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Tealeaf, Meaning: Tea Vapor) Baoyu's page boy. Knows his master like the back of his hand. *Zijuan (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Nightingale; Meaning: \\"Purple Rhododendron or Cuckoo\\") Daiyu's faithful maid, ceded by the Dowager to her granddaughter. She later becomes a nun to serve Jia Xichun. *Xueyan (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Snowgoose) Daiyu's other maid. She came with Daiyu from Yangzhou, and comes across as a young, sweet girl. She is asked to accompany the veiled bride Baochai to trick Baoyu into believing that he is marrying Daiyu. *Concubine Zhao () A concubine of Jia Zheng. She is the mother of Jia Tanchun and Jia Huan, Baoyu's half-siblings. She longs to be the mother of the head of the household, which she does not achieve. She plots to murder Baoyu and Xifeng with black magic, and it is believed that her plot cost her own life. =Notable minor characters= A scene from the story, painted by Xu Baozhuan *Qin Zhong (Áß¶Èêò, a homophone with \\"great lover\\") ‚Äì His elder sister is Qin Keqing, Baoyu's nephew's wife, and so he is technically a generation younger than Baoyu. Both he and Qin Keqing are the adopted children of Qin Ye (Áß¶Ê•≠). The two boys enroll in the Jia clan's school together and he becomes Baoyu's best friend. The novel leaves open the possibility that things might have gone beyond innocent friendship. Qin Zhong and the novice Zhineng (Êô∫ËÉΩ, \\"Intelligent\\"; \\"Sapientia\\" in the Hawkes translation) fall in love with tragic consequences, for Qin Zhong dies soon after from a combination of a severe beating administered by his father, sexual exhaustion, grief and remorse.The Story of the Stone, Vol I The Golden Days, translated by David Hawkes, pp. 206‚Äì209, 300, 320‚Äì23. See also Jonathan Spence, \\"Ch'ing,\\" in K.C. Chang, ed., Food in Chinese Culture (Yale University Press, 1977), p. 279. *Jia Lan (Ë≥àËò≠) ‚Äì Son of Baoyu's deceased older brother Jia Zhu and his virtuous wife Li Wan. Jia Lan is an appealing child throughout the book and at the end succeeds in the imperial examinations to the credit of the family. *Jia Zhen (Ë≥àÁèç) ‚Äì Head of the Ningguo House, the elder branch of the Jia family. He has a wife, Lady You, a younger sister, Jia Xichun, and many concubines. He is extremely greedy and the unofficial head of the clan, since his father has retired. He has an adulterous affair with his daughter-in-law, Qin Keqing. *Lady You (Â∞§Ê∞è) ‚Äì Wife of Jia Zhen. She is the sole mistress of the Ningguo House. *Jia Rong (Ë≥àËìâ) ‚Äì Jia Zhen's son. He is the husband of Qin Keqing. An exact copy of his father, he is the Cavalier of the Imperial Guards. *Second Sister You (Â∞§‰∫åÂßê) ‚Äì Jia Lian takes her in secret as his lover. Though a kept woman before she was married, after her wedding she becomes a faithful and doting wife. Because of Wang Xifeng's intrigue, she finally kills herself by swallowing a large piece of gold. *Lady Xing (ÈÇ¢Â§´‰∫∫) ‚Äì Jia She's wife. She is Jia Lian's stepmother. *Jia Huan (Ë≥àÁí∞) ‚Äì Son of Concubine Zhao. He and his mother are both reviled by the family, and he carries himself like a kicked dog. He shows his malignant nature by spilling candle wax, intending to blind his half-brother Baoyu. *Sheyue (È∫ùÊúà; Hawkes/Minford translation: Musk) ‚Äî Baoyu's main maid after Xiren and Qingwen. She is beautiful and caring, a perfect complement to Xiren. *Qiutong (ÁßãÊ°ê) ‚Äî Jia Lian's other concubine. Originally a maid of Jia She, she is given to Jia Lian as a concubine. She is a very proud and arrogant woman. *Sister Sha (ÂÇªÂ§ßÂßê) ‚Äì A maid who does rough work for the Dowager. She is guileless but amusing and caring. In the Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan version, she unintentionally informs Daiyu of Baoyu's secret marriage plans. Themes In the opening chapter of the novel, a couplet is introduced: As one critic points out, the couplet signifies \\"not a hard and fast division between truth and falsity, reality and illusion, but the impossibility of making such distinctions in any world, fictional or 'actual.'\\" The name of the main family, Jia (Ë≥à, pronounced ji«é), is a homophone with the character ji«é ÂÅá, meaning false or fictitious; this is mirrored by another family that has the surname Zhen (ÁîÑ, pronounced zhƒìn), a homophone for the word \\"real\\" (Áúü). It is suggested that the novel's family is both a realistic reflection and a fictional or \\"dream\\" version of Cao's own family. The novel is most often titled H√≥ng l√≥u M√®ng (Á¥ÖÊ®ìÂ§¢), literally \\"Red Chamber Dream\\". \\"Red chamber\\" is an idiom with several definitions; one in particular refers to the sheltered chambers where the daughters of prominent families reside. It also refers to a dream in chapter five that Baoyu has, set in a \\"red chamber\\", where the fates of many of the characters are foreshadowed. \\"Chamber\\" is sometimes translated as \\"mansion\\" because of the scale of the Chinese word \\"Ê®ì\\". However the word \\"mansion\\" is thought to be an erroneous understanding of the phrase h√≥ngl√≥u, which should more accurately be translated as \\"chamber\\", according to scholar Zhou Ruchang. The novel depicts many aspects of Chinese culture of the time, such as medicine, cuisine, tea culture, festivities, proverbs, mythology, Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, filial piety, opera, music, architecture, funeral rites, painting, classic literature and the Four Books, are vividly portrayed. Among these, the novel is particularly notable for its grand use of poetry. Early Chinese critics identified its two major themes as those of romantic love, and of the transitoriness of earthly material values, as outlined in Buddhist and Taoist philosophies.Chen (2005), pp. 31‚Äì37 Since the rediscovery of Cao Xueqin as the novel's author, its autobiographical aspects have come to the fore, in particular that of Cao Xueqin's clan which was similarly raided in real life, and placed under the scrutiny of 20th- and 21st-century critics. During Mao Zedong's era, a Marxist interpretation of the novel was the focus of some Chinese critics, which deplores the feudal society's corruption and emphasizes the clashes between the classes. Since the 1980s, critics began embracing the novel's richness and aesthetics in a more multicultural context.Chen (2005), pp. 12‚Äì15 Reception and influences in modern era The cover of a 1912 printed edition of the Youzheng version In the late 19th century, Hong Lou Meng's influence was so pervasive that the reformer Liang Qichao attacked it along with another classic novel Water Margin as \\"incitement to robbery and lust\\", and for smothering the introduction of Western style novels, which he regarded as more socially responsible.Leo Ou-fan Lee, \\"Literary Trends I: The Quest for Modernity, 1895‚Äì1927,\\" in John K. Fairbank, ed., Cambridge History of China Vol. 12 Republican China 1912‚Äì1949 Pt I (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983): 455. The eminent scholar Wang Guowei, however, achieved a new method of literary interpretation in an innovative and path-breaking 1904 essay which invoked the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Wang called the novel \\"the tragedy of tragedies\\", in contrast to the prosperous endings in most earlier drama and fiction. Wang further proclaims the novel as \\"[W]orthy of being considered as the one great masterpiece in the realm of Chinese art.\\"Wang Guowei, as quoted in Lin Yutang's appreciation of \\"The Red Chamber Dream\\", Renditions (Spring 1974), p. 23 In the early 20th century, although the New Culture Movement took a critical view of the Confucian classics, the scholar Hu Shih used the tools of textual criticism to put the novel in an entirely different light, as a foundation for national culture. Hu and his students, Gu Jiegang and Yu Pingbo, first established that Cao Xueqin was the work's author. Taking the question of authorship seriously reflected a new respect for fiction, since the lesser forms of literature had not been traditionally ascribed to particular individuals. Hu next built on Cai Yuanpei's investigations of the printing history of the early editions to prepare reliable reading texts. The final, and in some respects most important task, was to study the vocabulary and usage of Cao's Beijing dialect as a basis for Modern Mandarin. In the 1920s, scholars and devoted readers developed Hongxue, or Redology into both a scholarly field and a popular avocation. Among the avid readers was the young Mao Zedong, who later claimed to have read the novel five times and praised it as one of China's greatest works of literature.Li Zhisui, The Private Life of Chairman Mao (New York: Random House, 1994), p. 82. The influence of the novel's themes and style are evident in many modern Chinese prose works. The early 1950s was a rich period for Redology with publication of major studies by Yu Pingbo. Zhou Ruchang, who as a young scholar had come to the attention of Hu Shih in the late 1940s, published his first study in 1953, which became a best seller.Editor's Preface, Ruchang Zhou, Between Noble and Humble: Cao Xueqin and the Dream of the Red Chamber (New York: Peter Lang, 2009), xiv. But in 1954 Mao personally criticized Yu Pingbo for his \\"bourgeois idealism\\" in failing to emphasize that the novel exposed the decadence of \\"feudal\\" society and the theme of class struggle. In the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Yu came under heavy criticism but the attacks were so extensive and full of quotations from his work that they spread Yu's ideas to many people who would not otherwise have known of their existence.Joey Bonner, \\"Y√º P'ing-Po and the Literary Dimension of the Controversy over Hung Lou Meng,\\" The China Quarterly 67 (1976): 546‚Äì581 ; Merle Goldman, Literary Dissent in Communist China (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1967). During the Cultural Revolution, the novel initially came under fire, though it quickly regained its prestige in the following years. Zhou Ruchang resumed his lifework, eventually publishing more than sixty biographical and critical studies. In 2006, Zhou, who had long distrusted Gao E's editions, and the novelist Liu Xinwu, author of popular studies of the novel, joined to produce a new 80 chapter version which Zhou had edited to eliminate the Cheng-Gao emendations. Liu completed an ending that was supposedly more true to Cao's original intent.Conspiracy of the Red Mansions. Danwei (6 December 2006). The novel continues to be influential on contemporary Chinese poets such as Middle Generation's An Qi, who paid homage to it in her poem To Cao Xueqin. Translations and reception in the West It is a major challenge to translate Cao's prose, which utilizes many levels of colloquial and literary language and incorporates forms of classic poetry that are integral to the novel. A 2014 study concluded that the work is a \\"challenge even to the most resourceful of translators, and the process of rendering it into another language is bound to involve more translation problems, techniques, and principles than the process of rendering any other literary work.\\" The first recorded attempt at translating the novel into English was done by the noted Protestant missionary and sinologist Robert Morrison (1782‚Äì1834) in 1812 when he translated part of chapter four of the novel for the purpose of having it published in the second volume of his 1812 book Horae Sinicae (this book was never published). In 1816, Morrison did publish a translation of a conversation from chapter 31 in his Chinese language textbook Dialogues and Detached Sentences in the Chinese Language. In 1819, a short excerpt from chapter 3 was translated by the famous British diplomat and sinologist John Francis Davis (1795‚Äì1890) and published in the London Journal Quarterly Review. Davis also published a poem from chapter 3 of the novel in 1830 in the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society.Gray, Ronald \\"The Stone's Curious Voyage to the West: A Brisk Overview of Honglou Meng‚Äôs English Translation History and English Hongxue.\\" Journal of Sino- Western Communication 3.2 (December, 2011). The next translation into English was a literal translation of selected passages prepared for foreigners learning Chinese published by the Presbyterian Mission Press of Ningbo in 1846.Robert Thom, The Chinese Speaker; or, Extracts from Works Written in the Mandarin Language, as Spoken at Peking (Ningpo: Presbyterian mission Press, 1846). Edward Charles Bowra of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs published a translation of the first eight chapters in 1868E. C.

Bencraft Joly of the first fifty-six chapters in 1892.The Dream of the Red Chamber or (Hung Lou Meng) (Hong Kong: Kelly & Walsh) 1891, 1892. Hung Lou Meng, from the Project Gutenberg, Hong Kong: Kelly & Walsh, 1892‚Äì1893, paper published edition is also available. Wildside Press, ; and Hard Press, 3 November 2006, . Text of the 1892‚Äì1893 English translation at University of Adelaide; rpr. with a new foreword by John Minford, Tokyo; North Clarendon, Vt.: 2010 . An abridged translation by Wang Chi-Chen which emphasized the central love story was published in 1929, with a preface by Arthur Waley. Waley said that in the passages which recount dreams \\"we feel most clearly the symbolic or universal value\\" of the characters. \\"Pao Yu\\", Waley continued, stands for \\"imagination and poetry\\" and his father for \\"all those sordid powers of pedantry and restriction which hamper the artist\\".Dream of the Red Chamber (Wang Chi-Chen), (New York: Doubleday; London: Routledge, 1929) enlarged version (New York: Twayne: 1958 ). In a 1930 review of Wang's translated version, Harry Clemons of The Virginia Quarterly Review wrote \\"This is a great novel\\", and along with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it \\"ranks foremost\\" among the novels of classic Chinese literature. Although Clemons felt \\"meaning was only fragmentarily revealed\\" in the English translated prose and that \\"many of the incidents\\" and \\"much of the poetry\\" were omitted, he nevertheless thought \\"at any rate the effort to read The Dream of the Red Chamber is eminently worth making.\\" In 1958 Wang published an expansion on his earlier abridgement, though it was still truncated at 60 chapters. The stream of translations and literary studies in the West grew steadily, building on Chinese language scholarship. The 1932 German translation by Franz KuhnDer Traum Der Roten Kammer (Leipzig: Insel-verlag, 1932). was the basis of an abridged version, The Dream of the Red Chamber, by Florence and Isabel McHugh published in 1958,(New York: Pantheon: 1958, ). Available at Open Library (link). and a later French version. Bramwell Seaton Bonsall, completed a translation in the 1950s, Red Chamber Dream, a typescript of which is available on the web. Critic Anthony West wrote in The New Yorker in 1958 that the novel is to the Chinese \\"very much what The Brothers Karamazov is to Russian and Remembrance of Things Past is to French literature\\" and \\"it is beyond question one of the great novels of all literature.\\" Kenneth Rexroth in a 1958 review of the McHugh translation, describes the novel as among the \\"greatest works of prose fiction in all the history of literature\\", for it is \\"profoundly humane\\". The first complete English translation to be published was by David Hawkes some century and a half after the first English translation. Hawkes was already a recognized redologist and had previously translated Chu Ci when Penguin Classics approached him in 1970 to make a translation which could appeal to English readers. After resigning from his professorial position, Hawkes published the first eighty chapters in three volumes (1973, 1977, 1980). The Story of the Stone (1973‚Äì1980), the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by John Minford consists of five volumes and 2,339 pages of actual core text (not including Prefaces, Introductions and Appendices).(Penguin Classics and Bloomington: Indiana University Press, five volumes, 1973‚Äì1980. , , ; , ). The wordcount of the Penguin Classics English translation is estimated as 845,000 words. In a 1980 review of the Hawkes and Minford translation in The New York Review of Books, Frederic Wakeman, Jr. described the novel as a \\"masterpiece\\" and the work of a \\"literary genius\\". Cynthia L. Chennault of the University of Florida stated that \\"The Dream is acclaimed as one of the most psychologically penetrating novels of world literature.\\" The novel and its author have been described as among the most significant works of literature and literary figures of the past millennium. Extracts from the Hawkes translation were published as The Dream of the Red Chamber (New York: Penguin, Penguin 1960s Classics Series, 1996. .) The respected and prolific team Gladys Yang and Yang Hsien-yi also translated a complete version, A Dream of Red Mansions (Beijing: Foreign Language Press, three volumes, 1978‚Äì1980). The sinologist Old≈ôich Kr√°l also undertook a Czech translation of the entire novel, Sen v ƒçerven√©m domƒõ (Prague: Odeon, three volumes, 1986‚Äì1988). In 2014, an abridged translation of Dream by writer Lin Yutang resurfaced in a Japanese library. Lin's translation, about half the length of the original, is reportedly not a literal one. Sequels and continuations Owing to its immense popularity, numerous sequels and continuations to the novel have been published, even during the Qing era. There are currently more than thirty recorded sequels or continuations to the novel, including modern ones.„ÄäÊòéÊ∏ÖÂ∞èËØ¥Á†îÁ©∂Ê¶ÇËÆ∫„Äã by ÂÖöÊúàÂºÇ„ÄÅÂº†Âª∑ÂÖ¥ (‰∏≠Â§ÆÁºñËØëÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 2015), , lists 15 alone printed during the Qing dynasty and 17 during the Republican era (1912‚Äì1949). Modern (post-1949) continuations tend to follow after the eightieth chapter, and include those by Zhang Zhi,Âº†‰πã, „ÄäÁ∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶Êñ∞Ë°•„Äã, 1984. Zhou Yuqing,Âë®ÁéâÊ∏Ö, „ÄäÁ∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶Êñ∞Áª≠„Äã, 1990.

Adaptations A scene from Dream of the Red Chamber as depicted in Chinese opera At least fourteen cinematic adaptations of the Dream of the Red Chamber have been made, including the 1944 film directed by Bu Wancang, the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers adaptation starring Sylvia Chang and Brigitte Lin, and the 1988 film directed by Xie Tieli (Ë∞¢ÈìÅÈ™ä) and Zhao Yuan (ËµµÂÖÉ). This last film took two years to prepare and three years to shoot, and remains, at 735 minutes, the longest Chinese film ever made. In 1981, Jiangsu Song and Dance Troupe premiered a dance drama version of Dream of the Red Chamber. A reworked version was performed in 1982 in Beijing by China Opera and Dance Drama Theatre featuring lead dancer Chen Ailian. At least ten television adaptations have been produced (excluding numerous Chinese opera adaptations), and they include the renowned 1987 television series, which is regarded by many within China as being a near-definitive adaptation of the novel. It was initially somewhat controversial as few Redologists believed a TV adaptation could do the novel full justice. Producer and director Wang Fulin's decision in employing non-professional young actors was vindicated as the TV series gained enormous popularity in China. The series' success owes much to composer Wang Liping (ÁéãÁ´ãÂπ≥). He set many of the novel's classical verses to music, taking as long as four years to deliberate and complete his compositions. Other television versions include a 1996 Taiwanese series and a 2010 version directed by Fifth Generation director Li Shaohong. Unlike the other great Chinese novels, particularly Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Journey to the West, the Dream of the Red Chamber has received little attention in the gaming world, with only two Chinese language visual novels having been released as of 2017. Hong Lou Meng and Hong Lou Meng: Lin Daiyu yu Bei Jingwang () were both released by Beijing Entertainment All Technology (). The latter one was released on 8 January 2010, and it is an extended version of the first game, with the main heroines of the game fully voiced and additional CG+endings. An English-language opera based on the novel in two acts was composed by Chinese American composer Bright Sheng, with libretto by Sheng and David Henry Hwang. The three-hour opera had its world premiere on 10 September 2016, by the San Francisco Opera.

In his writings he styles himself as \\"Athenagoras, the Athenian, Philosopher, and Christian\\". There is some evidence that he was a Platonist before his conversion, but this is not certain. Athenagoras' feast day is observed on 24 July in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  Work and writings  Although his work appears to have been well-known and influential, mention of him by other early Christian apologists, notably in the extensive writings of Eusebius, is strangely absent. It may be that his treatises, circulating anonymously, were for a time considered as the work of another apologist, or there may have been other circumstances now lost. There are only two mentions of him in early Christian literature: several accredited quotations from his Apology in a fragment of Methodius of Olympus (died 312) and some untrustworthy biographical details in the fragments of the Christian History of Philip of Side (c. 425). Philip of Side claims that Athenagoras headed the Catechetical School of Alexandria (which is probably incorrect and contradicted by Eusebius)\\"Introductory Note to the Writings of Athenagoras\\", Roberts-Donaldson translation, Kirby, Peter. \\"Athenagoras of Athens.\\" Early Christian Writings. 2018. and notes that Athenagoras converted to Christianity after initially familiarizing himself with the Scriptures in an attempt to controvert them. His writings bear witness to his erudition and culture, his power as a philosopher and rhetorician, his keen appreciation of the intellectual temper of his age, and his tact and delicacy in dealing with the powerful opponents of his religion. Thus his writings are credited by some later scholars as having had a more significant impact on their intended audience than the now better-known writings of his more polemical and religiously-grounded contemporaries. Of his writings, of which there were likely many, there have been preserved but a few: his Embassy (œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤ŒµŒØŒ±) for the Christians (more usually called by the Latin titled Legatio Pro Christianis or simply the Legatio and often referred to as the Apology), and a treatise titled the Resurrection of the Dead a.k.a. On the Resurrection of the Body. The Embassy for the Christians, the date of which is fixed by internal evidence as late in 176 or 177, was a carefully written plea for justice to the Christians made by a philosopher, on philosophical grounds, to the Emperors Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus, whom he flatters as conquerors, \\"but above all, philosophers\\". He first complains of the illogical and unjust discrimination against the Christians and of the calumnies they suffer, and then meets the charge of atheism (a major complaint directed at the Christians of the day was that by disbelieving in the Roman gods, they were showing themselves to be atheists). He establishes the principle of monotheism, citing pagan poets and philosophers in support of the very doctrines for which Christians are condemned, and argues for the superiority of the Christian belief in God to that of pagans. This first strongly-reasoned argument for the unity of God in Christian literature is supplemented by an able exposition of the Trinity. Assuming then the defensive, he justifies the Christian abstention from worship of the national deities by arguing that it is absurd and indecent, quoting at length the pagan poets and philosophers in support of his contention. Finally, he meets the charges of immorality by exposing the Christian ideal of purity, even in thought, and the inviolable sanctity of the marriage bond. In refuting the charge of cannibalism Athenagoras states that Christians detest all cruelty and murder, refusing to attend contests of gladiators and wild beasts and holding that women who use drugs to bring on abortion commit murder for which they will have to give an account to God., \\"Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. II -- Writings of Athenagoras -- A Plea For the Christians -- Chapter XXXV - The Christians Condemn and Detest all Cruelty\\", Retrieved 2012 -11-06 The treatise on the Resurrection of the Dead, the first complete exposition of the doctrine in Christian literature, was written later than the Apology, to which it may be considered as an appendix. The writer brings to the defence of the doctrine the best that contemporary philosophy could adduce. After meeting the objections common to his time, he seeks to prove the possibility of a resurrection in view either of the power of the Creator, or of the nature of our bodies. To exercise such powers is neither unworthy of God nor unjust to other creatures. He argues that the nature and end of man demand a perpetuation of the life of body and soul. Although he clearly teaches the immortality of the soul and of the resurrection body, he argues that the soul is unconscious between death and resurrection: \\"[T]hose who are dead and those who sleep are subject to similar states, as regards at least the stillness and the absence of all sense of the present or the past, or rather of existence itself and their own life.\\" Chap. xvi., retrieved 7 July 2018 There are reasons to think that De resurrectione is not by Athenagoras but by some 4th-century author, e.g. the use of at least one term (·ºÄŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÜŒøœÅŒ≠œâ) coined by Philo of Alexandria and not widely known before the time of Origen.

It was released on August 26, 1997 on Birdman Records, while Frusciante was addicted to drugs and was no longer performing with Red Hot Chili Peppers. The record is an amalgamation of songs from various periods of time, mainly extras not included on Frusciante's debut Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994); included, however, are several tracks recorded in 1993, 1994, 1996 and \\"A Fall Thru the Ground\\" from 1988. Recording Many songs from Smile from the Streets You Hold were recorded when Frusciante was still with the Chili Peppers and are from the same period as his previous solo album, Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt. One of the earliest songs to be recorded is A Fall Thru the Ground, which was recorded in 1988. In a 1997 interview with Guitar Player, Frusciante claimed to have maintained active communication with the spirit world during the album's recording phase: Actor River Phoenix, a good friend of Frusciante and the rest of the Chili Peppers, is featured on two tracks, \\"Height Down\\" (originally titled \\"Soul Removal\\"), and \\"Well I've Been\\" (originally titled \\"Bought Her Soul\\"). Both songs were supposed to be released on Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt, but were pulled by request of Phoenix's family after Phoenix's death. \\"Life's A Bath\\" was recorded in late 1993 while Frusciante was living in a rental home after his former house was damaged in a fire. The previously mentioned \\"Height Down\\" and \\"Well, I've Been\\" were recorded in spring 1993 at Frusciante's former home. \\"I May Again Know John\\", \\"Enter A Uh\\", \\"Nigger Song\\" & the second part of \\"Smile From The Streets You Hold\\" were recorded in late 1994 while Frusciante was living in New York City. \\"More\\", \\"I Can't See Until I See Your Eyes\\", and \\"Estress\\" were recorded to a cassette on a boombox in 1996. Frusciante's poor health is apparent in his voice. Release Frusciante had Smile from the Streets You Hold and Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt removed from record stores in 1998 after rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers because he felt uncomfortable with them being available to the public. He is quoted as saying that he released Smile from the Streets You Hold for drug money. Niandra Lades was eventually re-issued and in the early 2000s, Frusciante stated he will one day re-release Smile from the Streets You Hold. There is also a second print of Smile from the Streets You Hold available. The songs on the second print are much lower in sound quality and have frequent hiss and hum, most notable in \\"Nigger Song\\" which obscures the recording somewhat. It has been speculated that the original release had had the recordings professionally mastered, but the second release used Frusciante's untampered tapes by mistake. The title song \\"Smile from the Streets You Hold\\", is split in two separate tracks. During a 2001 solo performance, Frusciante said the song was about a friend, with the first half written while the person was alive and the second part being written after their death. Fans have speculated that the song may be about River Phoenix, although this has never been confirmed. The second print also includes an extended version of \\"Life's a Bath\\". Another notable difference between the 17-track version and the 18-track version is that on the former, John can be heard taking a hit from a bong on \\"For Air\\".  Reception  Reviewing the album for Pitchfork, James Wisdom wrote: \\"Smile For The Streets You Hold would easily have to be the easiest CD to hate that I've ever heard, but hidden between the disturbingly twisted and tortured vocals there are a few gems ... It's fringe -- way, way out there. I'm giving it a 0% because you'll have to call this one on your own, sorry.\\" Track listing References Category:John Frusciante albums Category:1997 albums Category:Birdman Records albums ","title":"Smile from the Streets You Hold"},{"id":"263027","title":"Travel behavior"},{"id":"263031","text":"Davao may refer to: Cities and metropolitan areas *Davao City, an independent highly urbanized city in the Davao Region of Mindanao, Philippines *Metro Davao, the metropolitan area centered on Davao City Regions and provinces *Davao (province) (1914‚Äì1967), a defunct/former province in the Philippines *Davao Region, an administrative region in the Philippines succeeding the former Davao province, containing the present provinces of: **Davao de Oro **Davao del Norte **Davao del Sur **Davao Occidental **Davao Oriental Hubs of transportation *Francisco Bangoy International Airport (DVO), Davao City's main airport *Port of Davao, Davao City's main seaport Water bodies *Davao Gulf, Mindanao, Philippines *Davao River, Mindanao, Philippines ","title":"Davao"},{"id":"263033","text":"Anadoluhisarƒ± (), known historically as G√ºzelce Hisar (\\"the Beauteous Castle\\") is a medieval fortress located in Istanbul, Turkey on the Anatolian (Asian) side of the Bosporus. The complex is the oldest surviving Turkish architectural structure built in Istanbul, and further gives its name to the neighborhood around it in the city's Beykoz district. History Anadoluhisarƒ± was built between 1393 and 1394 on the commission of the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, as part of his preparations for a siege on the then- Byzantine city of Constantinople. Constructed on an area of , the fortress is situated at the narrowmost point of the Bosporus, where the strait is a mere wide. The site is bound by G√∂ksu () creek to the south, and was previously home to the ruins of a Roman temple dedicated to Uranus. Erected primarily as a watch fort, the citadel has a tall, quadratic main tower within the walls of an irregular pentagon, with five watchtowers at the corners. Constantinople was blockaded from 1394 on, but Bayezid's campaign was first interrupted by the Crusade of Nicopolis, and then ended with his defeat at the Battle of Ankara. An 11-year civil war followed, which ended with the ascent of Mehmed I to the throne. His grandson, Sultan Mehmed II reinforced the fortress with a two-meter-thick wall and three additional watchtowers, and added further extensions, including a warehouse and living quarters. As part of his plans to launch a renewed military campaign to conquer Constantinople, Mehmed II further built a sister structure to Anadoluhisarƒ± across the Bosphorus called Rumelihisarƒ±, and the two fortresses worked in tandem in 1453 to throttle all maritime traffic along the Bosphorus, thus helping the Ottomans achieve their goal of making the city of Constantinople (later renamed Istanbul) their new imperial capital. After the Ottoman conquest of the city, Anadoluhisarƒ± served as a customs house and military prison, and after several centuries, fell into disrepair. After the fall of the Ottomans and the 1923 establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the newly-created Turkish Ministry of Culture tended to and ultimately restored the site in 1991 - 1993. Today, Anadoluhisarƒ± lends a picturesque appearance to its corner of the Bosphorus alongside the timber yalƒ± homes that define the neighborhood, and functions as a historical site, although it is not open to the public.

The red cars are those causing the gridlock by stopping in the middle of the intersection. John Glen Wardrop (1922‚Äì1989), born in Warwick, England, was an English mathematician and transport analyst who developed what became known as Wardrop's first and second principles of equilibrium in the field of traffic assignment. He studied at Downing College, Cambridge, and worked in Operational Research at British Bomber Command during the Second World War. He then helped to set up, and later headed, a Traffic and Safety Division of the British Road Research Unit in Slough, where he published his work on equilibrium. In later life he worked at University College, London.  Wardrop equilibria  In studies about traffic assignment, network equilibrium models are commonly used for the prediction of traffic patterns in transportation networks that are subject to congestion. The idea of traffic equilibrium originated as early as 1924, with Frank Knight. The concepts are related to the idea of Nash equilibrium in game theory developed separately. However, in transportation networks, there are many players, making the analysis complex. In 1952, Wardrop stated two principles that formalize different notions of equilibrium, and introduced the alternative behavior postulate of the minimization of the total travel costs: User equilibrium. Wardrop's first principle of route choice, now known as \\"user equilibrium\\", \\"selfish Wardrop equilibrium\\" or just \\"Wardrop equilibrium\\", and is identical to the notion postulated by Knight, became accepted as a sound and simple behavioral principle to describe the spreading of trips over alternate routes because of congested conditions. It states that the journey times in all routes actually used are equal and less than those that would be experienced by a single vehicle on any unused route. The traffic flows that satisfy this principle are usually referred to as \\"user equilibrium\\" (UE) flows, since each user chooses the route that is the best. Specifically, a user-optimized equilibrium is reached when no user may lower his transportation cost through unilateral action. A variant is the stochastic user equilibrium (SUE), in which no driver can unilaterally change routes to improve his/her perceived, rather than actual, travel times. System optimal. Wardrop's second principle, now known as \\"system optimal\\" or \\"social Wardrop equilibrium\\" states that at equilibrium, the average journey time is at a minimum. That implies that all users behave cooperatively in choosing their routes to ensure the most efficient use of the whole system. For example, this would be the case if an omnipotent central authority could command them all which routes to take. Traffic flows satisfying Wardrop's second principle are generally deemed system optimal (SO). Economists and modellers have argued that it can be achieved with marginal cost road pricing, or by a central routing authority dictating route choices. The potential fall in efficiency from social to selfish equilibria is an example of the price of anarchy. Wardrop did not provide algorithms for solving Wardrop equilibria, he simply defined them as desiderata. The first mathematical model of network equilibrium was formulated by Beckmann, McGuire and Winsten in 1956. As with Nash equilibria, simple solutions to selfish equilibrium can be found through iterative simulation, with each agent assigning its route given the choices of the others. This is very slow computationally. The Frank‚ÄìWolfe algorithm improves on this by exploiting dynamic programming properties of the network structure, to find solutions with a faster form of iteration. Creating new and faster algorithms for both selfish and social Wardrop equilibria remains an active research topic in the 2010s.

Nobel laureates Milton Friedman, George Stigler and James M. Buchanan were all students of Knight at Chicago. Ronald Coase said that Knight, without teaching him, was a major influence on his thinking. F.A. Hayek considered Knight to be one of the major figures in preserving and promoting classical liberal thought in the twentieth century. Paul Samuelson named Knight (along with Harry Gunnison Brown, Allyn Abbott Young, Henry Ludwell Moore, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Jacob Viner, and Henry Schultz) as one of the several \\"American saints in economics\\" born after 1860. Life and career Knight (B.A., Milligan College, 1911; B.S. and A.M., Tennessee, 1913; Ph.D., Cornell, 1916) was born in 1885 in McLean County, Illinois, the son of Julia Ann (Hyneman) and Winton Cyrus Knight. After his early study at the University of Tennessee, most of his academic career was spent at the University of Chicago, where he was the Morton D. Hall Distinguished Service Professor, Emeritus, of Social Science and Philosophy. Knight was one of the world's leading economists, having made significant contributions to many problems of both economic theory and social philosophy. He is best known for his Risk, Uncertainty and Profit, a monumental study of the role of the entrepreneur in economic life. In 1950 he was president of the American Economic Association and in 1957 the recipient of its coveted Francis A. Walker Award, given \\"not more frequently than once every five years to the living (American) economist who in the judgment of the awarding body has during his career made the greatest contribution to economics.\\" His ashes are interred in the crypt of First Unitarian Church of Chicago. Knight is best known as the author of the book Risk, Uncertainty and Profit (1921), based on his Ph.D. dissertation at Cornell University. In that book, he carefully distinguished between economic risk and uncertainty. Situations with risk were those where the outcomes were unknown but governed by probability distributions known at the outset. He argued that these situations, where decision making rules such as maximising expected utility can be applied, differ in a deep way from \\"uncertain\\" ones, in which not only the outcomes, but even the probability models that governed them, were unknown. Knight argued that uncertainty gave rise to economic profits that perfect competition could not eliminate. While most economists now acknowledge Knight's distinction between risk and uncertainty, the distinction has not resulted in much theoretical modelling or empirical work. However, the Knightian concept of uncertainty has been recognized in a variety of works: John Maynard Keynes discussed it at length in his Treatise on Probability; Armen Alchian relied on it for discussing market behavior in his seminal paper Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory; Paul Davidson incorporated it as an essential element in the Post Keynesian school of economics he co-founded; and G.L.S. Shackle explored the methodological consequences of Knight's and Keynes's fundamental uncertainty in his Epistemics and Economics. A more model-oriented contribution is the \\"Markets from Networks\\" model developed by sociologist Harrison White from 2002. Knight also famously debated A. C. Pigou about social costs. He also contributed to the argument for toll roads. He said that rather than congestion justifying government tolling of roads, privately owned roads would set tolls to reduce congestion to its efficient level. In particular, he developed the argument that forms the basis of analysis of traffic equilibrium, which has since become known as Wardrop's Principle: Knight was a co-founder and vice president of the Mont Pelerin Society of like-minded economists. Knight was raised Christian, but later became an atheist.Lanny Ebenstein (2007). Milton Friedman: A Biography. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 21. . Frank Knight was the other leading member in the department when Friedman was a graduate student. Born in 1885, Knight hailed from a rural Christian background but early became an atheist.

Born in Morges on Lake Geneva, he worked as a professor of medicine at the University of Lausanne. But his real love was the lake; his investigations of biology, chemistry, water circulation, and sedimentation, and most importantly their interactions, established the foundation of a new discipline. In his chief work, Le L√©man, published in three volumes between 1892 and 1904, he named his activity limnology in analogy with oceanography (\\"limnography\\" could have been confused with the limnograph, which measures water level in lakes). He discovered the phenomenon of density currents in lakes, and explained seiches, the rhythmic oscillations observed in enclosed waters. In collaboration with Wilhelm Ule, developed the Forel-Ule scale, used to evaluate the colour of a body of water. In a totally different field, in cooperation with the Italian seismologist Michele Stefano de Rossi, he developed the Rossi‚ÄìForel scale to describe the intensity of an earthquake. The Institute F.-A. Forel of the University of Geneva is named after Forel. Foreltinden, a mountain at Spitsbergen, Svalbard, is named after him. Forel (station) in Maule, Chile is named after him after he lived close to the station.

Founded in 1837, it is currently owned by Tribune Publishing. History The Sun was founded on May 17, 1837, by printer/editor/publisher/owner Arunah Shepherdson Abell (often listed as \\"A. S. Abell\\") and two associates, William Moseley Swain, and Azariah H. Simmons, recently from Philadelphia, where they had started and published the Public Ledger the year before. Abell was born in Rhode Island, became a journalist with the Providence Patriot and later worked with newspapers in New York City and Boston.Van Doren, Charles and Robert McKendry, ed., Webster's American Biographies. (Springfield, Massachusetts: Merriam-Webster, 1984) p. 5. The Abell family and descendants owned The Sun until 1910, when the local Black and Garrett families invested in the paper at the suggestion of former rival owner/publisher of The News, Charles H. Grasty, and they, along with Grasty gained a controlling interest; they retained the name A. S. Abell Company for the parent publishing company. That same year The Evening Sun was established under reporter, editor/columnist H.L. Mencken (1880‚Äì1956). From 1947 to 1986, The Sun was the owner of Maryland's first television station, WMAR-TV (Channel 2), founded 1947 and longtime affiliate of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) television network, along with several radio stations. The newspaper opened its first foreign bureau in London in 1924. Between 1955 and 1961, it added four new foreign offices. As Cold War tensions grew, it set up shop in Bonn, West Germany, in February 1955. (The bureau later moved to Berlin.) Eleven months later, The Sun opened a Moscow bureau, becoming one of the first U.S. newspapers to do so. A Rome office followed in July 1957, and in 1961, The Sun expanded to New Delhi. At its height, The Sun ran eight foreign bureaus, giving rise to its boast in a 1983 advertisement that \\"The Sun never sets on the world.\\" The paper was sold by Reg Murphy in 1986 to the Times- Mirror Company of the Los Angeles Times. The same week, a 115 year old rivalry ended. The oldest paper in the city, the News American, a Hearst paper since the 1920s, but with roots to 1773, folded. A decade later in 1997, The Sun acquired the Patuxent Publishing Company, a local suburban newspaper publisher that had a stable of 15 weekly papers and a few magazines in several communities and counties.\\"Baltimore Sun to buy Patuxent Publishing Columbia company has 15 newspapers, magazines in region\\", Baltimore Sun In the 1990s and 2000s, The Sun began cutting back its foreign coverage. In 1995 and 1996, the paper closed its Tokyo, Mexico City and Berlin bureaus. Two more‚ÄîBeijing and London‚Äîfell victim to cost-cutting in 2005. The final three foreign bureaus‚ÄîMoscow, Jerusalem, and Johannesburg, South Africa‚Äîfell a couple of years later. All were closed by 2008, as the Tribune Co. streamlined and downsized the newspaper chain's foreign reporting. Some material from The Suns foreign correspondents is archived at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\\"Baltimore Sun Foreign Bureaus records\\", University of Maryland, Baltimore County In the 21st century, The Sun, like most legacy newspapers in the United States, has suffered a number of setbacks in the competition with Internet and other sources, including a decline in readership and ads, a shrinking newsroom staff, and competition in 2005 from The Baltimore Examiner, a free daily that lasted two years to 2007, along with a similar Washington publication of a small chain recently started by new owners that took over the old Hearst flagship paper, the San Francisco Examiner. In 2000, the Times- Mirror company was purchased by the Tribune Company of Chicago. In 2014, it transferred its newspapers, including The Sun, to Tribune Publishing. On September 19, 2005, and again on August 24, 2008, The Baltimore Sun as the paper now titled itself, introduced new layout designs. Its circulation was 195,561 for the daily edition and 343,552 on Sundays. On April 29, 2009, the Tribune Company announced that it would lay off 61 of the 205 staff members in the Sun newsroom.Mirabella, Lorraine; The Baltimore Sun, April 28, 2009 On September 23, 2011, it was reported that the Baltimore Sun would be moving its web edition behind a paywall starting October 10, 2011. The Baltimore Sun is the flagship of the Baltimore Sun Media Group, which also produces the b free daily newspaper and more than 30 other Baltimore metropolitan-area community newspapers, magazines and Web sites. BSMG content reaches more than one million Baltimore-area readers each week and is the region's most widely read source of news. On February 20, 2014, The Baltimore Sun Media Group announced that they would buy the alternative weekly City Paper. In April, the Sun acquired the Maryland publications of Landmark Media Enterprises. Editions From 1910 to 1995 there were two distinct newspapers‚ÄîThe Sun in the morning and The Evening Sun in the afternoon‚Äîeach with its own separate reporting and editorial staff. The Evening Sun was first published in 1910 under the leadership of Charles H. Grasty, former owner of the Evening News, and a firm believer in the evening circulation. For most of its existence, The Evening Sun led its morning sibling in circulation. In 1959, the afternoon edition's circulation was 220,174, compared to 196,675 for the morning edition. However, by the 1980s, cultural, technological and economic shifts in America were eating away at afternoon newspapers' market share, with readers flocking to either morning papers or switching to nightly television news broadcasts. In 1992, the afternoon paper's circulation was 133,800. By mid-1995, The Evening Suns readership‚Äî86,360‚Äîhad been eclipsed by The Sun‚Äî264,583. The Evening Sun ceased publication on September 15, 1995. =Daily= After a period of roughly a year during which the paper's owners sometimes printed a two-section product, The Baltimore Sun now has three sections every weekday: News, Sports and alternating various business and features sections. On some days, comics and such features as the horoscope and TV listings are printed in the back of the Sports section. After dropping the standalone business section in 2009, The Sun brought back a business section on Tuesdays and Sundays in 2010, with business pages occupying part of the news section on other days. Features sections debuting in 2010 included a Saturday \\"Home\\" section, a Thursday \\"Style\\" section and a Monday section called \\"Sunrise.\\" The sports article written by Peter Schmuck is published only on week-days. =Sunday= The Sunday Sun for many years was noted for a locally produced rotogravure Maryland pictorial magazine section, featuring works by such acclaimed photographers as A. Aubrey Bodine. The Sunday Sun dropped the Sunday Sun Magazine in 1996 and now only carries Parade magazine weekly. A quarterly version of the Sun Magazine was resurrected in September 2010, with stories that included a comparison of young local doctors, an interview with actress Julie Bowen and a feature on the homes of a former Baltimore anchorwoman. Newsroom managers plan to add online content on a more frequent basis. =baltimoresun.com= The company introduced its website in September 1996. A redesign of the site was unveiled in June 2009, capping a six-month period of record online traffic. Each month from January through June, an average of 3.5 million unique visitors combined to view 36.6 million Web pages. Sun reporters and editors produce more than three dozen blogs on such subjects as technology, weather, education, politics, Baltimore crime, real estate, gardening, pets and parenting. Among the most popular are Dining@Large, which covers local restaurants; The Schmuck Stops Here, a Baltimore-centric sports blog written by Peter Schmuck; Z on TV, by media critic David Zurawik; and Midnight Sun, a nightlife blog. A Baltimore Sun iPhone app was released September 14, 2010. In 2018, in response to the European cookie law, baltimoresun.com began blocking visitors with European IP addresses rather than go to the effort of obtaining permission-requesting software, with the result that many European visitors (and those from some non-European countries) must visit the site via proxies, potentially muddling the website's analytics. =b= In 2008, the Baltimore Sun Media Group launched the daily paper b to target younger and more casual readers, ages 18 to 35. It was in tabloid format, with large graphics, creative design, and humor in focusing on entertainment, news, and sports. Its companion website was bthesite.com. The paper transitioned from daily to weekly publication in 2011. It ceased publication entirely in August 2015, more than a year after the Baltimore Sun Media Group acquired City Paper. Contributors The Baltimore Sun has been home many notable journalists, including reporter, essayist, and language scholar H.L. Mencken, who had a forty-plus-year association with the paper.

Facilities The Baltimore Sun, North Calvert Street Sun Park in Port Covington The first issue of The Sun, a four-page tabloid, was printed at 21 Light Street in downtown Baltimore in the mid-1830s. A five-story structure, at the corner of Baltimore and South streets, was built in 1851. The \\"Iron Building\\", as it was called, was destroyed in the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904. In 1906, operations were moved to Charles and Baltimore streets, where The Sun was written, published and distributed for nearly 50 years. In 1950, the operation was moved to a larger, modern plant at Calvert and Centre streets. In 1979, ground was broken for a new addition to the Calvert Street plant to house modern pressroom facilities. The new facility commenced operations in 1981. In April 1988, at a cost of $180 million, the company purchased of land at Port Covington and built \\"Sun Park\\". The new building houses a satellite printing and packaging facility, as well as the distribution operation. The Suns printing facility at Sun Park has highly sophisticated computerized presses and automated insertion equipment in the packaging area. To keep pace with the speed of the presses and Automated Guided Vehicles; \\"intelligent\\" electronic forklifts deliver the newsprint to the presses. In 1885, The Sun constructed a building for its Washington Bureau at 1317 F Street, NW.Washington Post, April 9, 1903 The building is on the National Register. Controversies * The paper became embroiled in a controversy involving the former governor of Maryland, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R). Ehrlich had issued an executive order on November 18, 2004, banning state executive branch employees from talking to Sun columnist Michael Olesker and reporter David Nitkin, claiming that their coverage had been unfair to the administration. This led The Sun to file a First Amendment lawsuit against the Ehrlich administration. The case was dismissed by a U.S. District Court judge, and The Sun appealed to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the dismissal.\\"Court Favors Ehrlich on Ban\\", The Baltimore Sun, February 16, 2006 * The same Olesker was forced to resign on January 4, 2006, after being accused of plagiarism. The Baltimore City Paper reported that several of his columns contained sentences or paragraphs that were extremely similar (although not identical) to material previously published in The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Sun. Several of his colleagues both in and out of the paper were highly critical of the forced resignation, taking the view that the use of previously published boilerplate material was common newsroom practice, and Olesker's alleged plagiarism was in line with that practice. * Between 2006 and 2007, Thomas Andrews Drake, a former National Security Agency executive, allegedly leaked classified information to Siobhan Gorman, then a national security reporter for The Sun. Drake was charged in April 2010 with 10 felony counts in relation to the leaks. In June 2011, all 10 original charges were dropped, in what was widely viewed as an acknowledgement that the government had no valid case against the whistleblower, who eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer. Drake was the 2011 recipient of the Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling. * Entering an ongoing controversy labeled as racist attacks by Donald Trump against congressional members who had criticized him that had begun to include numerous attacks against Baltimore Congressman Elijah Cummings and was naming him personally responsible for the presence of rodents in Baltimore neighborhoods, on July 27, 2019, The Baltimore Sun responded with an editorial entitled, \\"Better to have a few rats than to be one\\".Baltimore Sun Editorial Board, \\"Better to have a few rats than to be one\\", The Baltimore Sun, Saturday, July 27, 2017. Portrayal in The Wire The Baltimore Sun was featured in the American crime drama television series The Wire in 2008 (season 5), which was created by former Sun reporter David Simon. Like all of the institutions featured in The Wire, the Sun is portrayed as having many deeply dysfunctional qualities while also having very dedicated people on its staff. The season focuses on the role of the media in affecting political decisions in City Hall and the priorities of the Baltimore Police Department. Additionally, the show explores the business pressures of modern media through layoffs and buyouts occurring at the Sun, on the orders of the Tribune Company, the Suns corporate owner. One storyline involves a troubled Sun reporter named Scott Templeton, and his escalating tendency to sensationalize and falsify stories. The Wire portrays the managing editors of the Sun as turning a blind eye to the protests of a concerned line editor, in the managing editors' zeal to win a Pulitzer Prize. The show insinuates that the motivation for this institutional dysfunction is the business pressures of modern media, and working for a flagship newspaper in a major media market like The New York Times or The Washington Post is seen as the only way to avoid the cutbacks occurring at the Sun. Season 5 was The Wires last. The finale episode, \\"-30-\\", features a montage at the end portraying the ultimate fate of the major characters. It shows Templeton at Columbia University with the senior editors of the fictional Sun, accepting the Pulitzer Prize, with no mention being made as to the aftermath of Templeton's career. Alma Gutierrez is shown being exiled to the Carroll County bureau past the suburbs. News partnership In September 2008, The Baltimore Sun became the newspaper partner of station WJZ-TV, owned and operated by CBS; the partnership involves sharing content and story leads, and teaming up on stories. WJZ promotes Baltimore Sun stories in its news broadcasts. The Sun promotes WJZ's stories and weather team on its pages.

It was based on a suggestion by George FitzGerald that a charged parallel-plate capacitor moving through the aether should orient itself perpendicular to the motion. Like the earlier Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, Trouton and Noble obtained a null result: no motion relative to the aether could be detected.F. T. Trouton and H. R. Noble, \\"The mechanical forces acting on a charged electric condenser moving through space,\\" Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. A 202, 165-181 (1903).F. T. Trouton and H. R. Noble, \\"The Forces Acting on a Charged Condenser moving through Space. Proc. Royal Soc. 74 (479): 132-133 (1903). This null result was reproduced, with increasing sensitivity, by Rudolf Tomaschek (1925, 1926), Chase (1926, 1927) and Hayden in 1994. Such experimental results are now seen, consistent with special relativity, to reflect the validity of the principle of relativity and the absence of any absolute rest frame (or aether). The experiment is a test of special relativity. The Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment is also related to thought experiments such as the \\"Trouton‚ÄìNoble paradox,\\" and the \\"right-angle lever\\" or \\"Lewis‚ÄìTolman paradox\\". Several solutions have been proposed to solve this kind of paradox, all of them in agreement with special relativity. Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment In the experiment, a suspended parallel-plate capacitor is held by a fine torsion fiber and is charged. If the aether theory were correct, the change in Maxwell's equations due to the Earth's motion through the aether would lead to a torque causing the plates to align perpendicular to the motion. This is given by: :\\\\tau=-E'\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\\\sin2\\\\alpha' where \\\\tau is the torque, E the energy of the condenser, \\\\alpha the angle between the normal of the plate and the velocity. On the other hand, the assertion of special relativity that Maxwell's equations are invariant for all frames of reference moving at constant velocities would predict no torque (a null result). Thus, unless the aether were somehow fixed relative to the Earth, the experiment is a test of which of these two descriptions is more accurate. Its null result thus confirms Lorentz invariance of special relativity. However, while the negative experimental outcome can easily be explained in the rest frame of the device, the explanation from the viewpoint of a non-co-moving frame (concerning the question, whether the same torque should arise as in the \\"aether frame\\" described above, or whether no torque arises at all) is much more difficult and is called \\"Trouton‚ÄìNoble paradox,\\" which can be solved in several ways (see Solutions below). Right-angle lever paradox thumb The Trouton‚ÄìNoble paradox is essentially equivalent to a thought experiment called \\"right angle lever paradox\\", first discussed by Gilbert Newton Lewis and Richard Chase Tolman in 1909. Suppose a right-angle lever with endpoints abc. In its rest frame, the forces f_y towards ba and f_x towards bc must be equal to obtain equilibrium, thus no torque is given by the law of the lever: :\\\\tau'=L_{0}\\\\left(f'_{x}-f'_{y}\\\\right)=0 where \\\\tau is the torque, and L_0 the rest length of one lever arm. However, due to length contraction, ba is longer than bc in a non-co-moving system, thus the law of the lever gives: :\\\\tau=f_{x}\\\\cdot L_{0}-f_{y}\\\\cdot L_{0}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}=L_{0}\\\\left(f_{x}-f_{y}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\\\\right) It can be seen that the torque is not zero, which apparently would cause the lever to rotate in the non-co-moving frame. Since no rotation is observed, Lewis and Tolman thus concluded that no torque exists, therefore: :\\\\frac{f_{x}}{f_{y}}=\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} However, as shown by Max von Laue (1911), :*English Wikisource translation: An Example Concerning the Dynamics of the Theory of Relativity this is in contradiction with the relativistic expressions of force, :f_{x}=f'_{x},\\\\ f_{y}=f'_{y}\\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} which gives :\\\\frac{f_{x}}{f_{y}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} When applied to the law of the lever, the following torque is produced: :\\\\tau=-L_{0}\\\\cdot f'_{x}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} Which is principally the same problem as in the Trouton‚ÄìNoble paradox. Solutions The detailed relativistic analysis of both the Trouton‚ÄìNoble paradox and the right-angle lever paradox requires care to correctly reconcile, for example, the effects seen by observers in different frames of reference, but ultimately all such theoretical descriptions are shown to give the same result. In both cases an apparent net torque on an object (when viewed from a certain frame of reference) does not result in any rotation of the object, and in both cases this is explained by correctly accounting, in the relativistic way, for the transformation of all the relevant forces, momenta and the accelerations produced by them. The early history of descriptions of this experiment is reviewed by Janssen (1995).Janssen (1995), see \\"Further reading\\" =Laue current= The first solution of the Trouton‚ÄìNoble paradox was given by Hendrik Lorentz (1904). His result is based on the assumption that the torque and momentum due to electrostatic forces are compensated by the torque and momentum due to molecular forces. This was further elaborated by Max von Laue (1911), who gave the standard solution for these kind of paradoxes. It was based on the so- called \\"inertia of energy\\" in its general formulation by Max Planck. According to Laue, an energy current connected with a certain momentum (\\"Laue current\\") is produced in moving bodies by elastic stresses. The resulting mechanical torque in the case of the Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment amounts to: :\\\\tau=E'\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\\\sin2\\\\alpha' and in the right-angle lever: :\\\\tau=L_{0}\\\\cdot f'_{x}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} which exactly compensates the electromagnetic torque mentioned above, thus no rotation occurs on both cases. Or in other words: The electromagnetic torque is actually necessary for the uniform motion of a body, i.e., to hinder the body to rotate due to the mechanical torque caused by elastic stresses. :*English Wikisource translation: On the Dynamics of the Theory of Relativity :*English Wikisource translation: Remarks on the Law of the Lever in the Theory of Relativity :*English Wikisource translation: On the Theory of the Experiment of Trouton and Noble Since then, many papers appeared which elaborated on Laue's current, providing some modifications or re-interpretations, and included different variants of \\"hidden\\" momentum.See \\"further reading\\", especially Nickerson/McAdory (1975), Singal (1993), Teukolsky (1996), Jefimenko (1999), Jackson (2004). = Reformulations of force and momentum = Other authors were unsatisfied with the idea that torques and counter-torques arise only because different inertial frames are chosen. Their aim was to replace the standard expressions for momentum and force and thus equilibrium by manifestly Lorentz covariant ones from the outset. So when there is no torque in the rest frame of the considered object, then there are no torques in other frames as well.See \\"further reading\\", for instance Butler (1968), Aranoff (1969, 1972), Gr√∏n (1975), Janssen (1995, 2008), Iveziƒá (2006). This is in analogy to the 4/3 problem of the electromagnetic mass of electrons, where similar methods were employed by Enrico Fermi (1921) and Fritz Rohrlich (1960): In the standard formulation of relativistic dynamics the hyperplanes of simultaneity of any observer can be used, while in the Fermi/Rohrlich definition the hyperplane of simultaneity of the object's rest frame should be used.Janssen (2008), see further reading According to Janssen, deciding between Laue's standard model and such alternatives is merely a matter of convention. Following this line of reasoning, Rohrlich (1966) distinguished between \\"apparent\\" and \\"true\\" Lorentz transformations. For example, a \\"true\\" transformation of length would be the result of a direct application of the Lorentz transformation, which gives the non-simultaneous positions of the endpoints in another frame. On the other hand, length contraction would be an example of an apparent transformation, since the simultaneous positions of the endpoints in the moving frame must be calculated in addition to the initial Lorentz transformation. Furthermore, Cavalleri/Salgarelli (1969) distinguished between \\"synchronous\\" and \\"asynchronous\\" equilibrium conditions. In their view, synchronous consideration of forces should only be used for the object's rest frame, while in moving frames the same forces should be considered asynchronously.Rohrlich (1967), Cavalleri/Salgarelli (1969) =Force and acceleration= A solution without compensating forces or redefinitions of force and equilibrium was published by Richard C. Tolman and Paul Sophus Epstein :*English Wikisource translation: Concerning Relativistic Statics in 1911. A similar solution was re-discovered by Franklin (2006).Franklin (2006, 2008), see \\"Further reading\\". They alluded to the fact that force and acceleration do not always have the same direction, that is, the relation of mass, force and acceleration has tensor character in relativity. So the role played by the concept of force in relativity is very different from that of Newtonian mechanics. Epstein imagined a massless rod with endpoints OM, which is mounted at point O, and a particle with rest mass m is mounted at M. The rod encloses the angle \\\\tan\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\! with O. Now a force towards OM is applied at M, and equilibrium in its rest frame is achieved when \\\\tfrac{f'_{x}}{f'_{y}}=\\\\tan\\\\alpha'. As already shown above, these forces have the form in a non-co-moving frame: :f_{x}=f'_{x},\\\\ f_{y}=f'_{y}\\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}},\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\alpha=\\\\tan\\\\alpha'\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} Thus \\\\frac{f_{x}}{f_{y}}=\\\\frac{\\\\tan\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}. So the resultant force does not directly point from O to M. Does this lead to a rotation of the rod? No, because Epstein now considered the accelerations caused by the two forces. The relativistic expressions in the case, where a mass m is accelerated by these two forces in the longitudinal and transverse direction, are: :a_{x}=\\\\frac{f_{x}}{m\\\\gamma^{3}},\\\\ a_{y}=\\\\frac{f_{y}}{m\\\\gamma}, where \\\\gamma=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}. Thus \\\\frac{a_{x}}{a_{y}}=\\\\tan\\\\alpha. Thus no rotation occurs in this system as well. Similar considerations are also to be applied to the right-angle lever and Trouton‚ÄìNoble paradox. So the paradoxes are resolved, because the two accelerations (as vectors) point to the center of gravity of the system (condenser), although the two forces do not. Epstein added, that if one finds it more satisfying to re-establish the parallelism between force and acceleration with which we are accustomed in Newtonian mechanics, one has to include a compensating force, which formally corresponds to Laue's current. Epstein developed such a formalism in the subsequent sections of his 1911 paper.

Their music covers a range of styles from pop to progressive rock. Over the years they have had five albums in the UK Albums Chart and twelve singles in the UK Singles Chart. Career Steve Harley grew up in London's New Cross area and attended Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys' School. His musical career began in the late 1960s when he was busking (with John Crocker aka Jean-Paul Crocker) and performing his own songs, some of which were later recorded by him and the band. After an initial stint as a music journalist, the original Cockney Rebel was formed when Harley hooked up with his former folk music partner, Crocker (fiddle / mandolin / guitar) in 1972. Crocker had just finished a short stint with Trees and they advertised and auditioned drummer Stuart Elliott, bassist Paul Jeffreys, and guitarist Nick Jones. This line-up played one of the band's first gigs at the Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London on 23 July 1972, supporting The Jeff Beck Group. Nick was soon replaced by guitarist Pete Newnham but Steve felt that the Cockney Rebel sound did not need an electric guitar and they settled on the combination of Crocker's electric violin and the Fender Rhodes piano of keyboardist Milton Reame-James to share the lead. The band was signed to EMI after playing five gigs. Their first single, \\"Sebastian\\", was an immediate success in Europe, although it failed to score in the UK Singles Chart. Their debut album, The Human Menagerie, was released in 1973. Although the album was not a commercial success, the band attracted a growing following in London. Harley managed to irritate a significant segment of the music press with his self- aggrandisement, even as their music was getting rave reviews and gaining a wide audience. It was becoming clear that Harley regarded the band as little more than accompaniment to his own agenda, and already there were signs that things would not last, despite their having a big hit with their second single, \\"Judy Teen\\". In May 1974, the British music magazine, NME reported that Cockney Rebel were to undertake their first British tour, with the highlight of the itinerary being a gig at London's Victoria Palace Theatre on 23 June. There then followed the album The Psychomodo. A Live at the BBC album from 1995 included material recorded during a 1974 BBC Radio 1 broadcast. Following the European single \\"Psychomodo\\", a second single from the album, \\"Mr. Soft\\", was also a hit. \\"Tumbling Down\\" was also issued in America as a promotional single. By this time the problems within the band had already reached a head, and all the musicians, with the exception of Elliott, quit at the end of a successful UK tour, leaving the band to become session musicians. The original keyboardist, Milton Reame-James, recalled in 2010 that the original band 'said goodbye on the steps of Abbey Road studios and were never to meet up again.' Crocker continued to write songs and perform, forming a duet with his brother. After a brief period with Be-Bop Deluxe in 1974,Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website. pp. 78-9 Pomona Reame- James and Jeffreys formed the band Chartreuse in 1976. Harley's next appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops was supported by session musicians and Francis Monkman, and B. A. Robertson. The band's single \\"Big Big Deal\\" was issued in 1974 and was almost immediately withdrawn. From then on, the band was a band in name only, being more or less a Harley solo project. In 1974, a further album, The Best Years of Our Lives was released, produced by The Beatles' recording engineer, Alan Parsons. This included the track \\"Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)\\" which would go on to be a UK number one single in February 1975, and the band's biggest selling hit. It sold over one million copies globally. Amongst the backing vocalists on the act's only No. 1 was the future chart-topper, Tina Charles. Changing the band name from Cockney Rebel to Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel for the No. 1 hit, the degeneration was rapid. In a television interview recorded in 2002, Harley described how the lyrics are vindictively directed at the former band members who, he felt, had abandoned him ‚Äì a fact not obvious in the apparently happy chorus. , for whose band Jeffreys and had departed, confirms this story. One more single from the album, \\"Mr. Raffles (Man, It Was Mean)\\" made the Top 20, and the following album Timeless Flight was a top 20 success, although both singles \\"Black or White\\" and \\"White, White Dove\\" failed to chart. After 1975, Harley struggled to match the success of \\"Make Me Smile\\" and faded from fame, and Cockney Rebel eventually disbanded. The band had a surprise Top 10 in the summer of 1976 with a cover version of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". This was followed by the Top 50 single \\"(I Believe) Love's a Prima Donna\\" and the album Love's a Prima Donna. After the band's split, Harley provided vocals on The Alan Parsons Project song, \\"The Voice\\" on 1977's I Robot. Harley released two failed solo albums in the late 1970s; 1978's Hobo with a Grin which featured the two singles \\"Roll the Dice\\" and \\"Someone's Coming\\", and 1979's The Candidate. He made a minor comeback as a solo artist in the UK Singles Chart with \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" from the latter album. After a brief appearance in the 1980s with a song from Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, the 1982 single \\"I Can't Even Touch You\\" was released by Harley under the band name, whilst the 1983 minor hit single \\"Ballerina (Prima Donna)\\" was also credited to the band on the both sides of the vinyl release, although not on the sleeve, where Harley was solely credited. In 1986, Harley released two singles on RAK; \\"Irresistible\\" and \\"Heartbeat Like Thunder\\". Harley began touring again with his old Cockney Rebel songs in the late 1980s and 1990s. Cockney Rebel's original bassist, Paul Jeffreys, was one of those who died in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. He was with his bride on their honeymoon. In April 1990, Harley and several former members of Cockney Rebel Mark II reformed as Raffles United, and played four consecutive nights in a pub in Sudbury, London. In 2007 Harley revealed that these concerts were, in effect, used as Pop Idol style auditions for new band members, in particular a new bassist, lead guitarist and pianist (Stuart Elliott and Barry Wickens were already signed as drummer and violinist respectively, and as of 2020 they continue to perform these roles in the band), as well as backing singers/percussionists pending a tour in late 1990/early 1991, after the success of 1989's 'Come Back, All Is Forgiven' tour. Harley has released several solo albums since ‚Äì Yes You Can in 1992 (including the singles \\"Irresistible\\" and \\"Star for a Week (Dino)\\"), Poetic Justice in 1996, and most recently, The Quality of Mercy in 2005 (which included the singles \\"A Friend for Life\\" and \\"The Last Goodbye\\"), the first since the 1970s to be released with the Cockney Rebel name. He has dubbed his current touring band 'Cockney Rebel Mark III'. Two of the bigger hits appeared in UK television advertisements in the 1990s: \\"Make Me Smile\\" for Carlsberg Lager in 1995, prompting the track's return to the UK Top 40; and \\"Mr Soft\\" for Trebor Softmints between 1987 and 1994. \\"Make Me Smile\\" was used again in a 2005 advertisement for Marks & Spencer. It was also used on the soundtrack of the 1997 film, The Full Monty and the 1998 glam rock film Velvet Goldmine, in the latter's case being used in the end credits. From 1999 to 2008, Harley presented a show on BBC Radio 2 called Sounds of the 70s. In 2006, EMI released a CD box set compilation album spanning Harley's Cockney Rebel and solo work, titled The Cockney Rebel ‚Äì A Steve Harley Anthology. On 25 July 2007, they performed in Warsaw, Poland and on 28 July 2007 in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in both cases opening The Rolling Stones' concerts. In 2007, the song Make Me Smile was used by the Norwegian national lottery Norsk Tipping in a popular TV commercial in Norway. Original keyboardist, Reame- James, has since joined with James Staddon, Phil Beer and Robbie Johnson to create 'Banana Rebel', who have released a CD Top Banana, available from their website. In 2010, Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel began touring again setting concert dates for England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland. This was done following the release of the new studio album Stranger Comes to Town. In October 2012, the remastered four-disc box-set anthology compilation album Cavaliers: An Anthology 1973‚Äì1974 was released, chronicling the recording career of the original Cockney Rebel line-up. On 24 November 2012 the band including the Orchestra of the Swan and a choir performed the band's first two albums The Human Menagerie and The Psychomodo in their entirety for the first time. A live double-CD and DVD was released in October 2013 of this performance, titled Birmingham. In 2016, the newly reestablished Chrysalis Records, now owned by Blue Raincoat Music, announced that it had acquired the Cockney Rebel catalogue. Harley was one of the artists who appeared on the label's first release, a charity single of The Rolling Stones' \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" credited to Friends of Jo Cox in tribute to Jo Cox, a Labour Party MP who had been assassinated earlier that year. In 2018, \\"Make Me Smile\\" was used again in an advert for Viagra, the first one of its kind to air on UK television. Harley often jokes at his live concerts that his 1974 single, \\"Mr Soft\\", may have been more appropriate given the nature of the advert. Between 2010 and 2019, some concerts in smaller venues were played acoustically by Harley, Wickens and Lascelles. These concerts were originally marketed as \\"3 Man Acoustic Show\\" before being renamed to \\"Acoustic Trio\\". Beginning in 2020, Lascelles has been temporarily been replaced by David Delarre on lead guitar and Oli Hayhurst on double bass. This means that keyboard is no longer used in the acoustic shows, and instead they are titled as being from the \\"Steve Harley Acoustic Band\\". However, the 2020 Acoustic Band dates are, in effect, a promotional tour for Harley's 2020 album Uncovered and therefore, in 2021, it is possible that the original Harley/Wickens/Lascelles acoustic set will be revived.

The set used on this tour consisted of a selection of recordings from Harley and the band's career during the first half, and the 'Best Years Of Our Lives' album in its entirety during the second. The version of 'Make Me Smile' played as track six in the second set is significant because it was an acoustic solo by Harley. In other words, Harley played the song as it was originally intended to be released, before the CEO of EMI stepped in and asked him to change it to a pop song.

The princes also appointed two co-regents: Dorgon (1612‚Äì1650), the 14th son of the Qing dynasty's founder Nurhaci (1559‚Äì1626), and Jirgalang (1599‚Äì1655), one of Nurhaci's nephews, both of whom were members of the Qing imperial clan.

Under his leadership, the Qing Empire conquered most of the territory of the fallen Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), chased Ming loyalist regimes deep into the southwestern provinces, and established the basis of Qing rule over China despite highly unpopular policies such as the \\"hair cutting command\\" of 1645, which forced Qing subjects to shave their forehead and braid their remaining hair into a queue resembling that of the Manchus. After Dorgon's death on the last day of 1650, the young Shunzhi Emperor started to rule personally. He tried, with mixed success, to fight corruption and to reduce the political influence of the Manchu nobility. In the 1650s, he faced a resurgence of Ming loyalist resistance, but by 1661 his armies had defeated the Qing Empire's last enemies, seafarer Koxinga (1624‚Äì1662) and the Prince of Gui (1623‚Äì1662) of the Southern Ming dynasty, both of whom would succumb the following year. The Shunzhi Emperor died at the age of 22 of smallpox, a highly contagious disease that was endemic in China, but against which the Manchus had no immunity. He was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who had already survived smallpox, and who reigned for sixty years under the era name \\"Kangxi\\" (hence he was known as the Kangxi Emperor). Because fewer documents have survived from the Shunzhi era than from later eras of the Qing dynasty, the Shunzhi era is a relatively little-known period of Qing history. \\"Shunzhi\\" was the name of this ruler's reign period in Chinese. This title had equivalents in Manchu and Mongolian because the Qing imperial family was Manchu and ruled over many Mongol tribes that helped the Qing to conquer China. The emperor's personal name was Fulin, and the posthumous name by which he was worshipped at the Imperial Ancestral Temple was Shizu (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Shih-tsu; Chinese: ‰∏ñÁ•ñ). Historical background Jurchen man on a Ming woodblock print dated 1609. The original caption explained that the Jurchens lived near the Changbai Mountains and wore \\"deerskin shoes and fish-scale clothing.\\". In the 1580s, when China was ruled by the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), a number of Jurchen tribes lived northeast of Ming territory in the region that is now known as China's Northeast, or \\"Manchuria\\".. In a series of campaigns from the 1580s to the 1610s, Nurhaci (1559‚Äì1626), the leader of the Jianzhou Jurchens, unified most Jurchen tribes under his rule. (campaigns of Jurchen unification) and 40 (seizing of patents). One of his most important reforms was to integrate Jurchen clans under flags of four different colors‚Äîyellow, white, red, and blue‚Äîeach further subdivided into two to form an encompassing social and military system known as the Eight Banners.. Nurhaci gave control of these Banners to his sons and grandsons.. Around 1612, Nurhaci renamed his clan Aisin Gioro (\\"golden Gioro\\"), both to distinguish his family from other Gioro lines and to allude to an earlier dynasty that had been founded by Jurchens, the Jin (\\"golden\\") dynasty that had ruled northern China from 1115 to 1234.. In 1616 Nurhaci formally announced the foundation of the \\"Later Jin\\" dynasty, effectively declaring his independence from the Ming.. Over the next few years he wrested most major cities in Liaodong from Ming control.. His string of victories ended in February 1626 at the siege of Ningyuan, where Ming commander Yuan Chonghuan defeated him with the help of recently acquired Portuguese cannon.. Probably wounded during the battle, Nurhaci died a few months later.. Nurhaci's son and successor Hong Taiji (1592‚Äì1643) continued his father's state-building efforts: he concentrated power into his own hands, modeled the Later Jin's government institutions on Chinese ones, and integrated Mongol allies and surrendered Chinese troops into the Eight Banners.. In 1629 he led an incursion to the outskirts of Beijing, during which he captured Chinese craftsmen who knew how to cast Portuguese cannon.. In 1635 Hong Taiji renamed the Jurchens the \\"Manchus\\", and in 1636 changed the name of his polity from \\"Later Jin\\" to \\"Qing\\".. After capturing the last remaining Ming cities in Liaodong, by 1643 the Qing were preparing to attack the struggling Ming dynasty, which was crumbling under the combined weight of financial bankruptcy, devastating epidemics, and large-scale bandit uprisings fed by widespread starvation. (preparing to attack the Ming); (late Ming crises). Becoming emperor Hong Taiji, whose five-year-old son, Fulin, became the Shunzhi Emperor in 1643 When Hong Taiji died on 21 September 1643 without having named a successor, the fledgling Qing state faced a possibly serious crisis. (p. 38), (p. 297), and (p. 51) all place Hong Taiji's death on 21 September (Chongde Â¥áÂæ∑ 8.8.9). (p. 74) gives the date as 9 September. Several contenders‚Äînamely Nurhaci's second and eldest surviving son Dai≈°an, Nurhaci's fourteenth and fifteenth sons Dorgon and Dodo (both born to the same mother), and Hong Taiji's eldest son Hooge‚Äîstarted to vie for the throne.. With his brothers Dodo and Ajige, Dorgon (31 years old) controlled the Plain and Bordered White Banners, Dai≈°an (60) was in charge of the two Red Banners, whereas Hooge (34) had the loyalty of his father's two Yellow Banners. (about the White and Yellow banners); (table with age of the imperial princes and the banners they controlled). The decision about who would become the new Qing emperor fell to the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers, which was the Manchus' main policymaking body until the emergence of the Grand Council in the 1720s. (convening of the Deliberative Council to discuss Hong Taiji's succession); (Deliberative Council as \\"the most influential shaper of policy in the early Ch'ing\\" [i.e., Qing]; (the Grand Council rose \\"to the overlordship of almost the entire central government of the Chinese empire\\" in the 1720s and 1730s). Many Manchu princes argued that Dorgon, a proven military leader, should become the new emperor, but Dorgon refused and insisted that one of Hong Taiji's sons should succeed his father.. To recognize Dorgon's authority while keeping the throne in Hong Taiji's descent line, the members of the council named Hong Taiji's ninth son, Fulin, as the new emperor, but decided that Dorgon and Jirgalang (a nephew of Nurhaci who controlled the Bordered Blue Banner) would act as the five-year-old child's regents. Fulin was officially crowned emperor of the Qing dynasty on 8 October 1643; it was decided that he would reign under the era name \\"Shunzhi.\\". Because the Shunzhi reign is not well documented, it constitutes a relatively little-known period of Qing history.. Dorgon's regency (1643‚Äì1650) Prince Regent Dorgon in imperial regalia. He reigned as a quasi emperor from 1643 to his death in 1650, a period during which the Qing conquered almost all of China. =A quasi emperor= On 17 February 1644, Jirgalang, who was a capable military leader but looked uninterested in managing state affairs, willingly yielded control of all official matters to Dorgon.. After an alleged plot by Hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 May of that year, Hooge was stripped of his title of Imperial Prince and his co-conspirators were executed., note 231. Dorgon soon replaced Hooge's supporters (mostly from the Yellow Banners) with his own, thus gaining closer control of two more Banners.. By early June 1644, he was in firm control of the Qing government and its military.. In early 1644, just as Dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the Ming, peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching Beijing. On 24 April of that year, rebel leader Li Zicheng breached the walls of the Ming capital, pushing the Chongzhen Emperor to hang himself on a hill behind the Forbidden City.. Hearing the news, Dorgon's Chinese advisors Hong Chengchou and Fan Wencheng (ËåÉÊñáÁ®ã; 1597‚Äì1666) urged the Manchu prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen Ming and to claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing.; . The last obstacle between Dorgon and Beijing was Ming general Wu Sangui, who was garrisoned at Shanhai Pass at the eastern end of the Great Wall.. Himself caught between the Manchus and Li Zicheng's forces, Wu requested Dorgon's help in ousting the bandits and restoring the Ming.. When Dorgon asked Wu to work for the Qing instead, Wu had little choice but to accept.. Aided by Wu Sangui's elite soldiers, who fought the rebel army for hours before Dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry, the Qing won a decisive victory against Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass on 27 May.. Li's defeated troops looted Beijing for several days until Li left the capital on 4 June with all the wealth he could carry.; . =Settling in the capital= The circular mound of the Altar of Heaven, where the Shunzhi Emperor conducted sacrifices on 30 October 1644, ten days before being officially proclaimed Emperor of China. The ceremony marked the moment when the Qing dynasty seized the Mandate of Heaven. After six weeks of mistreatment at the hands of rebel troops, the Beijing population sent a party of elders and officials to greet their liberators on 5 June.. They were startled when, instead of meeting Wu Sangui and the Ming heir apparent, they saw Dorgon, a horseriding Manchu with his shaved forehead, present himself as the Prince Regent. (were all expecting Wu and the heir apparent) and 315 (reaction to seeing Dorgon instead). In the midst of this upheaval, Dorgon installed himself in the Wuying Palace (), the only building that remained more or less intact after Li Zicheng had set fire to the palace complex on 3 June.. Banner troops were ordered not to loot; their discipline made the transition to Qing rule \\"remarkably smooth.\\". Yet at the same time as he claimed to have come to avenge the Ming, Dorgon ordered that all claimants to the Ming throne (including descendants of the last Ming emperor) should be executed along with their supporters.. On 7 June, just two days after entering the city, Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepted to shave their forehead, wear a queue, and surrender, the officials would be allowed to stay at their post.; . He had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around Beijing, threatening Qing control over the capital region., pp. 420‚Äì22 (which explains these matters and claims that the order was repealed by edict on 25 June). gives the date as 28 June. Dorgon greeted the Shunzhi Emperor at the gates of Beijing on 19 October 1644.. On 30 October the six-year-old monarch performed sacrifices to Heaven and Earth at the Altar of Heaven.. The southern cadet branch of Confucius' descendants who held the title Wujing boshi ‰∫îÁ∂ìÂçöÂ£´ and the sixty- fifth generation descendant of Confucius to hold the title Duke Yansheng in the northern branch both had their titles reconfirmed on 31 October. A formal ritual of enthronement for Fulin was held on 8 November, during which the young emperor compared Dorgon's achievements to those of the Duke of Zhou, a revered regent from antiquity., pp. 858 and 860 (\\"According to the emperor's speechwriter, who was probably Fan Wencheng, Dorgon even 'surpassed' (guo) the revered Duke of Zhou because 'The Uncle Prince also led the Grand Army through Shanhai Pass to smash two hundred thousand bandit soldiers, and then proceeded to take Yanjing, pacifying the Central Xia. He invited Us to come to the capital and received Us as a great guest'.\\"). During the ceremony, Dorgon's official title was raised from \\"Prince Regent\\" to \\"Uncle Prince Regent\\" (Shufu shezheng wang ÂèîÁà∂ÊîùÊîøÁéã), in which the Manchu term for \\"Uncle\\" (ecike) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince., pp. 860‚Äì61, and p. 861, note 31. Three days later Dorgon's co-regent Jirgalang was demoted from \\"Prince Regent\\" to \\"Assistant Uncle Prince Regent\\" (Fu zheng shuwang ËºîÊîøÂèîÁéã).. In June 1645, Dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as \\"Imperial Uncle Prince Regent\\" (Huang shufu shezheng wang ÁöáÂèîÁà∂ÊîùÊîøÁéã), which left him one step short of claiming the throne for himself. imperial civil service examinations almost as soon as they seized Beijing in 1644. One of Dorgon's first orders in the new Qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of Beijing to give it to Bannermen, including Han Chinese Bannermen. The Yellow Banners were given the place of honor north of the palace, followed by the White Banners east, the Red Banners west, and the Blue Banners south.See maps in and , p. 103. This distribution accorded with the order established in the Manchu homeland before the conquest and under which \\"each of the banners was given a fixed geographical location according to the points of the compass.\\". Despite tax remissions and large-scale building programs designed to facilitate the transition, in 1648 many Chinese civilians still lived among the newly arrived Banner population and there was still animosity between the two groups. and . Agricultural land outside the capital was also marked off (quan Âúà) and given to Qing troops.. Former landowners now became tenants who had to pay rent to their absentee Bannermen landlords. This transition in land use caused \\"several decades of disruption and hardship.\\" In 1646, Dorgon also ordered that the civil examinations for selecting government officials be reestablished. From then on they were held regularly every three years as under the Ming. In the very first palace examination held under Qing rule in 1646, candidates, most of whom were northern Chinese, were asked how the Manchus and Han Chinese could be made to work together for a common purpose.. The 1649 examination inquired about \\"how Manchus and Han Chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division.\\"Cited in . Under the Shunzhi Emperor's reign, the average number of graduates per session of the metropolitan examination was the highest of the Qing dynasty (\\"to win more Chinese support\\"), until 1660 when lower quotas were established., Table 1.1 (number of graduates per session under each Qing reign); (reason for the high quotas); (lower quotas in 1660). To promote ethnic harmony, in 1648 an imperial decree formulated by Dorgon allowed Han Chinese civilians to marry women from the Manchu Banners, with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners, or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. Only later in the dynasty were these policies allowing intermarriage rescinded.Wang 2004, pp. 215‚Äì216 & 219‚Äì221. = Conquest of China = A late-Qing woodblock print representing the Yangzhou massacre of May 1645. Dorgon's brother Dodo ordered this massacre to scare other southern Chinese cities into submission. By the late nineteenth century the massacre was used by anti-Qing revolutionaries to arouse anti-Manchu sentiment among the Han Chinese population., passim. Under the reign of Dorgon‚Äîwhom historians have variously called \\"the mastermind of the Qing conquest\\" and \\"the principal architect of the great Manchu enterprise\\"‚Äîthe Qing subdued almost all of China and pushed loyalist \\"Southern Ming\\" resistance into the far southwestern reaches of China. After repressing anti-Qing revolts in Hebei and Shandong in the Summer and Fall of 1644, Dorgon sent armies to root out Li Zicheng from the important city of Xi'an (Shaanxi province), where Li had reestablished his headquarters after fleeing Beijing in early June 1644., pp. 483 (Li reestablished headquarters in Xi'an) and 501 (Hebei and Shandong revolts, new campaigns against Li). Under the pressure of Qing armies, Li was forced to leave Xi'an in February 1645, and he was killed‚Äîeither by his own hand or by a peasant group that had organized for self-defense in this time of rampant banditry‚Äîin September 1645 after fleeing though several provinces.. From newly captured Xi'an, in early April 1645 the Qing mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of Jiangnan south of the lower Yangtze River, where in June 1644 a Ming imperial prince had established a regime loyal to the Ming. Factional bickering and numerous defections prevented the Southern Ming from mounting an efficient resistance. Several Qing armies swept south, taking the key city of Xuzhou north of the Huai River in early May 1645 and soon converging on Yangzhou, the main city on the Southern Ming's northern line of defense. (taking of Xuzhou; (converging on Yangzhou). Bravely defended by Shi Kefa, who refused to surrender, Yangzhou fell to Manchu artillery on 20 May after a one-week siege.. Dorgon's brother Prince Dodo then ordered the slaughter of Yangzhou's entire population.. As intended, this massacre terrorized other Jiangnan cities into surrendering to the Qing. (purpose of the massacre was to terrorize Jiangnan); , passim (late-Qing uses of the Yangzhou massacre). Indeed, Nanjing surrendered without a fight on 16 June after its last defenders had made Dodo promise he would not hurt the population.. The Qing soon captured the Ming emperor (who died in Beijing the following year) and seized Jiangnan's main cities, including Suzhou and Hangzhou; by early July 1645, the frontier between the Qing and the Southern Ming had been pushed south to the Qiantang River. (capture of Suzhou and Hangzhou by early July 1645; new frontier); (capture of the emperor around 17 June, and later death in Beijing). A man in San Francisco's Chinatown around 1900. The Chinese habit of wearing a queue came from Dorgon's July 1645 edict ordering all men to shave their forehead and tie their hair into a queue similar to those of the Manchus. On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan had been superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict ordering all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid the rest of their hair into a queue identical to those of the Manchus.; ; (which calls this edict \\"the most untimely promulgation of [Dorgon's] career.\\" The punishment for non-compliance was death.. This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe. (\\"From the Manchus' perspective, the command to cut one's hair or lose one's head not only brought rulers and subjects together into a single physical resemblance; it also provided them with a perfect loyalty test\\"). For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one's body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility., pp. 648‚Äì49 (officials and literati) and 650 (common men). In the Classic of Filial Piety, Confucius is cited to say that \\"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged: this is the beginning of filial piety\\" (Ë∫´È´îÈ´ÆËÜöÔºåÂèó‰πãÁà∂ÊØçÔºå‰∏çÊï¢ÊØÄÂÇ∑ÔºåÂ≠ù‰πãÂßã‰πü). Prior to the Qing dynasty, adult Han Chinese men customarily did not cut their hair, but instead wore it in a topknot. Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest. (\\"broke the momentum of the Qing conquest\\"); (\\"the hair-cutting order, more than any other act, engendered the Kiangnan [Jiangnan] resistance of 1645\\"); (\\"the rulers' effort to make Manchus and Han one unified 'body' initially had the effect of unifying upper- and lower-class natives in central and south China against the interlopers\\"). The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (ÊùéÊàêÊù±; d. 1649), respectively on 24 August and 22 September.. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (ÂäâËâØ‰Ωê; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people.. These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze.. A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule. After the fall of Nanjing, two more members of the Ming imperial household created new Southern Ming regimes: one centered in coastal Fujian around the \\"Longwu Emperor\\" Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang‚Äîa ninth- generation descendant of Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang‚Äîand one in Zhejiang around \\"Regent\\" Zhu Yihai, Prince of Lu., pp. 665 (on the Prince of Tang) and 666 (on the Prince of Lu). But the two loyalist groups failed to cooperate, making their chances of success even lower than they already were., pp. 667‚Äì69 (for their failure to cooperate), 669-74 (for the deep financial and tactical problems that beset both regimes). In July 1646, a new Southern Campaign led by Prince Bolo sent Prince Lu's Zhejiang court into disarray and proceeded to attack the Longwu regime in Fujian.. Zhu Yujian was caught and summarily executed in Tingzhou (western Fujian) on 6 October.. His adoptive son Koxinga fled to the island of Taiwan with his fleet. Finally in November, the remaining centers of Ming resistance in Jiangxi province fell to the Qing. Johan Nieuhof's portrait of Shang Kexi, who recaptured Guangzhou from Ming loyalist forces in 1650. He was one of the Han Chinese generals the Qing relied on to conquer and administer southern China. Entrenched in the south, he eventually took part in the anti-Qing rebellion of the Three Feudatories in 1673. In late 1646 two more Southern Ming monarchs emerged in the southern province of Guangzhou, reigning under the era names of Shaowu () and Yongli.. Short of official costumes, the Shaowu court had to purchase robes from local theater troops. The two Ming regimes fought each other until 20 January 1647, when a small Qing force led by Li Chengdong captured Guangzhou, killed the Shaowu Emperor, and sent the Yongli court fleeing to Nanning in Guangxi.. In May 1648, however, Li mutinied against the Qing, and the concurrent rebellion of another former Ming general in Jiangxi helped Yongli to retake most of south China.. This resurgence of loyalist hopes was short-lived. New Qing armies managed to reconquer the central provinces of Huguang (present-day Hubei and Hunan), Jiangxi, and Guangdong in 1649 and 1650.. The Yongli emperor had to flee again. Finally on 24 November 1650, Qing forces led by Shang Kexi captured Guangzhou and massacred the city's population, killing as many as 70,000 people.. Meanwhile, in October 1646, Qing armies led by Hooge (the son of Hong Taiji who had lost the succession struggle of 1643) reached Sichuan, where their mission was to destroy the kingdom of bandit leader Zhang Xianzhong.. Zhang was killed in a battle against Qing forces near Xichong in central Sichuan on 1 February 1647., pp. 17‚Äì18. Also late in 1646 but further north, forces assembled by a Muslim leader known in Chinese sources as Milayin () revolted against Qing rule in Ganzhou (Gansu). He was soon joined by another Muslim named Ding Guodong ().. Proclaiming that they wanted to restore the Ming, they occupied a number of towns in Gansu, including the provincial capital Lanzhou. These rebels' willingness to collaborate with non-Muslim Chinese suggests that they were not only driven by religion. Both Milayin and Ding Guodong were captured and killed by Meng Qiaofang (Â≠üÂñ¨Ëä≥; 1595‚Äì1654) in 1648, and by 1650 the Muslim rebels had been crushed in campaigns that inflicted heavy casualties. (Meng Qiaofang, death of rebel leaders); . Transition and personal rule (1651‚Äì1661) =Purging Dorgon's clique= Portrait of the Shunzhi Emperor in adulthood Dorgon's unexpected death on 31 December 1650 during a hunting trip triggered a period of fierce factional struggles and opened the way for deep political reforms. (\\"intense factional rivalry,\\" \\"among the fiercest and most complex of the early Ch'ing\\"); , pp. 892‚Äì93 (date and cause of Dorgon's death) and 907 (second \\"great wave of Qing institutional reform\\" from 1652 to 1655). Because Dorgon's supporters were still influential at court, Dorgon was given an imperial funeral and was posthumously elevated to imperial status as the \\"Righteous Emperor\\" (yi huangdi Áæ©ÁöáÂ∏ù).. On the same day of mid-January 1651, however, several officers of the White Banners led by former Dorgon supporter Ubai arrested Dorgon's brother Ajige for fear he would proclaim himself as the new regent; Ubai and his officers then named themselves presidents of several Ministries and prepared to take charge of the government.. Meanwhile, Jirgalang, who had been stripped of his title of regent in 1647, gathered support among Banner officers who had been disgruntled during Dorgon's rule.. In order to consolidate support for the emperor in the two Yellow Banners (which had belonged to the Qing monarch since Hong Taiji) and to gain followers in Dorgon's Plain White Banner, Jirgalang named them the \\"Upper Three Banners\\" (shang san qi ‰∏ä‰∏âÊóó; Manchu: dergi ilan g≈´sa), which from then on were owned and controlled by the emperor. (Manchu name; \\"personal property of the emperor\\"); (timing and purpose of Jirgalang's move). Oboi and Suksaha, who would become regents for the Kangxi Emperor in 1661, were among the Banner officers who gave Jirgalang their support, and Jirgalang appointed them to the Council of Deliberative Princes to reward them. On 1 February, Jirgalang announced that the Shunzhi Emperor, who was about to turn thirteen, would now assume full imperial authority. The regency was thus officially abolished. Jirgalang then moved to the attack. In late February or early March 1651 he accused Dorgon of usurping imperial prerogatives: Dorgon was found guilty and all his posthumous honors were removed. Jirgalang continued to purge former members of Dorgon's clique and to bestow high ranks and nobility titles upon a growing number of followers in the Three Imperial Banners, so that by 1652 all of Dorgon's former supporters had been either killed or effectively removed from government.. =Factional politics and the fight against corruption= Court dress was a controversial topic during the Shunzhi era. High official Chen Mingxia was denounced in 1654 because he advocated returning to Ming-dynasty court dress, an example of which is shown in this 17th-century portrait of Ni Yuanlu. On 7 April 1651, barely two months after he seized the reins of government, the Shunzhi Emperor issued an edict announcing that he would purge corruption from officialdom.. This edict triggered factional conflicts among literati that would frustrate him until his death.. One of his first gestures was to dismiss grand academician Feng Quan (È¶ÆÈäì; 1595‚Äì1672), a northern Chinese who had been impeached in 1645 but was allowed to remain in his post by Prince Regent Dorgon. (dismissal of Feng Quan in 1651); (for the story of the failed purge of Feng Quan in 1645). The Shunzhi Emperor replaced Feng with Chen Mingxia (ca. 1601‚Äì1654), an influential southern Chinese with good connections in Jiangnan literary societies. (\\"coalition of literary societies\\"); . Though later in 1651 Chen was also dismissed on charges of influence peddling, he was reinstated in his post in 1653 and soon became a close personal advisor to the sovereign.. He was even allowed to draft imperial edicts just as Ming Grand Secretaries used to.. Still in 1653, the Shunzhi Emperor decided to recall the disgraced Feng Quan, but instead of balancing the influence of northern and southern Chinese officials at court as the emperor had intended, Feng Quan's return only intensified factional strife.. In several controversies at court in 1653 and 1654, the southerners formed one bloc opposed to the northerners and the Manchus. (discussion of these cases). In April 1654, when Chen Mingxia spoke to northern official Ning Wanwo (ÂØßÂÆåÊàë; d. 1665) about restoring the style of dress of the Ming court, Ning immediately denounced Chen to the emperor and accused him of various crimes including bribe-taking, nepotism, factionalism, and usurping imperial prerogatives., pp. 976 (April 1654, Ning Wanwo) and 977‚Äì81 (long discussion of Chen Mingxia's \\"crimes\\"). Chen was executed by strangulation on 27 April 1654.. In November 1657, a major cheating scandal erupted during the Shuntian provincial-level examinations in Beijing. gives the date as 30 November 1657. Eight candidates from Jiangnan who were also relatives of Beijing officials had bribed examiners in the hope of being ranked higher in the contest., note 38. Seven examination supervisors found guilty of receiving bribes were executed, and several hundred people were sentenced to punishments ranging from demotion to exile and confiscation of property.. The scandal, which soon spread to Nanjing examination circles, uncovered the corruption and influence-peddling that was rife in the bureaucracy, and that many moralistic officials from the north attributed to the existence of southern literary clubs and to the decline of classical scholarship.. =Chinese style of rule= During his short reign, the Shunzhi Emperor encouraged Han Chinese to participate in government activities and revived many Chinese-style institutions that had been either abolished or marginalized during Dorgon's regency. He discussed history, classics, and politics with grand academicians such as Chen Mingxia (see previous section) and surrounded himself with new men such as Wang Xi (ÁéãÁÜô; 1628‚Äì1703), a young northern Chinese who was fluent in Manchu., pp. 109 (topics of discussions with Chen Mingxia) and 112 (on Wang Xi). The \\"Six Edicts\\" (Liu yu ÂÖ≠Ë´≠) that the Shunzhi Emperor promulgated in 1652 were the predecessors to the Kangxi Emperor's \\"Sacred Edicts\\" (1670): \\"bare bones of Confucian orthodoxy\\" that instructed the population to behave in a filial and law-abiding fashion. (\\"bare bones\\"); . In another move toward Chinese-style government, the sovereign reestablished the Hanlin Academy and the Grand Secretariat in 1658. These two institutions based on Ming models further eroded the power of the Manchu elite and threatened to revive the extremes of literati politics that had plagued the late Ming, when factions coalesced around rival grand secretaries.. To counteract the power of the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 the Shunzhi Emperor established the Thirteen Offices (), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu bondservants. (\\"Thirteen Offices\\"); (\\"Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus,\\" supervised by Manchus). Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon's regency, but the young emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers such as his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang.; . By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: they handled key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts. (composed edicts); . Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming. (isolated emperor from his officials); . Despite the emperor's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, the Shunzhi Emperor's favorite eunuch Wu Liangfu (Âê≥ËâØËºî; d. 1661), who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658.; ; . The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power.. The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after the Shunzhi Emperor's death.; (specific date). =Frontiers, tributaries, and foreign relations= Mughal prince who ruled Turfan in Central Asia) as portrayed in 1656 by Dutch visitors to the Shunzhi Emperor's Beijing.In 1951 Italian scholar Luciano Petech was the first to hypothesize that these emissaries came from Turfan, not from the Moghul India (, cited in , plate 315). discusses this Turfan embassy in some detail. In 1646, when Qing armies led by Bolo had entered the city of Fuzhou, they had found envoys from the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom, Annam, and the Spanish in Manila.. These tributary embassies that had come to see the now fallen Longwu Emperor of the Southern Ming were forwarded to Beijing, and eventually sent home with instructions about submitting to the Qing. The King of the Ry≈´ky≈´ Islands sent his first tribute mission to the Qing in 1649, Siam in 1652, and Annam in 1661, after the last remnants of Ming resistance had been removed from Yunnan, which bordered Annam. Also in 1646 sultan Abu al- Muhammad Haiji Khan, a Moghul prince who ruled Turfan, had sent an embassy requesting the resumption of trade with China, which had been interrupted by the fall of the Ming dynasty.. The mission was sent without solicitation, but the Qing agreed to receive it, allowing it to conduct tribute trade in Beijing and Lanzhou (Gansu). (\\"without solicitation\\"; location of trade); (within the constraints of the old tributary system). But this agreement was interrupted by a Muslim rebellion that engulfed the northwest in 1646 (see the last paragraph of the \\"Conquest of China\\" section above). Tribute and trade with Hami and Turfan, which had aided the rebels, were eventually resumed in 1656.. In 1655, however, the Qing court announced that tributary missions from Turfan would be accepted only once every five years.. The bell-shaped White Dagoba, which can still be seen in Beihai Park in Beijing, was commissioned by the Shunzhi Emperor to honor Tibetan Buddhism. In 1651 the young emperor invited to Beijing the Fifth Dalai Lama, the leader of the Yellow Hat Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, who, with the military help of Khoshot Mongol Gushri Khan, had recently unified religious and secular rule in Tibet. (unification or religious and secular rule). Qing emperors had been patrons of Tibetan Buddhism since at least 1621 under the reign of Nurhaci, but there were also political reasons behind the invitation. (beginning of Qing patronage of Tibetan Buddhism). Namely, Tibet was becoming a powerful polity west of the Qing, and the Dalai Lama held influence over Mongol tribes, many of which had not submitted to the Qing., note 5 (political reasons for inviting the Dalai Lama). To prepare for the arrival of this \\"living Buddha,\\" the Shunzhi Emperor ordered the building of the White Dagoba (baita ÁôΩÂ°î) on an island on one of the imperial lakes northwest of the Forbidden City, at the former site of Qubilai Khan's palace., note 81 (site of Qionghua Island and Qubilai's former palace); (preparation for Lama's visit, \\"bell-shaped\\" temple). After more invitations and diplomatic exchanges to decide where the Tibetan leader would meet the Qing emperor, the Dalai Lama arrived in Beijing in January 1653. The Dalai Lama later had a scene of this visit carved in the Potala Palace in Lhasa, which he had started building in 1645.; (date of the beginning of the construction of the Potala). Meanwhile, north of the Manchu homeland, adventurers Vassili Poyarkov (1643‚Äì1646) and Yerofei Khabarov (1649‚Äì1653) had started to explore the Amur River valley for Tzarist Russia. In 1653 Khabarov was recalled to Moscow and replaced by Onufriy Stepanov, who assumed command of Khabarov's Cossack troops.. Stepanov went south into the Sungari River, along which he exacted \\"yasak\\" (fur tribute) from native populations such as the Daur and the Duchers, but these groups resisted because they were already paying tribute to the Shunzhi Emperor (\\"Shamshakan\\" in Russian sources).. In 1654 Stepanov defeated a small Manchu force that had been despatched from Ningguta to investigate Russian advances. In 1655 another Qing commander, the Mongol Minggadari (d. 1669), defeated Stepanov's forces at fort Kumarsk on the Amur, but this was not enough to chase the Russians. (Mongol); (victory, but \\"yielded no permanent success\\"). In 1658, however, Manchu general ≈†arh≈´da (1599‚Äì1659) attacked Stepanov with a fleet of 40 or more ships that managed to kill or capture most Russians. This Qing victory temporarily cleared the Amur valley of Cossack bands, but Sino-Russian border conflicts would continue until 1689, when the signature of the Treaty of Nerchinsk fixed the borders between Russia and the Qing. =Continuous campaigns against the Southern Ming= The flight of the Yongli Emperor‚Äîthe last sovereign of the Southern Ming dynasty‚Äîfrom 1647 to 1661. The provincial and national boundaries are those of the People's Republic of China. Though the Qing under Dorgon's leadership had successfully pushed the Southern Ming deep into southern China, Ming loyalism was not dead yet. In early August 1652, Li Dingguo, who had served as general in Sichuan under bandit king Zhang Xianzhong (d. 1647) and was now protecting the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming, retook Guilin (Guangxi province) from the Qing.. Within a month, most of the commanders who had been supporting the Qing in Guangxi reverted to the Ming side., note 194. Despite occasionally successful military campaigns in Huguang and Guangdong in the next two years, Li failed to retake important cities. In 1653, the Qing court put Hong Chengchou in charge of retaking the southwest.. Headquartered in Changsha (in what is now Hunan province), he patiently built up his forces; only in late 1658 did well-fed and well-supplied Qing troops mount a multipronged campaign to take Guizhou and Yunnan. In late January 1659, a Qing army led by Manchu prince Doni took the capital of Yunnan, sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing into nearby Burma, which was then ruled by King Pindale Min of the Toungoo dynasty. The last sovereign of the Southern Ming stayed there until 1662, when he was captured and executed by Wu Sangui, the former Ming general whose surrender to the Manchus in April 1644 had allowed Dorgon to start the Qing conquest of China.. Zheng Chenggong (\\"Koxinga\\"), who had been adopted by the Longwu Emperor in 1646 and ennobled by Yongli in 1655, also continued to defend the cause of the Southern Ming.. In 1659, just as the Shunzhi Emperor was preparing to hold a special examination to celebrate the glories of his reign and the success of the southwestern campaigns, Zheng sailed up the Yangtze River with a well-armed fleet, took several cities from Qing hands, and went so far as to threaten Nanjing. When the emperor heard of this sudden attack he is said to have slashed his throne with a sword in anger. But the siege of Nanjing was relieved and Zheng Chenggong repelled, forcing Zheng to take refuge in the southeastern coastal province of Fujian.. Pressured by Qing fleets, Zheng fled to Taiwan in April 1661 but died that same summer.. His descendants resisted Qing rule until 1683, when the Kangxi Emperor successfully took the island.. =Personality and relationships= Johann Adam Schall von Bell, a Jesuit missionary the Shunzhi Emperor affectionately called mafa (\\"grand'pa\\" in Manchu). After Fulin came to rule on his own in 1651, his mother the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang arranged for him to marry her niece, but the young monarch deposed his new Empress in 1653.. The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her Khorchin Mongol clan, this time matching her son with her own grand-niece. Though Fulin also disliked his second empress (known posthumously as Empress Xiaohuizhang), he was not allowed to demote her. She never bore him children.. Starting in 1656, the Shunzhi Emperor lavished his affection on Consort Donggo, who, according to Jesuit accounts from the time, had first been the wife of another Manchu noble.. She gave birth to a son (the Shunzhi Emperor's fourth) in November 1657. The emperor would have made him his heir apparent, but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name.. The Shunzhi Emperor was an open- minded emperor and relied on the advice of Johann Adam Schall von Bell, a Jesuit missionary from Cologne in the Germanic parts of the Holy Roman Empire, for guidance on matters ranging from astronomy and technology to religion and government.. In late 1644, Dorgon had put Schall in charge of preparing a new calendar because his eclipse predictions had proven more reliable than those of the official astronomer.; , note 24. After Dorgon's death Schall developed a personal relationship with the young emperor, who called him \\"grandfather\\" (mafa in Manchu).; , note 82. At the height of his influence in 1656 and 1657, Schall reports that the Shunzhi Emperor often visited his house and talked to him late into the night. He was excused from prostrating himself in the presence of the emperor, was granted land to build a church in Beijing, and was even given imperial permission to adopt a son (because Fulin worried that Schall did not have an heir), but the Jesuits' hope of converting the Qing sovereign to Christianity was crushed when the Shunzhi Emperor became a devout follower of Chan Buddhism in 1657. (list of privileges); (date of conversion to Buddhism). The emperor developed a good command of Chinese that allowed him to manage matters of state and to appreciate Chinese arts such as calligraphy and drama.. One of his favorite texts was \\"Rhapsody of a Myriad Sorrows\\" (Wan chou qu Ëê¨ÊÑÅÊõ≤), by Gui Zhuang (Ê≠∏Ëéä; 1613‚Äì1673), who was a close friend of anti- Qing intellectuals Gu Yanwu and Wan Shouqi (Ëê¨Â£ΩÁ•∫; 1603‚Äì1652)., note 2. \\"Quite passionate and attach[ing] great importance to qing (love),\\" he could also recite by heart long passages of the popular Romance of the Western Chamber.  Death and succession  Electron micrograph of the smallpox virus, against which the Manchus had no immunity. The Shunzhi Emperor died of it, and his young successor, Xuanye, was chosen because he had already survived it. = Smallpox = In September 1660, Consort Donggo, the Shunzhi Emperor's favourite consort, suddenly died as a result of grief over the loss of a child.. Overwhelmed with grief, the emperor fell into dejection for months, until he contracted smallpox on 2 February 1661. On 4 February 1661, officials Wang Xi (ÁéãÁÜô, 1628‚Äì1703; the emperor's confidant) and Margi (a Manchu) were called to the emperor's bedside to record his last will.. On the same day, his seven-year-old third son Xuanye was chosen to be his successor, probably because he had already survived smallpox.. Note that Xuanye was born in May 1654, and was therefore less than seven years old. Both and (p. 1) nonetheless claim that he was \\"seven years old.\\" (p. 119) and (p. 99) indicate that he was \\"not yet seven years old.\\" In Chinese documents concerning the succession, Xuanye was said to be eight sui (). The emperor died on 5 February 1661 in the Forbidden City at the age of twenty-two. The Manchus feared smallpox more than any other disease because they had no immunity to it and almost always died when they contracted it. (\\"Seventy to 80 percent of those infected died\\"); (most feared disease among the Manchus). By 1622 at the latest, they had already established an agency to investigate smallpox cases and isolate sufferers to avoid contagion.. During outbreaks, royal family members were routinely sent to \\"smallpox avoidance centers\\" (bidousuo ÈÅøÁóòÊâÄ) to protect themselves from infection.. The Shunzhi Emperor was particularly fearful of the disease, because he was young and lived in a large city, near sources of contagion. Indeed, during his reign at least nine outbreaks of smallpox were recorded in Beijing, each time forcing the emperor to move to a protected area such as the \\"Southern Park\\" (Nanyuan ÂçóËãë), a hunting ground south of Beijing where Dorgon had built a \\"smallpox avoidance center\\" in the 1640s. (Southern Park used as hunting ground); , pp. 181 (number of outbreaks) and 192 (Dorgon building a bidousuo in the Southern Park). Despite this and other precautions‚Äîsuch as rules forcing Chinese residents to move out of the city when they contracted smallpox‚Äîthe young monarch still succumbed to that illness. (on rule forcing Chinese residents to move out). = Forged last will = An official court portrait of Oboi, who on 5 February 1661 was named as the main regent to the newly enthroned Kangxi Emperor, who was only seven years old. The emperor's last will, which was made public on the evening of 5 February, appointed four regents for his young son: Oboi, Soni, Suksaha, and Ebilun, who had all helped Jirgalang to purge the court of Dorgon's supporters after Dorgon's death on the last day of 1650., pp. 48 (on the four men helping Jirgalang), 50 (date of promulgation of the edict of succession), and 62 (on appointment of the four regents); (on helping to get rid of Dorgon's faction in the early 1650s). It is difficult to determine whether the Shunzhi Emperor had really named these four Manchu nobles as regents, because they and Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang clearly tampered with the emperor's testament before promulgating it. The emperor's will expressed his regret about his Chinese- style ruling (his reliance on eunuchs and his favoritism toward Chinese officials), his neglect of Manchu nobles and traditions, and his headstrong devotion to his consort rather than to his mother.. Though the emperor had often issued self-deprecating edicts during his reign, the policies his will rejected had been central to his government since he had assumed personal rule in the early 1650s. (on proclamations in which the emperor \\"publicly degraded himself\\") and 52 (on the centrality of these policies to the Shunzhi Emperor's rule). The will as it was formulated gave \\"the mantle of imperial authority\\" to the four regents, and served to support their pro-Manchu policies during the period known as the Oboi regency, which lasted from 1661 to 1669.. = After death = Because court statements did not clearly announce the cause of the emperor's death, rumors soon started to circulate that he had not died but in fact retired to a Buddhist monastery to live anonymously as a monk, either out of grief for the death of his beloved consort, or because of a coup by the Manchu nobles his will had named as regents.. These rumors seemed not so incredible because the emperor had become a fervent follower of Chan Buddhism in the late 1650s, even letting monks move into the imperial palace. (emperor became a devout Buddhist in 1657); (emperor had become devoted to Buddhism \\"by 1659\\"; monks living in the palace). Modern Chinese historians have considered the Shunzhi Emperor's possible retirement as one of the three mysterious cases of the early Qing. But much circumstantial evidence‚Äîincluding an account by one of these monks that the emperor's health greatly deteriorated in early February 1661 because of smallpox, and the fact that a concubine and an Imperial Bodyguard committed suicide to accompany the emperor in burial‚Äîsuggests that the Shunzhi Emperor's death was not staged. (for monk's diary, citing an older study by Chinese historian Meng Sen Â≠üÊ£Æ); (on the two suicides). After being kept in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor's corpse was transported in a lavish procession to Jingshan ÊôØÂ±± (a hillock just north of the Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings.. Only two years later, in 1653, was the body transported to its final resting place.. Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually dictated that a deceased person should be cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried., note 122 (citing several studies and primary documents). By contrast, Hong Taiji and the Shunzhi Emperor's two empresses had been cremated (). He was interred in what later came to be known as the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries.. His tomb is part of the Xiao () mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Hiyoo≈°ungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.  Legacy  The Kangxi Emperor's three \\"southern tours\\" in the Jiangnan region‚Äî1684, 1689 (here depicted), and 1699‚Äîasserted the prestige and confidence of the newly solidified Qing dynasty a few years after it defeated the Three Feudatories.. The fake will in which the Shunzhi Emperor had supposedly expressed regret for abandoning Manchu traditions gave authority to the nativist policies of the Kangxi Emperor's four regents.; . Citing the testament, Oboi and the other regents quickly abolished the Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus.. Over the next few years, they enhanced the power of the Imperial Household Department, which was run by Manchus and their bondservants, eliminated the Hanlin Academy, and limited membership in the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers to Manchus and Mongols. (details of membership in the Deliberative Council); (other institutions). The regents also adopted aggressive policies toward the Qing's Chinese subjects: they executed dozens of people and punished thousands of others in the wealthy Jiangnan region for literary dissent and tax arrears, and forced the coastal population of southeast China to move inland in order to starve the Taiwan-based Kingdom of Tungning run by descendants of Koxinga. (Ming history case), 33‚Äì36 (tax arrears case), and 39‚Äì46 (clearing of the coast). After the Kangxi Emperor managed to imprison Oboi in 1669, he reverted many of the regents' policies.. He restored institutions his father had favored, including the Grand Secretariat, through which Chinese officials gained an important voice in government. (restored in 1670). He also defeated the rebellion of the Three Feudatories, three Chinese military commanders who had played key military roles in the Qing conquest, but had now become entrenched rulers of enormous domains in southern China.. The civil war (1673‚Äì1681) tested the loyalty of the new Qing subjects, but Qing armies eventually prevailed. (details of the campaigns). Once victory had become certain, a special examination for \\"eminent scholars of broad learning\\" (Boxue hongru ÂçöÂ≠∏È¥ªÂÑí) was held in 1679 to attract Chinese literati who had refused to serve the new dynasty.. The successful candidates were assigned to compile the official history of the fallen Ming dynasty. The rebellion was defeated in 1681, the same year the Kangxi Emperor initiated the use of variolation to inoculate children of the imperial family against smallpox. (use of variolation starting in 1681). When the Kingdom of Tungning finally fell in 1683, the military consolidation of the Qing regime was complete. The institutional foundation laid by Dorgon, and the Shunzhi and Kangxi emperors allowed the Qing to erect an imperial edifice of awesome proportion and to turn it into \\"one of the most successful imperial states the world has known.\\" (citation); (institutional foundation, awesome proportion). Ironically, however, the prolonged Pax Manchurica that followed the Kangxi consolidation made the Qing fatefully unprepared to face aggressive and well-armed European powers in the nineteenth century.. Family Although only nineteen empresses and consorts are recorded for the Shunzhi Emperor in the Aisin Gioro genealogy made by the Imperial Clan Court, burial records show that he had at least thirty-two of them.See table in . Twelve bore him children. There were two empresses in his reign, both relatives of his mother the empress dowager. After the 1644 conquest, imperial consorts and empresses were usually known by their titles and by the name of their patrilineal clan.. Eleven of the Shunzhi Emperor's 32 spouses bore him a total of fourteen children,See table in . but only four sons (Fuquan, Xuanye, Changning, and Longxi) and one daughter (Princess Gongque) lived to be old enough to marry. Unlike later Qing emperors, the names of the Shunzhi Emperor's sons did not include a generational character.See table in . The Shunzhi Emperor's third son, Xuanye, after he had become the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661‚Äì1722). Before the Qing court moved to Beijing in 1644, Manchu women used to have personal names, but after 1644 these names \\"disappear from the genealogical and archival records.\\" Only after their betrothal were imperial daughters given a title and rank, by which they then became known. Although five of the Shunzhi Emperor's six daughters died in infancy or childhood, they all appear in the Aisin Gioro genealogy. \\\\---- Consorts and Issue: * Consort Jing, of the Khorchin Borjigit clan (), first cousin, personal name Erdeni Bumba () * Empress Xiaohuizhang, of the Khorchin Borjigit clan (; 5 November 1641 ‚Äì 7 January 1718), first cousin once removed, personal name Alatan Qiqige () * Empress Xiaoxian, of the Donggo clan (; 1639 ‚Äì 23 September 1660) ** Prince Rong of the First Rank (; 12 November 1657 ‚Äì 25 February 1658), fourth son * Empress Xiaokangzhang, of the Tunggiya clan (; 1638 ‚Äì 20 March 1663) ** Xuanye, the Kangxi Emperor (; 4 May 1654 ‚Äì 20 December 1722), third son * Consort Dao, of the Khorchin Borjigit clan (; d. 7 April 1658), first cousin * Consort Zhen, of the Donggo clan (; d. 5 February 1661) * Consort Ke, of the Shi clan (; d. 13 January 1668) * Consort Gongjing, of the Hotsit Borjigit clan (; d. 20 May 1689) * Consort Shuhui, of the Khorchin Borjigit clan (; 1642 ‚Äì 17 December 1713), first cousin once removed * Consort Duanshun, of the Abaga Borjigit clan (; d. 1 August 1709) * Consort Ningque, of the Donggo clan (; d. 11 August 1694) ** Fuquan, Prince Yuxian of the First Rank (; 8 September 1653 ‚Äì 10 August 1703), second son * Mistress, of the Ba clan () ** Niuniu (; 13 December 1651 ‚Äì 9 March 1652), first son ** Third daughter (30 January 1654 ‚Äì April/May 1658) ** Fifth daughter (6 February 1655 ‚Äì January 1661) * Mistress, of the Chen clan (; d. 1690) ** First daughter (22 April 1652 ‚Äì November/December 1653) ** Changning, Prince Gong of the First Rank (; 8 December 1657 ‚Äì 20 July 1703), fifth son * Mistress, of the Yang clan () ** Princess Gongque of the Second Rank (; 19 January 1654 ‚Äì 26 November 1685), second daughter *** Married Na'erdu (; d. 1676) of the Manchu G≈´walgiya clan in February/March 1667 ** Fourth daughter (9 January 1655 ‚Äì March/April 1661) * Mistress, of the Nara clan () ** Sixth daughter (11 November 1657 ‚Äì March 1661) * Mistress, of the Tang clan () ** Qishou (; 3 January 1660 ‚Äì 12 December 1665), sixth son * Mistress, of the Niu clan () ** Longxi, Prince Chunjing of the First Rank (; 30 May 1660 ‚Äì 20 August 1679), seventh son * Mistress, of the Muktu clan () ** Yonggan (; 23 January 1661 ‚Äì 15 January 1668), eighth son Ancestry  Popular culture  * Portrayed by Jung Yun- seok in the 2013 JTBC TV series Blooded Palace: The War of Flowers.
