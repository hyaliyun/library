This area of the anatomy is of particular significance for the horse. Specifically, the \\"poll\\" refers to the occipital protrusion at the back of the skull. However, in common usage, many horsemen refer to the poll joint, between the atlas (C1) and skull as the poll. The area at the joint has a slight depression, and is a sensitive location. Thus, because the crownpiece of a bridle passes over the poll joint, a rider can indirectly exert pressure on the horse's poll by means of the reins, bit, and bridle. Importance of the poll in riding The poll is especially important in riding, as correct flexion at the poll joint is a sign that the horse is properly on the bit. Over-flexion, with the poll lowered and the neck bent at a cervical vertebra farther down the neck, is usually a sign that the horse is either evading contact or that the rider is trying to pull the horse onto the bit, rather than correctly ride from behind. In classical dressage, the poll should always be the highest point on the horse when the horse is on the bit. The horse is always relaxed over the poll, giving it a relaxed look when going about its job. When, for example, the third vertebra (C3) is the highest point on the neck, rather than the poll, it is a clear sign of incorrect work.

Its common name is derived from the male frog's mating call, which sounds similar to a motorbike changing up through gears; it is also known as Moore's frog, the western bell frog, western green and golden bell frog, and western green tree frog.  Description  Juvenile motorbike frog R. moorei is able to camouflage itself well, and ranges in colour from dark brown, through green, to gold. The underside is noticeably lighter, and usually ranges from very pale green to light brown. The light green of the groin and thigh distinguishes this species from its cogenor, Ranoidea cyclorhynchus, which is darker and spotted with yellow there. Typical of tree frogs, its toe pads enable it to climb smooth vertical surfaces. Its hind legs are powerful, and the toes are webbed. In mating season, the males develop black nuptial pads that enable them to cling to the females' backs during amplexus. R. moorei can be up to 7.5 cm in length. The tadpole's body is a uniform dark brown above with a silvery sheen below; initially minute in size, they grow to a very large 80 mm in length. The tadpoles usually hide amongst vegetation, but are easily encouraged out of hiding when food is presented. For most of their time as tadpoles, they crowd together in schools.  Ecology and behaviour  Swanbourne Breeding season is from early spring through to late summer. The male's mating call sounds like a motorbike changing gears. The males usually find a suitable clump of reeds or other water plants from which to call. When a female joins the male in the water, the male grips onto the female's back, using his nuptial pads, that appear during breeding season. Large clumps of eggs, encased in a transparent jelly, are attached to floating vegetation and debris. Despite being a tree frog, R. moorei seldom climbs higher than 1‚Äì2 m, on plants, shrubs, brick walls, or windows. Their diets consist mainly of arthropods, but also include smaller frogs, including juveniles of the same species. The tadpole's main diet is algae, but they also eat animal matter when available. Tadpoles, like adult frogs, sunbathe for one or two hours each day for healthy growth. A wide and populous distribution through lakes and swamps has readily incorporated garden ponds and farm dams, where they are often found sunbathing on the upper leaves of plants. They can live without water for extended periods of time. R. moorei is a member of the Ranoidea aurea complex. Unlike the eastern members of the complex (Ranoidea aurea, R. raniformis and \\"Litoria\\" castanea), the motorbike frog has not suffered from dramatic declines, despite chytrid fungus being present in areas which they inhabit.  Distribution  Bayswater Three-week-old Litoria moorei tadpoles, backyard pond, Bayswater South-west corner of Western Australia, from as far north as the Geraldton Sandplains, to the Esperance Plains on the south coast of WA. A population exists on Rottnest Island. The species is one of the most well known frogs found in urban Perth areas. The estimated altitudinal range of the species is from 0‚Äì600 m asl.

The first fossils of Shansisuchus were discovered from the Ermaying Formation of Shansi Province in 1964 by Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian. Like other erythrosuchids, Shansisuchus was a large-bodied carnivore with a large, deep skull. Shansisuchus is unique among early archosauriforms in having a hole in its skull called a subnarial fenestra. Description Restoration Shansisuchus is a large erythrosuchid distinguished from other members of the group by two characters: a tongue-and-groove articulation between the premaxilla and nasal bones of the skull and the presence of a subnarial fenestra. In Shansisuchus the premaxilla, a bone that makes up the front of the snout, projects backward and fits into a groove in the nasal, a bone that makes up the top of the snout. The subnarial fenestra is present between the external nares (nasal opening) and the antorbital fenestra, a hole in front of the eye socket. It is separated from the antorbital fenestra by a vertical projection of the maxilla bone. A subnarial fenestra is present in a few other more derived archosauriforms such as some dinosaurs and pseudosuchians, but its morphology in Shansisuchus is unique. History of research Shansisuchus is known from many fossil skeletons representing more than a dozen individuals, making it one of the best known erythrosuchids. However, all but one specimen discovered in 2010 (a complete skull and 14 vertebrae from Jixian County) are disarticulated, meaning that many aspects of its anatomy had been poorly understood before that specimen was described. Most specimens have been found in a fossil locality in Wuxiang County, and others have been found in localities in Ningwu, Yushe, Jingle, and Xing counties. Three species of Shansisuchus have been named: the type species Shansisuchus shansisuchus, which is known from over ten individuals; S. heiyuekouensis, which is known from five individuals; and S. kuyeheensis, which is known from one individual. Relationships Skull, Paleozoological Museum of China Shansisuchus belongs to a group of reptiles called Archosauriformes, which is today represented by crocodilians and birds but also includes a diversity of extinct forms extending back to the Late Permian. It is a basal archosauriform that lies outside Archosauria, the crown group originating with the last common ancestor of birds and crocodilians. When Shansisuchus was first described, Yang placed it in its own family, Shansisuchidae. In 1992 Shansisuchus was reassigned to the family Erythrosuchidae and proposed to be the closest relative of the genus Vjushkovia (now considered a synonym ofGarjainia). A phylogenetic analysis published in 2013 found that Vjushkovia was more closely related to Erythrosuchus, and that Shansisuchus lied outside the Vjushkovia+Erythrosuchus clade as a more basal erythrosuchid.

CGRP I or Œ±-CGRP is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide and is formed from the alternative splicing of the calcitonin/CGRP gene located on chromosome 11. CGRP II or Œ≤-CGRP is less studied. In humans, Œ≤-CGRP differs from the Œ±-CGRP by three amino acids and is encoded in a separate gene within the same vicinity. The CGRP family includes calcitonin (CT), adrenomedullin (AM), and amylin (AMY). This article outlines the basic function of CGRP as well as sources of production and synthesis. It further introduces receptors and regulation of CGRP, with a focus on human and mammalian systems.  Function  CGRP is produced in both peripheral and central neurons. It is a potent peptide vasodilator and can function in the transmission of nociception. In the spinal cord, the function and expression of CGRP may differ depending on the location of synthesis. CGRP is derived mainly from the cell bodies of motor neurons when synthesized in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and may contribute to the regeneration of nervous tissue after injury. Conversely, CGRP is derived from dorsal root ganglion when synthesized in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and may be linked to the transmission of pain. In the trigeminal vascular system, the cell bodies on the trigeminal ganglion are the main source of CGRP. CGRP is thought to play a role in cardiovascular homeostasis and nociception. In the heart, CGRP acts a chronotrope by increasing heart rate. Apart from these attributes, CGRP is known to modulate the autonomic nervous system and plays a role in ingestion. CGRP has moderate effects on calcium homeostasis compared to its extensive actions in other areas, such as the autonomic nervous system. = Appetite = As a neuropeptide, CGRP acts as an appetite suppressant and contributes to gastric acid secretion. It also functions in temperature homeostasis, increases heart rate, and plays a role in the release of the pituitary hormones in a paracrine manner. Because of these characteristics, it has been said that CGRP functions more as a neurotransmitter than a hormone.  Receptors  CGRP mediates its effects through a heteromeric receptor composed of a G protein-coupled receptor called calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) and a receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP1). CGRP receptors are found throughout the body, suggesting that the protein may modulate a variety of physiological functions in all major systems (e.g., respiratory, endocrine, gastrointestinal, immune, and cardiovascular). The extracellular loop number 2 is fundamental for ligand induced activation, with key interactions of R274/Y278/D280/W283.  Regulation  Regulation of the calcitonin gene- related peptide (CGRP) gene is in part controlled by the expression of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, cytokines such as TNFŒ± and iNOS. 5HT1 receptor agonists, such as sumatriptan, increase intracellular calcium, which cause decreases in CGRP promoter activity. CGRP receptor is found in myelinated A-fibers axon which is required for ligand specificity and function of the receptor. The CGRP receptor has three subunits: receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), calcitonin-like receptor (CLR) and receptor component protein (RCP). The complex central receptor is the G protein-coupled receptor calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) which is necessary for CGRP and adrenomedullin (AM receptors). For function CGRP, CALCRL must coincide with RAMP1 where the ligand-binding domain of CGRP is located. It also includes two cytoplasmic proteins that associate with the CALCRL-RAMP1 to form signal transduction. CALCRL contains the GŒ± subunit, which activates adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. Receptor-mediated transduction elevates in intracellular cAMP activate protein kinase A, which results in the phosphorylation of multiple targets, including potassium- sensitive ATP channels (KATP channels), extracellular signal-related kinases and transcription factors such as cAMP- responsive element-binding protein (CREB). In smooth muscle of neurovascular region, the elevation of cAMP upon CGRP activation results in vasodilation of the blood vessel. Chronic exposure to CGRP causes degradation of lysosomes.  Research  Increased levels of CGRP have been reported in migraine and temporomandibular joint disorder patients as well as a variety of other diseases such as cardiac failure, hypertension, and sepsis. There is mounting evidence to suggest that CGRP may be beneficial in preventing the development of hypertension and cardiovascular pathologies associated with hypertension. Prophylactic therapy with calcitonin gene‚Äêrelated peptides (CGRPs) may have unknown fertility consequences for women of child bearing age. This is of particular concern, as females (16.6%) are more genetically predisposed to migraine than are males (7.5%). Preclinical evidence suggests that, during a migraine, activated primary sensory neurons (meningeal nociceptors) in the trigeminal ganglion release CGRP from their peripherally projecting nerve endings located within the meninges. This CGRP then binds to and activates CGRP receptors located around meningeal vessels, causing vasodilation, mast cell degranulation, and plasma extravasation. Human observations have further implicated the role of CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine. Activation of primary sensory neurons in the trigeminal vascular system in humans can cause the release of CGRP. During some migraine attacks, increased concentrations of CGRP can be found in both saliva and in plasma drawn from the external jugular vein. Furthermore, intravenous administration of alpha-CGRP is able to induce headache in individuals susceptible to migraine.  Medicines  New medicines are now on the market that contain antibodies against either CGRP itself, or its receptor. They are called monoclonal antibodies (MABs) and are large molecules that do not cross the blood-brain barrier. They typically are not metabolized by the liver and have little direct impact on the metabolism of more conventional small-molecule drugs. They also tend to have relatively long half-lives in the body, but must be given parenterally (preferably by injection) due to very poor absorption from the digestive tract. They have been proved to be effective in people who experience migraine headaches, both with and without aura, and both episodic and chronic. These are the first class of preventive medications originally designed and approved for people with migraine. Monoclonal means all the antibodies are made from the same genetic material, although different MABs may derive from different sources, e.g. from hamster ovarian cells, from yeast cells or from humanized cell cultures. The antibodies are also made repeatedly to make them all identical, which results in difficult and relatively expensive production lines. Antibodies are proteins that counter or interfere with very specific parts of another protein or the site where a protein is supposed to bind to the receptor. Most commonly thought of in being used to prevent or fight off infections. The first approved by the FDA is called erenumab (trade name Aimovig), produced by pharmaceutical company Amgen and Novartis. It interacts with the CGRP receptor. It is injected once monthly with a dose of 70 or 140 mg. Few adverse effects were reported (most related to injection site reactions) and patients had a significant reduction in migraines. The second approved by the FDA is called fremanezumab (trade name Ajovy), produced by the Teva pharmaceutical company. It interacts with the CGRP protein, whose expression is related to migraine attacks. It may be administered monthly or every three months, giving options for users. Trials have shown a reduction of greater than 50% of migraine days for those who responded. There were few significant side effects during trials, most related to injection site reactions. The third approved by the FDA is called galcanezumab (trade name Emgality), produced by the Eli Lilly Company. It interacts with the CGRP protein, whose expression is related to migraine attacks. It is injected once a month, after the first month having a double dose. The main side effects are injection site reactions. Approved by the FDA in February 2020, ubrogepant is an oral medication manufactured by Allergan. Also FDA approved in February 2020, eptinezumab (Vyepti), is an intravenous migraine prophylactic medication manufactured by Lundbeck.

Young Dr. Malone) is an American soap opera, created by Irna Phillips, which had a long run on radio and television from 1939 to 1963. The producer was Betty Corday (1912‚Äì1987), who also produced Pepper Young's Family and later was a co-creator with husband Ted Corday of NBC Daytime's Days of Our Lives. Sponsored by General Foods and Post Cereals, the radio serial began on the Blue Network on November 20, 1939. The 15-minute program aired daily at 11:15am, continuing until April 26, 1940. Without a break, it moved to CBS on April 29, 1940, where it was heard for two decades, first airing at 2:00pm weekdays (1940‚Äì1944) and then 1:30pm (1945‚Äì1960). In 1945, Procter & Gamble assumed sponsorship of the program. Radio When the serial began, Alan Bunce portrayed small town physician Dr. Jerry Malone, who dispensed prescriptions and advice to the folks of Three Oaks. Others heard in the title role were Carl Frank, Harold Miller, Charles Irving (during the mid-1940s) and Sandy Becker (beginning in 1947). With organists Charles Paul and Milton Kaye providing the background music, the storylines focused on Jerry, his wife Ann Richards Malone (Elizabeth Reller, Barbara Weeks) and their daughter Jill, initially portrayed by child impersonator Madeleine Pierce. As Jill grew up, she was played by Joan Lazer and Rosemary Rice. Malone's mother (Evelyn Varden, Vera Allen) usually intruded with a few choice words on the activities of her son. When Jerry made trips to New York, Three Oaks businessman Sam Williams (Berry Kroeger) let Ann know his true feelings for her.

The TV storyline was set in fictional Denison, Maryland and concentrated on the later lives of father and son doctors, Dr. Jerry Malone (William Prince) and Dr. David Malone (John Connell) at Valley Hospital. Jerry's wife, Tracey, was played first by Virginia Dwyer, then for most of the show's run by Augusta Dabney. Prince and Dabney became real-life husband and wife in 1964. The show was a sophisticated blend of hospital drama, family life and urbane humor.

He served in the Bengal Army and saw action in the First Anglo-Afghan War, Gwalior Campaign, Second Anglo-Sikh War, Indian Rebellion and Second Anglo-Afghan War. He later became Commander-in-chief of the Madras Army. Background and early life Chamberlain was born in Rio de Janeiro, the third son of Sir Henry Chamberlain, 1st Baronet, consul general and charge d'affaires in Brazil, and his second wife Anna Eugenia n√©e Morgan. His elder brother, William Charles Chamberlain, was an admiral, while younger brothers Crawford Chamberlain, and Charles Francis Falcon Chamberlain, were also army officers. He was raised in England and educated by a private tutor and at school in Shooter's Hill, London. In 1833 he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, having been nominated for a cadetship by Lord Beresford but was withdrawn after a year when it became clear he was unlikely to pass the final examinations.G.W. Forrest (2013), Life Of Field Marshal Sir Neville Chamberlain, Read Books During his time at Woolwich he earned a reputation for fighting and rebellious behaviour, and on his return home he threatened to join the British Legion, a body of troops leaving for Spain under Sir George de Lacy Evans. Instead, he was encouraged to pursue a career in India, and with help from his late father's contacts he was commissioned as an ensign in the Bengal Native Infantry on 24 February 1837.Heathcote, p. 83 India Chamberlain embarked for India on board the ship George and arrived at Madras in May 1837. He remained at Madras for a short time as the guest of the retired general Sir John Doveton before continuing on to Calcutta in June. In Calcutta, Chamberlain stayed with his uncle George and his aunt whilst he acclimatised to his new home. In November he left Calcutta to join the 12th Regiment at Barrackpore and three months later he was posted to Lucknow with the 55th Regiment. In mid 1838, he was transferred to the 16th Regiment based at Delhi who were preparing for the First Anglo-Afghan War. His regiment was to become part of the Army of the Indus, serving in the 1st Brigade 1st Division under the command of Sir Willoughby Cotton. He was present at a number of engagements including the Battle of Ghazni in July 1839 and was wounded on several occasions. Promoted to lieutenant on 16 July 1842, he transferred to the 1st Cavalry of Shah Shujah's Contingent and took part in a march from Kandahar to Kabul in August 1842. During the withdrawal from Kabul he was again wounded at Landi Kotal in October 1842 and again at Ali Masjid in November 1842. He became attached to the Governor-General's Bodyguard in January 1843 and took part in the Battle of Maharajpur in December 1843 during the Gwalior Campaign. Chamberlain became military secretary to the Governor of Bombay in late 1846 and then brigade major with the Bengal Irregular Cavalry in 1848.Heathcote, p. 84 Punjab He took part in the Battle of Chillianwala in January 1849 and the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He became assistant adjutant-general of the Sirhind division in May 1849 and, having been promoted to captain in the 16th Bengal Native Infantry on 1 November 1849 and to brevet major on 2 November 1849, he became assistant commissioner in the Rawalpindi District in December 1849 and then assistant commissioner in the Hazara District in June 1850. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 28 November 1854, he was given the command of the Punjab Irregular Frontier Force and led several expeditions against the frontier tribes. Indian Rebellion of 1857 During the Indian Rebellion he served as Adjutant-General of the Indian Army and was severely wounded at the Siege of Delhi in July 1857. For this he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 11 November 1857 and promoted to colonel on 27 November 1857. Chamberlain was reappointed to the command of the Punjab Irregular Frontier Force in 1858 and led it during the Ambela Campaign during which he was again severely wounded again in November 1863. Advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 11 April 1863, he returned to the United Kingdom and was promoted to major-general for distinguished service on 5 August 1864. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India on 24 May 1866 and accompanied the Duke of Edinburgh on an official trip to India in 1869. He was promoted to lieutenant-general on 1 May 1872, advanced to Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India on 24 May 1873 and further advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 28 May 1875. Chamberlain became Commander-in-chief of the Madras Army in February 1876 and, having been promoted to full general on 1 October 1877, was sent on a mission to the Emir of Afghanistan, Sher Ali Khan, whose refusal to allow him, along with Major Louis Cavagnari, to enter the country precipitated the Second Anglo-Afghan War in November 1878. He was a member of the Madras Legislative Council and, for several months, acting military member of the council of the Governor-General of India. He left India in February 1881 and retired to Lordswood near Southampton in February 1886. Later life and death In retirement, Chamberlain was an active member of the Southampton Unitarian Church. He was a vocal critic of British policy during the Boer War between 1899 and 1901.Charles Edward Buckland, Dictionary of Indian Biography, Ardent Media, 1971 He was promoted to field marshal on 25 April 1900, died at Lordswood on 18 February 1902 and was buried at Rownhams near Southampton. Family In 1873, Chamberlain married Charlotte Cuyler Reid, daughter of Major-General Sir William Reid, who died in 1896; there were no children.

Before temporarily retiring to start a family in 2009, she rode for in women's elite professional events on the National Racing Calendar (NRC) and UCI Women's World Cup. She announced a return to competitive cycling beginning in the 2011 season, competing for Peanut Butter & Co. TWENTY12 at the Redlands Classic. Background Prior to her professional cycling career, Armstrong had been a junior Olympian in swimming, a distance runner in college, and then a triathlete. She spent many hours perfecting her strokes in the pool at the Boise Family YMCA, where she also served as Director of Aquatics, managing more than 50 lifeguards, swim instructors, and others. She was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both hips in 2001 at age 27, and told that she could no longer run at an elite level, thus ending her triathlon career and leading her to focus exclusively on cycling. The three-time national champion finished 8th (top U.S. finisher) in the women's road race at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in China, Armstrong completed the biggest achievement of her career by winning the gold medal in the women's road time trial competition on August 13. Finishing in under 35 minutes, Armstrong was 25 seconds ahead of silver medalist Emma Pooley from Great Britain, with Karin Th√ºrig from Switzerland taking the bronze. Of Armstrong, Velonews wrote: \\"Kristin Armstrong is famous for both her success in bicycle racing, and the 'type-A' attention to detail that keeps her climbing the podium at critical races every season.\\" Armstrong announced at the end of 2010 that she would return to competitive cycling, with the goal of competing at the London 2012 Summer Olympics. In a written statement, she stated that her retirement was merely temporary in order to start a family: > I love cycling and I love competing. I stopped racing after the 2009 World > Championships not because I was burned out, but because my husband and I > wanted to start a family...I told myself from the beginning if everything > went smoothly with the birth of our son, Lucas William, I would consider > racing again. In 2011, Armstrong returned to compete with the Peanut Butter & Co. Team TWENTY12, of which she was a part owner. She won three of the four stages (criterium, road race, and time trial) and the overall title during the Sea Otter Classic in April. However, during the first stage of the Tour of the Gila, which she had won twice previously, Armstrong came down with food poisoning. She ended up withdrawing from the race and returning home to recover. Armstrong successfully defended her Olympic title in the individual time trial at the 2012 Olympics in London and became the oldest rider to win an Olympic time trial, and finished 35th in the Women's road race. She announced her retirement after the 2012 Olympics. In September 2012, Armstrong's Olympic gold medal-winning time trial bike was stolen while in transit between Germany and the USA. In April 2015, Armstrong announced that she would be coming out of retirement to race at the 2015 Pan American Road Championships in Leon, Mexico, having been selected by USA Cycling for the individual time trial. Two days after announcing Armstrong's selection, however, the USA Cycling Selection Committee reconvened, deciding that the new selection process under which Armstrong had been chosen had not been published in a timely manner, and that as a result the federation's older Principles of Athlete Selection, which had been issued in 2008, should be used instead for selection to the Pan American Championships. The upshot was that Armstrong's place was taken by Tayler Wiles. The following month, Armstrong won the United States National Time Trial Championships in Chattanooga, Tennessee, beating Carmen Small by 13 seconds. In August 2016, Armstrong made history at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro after coming out of retirement to win the gold medal in the women's individual time trial and becoming the first rider ever to win three gold medals in the same discipline. She also became the oldest female cyclist to win an Olympic medal. In September 2017 Armstrong joined USA Cycling as Endurance Performance Director. In December 2019 Armstrong created and launched her bike computer mount line of products called KX3 Sports. Personal life Armstrong's father was an officer in the US Marines. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, she lived in Tennessee and California and attended high school in Havelock, North Carolina, and abroad in Okinawa, Japan, where she graduated from Kubasaki High School in 1991. She enrolled at the University of Idaho in Moscow, where she ran track for the Vandals for a season as a walk-on and was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. Armstrong earned a bachelor's degree from UI in sports physiology in 1995, and currently lives in Boise, Idaho. She is often confused with the ex-wife of fellow cyclist Lance Armstrong, whose name is also Kristin. Kristin Armstrong the cyclist and Lance Armstrong are not related. Armstrong is married to Joe Savola; their son Lucas William Savola was born on September 15, 2010. Four months before his birth, she gave the commencement address at her alma mater in May 2010.

It focuses on the deaths of foreign Muslims who had gone to Bosnia to serve as fighters, or mujahadin and describes their deaths as that of martyrs (in Arabic, shuhadaa, plural for shahid). The book is available on many Internet sites and is especially popular in audio format, which was the original form before it appeared as a printed text. Audio versions include anaasheed (plural for nasheed), Islamic-oriented songs that were recorded by shuhadaa before their deaths. (Devji: 87, 110) The title refers to the common belief that the souls of martyrs are carried in the hearts of green birds. This idea has also been an inspiration for a book of a similar name but very different subject matter, In the Belly of the Green Bird, which is an account of the fall of Saddam Hussein and the US military operations in Iraq (Xenakis).

After serving 22 years in the British Army, he was the Member of Parliament for Esher in the British Parliament from 1970 until 1987. During his political career he held the offices of Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, and Comptroller of the Household. Early life Mather was born in Adlington, in the county of Cheshire, the younger son of Loris Emerson Mather. His family owned Mather and Platt, an engineering company in Manchester, which was chaired by his father and later managed by his elder brother, William. His grandfather was Sir William Mather, MP for North Salford, Gorton and Rossendale for 19 years, from 1885 to 1904. Mather was educated at Amesbury, Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, and then joined his elder brother at the family company as an apprentice for a short period. World War 2 He joined the Welsh Guards at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, and was trained at Sandhurst. In February 1940, before his officer training was completed, Mather volunteered to join the 5th Special Reserve Battalion, Scots Guards. The battalion was formed in anticipation of supporting Finland in the Winter War in 1939‚Äì1940, but the conflict ended before it left the UK. Mather returned to training with the Welsh Guards and was commissioned in March 1940. He volunteered for training at the Irregular Warfare Training Centre in Lochailort in October 1940, joined No. 8 Commando, and headed with the unit to North Africa in January 1941 as part of Layforce. After 8 Commando was disbanded on 1 August 1941, Mather joined \\"L Detachment\\", the nucleus of the future SAS headed by David Stirling, where he joined raids on Axis airfields the most notable being the raid on Sidi Haneish airfield in June 1942. In October 1942, he was offered the opportunity to join his elder brother on the staff of General Montgomery. Montgomery was a family friend, through his wife, Betty. Rejoining Stirling's force for a last operation deep behind enemy lines, he was captured by the Italians in Tripolitania on 20 December 1942. He was transferred to Italy by submarine, and spent 9 months as a prisoner of war in Fontanellato in Northern Italy. He escaped in September 1943, shortly after the Italians agreed an armistice with the Allies, and walked 600 miles down the Apennines to the Allied lines near Campobasso, north-east of Naples. He returned to England in November 1943, but rejoined Montgomery as a liaison officer in early 1944 to assist with preparations for D-Day. He landed on D+1, and remained with Montgomery through the operations in Northern France and Belgium, acting as Montgomery's eyes and ears on the front line. He was awarded the MC for a successful reconnaissance mission in Nijmegen on 18 September 1944, on the second day of Operation Market Garden, while it was still occupied by the German Army. On 9 January 1945, he survived being on an Auster that was shot down near Grave in the Netherlands: the pilot was killed, and another passenger, Major Richard Harden, took the controls and crash- landed while Mather deployed the flaps. Mather was hit by four bullets and badly injured, suffering 13 separate wounds and losing a kidney. He spent several months in hospital before rejoining Montgomery in July 1945 near Osnabr√ºck. =Post-war military career= Mather joined the regular army in 1946, returning to his regiment the Welsh Guards in Palestine, where he remained until the independence of Israel in 1948. He was Assistant Military Attach√© in Athens from 1953 to 1956, served in Military Intelligence in the War Office from 1956 to 1961 and the Far East from 1961 to 1962, when he retired with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Political career He resigned his commission in 1962 to join the research department of the Conservative Party, working alongside Christopher Chataway and Anthony Meyer. His grandfather had been a Liberal MP. He became a councillor on Eton Rural District Council in 1965. He stood for Parliament in Leicester North West at the 1966 general election, losing this Labour safe seat to incumbent Barnett Janner by a wide margin. He was elected to Eton Rural District Council, and joined 250 other aspiring MPs (including colleagues from the research department) in competing to be selected as prospective Parliamentary candidate for Esher, a safe Conservative seat, in 1969. Elected at the 1970 general election, he disagreed almost immediately with Prime Minister Edward Heath's course of joining the European Economic Community. He remained a Eurosceptic throughout his political career. He also campaigned vigorously for the return of capital punishment; supported the suggestion in 1974 for the creation of a 10,000-strong \\"Citizen Volunteer Force\\" to support the police; supported the role of the Army in Northern Ireland, and Royal Ulster Constabulary; and campaigned against the M25 being driven through his constituency. His strong right-wing views gained him to appointments on various backbench committees, but did not endear him to the party leadership. He became less vocal in sharing his views when Margaret Thatcher appointed him as an opposition whip in 1975, soon after she became leader of the Conservatives. After James Callaghan's Labour government lost a motion of no confidence by one vote in 1979, orchestrated in part by Mather, he became a government whip after the Conservatives won the 1979 general election. He served as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury from 1979 to 1981, as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household from 1981 to 1983, and finally as Comptroller of the Household from 1981 until 1987. He received a knighthood in the 1987 New Year's Honours List, and retired at the 1987 general election. Later years In retirement, he wrote Aftermath of War: Everyone Must Go Home, published in 1992. A memoir of his duties in Germany in 1945, visiting camps holding Axis prisoners, including Cossacks and Yugoslavs who fought for the Germans and who were returned to face an uncertain future under Stalin and Tito, the book was also a defence of Harold Macmillan against allegations of treachery made by Nikolai Tolstoy. He published a war memoir in 1997 entitled: When the Grass Stops Growing. Death Mather died on 3 July 2006 at the age of 87 in the Gloucestershire village of Lower Oddington. After a funeral service at St. Nicholas Church in Lower Oddington, his body was buried in its graveyard.Entry for Carol Mather in Findagrave website (2019). https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/51925111/carol-david_macdonell-mather Personal life Mather married The Honourable Philippa Bewicke-Copley, daughter of the 5th Baron Cromwell, in 1951, who survived him after 55 years of marriage. Together, they had one son and three daughters. He enjoyed sketching in pen and ink, and painting in watercolours. He also took part in and outdoor pursuits, including skiing and fishing. He played polo and enjoyed fox hunting. He also rode, and won, point-to-point races.

Rosen is known for his writings on the rise of violence in Iraq following the 2003 invasion, which form the basis of his first book, In the Belly of the Green Bird (2006). He spent eight years in Iraq reporting on the Coalition occupation, the relationship between Americans and Iraqis, the development of postwar Iraqi religious and political movements, inter-ethnic and sectarian relations, and the Iraqi civil war. He has regularly contributed to leading periodicals, such as Atlantic Monthly, The Washington Post, the New York Times Magazine, the Boston Review, and Harper's. He contributed to the footage of Iraq in Charles Ferguson's documentary No End In Sight and was also interviewed for the film. Rosen has written extensively against the surge in Iraq, notably in a March 2008 article for Rolling Stone. From 2005 to 2008, Rosen was a fellow at the New America Foundation. In September 2007, he was the C.V. Starr Distinguished Visitor at The American Academy in Berlin. On April 2, 2008, Rosen testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee at their hearings on political prospects in Iraq after the surge. In 2010 he published his second book, Aftermath. From 2008 to 2011, Rosen was a fellow at the Center on Law and Security at the New York University School of Law, until his resignation in the wake of his controversial statements about Lara Logan's sexual assault in Egypt. In March 2011, Mary Kaldor, Co-Director at the Center for Global Governance at the London School of Economics had hired Rosen as a research fellow to work on North Africa. This created controversy due to Kaldor's involvement in the LSE Libya Links affair.https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid;=explorer&chrome;=true&srcid;=0B1oqqxmEgcXbZDY4NGUwOTAtN2FkNC00MTUzLWIyZjgtNzdmMjZjYmZmY2Q3&hl;=sv&pli;=1 After two days, Rosen resigned from his position as a fellow at the London School of Economics. An LSE spokesman said, ‚ÄúNir Rosen today resigned his temporary visiting fellowship at LSE‚Äîwhich was an unpaid position.‚Äù  Controversy  In February, 2011 Rosen commented to his Twitter account regarding Lara Logan, Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent for CBS News, who was beaten and sexually assaulted in the February riots in Egypt. \\"Jesus Christ, at a moment when she is going to become a martyr and glorified we should at least remember her role as a major war monger,\\" wrote Rosen. Rosen suggested that she was trying to outdo Anderson Cooper, who was attacked but not sexually assaulted just days before, and that it would have been humorous had Cooper suffered a similar assault, saying \\"it would have been funny if it happened to Anderson too.\\" Rosen later posted an apology on Twitter and resigned his position as a fellow at New York University's Center on Law and Security. Rosen stated that he did not read the CBS News press release to which he had linked, and that at the time of his comments he did not know Logan's assault had been sexual. Beliefs and views Rosen believes that Hezbollah is not a terrorist organization, but rather a \\"widely popular and legitimate political and resistance movement\\". In April 2008, when asked by then-Senator Joe Biden what could be done to improve the situation in Iraq, Rosen replied: \\"As a journalist, I'm uncomfortable advising an imperialist power about how to be a more efficient imperialist power. I don't think we're there for the interests of the Iraqi people. I don't think that's ever been a motivation.\\" He wrote an assessment of the Syrian conflict for the American government and is known for the distinctly pro-Assad regime nature of his commentary.

It starred Bobby Sherman and Wes Stern as Bobby Conway and Lionel Poindexter, a songwriting duo. The pilot for the series had aired the previous spring as the first-season finale episode of The Partridge Family named \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\", in which Lionel and Bobby were introduced to each other by the Partridges. The unaired version of this episode, entitled \\"Words And Music\\", ran 33 minutes, and featured Farrah Fawcett and Pat Boone. The eight extra minutes of footage were filmed on March 15, 1971. Sherman's and Stern's characters were reportedly based on the real- life songwriting team of Boyce and Hart, who had written hits for the Monkees (\\"Last Train to Clarksville\\", \\"Valleri\\"), Jay and the Americans (\\"Come a Little Bit Closer\\") and others. New music was a staple of the series, provided by much of the same team that had created the Partridge Family music. Most of these songs were from Sherman's album Getting Together, though a few songs were from his other albums (and some songs have never been released). Cast *Bobby Sherman as Bobby Conway *Wes Stern as Lionel Poindexter *Susan Neher as Jennifer Conway *Jack Burns as Officer Rudy Colcheck *Pat Carroll as Rita Simon Episodes Reception Airing in the same time slot as breakout CBS hit All in the Family, the show never gained sufficient ratings and was canceled at midseason after 14 episodes.

It is a Grade I listed building. The first church All Saints' Church, Bakewell The church was founded in 920, during Anglo-Saxon times and the churchyard has two 9th-century crosses. During restoration work, in the 1840s, many carved fragments of Anglo-Saxon stonework were found in and around the porch, as well as some ancient stone coffins. The present church The present church was started in the 12th century in Norman style; however, only the west front and part of the nave survive from that time. The remainder of the church was built between 1220 and 1240. The spire was added in 1340 but, was taken down in 1825, and the tower also removed in 1830. Before the restoration work the church measurements were from the level of the church floor to the top of the spire , from east to west , transepts from north to south . Between 1841 and 1844, it was almost completely rebuilt as it had become dangerous. as part of the restoration by William Flockton.English Heritage (1951) Church of All Saints. Images of England (Retrieved 22 January 2006‚Äîfree registration required). Once the external works were completed in 1844, internal restorations were undertaken. The church was re-pewed throughout. The Norman piers from the nave were substituted for early English decorated ones, and steam heating was introduced. This work was carried out by Mr Bath of Haddon under the supervision of the architects John Grey Weightman and Matthew Ellison Hadfield of Sheffield. The church re-opened on 4 September 1851. The chancel was restored between 1879‚Äì82 by George Gilbert Scott Jr.. The restoration was carried out at the expense of the Ven. Archdeacon Balston, vicar, with the outside walls being paid for by the Ecclesiastical commissioners. A new screen was provided under the chancel arch, with carving mimicking that on the screen in the Vernon Chapel. A new pavement of marble was laid. In the sanctuary, a new reredos was installed, with an engraving of the scene on Mount Calvary. The woodwork was done by Mr Elwell of Beverley. The walls by Burlison and Grylls, the floor by Belham of Buckingham Palace Road, London and the marble work by Twigg of Ashford. A north vestry was added in 1897‚Äì98 at a cost of ¬£700 (). The architects were Naylor and Sale of Derby, and the contractor T. Allsop and Son of Bakewell. The vestry was fitted out with furniture from Booth and Wright of Bakewell, and the woodwork was installed by Groom and Co of Bakewell and Matlock. It was dedicated by the Bishop of Southwell on 15 May 1898. In 1906 ‚Äì 07 the nave roof was repaired by Charles Hodgson Fowler. He fixed a large crane on an elevated timber platform just over the roof of the south porch, and covered the nave with a temporary iron roof. The crane was used to remove the old roof timbers. Oak trees from Holton Park, Oxfordshire were selected for the new roof timbers. Hodgson Fowler also replaced the tie beams and the wall plates. The cost of restoration was ¬£445 (). =Misericords= All Saints' contains three early-15th-century misericords, along with eighteen 19th-century misericords in the choir stalls.

The son of a Mongol T√ºsheet Khan, Zanabazar was declared spiritual leader of Khalkha Mongols by a convocation of nobles in 1639 when he was just four years old. The 5th Dalai Lama (1617‚Äì1682) later recognized him as the reincarnation of the Buddhist scholar Taranatha and bestowed on him the Sanskrit name J√±ƒÅnavajra (Sanskrit: ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§µ‡§ú‡•ç‡§∞, Zanabazar in Mongolian) meaning \\"thunderbolt scepter of wisdom\\". Over the course of nearly 60 years, Zanabazar advanced the Gelugpa school of Buddhism among the Mongols, supplanting or synthesizing Sakya or \\"Red Hat\\" Buddhist traditions that had prevailed in the area, while strongly influencing social and political developments in 17th century Mongolia. His close ties with both Khalka Mongol leaders and the devout Kangxi Emperor facilitated the Khalkha's submission to Qing rule in 1691. In addition to his spiritual and political roles, Zanabazar was a polymath ‚Äì a prodigious sculptor, painter, architect, poet, costume designer, scholar and linguist, who is credited with launching Mongolia's seventeenth century cultural renaissance. He is best known for his intricate and elegant Buddhist sculptures created in the Nepali-derived style, two of the most famous being the White Tara and Varajradhara, sculpted in the 1680s. To aid translation of sacred Tibetan texts, he created the Soyombo script from which sprang the Soyombo that later became a national symbol of Mongolia. Zanabazar used his artistic output to promote Buddhism among all levels of Khalkha society and unify Khalkha Mongol tribes during a time of social and political turmoil.  Life  = Early life, 1635-1651 = 185x185pxZanabazar was born in 1635 in present-day Yes√∂nz√ºil, √ñv√∂rkhangai, Mongolia. Named Eshidorji at birth, he was the second son of the T√ºsheet khan Gombodorj (1594-1655) and his wife, Khandojamtso. Gombodorj, one of three Khalkha khans who could trace his lineage directly back to Genghis Khan, was the grandson of Abtai Sain Khan (1554-1588), who had first opened Khalkha Mongol lands to the spread of ‚ÄúYellow Hat‚Äù or Gelugpa Tibetan Buddhism. In 1578 Abtai's uncle, Altan Khan, bestowed the Mongolian language title \\"Dalai Lama\\" on the Gelug leader Sonam Gyatso. Drepung Monastery According to tradition, Zanabazar showed signs of advanced intelligence, linguistic abilities, and religious devotion from an early age. Miraculous incidents allegedly occurred during his youth and he was able to fully recite the Jambaltsanjod prayer (praise of Manjusri) at age three. In 1639, an assembly of Khalkha nobles at Shireet Tsagaan nuur (75 km east of the former capital Karakorum) recognized Zanabazar as an √ñnd√∂r Gegeen (high saint) and the Khalkh's supreme religious leader, even though he was only four years old at the time. They pledged their obedience, proclaiming him \\"He who brandishes the banner of the Sakyapa\\" school and \\"teacher of multitudes\\". This designation as supreme religious leader strengthened ties between the Khalkha aristocracy and the Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy, gave Khalkha nobility, added religious legitimacy, and served as a rallying point for Khalkha tribal leaders, who that same year had forged an uneasy alliance with western-based Oirat (Dzungar) Mongol tribes. Zanabazar established his religious center in 1647, a traveling ger camp known as the ‚ÄúMonastery of the West‚Äù (Baruun Kh√ºree), later renamed Shankh Monastery. In 1649, Zanabazar was sent to Tibet to receive personal instruction from the 5th Dalai Lama and the 4th Panchen Lama at Drepung Monastery. The Dalai Lama identified him as the reincarnation of the scholar Taranatha (1575‚Äì1634), who had led the rival Jonang school of Tibetan Buddhism until his death in Mongolia one year before Zanabazar's birth. Taranatha was believed to be the 15th reincarnation (Khutuktu) of Jebtsundamba (one of the Buddha's original 500 disciples). Thus Zanabazar was recognized as the 16th reincarnation and he and his successors thereafter referred to as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. The Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy also granted him the additional title Bogd Gegeen, or \\"Highest Enlightened Saint\\", designating him the top-ranking Lama in Mongolia. = Spiritual and temporal leadership, 1651-1686 = Zanabazar statuette Following his journeys to Tibet in 1651 and again in 1656, Zanabazar and his retinue of Tibetan lamas founded a series of Gelug-influenced monasteries, temples, and Buddhist shrines throughout Mongol territory, the most noteworthy being a stupa to house Taranatha's remains, the Saridgiin Monastery in the Khentii mountains (completed in 1680), and several movable temples which contained paintings, sculptures, wall hangings and ritual objects influenced by the Tibetan-Nepalese style and either imported from Tibet or produced by Zanabazar or his students. By the late 1650s, Zanabazar further solidified his spiritual and political authority over Khalkha tribal leaders. The gers he received as gifts from Khalkha nobles upon his election in 1639 became his √ñrg√∂√∂, his ambulatory palatial residence. Known as the Shira Busiin Ord (Yellow Screen Palace) - later called Urga by the Russians and Da Khuree or Ikh Khuree by Mongols - it would eventually become the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar after settling at its current location, near the confluence of the Selbe and Tuul rivers and beneath Bogd Khan Uul in 1778. Zanabazar established seven aimags (monastic departments) to oversee his religious institutions; the Department of the Treasury, Department of Administration, Department of Meals, Department of the Honored Doctor, Department of Amdo, Department of Orlog and the Department of Khuukhen Noyon. His authority was further substantiated in 1658 when he presided over a convocation of nobles at Erdene Zuu and a year later he conferred titles on nobles at Olziit Tsagaan Nuur. Nevertheless, despite being recognized as the undisputed spiritual leader of the Kalkha, Zanabazar's moral influence failed to overcome the Mongols‚Äô traditional tribalism, both among various Khalkha tribes as well as the rivalry between the Khalkha and Oirat-Dzungar Mongols to the west. = Khalkha submission to Qing rule, 1686-1691 = 202x202pxAs tensions between Dzungar and Khalkha Mongols grew, Zanabazar attempted to pacify the Dzungar leader Galdan Boshugtu Khan with gifts of his artwork and sacred texts. In 1686 he attended a peace conference at the behest of the Kangxi Emperor to reach a reconciliation with the Dzungars. Despite these efforts, skirmishes and vendettas soon led to all-out war. As Galdan's forces swept eastward into Khalka territory in 1688, Zanabazar and nearly 20,000 Khalkha refugees fled south into present day Inner Mongolia to seek the protection of the Qing Emperor. In pursuit, Dzungar forces pillaged Erdene Zuu and destroyed several monasteries built by Zanabazar. Under Zanabazar's authority, the three Khalkha rulers declared themselves Qing vassals at Dolon Nor (the site of Shangdu, the pleasure palace of the Yuan Emperors) in 1691, a politically decisive step that officially ended the last remnants of the Yuan dynasty and allowed the Qing to assume the mantle of the Genghisid khans, merging the Khalkha forces into the Qing army.J. Millward, Eurasian Crossroads:A history of Xinjiang, pg. 91 Motivated by the appeals of Zanabazar, whom he greatly admired, as well as the threat posed by a strong, unified Mongol state under Dzungar rule, the Kangxi Emperor dispatched Qing armies north to subdue the Galdan's forces. = Final years and death, 1691-1723 = From 1691 to 1701 Qing armies battled the Dzungars for control of Mongolia. Zanabazar remained in China, wintering in Beijing and passing his summers with the Kangxi Emperor at Jehol (Chengde) as his spiritual mentor. He returned to Khalkha Mongolia only once during this period, in 1699, to attend the funeral of his elder brother, T√ºsheet Khan Chankhuundorj. The Kangxi Emperor designated Zanabazar ‚ÄúDa Lama‚Äù, ‚ÄúGreat Lama‚Äù, and invited him on his pilgrimage to Wutaishan in 1698. Under Zanabazar's tutelage, the intensity of the Kangxi Emperor's Buddhist devotion notably increased after 1701.AmarbayasgalantIn 1697, Qing forces decisively defeated Galdan at the Battle of Jao Modo. At age 66, Zanabazar finally resettled in Khalkha Mongolia in 1701 to supervise restoration of the Erdene Zuu Monastery. Over the next several years he oversaw the building of more Buddhist monasteries in Mongolia while travelling to Beijing annually to meet with the Qing Emperor. Upon receiving news of the Kangxi Emperor's death on December 20, 1722, Zanabazar immediately journeyed to Beijing to conduct Buddhist rites at Beijing's Yellow Monastery (Huang si ÈªÉÂØ∫). Zanabazar died himself (poisoned, some believe, by the new emperor) in Beijing only six weeks later, on February 18, 1723. He was 88 years old. His body was embalmed, returned to Mongolia and mummified. The Kangxi Emperor's son, the Yongzheng Emperor, ordered a Chinese-style monastery dedicated to Zanabazar's main tutelary deity, Maitreya, to be built at the place where the lama's traveling encampment had stood at the moment of his death. He pledged 100,000 liang of silver to the monastery's construction, which was not completed until a year after his own death in 1736. Amarbayasgalant Monastery or ‚ÄúMonastery of Blessed Peace,‚Äù resembles Yongzheng's own Yonghe Palace in Beijing. Zanabazar's body was finally laid to rest there in 1779. In 1937, Amarbayasgalant Monastery was ransacked by Mongolian communists. Zanabazar's remains were allegedly removed and burned in the hills nearby.  Artistic works  T√∂vkh√∂n Monastery At his height, Zanabazar was recognized as a sculptor par excellence among the Buddhist countries of Asia and the greatest sculptor of Mongolia He is sometimes referred to as the Michelangelo of Asia as he epitomized the Mongolian Renaissance. During his time in Tibet, Zanabazar came to admire the Nepali style of representational arts favored by the Gelug school and it profoundly influenced his own artistic development and style. Upon his return from Tibet in 1651 and 1656, he revived the art of metal image making in Mongolia, through carved images of various Buddhist gods from bronze or copper. By the 1670s and 1680s, he and his workshop of apprentices at T√∂vkh√∂n Monastery were producing hundreds of artistic pieces used to populate the many monasteries and temples he founded and by extension were seen as vehicles to spread Buddhism beyond the confines of court circles to the lay masses. As his political influence grew, his artwork became a form of diplomacy, used in negotiations with the Dzungar leader Galdan Boshugtu Khan and to gain the favor of the Kangxi Emperor, paving the way for incorporation of outer Mongolia into Qing protectorate. 224x224px The vast majority of Zanabazar's artistic output came between his return from his first trip to Tibet in 1651 and the defeat of Khalkha armies by Dzungar Mongols in 1688. His greatest masterworks, including ‚ÄúVarajradhara‚Äù , Green Tara, White Tara 1685, Twenty One Taras, the Five Dhyani Buddhas, walking Maitreya and many others, were created in the mid 1680s at T√∂vkh√∂n Monastery, his retreat outside of Erdene Zuu, originally called Bayasgalant Aglag Oron (Happy Secluded Place), Zanabazar's works testify to his exceptional skill of depicting feminine beauty as well as his unique aesthetic vision of human physical perfection. His sculptures, portraying peaceful and contemplative female figures, are beautifully proportioned with facial features characterized by high foreheads, thin, arching eyebrows, high- bridged noses, and small, fleshy lips. Especially beautiful are the faces of Zanabazar's Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in deep meditation. Guided by desire to liberate the people from wrath, ignorance, lust, contempt and ill will ‚Äì the five vices giving rise to all sins. Zanabazar established unique features for Mongolian Buddhism including Tibetan influenced yet redesigned lama robes, reworked melodies for chanting, and modifications of traditional ceremonies either in the melodies or by the introduction of new prayer texts which he composed. In 1686 he designed the Soyombo script to facilitate cross translations between Mongolian, Tibetan, and Sanskrit. Today, the script is found mostly in historical texts and in religious and temple inscriptions. However, one special character of the script, the Soyombo symbol, later became a national symbol of Mongolia, and has appeared on the national flag since 1921, and on the Emblem of Mongolia since 1960, as well as money, stamps, etc.  Legacy  Zanabazar Museum Today, Zanabazar is viewed as one of Mongolia's most prominent historical figures, celebrated for propagating Tibetan Buddhism throughout Mongolia while reshaping it to fit Mongolian sensibilities, thereby establishing for the Mongols a unique cultural identity. His artistic works are generally regarded as the apogee of Mongolian aesthetic development and spawned a cultural renaissance among Mongols in the late 17th century. Even during the country's socialist era (1921-1991) he was acknowledged to be as a prominent scholar (his religious roles quietly discarded) and recognized for his artistic and cultural achievements. As a political personality, however, socialist authorities portrayed Zanabazar as a traitor and deceiver of the masses, responsible for the loss of Mongolian sovereignty to the Manchu. In the post socialist era, however, there has been a reevaluation of his image to where his actions in negotiating the Khalkha's submission to the Qing are considered to have been in the long term interests of Mongolia, and he is generally exonerated for his role in 1691. In 1965, the Zanabazar Museum of Fine Arts was established in Ulaanbaatar, containing the largest collection of his works. Zanabazar Buddhist University was founded in 1970 in Ulaanbaatar and a major street Undur Gegen Zanabazar (”®–Ω–¥”©—Ä –ì—ç–≥—ç—ç–Ω –ó–∞–Ω–∞–±–∞–∑–∞—Ä—ã–Ω –≥—É–¥–∞–º–∂) is located in the center of the capital.

It was the Adelaide home of Sir Edward \\"Bill\\" Hayward and his wife Lady Ursula (n√©e Barr-Smith), and contains a large collection of drawings, sculptures, antiques and paintings. Completed in 1939 and built in the style of an English manor, it is one of the few period homes in Australia to have survived with its grounds undiminished and most of its original contents intact. After being bequeathed to the state of South Australia upon Sir Edward's death in 1983, since 1985 it has been managed by the board of the Carrick Hill Trust, a statutory corporation which reports to the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. History The nearly 40-hectare property was the wedding gift of Ursula's father to the Haywards. After their marriage in 1935 the couple spent a year-long honeymoon in Europe. They bought many of the furnishings for their new home, including an imposing staircase, at the sale of Beaudesert House in Staffordshire, England. Construction of Carrick House began in 1937 and was completed in 1939. During this time Lady Ursula designed the gardens. The Haywards claimed a number of well-known artists as close friends, and some of their work features in the collection that fills the house. Ursula was an artist in her own right, and her work is also represented. Carrick Hill was bequeathed to the state on Sir Edward's death in 1983, his wife having predeceased him. The Carrick Hill Trust was established as a statutory body by the Carrick Hill Trust Act (1985), which reported to Arts SA (later Arts South Australia) from 1993 to 2018, when it started reporting directly to the Department of Premier and Cabinet. The artist David Dridan, a personal friend of the Haywards, was a member of the Carrick Hill Interim Committee, and founding member of the Carrick Hill Trust. 21st century use The house and grounds are open to the public for most of the year, closing in July for maintenance. An admission charge applies to the house, but not the gardens. Carrick Hill regularly houses themed art exhibitions. On 13 November 2005, it hosted a reunion picnic for former staff of John Martin's, which was for many years owned by the Hayward family. The event coincided with the opening of a social history exhibition entitled \\"Johnnies Spirit of a State\\" and was held on the weekend of the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, which was founded by Sir Edward. Carrick Hill has hosted exhibitions of works by notable Australian artists, built around the Hayward collection. Previous exhibitions have featured the work of William Dobell, Jeffrey Smart, Robert Hannaford and Adrian Feint. In 2018, Carrick Hill hosted an exhibition of May Gibbs' illustrations and other artists working with Australian botanical subjects. The Carrick Hill Trust has set up the Australian Museum of Gardening in the historic building which displays the influences over the art of gardening in the past 250 years. The collection includes more than thousand gardening tools.

It is an early low-budget \\"quota quickie\\". Plot In 1933, David Barr is the manager and chief designer of Glasgow shipbuilding firm Burns, McKinnon & Co. He comes up with a radical new ship design that can carry 25% more cargo for the tonnage and use less fuel at a time when the industry as a whole is in recession. Barr decides to build not just one ship, as Lord Dean advises, but twenty (to bring the costs down to a manageable level). Manning, a rival shipbuilder Barr loathes, hears rumors and sends two men undercover to find out what they can. They manage to get themselves hired. Manning then offers to purchase either the design or all the ships they can build. Both offers are rejected. With the support of June McKinnon, the chief shareholder, Barr proceeds, despite the opposition of Lord Dean and other members of the board. He receives a severe setback when the Government declines to give him a contract or pass a shipping bill, and is driven to use his own money to try to complete the ship. When he runs out and cannot secure a loan to cover the payroll, a rabble-rouser tries to stir up the men, but Barr convinces them to stick by him. June, having heard his rousing speech, offers to let him obtain a loan on the security of her trust fund. Manning's men knock out the night watchman and blow up the ship being built; a man named MacLeod is killed. Bassett, a reporter, informs Barr that MacLeod was third officer on one of Manning's ships. Now needing funds desperately, Barr forges Lord Dean's signature to obtain a loan when Dean, as a trustee of June's trust, refuses to cooperate (partly out of jealousy of Barr and June's developing relationship). Manning finds out and tries to blackmail Barr into selling the design, but Barr refuses to do so and is convicted of forgery. Later, however, Manning is sought for manslaughter, while Barr is present when June launches the first of the new ships, the SS David Barr.

Indeed the whole film is seen as a parallel with the struggles of a young bold film director, and a plea for a strong British film industry. The strong crusading tone of the film prefigures Powell's wartime propaganda films such as 49th Parallel and Contraband. A minor character is pointedly called 'Grierson' after the celebrated documentary maker John Grierson. This character is described as 'the best rivetter in the yard' who 'taught me [Barr] everything I know'. This scene is immediately followed with one of Barr firing a 'militant' worker intent on provoking industrial strife in the yard. DVD The film has been released on Region 1 DVD by MPI along with The Phantom Light (1934) and The Upturned Glass (1947). The film has been released on Region 2 DVD by Opening in the \\"Les films de ma vie\\" series. The DVD has fixed French subtitles for the original English soundtrack.

Political life Between 1956 and 1957 Lipski was an editor of the pro- reform weekly \\"Po prostu\\"; from 1957 to 1959 he was president of the Crooked Circle Club. In 1964 Lipski organized the Letter of the 34 (objecting the expansion of censorship in communist Poland). In 1975 he signed the Letter of 59 and in 1976 he co-funded the Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotnikow); as one of the most active members of this organization he organized help for the workers who protested in June 1976 against the government sponsored price increases in Radom and in Ursus district of Warsaw. In 1980, Lipski became a member of the Solidarity Union and was elected a delegate to the 1st Delegates' Rally to represent the Masovia Region (based in Warsaw).

The Slide Canyon, or Y Mountain Trail, leads to a large block Y located from a parking area at the mountain's base with an elevation gain of . This hillside letter was built over a hundred years ago as the insignia for BYU. For years the trail to the Y has been one of the most hiked trails in Utah Valley and provides a scenic view of Provo and Orem, the rest of the many cities in Utah Valley and Utah Lake. The trail is also regularly used by hikers, bikers, paragliders and hunters to access the backcountry in the Slide Canyon area. Y sign Hikers examining the Y The large white Y on the side of the mountain has become the nationally recognized insignia for BYU and the reason why BYU is often called \\"the Y\\". It is made of rock, with a concrete retaining wall made in 1908 and is 380 feet high and 130 feet wide (116 by 40 m). The Y is larger than the letters of the Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles. There used to be 14 strands of lights placed around the perimeter of the Y, which were lit five times a year by the Intercollegiate Knights. When the Y was lit, club members were selected to guard the Y to ensure the generator kept the lights on until nearly midnight. The same volunteer guards assisted the university grounds employees with setting up the lights (and removing them several days later) and remained on duty to protect against vandalism as long as the lights were in place. In 2016, the incandescent lights were replaced with LED lights that can be turned on or off from the campus below. The Y is lit for Freshman Orientation, Homecoming, Y Days, and graduation in April and August.  History  BYU campus with Y Mountain and Squaw Peak in the background Pre-1900s - One common LDS folktale is that the Native Americans told the LDS settlers that they had seen angels which told them that the people who lived in this area would be blessed with great prosperity. Early 1906 - When the junior class of Brigham Young High School (BYHS) wanted to paint '07 on the side of the mountain, the BYHS senior class became upset. To settle this conflict, BYU President George H. Brimhall and BYHS Principal Edwin S. Hinckley proposed that they paint the letters BYU on the mountain instead. April 1906 - The plans to construct the BYU on the mountain were begun. Professor Ernest D. Partridge was assigned to conduct a survey and designed the emblem. When this was complete, a line of high school and university students, and some faculty, passed buckets of lime, sand, and rocks up the mountain in order to fill up the letters. After six hours of hard labor, only the Y had been completed, so the filling in of the remaining two letters was postponed and later abandoned. 1907 - The BYU Y Day tradition began. This consisted of thousands of students hauling, by bucket brigade, gallons of whitewash up the mountain to paint the giant Y. This tradition lasted until 1973. It was abandoned due to the mountain eroding. 1908 - A wall was erected around the letter to keep it together. This required an additional 20,000 pounds of concrete. 1911 - Serifs were added to the top and bottom of the Y, giving it its current look. 1924 - The tradition of \\"lighting the Y\\" began. Each year during special evenings (such as homecoming), mattress batting was placed in buckets and soaked in kerosene. The buckets were then set around the edges of the Y and lit with torches. Eventually, this process evolved into using mattress batting soaked in used vehicle oil which was carried up the mountainside. Once at the Y the mixture was formed into \\"gook\\" balls (a little bigger than softballs) with a thumb size hole poked into the top. These were placed around the Y and just before lighting a bit of gasoline was poured into the holes to allow the torches to quickly light the entire Y. Using this method the Y would remain lit for about 20 minutes. 1975 - BYU began to use a helicopter to carry thousands of pounds of whitewash to repaint the Y. Repainting of the Y is accomplished about every 5 years. 1985 - As the previous method of lighting the Y was long considered hazardous (due to the potential wildland fire risk) and because of the brief amount of time the Y would actually remain lit, it was discontinued after the lighting in the spring of 1985. A generator and strands of lights were purchased for exclusive use on the Y, with up to 14 strands of the 25-watt lights bulbs being needed to outline the Y. These lights (first used for homecoming in the fall of 1985) provide several hours of much brighter light and allow the Y to be lit for several consecutive nights in celebration of each event rather than just a short while on a single evening. Initially, the lights and generator were dropped off and picked up by helicopter before and after each event, but after several years an old military ammunition bunker was installed on the mountainside near the Y to securely store the equipment when not in use. May 20, 2006 - The 100th anniversary of the Y was celebrated. Many people hiked the Y that day to commemorate the occasion. 2013 - Representative Jason Chaffetz sponsored a bill that was passed by Congress, allowing BYU to purchase the 80 acres surrounding the Y that was owned by the US Forest Service. The sale did require BYU to maintain public access to the trail and the land. 2016 - BYU officials announce the finalization of the purchase of 81 surrounding acres, renovation of erosion damage, installation of permanent lights and trail enhancements. Vandalism Like many college symbols, the Y has been the target of various pranks, many of them involving red paint, the principal color of BYU's archrival, the University of Utah. It was most recently painted red by members of the Utah baseball team in 2004. The cost of repair was reported to be over $6,000, and therefore, in accordance with laws of the state of Utah, the perpetrators were initially charged with second degree felonies. It has also been painted many other times, such as an incident in 2002, when vandals dumped several cans of paint down the Y, giving it a multicolored visage until it was painted white again the next day. This incident was called the worst act of vandalism against the Y in the past decade. Hiking the Y Hiking to the Y is a popular activity for BYU students and locals going for a walk or jog, or exercising their pets. Most BYU students end up hiking the 'Y' at least once during their time in school, either on a date or for one of the University's \\"Light the Y\\" events.

Frost* released their first studio album, Milliontown, in 2006, before splitting up. In 2008, Godfrey reformed Frost*, adding Darwin's Radio vocalist and guitarist, Declan Burke, to the lineup, and released their second album, Experiments in Mass Appeal. The band disbanded again in 2011, to reunite later in September, after a brief hiatus. Frost* released their long-awaited third studio album 'Falling Satellites' on 27 May 2016, to critical acclaim. The band are currently working on their fourth studio album. Band history =Formation (2004‚Äì2005)= Frost* was formed in September 2004, by songwriter, producer and musician Jem Godfrey - better known to the wider world for his work creating chart-topping pop hits for bands including Atomic Kitten - when he made a conscious decision to return to his own musical past writing and playing progressive music, in the band Freefall. After writing and recording material on his own for several months, and listening to a broad selection of contemporary progressive music, Godfrey first approached John Mitchell of Arena, The Urbane and Kino, (and currently lead guitarist and singer for It Bites). Mitchell then introduced Godfrey to John Jowitt (also of Arena, and additionally IQ and Jadis), subsequently leading to meeting Andy Edwards (ex Robert Plant and IQ). John Boyes, Godfrey's former band-mate in Freefall in the 1990s, and from the band Rook, had already performed significant rhythm guitar work on the early recordings. With the lineup in place, recording of the first album was completed during winter 2005. When asked in an interview why there is an asterisk next to the band name, Godfrey replied \\"That is a serving suggestion; if you get to put it on it means 'serve chilled'! or 'may contain nuts'!\\" =Milliontown (2006)= Frost*'s first album was named after the 26 minute long final track, Milliontown, inspired by the book The Apprentice by Gordon Houghton. The album was released in the United States on 18 July 2006 and in Europe on 24 July. The band went on a brief tour to play a selection from the album, supporting Pallas on a four date tour of the Netherlands and Germany in October 2006. =Dissolution, rebirth, Experiments In Mass Appeal (2006‚Äì2009)= Shortly after returning from the tour, Godfrey announced - by way of an article on the band's blog on MySpace on the 29th of the month (since removed), and reiterated by InsideOut in a bulletin on the same site two days later (expired) \\\\- that due to his increasing professional and personal commitments elsewhere, Frost* would be dissolved after fulfilling four remaining concert dates. It later emerged that an appearance at the RoSfest in 2007, in America - which was the final scheduled date - had been cancelled. The final appearance of Frost* for the time being, in support of their album Milliontown, was back-up for The Flower Kings at The Scala in Kings Cross, London, on 10 December 2006. However, in early 2007, Godfrey revived the band name and wrote in his blog about writing material for a second Frost* album. Following the band's reformation, Godfrey recruited Declan Burke of Darwin's Radio to contribute vocals and guitars on the follow- up album, Experiments in Mass Appeal which was released worldwide on 17 November 2008. Throughout 2008 Godfrey posted several videos on YouTube called \\"Frost* Reports,\\" under the user name Planetfrost. In between the recording in early 2008, Frost* supported Spock's Beard for a small tour. In November 2008, Andy Edwards announced that due to his new job as a college lecturer he would no longer play live with the band, although he might be involved in future recording work. In January 2009, Nick D'Virgilio of Spock's Beard was announced as guest drummer for Frost*'s performance in May at RoSfest 2009. In May 2009, John Jowitt announced his departure from the band. With gigs scheduled in support of Dream Theater, Jem announced bass duties would be handled by Level 42 guitarist Nathan King, with Andy Edwards briefly rejoining the band for these dates. On 29 May 2009, Jem announced via AudioBoo that a live Frost* album, recorded at RoSfest 2009, would be titled The Philadelphia Experiment. Excerpts from that performance were released as a limited edition EP, titled FrostFest Live CD, including a new song called \\"The Forget You Song\\", recorded at Godfrey's home studio The Cube in East Sussex. Subsequent to RoSfest, Dec Burke left the band. Jem Godfrey, John Mitchell and Nathan King performed some low key gigs as a drummerless trio before recruiting new drummer Craig Blundell. =The Dividing Line, \\"Indefinite\\" Hiatus (2010‚Äì2011)= On 2 February 2010, Jem announced via his blog that he had been invited to participate in the 10th anniversary party of The Dividing Line Broadcast Network, Vancouver, British Columbia's internet-based progressive rock radio station. Godfrey accepted, and, to thank them for their support of Frost*, tasked himself to write and record a new Frost* song, aptly titled, \\"The Dividing Line,\\" to be completed within the eight weeks then remaining until the party. Godfrey gathered not only fellow Frost* mates John Mitchell (It Bites), Andy Edwards, Dec Burke and Nathan King, but also enlisted the talents of Tara Busch, Mark \\"madfiddler\\" Knight, Lyndon Connah and original Frost* guitarist, John Boyes, for the one-off project. A special Frost* Report, Dividing Line edition, was posted on Godfrey's blog, as well as PlanetFrost*, the band's YouTube channel, providing a video chronicle of the song's status. Jem announced on 31 March on the Frost* forum that the track was completed and would be included as a bonus track on the 2-disc live album, The Philadelphia Experiment. \\"The Dividing Line\\" premiered during The Dividing Line's 10th anniversary broadcast on Saturday, 3 April 2010. Frost* played a small number of shows in the U.K. in December 2010. On 1 March 2011, Godfrey announced that he had put the band on indefinite hiatus. He stated that the main reasons for his decision were that he felt uncomfortable as the band leader, and that the increased workload from running the band was having a negative impact on his health. =Return of Frost*, third studio album Falling Satellites (2011‚Äì2018)= On 16 September 2011, Godfrey announced via his blog that Frost* would once again be returning for a third album, stating \\"As yet I have no idea of the form, shape, personnel or sound of this new album, but it will definitely be Frost* shaped. I'll once again be making Frost* reports available online during the process and it'll no doubt be a bloody madhouse throughout, but that's Frost*\\". The band performed a sold-out Christmas show at the House of Progression, Kingston upon Thames on 16 December 2011. On 12 May 2013, Frost* played at Celebr8.2 Prog Festival at the Hippodrome. In December 2013 Frost* released The Rockfield Files, a CD/DVD package documenting \\"live in studio\\" performances of older material plus then-new piece \\"Heartstrings\\", recorded at Rockfield Studios (Monmouth, Wales UK) in early January 2013. In May 2015, Godfrey announced on Facebook that a new Frost* album was in progress ‚Äì ‚ÄúNew album underway. JM, CB and NK all in. Release scheduled for ‚Äô16. Writing nearly complete. Recording in Autumn‚Äù. Writing was completed in late October 2015; recording began in December and was completed on February 17, 2016. On 17 January 2016, Godfrey announced the new album would be called ‚ÄòFalling Satellites‚Äô, and later announced a U.K. tour for June/July 2016 to promote the new album. The tour included an appearance on the Prog Stage at the 2016 Ramblin Man Fair, Mote Park, Maidstone, Kent, UK on Saturday 23 July 2016, playing a cut-down set of four songs. Falling Satellites was released on 27 May 2016. The band's first ever official music video (for the track 'Numbers') debuted shortly after on 31 May 2016. Additional dates were performed in 2017, including that year's \\"Cruise To The Edge\\" and an appearance at Dingwalls in London that was recorded for future video release (tentatively titled \\"Failing Satellite\\"). = Departure of Craig Blundell, Others EP and fourth studio album (2019‚Äìpresent) = Frost* once again performed on the 2019 Cruise To The Edge (with Nick D'Virgilio filling in for Craig Blundell), along with a small number of dates in Canada in March. On May 15, 2019, it was announced that drummer Craig Blundell had left the band due to scheduling conflicts caused by being entirely too successful. In July 2019, Godfrey announced that Frost* will release an EP titled Others, comprising six older, previously unfinished tracks recorded with either Andy Edwards or Craig Blundell on drums. In September 2019, the band shared three tracks from this forthcoming EP on Soundcloud, 'Exhibit A', 'Fathom' and ' Postcard'. The Others EP was released through InsideOut Music on June 5 2020. Starting 16 September 2019, Godfrey and John Mitchell spent a week in Cornwall working on material for the band's fourth studio album. \\"Podcasts\\" of the two conversing were recorded each evening at area pubs and uploaded on Soundcloud.

Plot summary  Colin Mudford, a twelve year old Australian, is sent to stay with his uncle and his aunt who live in London, while his brother is being treated for cancer. In England, Colin, along with his cousin Alistair, decides to meet the Queen by trying to break into Buckingham Palace, because he wants to ask her for good doctors. Both boys are caught by the police for attempting this, and taken home. He also tries to sneak into the best cancer hospital in London, and is again, kicked out. Outside the hospital, he meets a Welshman named Ted, who claims that his friend is also suffering from cancer. Ted offers to introduce Colin to one of England's leading cancer experts. The expert contacts Luke's doctors in Sydney and confirms that the cancer which Luke has is terminal. Colin then slashes tyres on cars, which were Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar and Audi, to get revenge on the doctors. Colin storms back to his Aunt Iris's house distraught, on where Alistair gives Colin the idea that a possible cure may be found in South America. Colin convinces Alistair to stow away with him on a cargo ship to South America the next day. However, when Colin admits that he slashed the tires of several doctors' cars and that Ted caught him, Alistair tells Colin that Ted could be blamed for this, so Colin delays their trip to South America, and visits Ted the next day. Colin visits Ted at his home, and finds that he has been badly injured. Ted tells him that he was attacked by people in the street who disliked him, because he is gay. He then confesses to Colin that his friend who is dying of cancer is actually his lover, Griff, who is dying of AIDS. Ted is unable to walk, so Colin promises to visit Griff for him. Colin goes to the hospital and meets Griff, bringing him a letter from Ted as well as Griff's favourite food, tangerines. After enjoying a conversation with Colin, Griff requests that he come to visit him again. After Griff is taken back to his ward by a nurse, Colin finds a spare wheelchair in the hospital which he takes back to Ted's house, because Ted can't walk. Colin then takes Ted to the hospital to see Griff using the wheelchair and the couple thanks Colin greatly for reuniting them. Several days later, after Ted has recovered, Colin goes to visit the couple in the hospital, but upon arrival, he learns that Griff has died. When Colin arrives home, Aunt Iris tells Colin that she found out everything from Alistair. They are both punished by receiving only cold baked beans for dinner, and the house is fortified against any escape attempts. Colin abandons his plans for traveling to South America and decides to accept Luke's fate. He asks Aunt Iris to let him go back to his family, but she forbids it. She tells him any attempt to escape will not help either, because they will not allow him on the plane with his return ticket, unless he is seen off by an adult guardian. The next morning, with much difficulty, Colin sneaks out of the house and meets Ted at the airport. Ted signs Colin's forms and they say their goodbyes and Ted leaves. Aunt Iris catches Colin trying to escape and conflict is created; Alistair has a rant, but Aunt Iris eventually sees reason and lets him go. They see him off, and Colin travels back to Sydney to see Luke. The story ends as Luke wakes up, happy to see Colin.  Characters  Colin Mudford: A twelve year old Australian boy determined to convince a cancer expert to treat his younger brother. He is fearless, friendly, and adventurous. Luke Mudford: Colin's eight year old brother suffering from terminal cancer. He is in Sydney for the entire novel, undergoing treatment. Alistair: Colin's shy thirteen year old English cousin. While Colin is in London, Alistair becomes involved with Colin's ambitious schemes to find a cure for Luke's cancer. Aunty Iris: Colin's aunt and Alistair's overbearing mother. She is friendly towards Colin, but is frightened that he is so open about Luke's cancer. And, she is sometimes so awkward towards him, about not talking to his brother cancer. The Queen: Elizabeth II is least bothered about Luke's illness, and doesn't respond to any of Colin's letters and requests. A liaison officer writes a letter to Colin on her behalf at the end of the book, which Colin leaves in an airplane's ashtray. Uncle Bob: Uncle Bob is Colin's grumpy uncle. He thinks lowly of the British Royal Family, as well as the City of London. He often joins in with his wife in telling their son, Alistair, what to do. Ted Caldicot: A gay Welshman. He listens to Colin about Luke as his partner, Griff, has a similar issue. Contrasted with the other adults in the book Ted is characterized as warm and open, especially about cancer. Griff Price: Ted's partner of six years being treated for AIDS related cancer in the hospital. His favourite food is tangerines.  Notability  Two Weeks with the Queen was published during a time of change in Australia, particularly economic and political change. When Treasurer Paul Keating announced the recession on 29 November ‚Äì the economic struggles of average families are described in the early chapters of the book, such as when Colin's parents cannot afford to buy him a Christmas gift that he wants, and instead give him something that he needs ‚Äì sensible school shoes, which go unappreciated. AIDS was a growing concern in Australia. Two Weeks with the Queen was published three years after the prominent \\"Grim Reaper\\" public service announcements. Although the novel presents a gay man with a partner dying of the disease, it humanises Ted and presents his plight as very real, significant, and similar to Colin's struggle with his brother's illness. The first hospital for sufferers of AIDS was opened by Princess Diana in July 1989, ‚Äì her hands on approach contrasting vastly, with the absence in the text of the Queen.  Themes  Gleitzman depicts the denial and anger that accompany grief, portraying Colin's egocentricity, spunk, and pain compassionately and without condescension. Neatly tied together by the incidents involving the Queen, this mixture of genuine emotion and humor makes for an engaging story that is said to have broad appeal.  Adaptation for theatre  The book was adapted for the stage by Mary Morris in April 1992, and premi√®red at the Sydney Festival in the same year. Directed by Wayne Harrison, it received praise from its first performances, and has since been shown throughout the world, including England, Canada, Japan, the United States, Cuba, and Portugal. Reception Two Weeks with the Queen won the Family Award in 1990. Todd Morning, reviewing the book for School Library Journal, describes Colin as \\"incredibly feisty and brave\\", and criticises the book's \\"breakneck\\" pace, stating that this made it difficult to get to know Colin. Reviewers for the School Library Journal described Gleitzman's pacing in the audiobook as \\"wonderful\\", showing Colin's growing maturity.Mandell, Phyllis Levy, and B. Allison Gray. \\"Two Weeks With The Queen\\". School Library Journal 53.3 (2007): 84. 14 February 2015. Stephens regards Two Weeks with the Queen as being unusual in contemporary Australian children's literature because Colin is presented as having agency ‚Äì he is capable of making decisions and taking action to change the world around him ‚Äì even though he does not do so in the way he first intended.Stephens, J. (2003). Editor's introduction: \\"Always facing the issues ‚Äì preoccupations in Australian children's literature.\\" The Lion and the Unicorn, 27(2), 13. Retrieved from here Maya Sen, writing for The Canberra Times, praises Colin's determination and character development, and enjoyed the book's humour and direct treatment of its themes. When the play was performed in the United Kingdom, according to Gleitzman, the Australian Republican themes of the play proved controversial.

There is no concrete definition of graph pseudorandomness, but there are many reasonable characterizations of pseudorandomness one can consider. Pseudorandom properties were first formally considered by Andrew Thomason in 1987. He defined a condition called \\"jumbledness\\": a graph G=(V,E) is said to be (p,\\\\alpha)-jumbled for real p and \\\\alpha with 0 if :\\\\lefte(U)-p\\\\binom{U}{2}\\\\right\\\\leq \\\\alphaU for every subset U of the vertex set V, where e(U) is the number of edges among U (equivalently, the number of edges in the subgraph induced by the vertex set U). It can be shown that the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi random graph G(n,p) is almost surely (p,O(\\\\sqrt{np}))-jumbled. However, graphs with less uniformly distributed edges, for example a graph on 2n vertices consisting of an n-vertex complete graph and n completely independent vertices, are not (p,\\\\alpha)-jumbled for any small \\\\alpha, making jumbledness a reasonable quantifier for \\"random-like\\" properties of a graph's edge distribution.  Connection to local conditions  Thomason showed that the \\"jumbled\\" condition is implied by a simpler-to- check condition, only depending on the codegree of two vertices and not every subset of the vertex set of the graph. Letting \\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v) be the number of common neighbors of two vertices u and v, Thomason showed that, given a graph G on n vertices with minimum degree np, if \\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)\\\\leq np^2+\\\\ell for every u and v, then G is \\\\left( p,\\\\sqrt{(p+\\\\ell)n}\\\\,\\\\right) -jumbled. This result shows how to check the jumbledness condition algorithmically in polynomial time in the number of vertices, and can be used to show pseudorandomness of specific graphs. Chung‚ÄìGraham‚ÄìWilson theorem In the spirit of the conditions considered by Thomason and their alternately global and local nature, several weaker conditions were considered by Chung, Graham, and Wilson in 1989: a graph G on n vertices with edge density p and some \\\\varepsilon>0 can satisfy each of these conditions if * Discrepancy: for any subsets X,Y of the vertex set V=V(G), the number of edges between X and Y is within \\\\varepsilon n^2 of pXY. * Discrepancy on individual sets: for any subset X of V, the number of edges among X is within \\\\varepsilon n^2 of p\\\\binom{X}{2}. * Subgraph counting: for every graph H, the number of labeled copies of H among the subgraphs of G is within \\\\varepsilon n^{v(H)} of p^{e(H)}n^{v(H)}. * 4-cycle counting: the number of labeled 4-cycles among the subgraphs of G is within \\\\varepsilon n^4 of p^4n^4. * Codegree: letting \\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v) be the number of common neighbors of two vertices u and v, :\\\\sum_{u,v\\\\in V}\\\\big\\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)-p^2 n\\\\big\\\\leq \\\\varepsilon n^3. * Eigenvalue bounding: If \\\\lambda_1\\\\geq \\\\lambda_2\\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\geq \\\\lambda_n are the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of G, then \\\\lambda_1 is within \\\\varepsilon n of pn and \\\\max\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\lambda_2\\\\right,\\\\left\\\\lambda_n\\\\right\\\\right)\\\\leq \\\\varepsilon n. These conditions may all be stated in terms of a sequence of graphs \\\\\\\\{G_n\\\\\\\\} where G_n is on n vertices with (p+o(1))\\\\binom{n}{2} edges. For example, the 4-cycle counting condition becomes that the number of copies of any graph H in G_n is \\\\left(p^{e(H)}+o(1)\\\\right)e^{v(H)} as n\\\\to\\\\infty, and the discrepancy condition becomes that \\\\lefte(X,Y)-pXY\\\\right=o(n^2), using little-o notation. A pivotal result about graph pseudorandomness is the Chung‚ÄìGraham‚ÄìWilson theorem, which states that many of the above conditions are equivalent, up to polynomial changes in \\\\varepsilon. It is considered particularly surprising that the weak condition of having the \\"correct\\" 4-cycle density implies the other seemingly much stronger pseudorandomness conditions. Some implications in the Chung‚ÄìGraham‚ÄìWilson theorem are clear by the definitions of the conditions: the discrepancy on individual sets condition is simply the special case of the discrepancy condition for Y=X, and 4-cycle counting is a special case of subgraph counting. In addition, the graph counting lemma, a straightforward generalization of the triangle counting lemma, implies that the discrepancy condition implies subgraph counting. The fact that 4-cycle counting implies the codegree condition can be proven by a technique similar to the second-moment method. Firstly, the sum of codegrees can be upper-bounded: :\\\\sum_{u,v\\\\in G} \\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in G} \\\\deg(x)^2\\\\ge n\\\\left(\\\\frac{2e(G)}{n}\\\\right)^2=\\\\left(p^2+o(1)\\\\right)n^3. Given 4-cycles, the sum of squares of codegrees is bounded: : \\\\sum_{u,v} \\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)^2=\\\\text{Number of labeled copies of }C_4 + o(n^4)\\\\le \\\\left(p^4+o(1)\\\\right)n^4. Therefore, the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality gives :\\\\sum_{u,v\\\\in G}\\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)-p^2n\\\\le n\\\\left(\\\\sum_{u,v\\\\in G} \\\\left(\\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)-p^2n\\\\right)^2\\\\right)^{1/2}, which can be expanded out using our bounds on the first and second moments of \\\\operatorname{codeg} to give the desired bound. A proof that the codegree condition implies the discrepancy condition can be done by a similar, albeit trickier, computation involving the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality. The eigenvalue condition and the 4-cycle condition can be related by noting that the number of labeled 4-cycles in G is, up to o(1) stemming from degenerate 4-cycles, \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left(A_G^4\\\\right), where A_G is the adjacency matrix of G. The two conditions can then be shown to be equivalent by invocation of the Courant‚ÄìFischer theorem. Connections to graph regularity The concept of graphs that act like random graphs connects strongly to the concept of graph regularity used in the Szemer√©di regularity lemma. For \\\\varepsilon>0, a pair of vertex sets X,Y is called \\\\varepsilon-regular, if for all subsets A\\\\subset X,B\\\\subset Y satisfying A\\\\geq\\\\varepsilonX,B\\\\geq\\\\varepsilonY, it holds that :\\\\left d(X,Y) - d(A,B) \\\\right \\\\le \\\\varepsilon, where d(X,Y) denotes the edge density between X and Y: the number of edges between X and Y divided by XY. This condition implies a bipartite analogue of the discrepancy condition, and essentially states that the edges between A and B behave in a \\"random-like\\" fashion. In addition, it was shown by Mikl√≥s Simonovits and Vera T. S√≥s in 1991 that a graph satisfies the above weak pseudorandomness conditions used in the Chung‚ÄìGraham‚ÄìWilson theorem if and only if it possesses a Szemer√©di partition where nearly all densities are close to the edge density of the whole graph. Sparse pseudorandomness =Chung‚ÄìGraham‚ÄìWilson theorem analogues= The Chung‚ÄìGraham‚ÄìWilson theorem, specifically the implication of subgraph counting from discrepancy, does not follow for sequences of graphs with edge density approaching 0, or, for example, the common case of d-regular graphs on n vertices as n\\\\to\\\\infty. The following sparse analogues of the discrepancy and eigenvalue bounding conditions are commonly considered: * Sparse discrepancy: for any subsets X,Y of the vertex set V=V(G), the number of edges between X and Y is within \\\\varepsilon dn of \\\\frac{d}{n}XY. * Sparse eigenvalue bounding: If \\\\lambda_1\\\\geq \\\\lambda_2\\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\geq \\\\lambda_n are the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of G, then \\\\max\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\lambda_2\\\\right,\\\\left\\\\lambda_n\\\\right\\\\right)\\\\leq \\\\varepsilon d. It is generally true that this eigenvalue condition implies the corresponding discrepancy condition, but the reverse is not true: the disjoint union of a random large d-regular graph and a d+1-vertex complete graph has two eigenvalues of exactly d but is likely to satisfy the discrepancy property. However, as proven by David Conlon and Yufei Zhao in 2017, slight variants of the discrepancy and eigenvalue conditions for d-regular Cayley graphs are equivalent up to linear scaling in \\\\varepsilon. One direction of this follows from the expander mixing lemma, while the other requires the assumption that the graph is a Cayley graph and uses the Grothendieck inequality. =Consequences of eigenvalue bounding= A d-regular graph G on n vertices is called an (n,d,\\\\lambda)-graph if, letting the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of G be d=\\\\lambda_1\\\\geq \\\\lambda_2\\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\geq \\\\lambda_n, \\\\max\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\lambda_2\\\\right,\\\\left\\\\lambda_n\\\\right\\\\right)\\\\leq \\\\lambda. The Alon-Boppana bound gives that \\\\max\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\lambda_2\\\\right,\\\\left\\\\lambda_n\\\\right\\\\right)\\\\geq 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}-o(1) (where the o(1) term is as n\\\\to\\\\infty), and Joel Friedman proved that a random d-regular graph on n vertices is (n,d,\\\\lambda) for \\\\lambda=2\\\\sqrt{d-1}+o(1). In this sense, how much \\\\lambda exceeds 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} is a general measure of the non-randomness of a graph. There are graphs with \\\\lambda\\\\leq 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}, which are termed Ramanujan graphs. They have been studied extensively and there are a number of open problems relating to their existence and commonness. Given an (n,d,\\\\lambda) graph for small \\\\lambda, many standard graph-theoretic quantities can be bounded to near what one would expect from a random graph. In particular, the size of \\\\lambda has a direct effect on subset edge density discrepancies via the expander mixing lemma. Other examples are as follows, letting G be an (n,d,\\\\lambda) graph: * If d\\\\leq \\\\frac{n}{2}, the vertex-connectivity \\\\kappa(G) of G satisfies \\\\kappa(G)\\\\geq d-\\\\frac{36\\\\lambda^2}{d}. * If \\\\lambda\\\\leq d-2, G is d edge-connected. If n is even, G contains a perfect matching. * The maximum cut of G is at most \\\\frac{n(d+\\\\lambda)}{4}. * The largest independent subset of a subset U\\\\subset V(G) in G is of size at least \\\\frac{n}{2(d-\\\\lambda)}\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{U(d-\\\\lambda)}{n(\\\\lambda+1)}+1\\\\right). * The chromatic number of G is at most \\\\frac{6(d-\\\\lambda)}{\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{d+1}{\\\\lambda+1}\\\\right)}. =Connections to the Green‚ÄìTao theorem= Pseudorandom graphs factor prominently in the proof of the Green‚ÄìTao theorem. The theorem is proven by transferring Szemer√©di's theorem, the statement that a set of positive integers with positive natural density contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, to the sparse setting (as the primes have natural density 0 in the integers). The transference to sparse sets requires that the sets behave pseudorandomly, in the sense that corresponding graphs and hypergraphs have the correct subgraph densities for some fixed set of small (hyper)subgraphs. It is then shown that a suitable superset of the prime numbers, called pseudoprimes, in which the primes are dense obeys these pseudorandomness conditions, completing the proof.

Nyanaponika Thera (Siegmund Feniger) was born in Hanau, Germany on July 21, 1901 as Siegmund Feniger, the only child of a Jewish family. In 1921, he moved with his parents to Berlin, where he met with German Buddhists and also had access to Buddhist literature in the German language. He first came across the writings of Ven. Nyanatiloka Mahathera (1878‚Äì1957), the former German violin virtuoso Anton Gueth, which had already been published in Germany. Young Siegmund had learned that Ven. Nyanatiloka Thera had established a monastery for Western monks in Sri Lanka, on an island lagoon (opposite the Railway station) Polgasduwa, Dodanduwa named Island Hermitage. This news stirred his conscience to go to Asia and become a Buddhist monk. However, circumstances prevented him from acting on this plan for quite some time. In 1932 his father died, and he did not wish to leave his widowed mother in the lurch. Then, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. In November 1935 he and his mother left Germany and moved to Vienna, where they had relatives. Having arranged for his mother to stay in Vienna, in early 1936 he finally was able to leave Europe for Sri Lanka, where he joined Ven. Nyanatiloka Thera at the Island Hermitage. After several months of studies, in June 1936 he was ordained as a novice and was given the name Nyanaponika. In 1937 he received UpasampadƒÅ (Higher Ordination) under the tutelage of Nyanatiloka Mahathera. In 1939, after the Nazis invaded Poland, Ven. Nyanaponika Thera arranged for his mother and other relatives to move to Sri Lanka. Through the influence of her son and the generous hosts, she embraced Buddha Dhamma and became a devoted Buddhist. She died in Colombo in 1956. When World War II broke out in 1939, the British Government had all German males resident in their colonies consigned to internment camps, suspecting them to be German spies. Nyanaponika's and Nyanatiloka's internment was first at Diyatalawa Army Cantonment in Sri Lanka, and later at Dehra Dun in northern India. Despite these traumatic experiences as a prisoner of war, during this period Ven. Nyanaponika Thera completed German translations of the Sutta Nipata, the Dhammasangani (the first book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka), and its commentary. He also compiled an anthology of texts on Satipatthana Meditation. This work was begun at Diyatalawa, and it was finished while he was interned at Dehra Dun. With the cessation of war, the two bhikkhus were released from internment at Dehra Dun. They returned to Sri Lanka in 1946 and resided at the Island Hermitage, Dodanduwa. In early 1951 Sri Lanka granted citizenship to both of them. In 1946, Ven. Nyanatiloka Mahathera was offered a hermitage in the Udawattekelle Forest Reserve, but being advanced in age he preferred the cooler climate of Kandy to the hot and stuffy sea-coast climate of Dodanduwa. In 1947, Ven. Nyanaponika Thera joined him at the new Kandy Hermitage. In 1952, both Venerable Nyanatiloka Mahathera and Nyanaponika Thera were invited by the Burmese (Myanmar) Government to be consultants to the Sixth Buddhist Council, to be convened in 1954 to re-edit and reprint the entire Pali Canon and its commentaries. After their work with the Council was completed, Ven. Nyanaponika Thera stayed in Burma for a period of training in VipassanƒÅ (Insight Meditation) under the renowned meditation teacher Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw Thera. The experience he gathered motivated him to write his best-known work, The Heart of Buddhist Meditation, published by the Buddhist Publication Society. This work was reprinted in many editions, and was translated into more than seven languages. In 1954, the teacher and the pupil returned to Burma for the opening ceremonies of the Sixth Buddhist Council, which was held in a cave-like structure built similar to the Sattaprani Caves in Rajagaha (Rajgir), India, where the First Buddhist Council had been held. For the closing ceremonies in 1956 Ven. Nyanaponika Thera went to Burma alone, as his teacher Nyanatiloka Mahathera was indisposed at that time. In 1957, the health of Ven. Nyanatiloka Mahathera deteriorated, and he moved to Colombo for easy and ready medical attention. Finally, on May 28, 1957, the great pioneering scholar monk died, and he was accorded a State Funeral at Independence Square, Colombo, attended by the Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, many State officials, and both the laity and religious dignitaries and prelates of all Nikayas. His ashes were enshrined at the Polgasduwa Island Hermitage, Dodanduwa, and a tombstone was built to perpetuate his memory. Ven. Nyanaponika Thera, thereafter dutifully honoring the request of his teacher, revised Ven. Nyanatiloka Mahathera's German translation of the complete Anguttara Nikaya, retyping the five volumes in full by himself, and also compiling a forty-page Index to the work. Six months after the death of his teacher, the career of Ven. Nyanaponika Thera was to be launched in a new direction, a permanent contribution to the spread of Buddhism worldwide. A.S. Karunaratne (a prominent lawyer in Kandy, who was Mayor of Kandy in 1945) suggested to his friend Richard Abeysekera (d. August 1982) (Trinity College teacher in retirement), that they start a society for the publication of Buddhist literature in English, mainly to be distributed abroad. The unanimous decision was that Ven. Nyanaponika Thera, in the Udawattekelle Forest Reserve Aramaya, would be the best director of the institution. Thus, on January 1, 1958, the Buddhist Publication Society (BPS) was born. Devoting his entire time and energy to the publications of the BPS, Nyanaponika Thera wrote tracts, encouraged others to write, collated and translated important suttas, and had them published. In addition to his own writings, 200 Wheel titles and 100 Bodhi Leaves (booklets) - authored by numerous scholars - were issued during his editorship at the BPS. Ven. Nyanaponika Thera's biography is completely submerged in his writings. With advancing age having a heavy toll on his strength, in 1984 Ven. Nyanaponika Thera retired as editor of BPS, and in 1988 he retired as President, ending his career there with recognition as a Distinguished Patron of BPS. His fame as an exponent of authentic Theravada Buddhism reached all corners of the globe. In 1978, the German Oriental Society appointed him an honorary member, in recognition of his combination of objective scholarship with religious practice as a Buddhist monk. In 1987, the Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka at its first convocation, conferred on him its first ever Honoris Causa Degree of Doctor of Literature. In 1990, he received the Honoris Causa Degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Peradeniya. In 1993, The Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha, to which he belonged for 56 years, conferred on him the honorary title of Amarapura Maha Mahopadhyaya Sasana Sobhana (The Great Mentor of the Amarapura Maha Sasana Sabha, Ornament of Teaching). His last birthday (which fell on July 21, 1994) was celebrated by his friends and the BPS staff with the release of the BPS edition of his book The Vision of Dhamma, a collection of his writings from the Wheel and Bodhi Leaves series. On October 19, 1994, the last day of his 58th Rains Retreat as a bhikkhu, he breathed his last in the pre-dawn quietude of the Udawattekelle forest hermitage.

He was shot dead by the British Army in 1984 whilst engaged in an attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Background Mac Giolla Bhrighde was the eldest son of Frank and Nora MacBride. He had two sisters, Marie and Patricia and three brothers, Damian, Lughaidh and Oist√≠n. The MacBride family moved from their South Londonderry home to the Knock Road, Belfast, in 1964. It was then that Mac Giolla Bhrighde was introduced to physical force republicanism by his maternal grandmother, also called Nora, who was involved in the Irish War of Independence in the 1920s. The MacBride family later moved to Killowen Street, which is located in a predominantly loyalist area of east Belfast. The family home was subjected to a number of attacks from loyalists. The attacks came in the form of window breaking and an attempted bombing but culminated in 1972 with the shooting of Mac Giolla Bhrighde and his father Frank. In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen called to the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was carrying a baby at the time, went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening the door by stating that they were looking for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow hallway to see who was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later. Irish Army Immediately after the shooting the family moved to Newtownards, County Down, and in the mid-1970s Mac Giolla Bhrighde left Northern Ireland to join the Irish Army in the Republic of Ireland. The McBride family then moved again, this time returning to their native County Londonderry. Mac Giolla Bhrighde served in the Irish Army for less than a year before being court-martialed for desertion and was dishonourably discharged. Paramilitary activities After dismissal from the Irish Army, Mac Giolla Bhrighde joined the South Derry Brigade of the IRA, and was active in rural areas of County Londonderry. In 1979 he was stopped by Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers near Magherafelt while in possession of a rifle, and was detained at Strabane police station, being subsequently imprisoned for three years. He was noted for his hard line militarism in the early 1980s, and supported a strategy of forming full-time IRA guerrilla units or flying columns based in the Republic, which would carry out four or five large-scale attacks across the border into Northern Ireland a year, retreating back across the border into the Republic of Ireland after each attack, to deny British Forces the chance for fully engaging them. This strategy was espoused by the militant Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade led by Padraig McKearney and Jim Lynagh, who wanted an escalation of the conflict to what they termed total war. They were opposed by Kevin McKenna, the IRA Chief of Staff, and by the republican leadership based around Gerry Adams, on the grounds that actions of that scale were too big a risk and unsustainable. The IRA leadership wanted a smaller scale campaign of attrition, supplemented by political campaigning by Sinn F√©in. =Norwegian link= After his release from prison Mac Giolla Bhrighde, who had made a number of friends and contacts in Norway, became involved in providing information for the Irish republican cause throughout Scandinavia. Kesh ambush and death After returning from a trip to Norway, in the early hours of Sunday morning on 2 December 1984 Mac Giolla Bhrighde and Ciaran Fleming stole a Toyota van in Pettigo, County Donegal, in the Republic of Ireland. The van was then loaded with 9 beer kegs, each containing 100 lbs of low explosives, which they drove across the border into Northern Ireland to Kesh, a village in the north of County Fermanagh. At the Drumrush Lodge Restaurant, just outside Kesh, they planted a landmine in a lane leading to the restaurant and wired up a device which was connected to an observation point. Having set this ambush, a hoax call was made to the Royal Ulster Constabulary to lure the British Army to the restaurant on the pretence that there was a firebomb planted within it. After a while Mac Giolla Bhrighde saw an Royal Ulster Constabulary police vehicle approaching the restaurant, and gave the detonation code word \\"one\\", however, on switching the electric trigger the mine failed to detonate. There was another car parked in the car park which Mac Giolla Bhrighde believed contained civilians, and he left the stolen van from which he was observing to warn them to leave the area. =Conflicting accounts of his death= According to the republican sources, when he approached the car two Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers got out and ordered him to halt and drop his gun. Mac Giolla Bhrighde, who was unarmed, informed the SAS of this and then one of the SAS men stepped forward and shot him on his left side. After which he was then handcuffed and shot dead. However, according to CAIN, there was a gun battle at the scene of the attempted bombing between a number of IRA men and British troops, in which Mac Giolla Bhrighde was killed in the exchange of fire. A British Army soldier, Sergeant Al Slater, of the Special Air Service was killed in the fire-fight. Charles \\"Nish\\" Bruce served with Al Slater on this operation. His autobiography, Freefall, under the pseudonym Tom Read, accounts in detail the exchange of fire and the respective deaths of both Slater and Mac Giolla Bhrighde.Tom Read, Freefall, Pages 158‚Äì166 (Little Brown, Edition 1, 1998). . Mac Giolla Bhrighde's companion Ciar√°n Fleming drowned in the swollen Bannagh River as he fled the scene attempting to escape Crown forces pursuit.The SAS in Ireland, p. 276. The British Army officially listed Slater as a member of the Parachute Regiment, however, an obituary appeared in the SAS magazine, Mars & Minerva, stating that Slater was a member of 7 Troop (Free Fall) 'B' Squadron of the SAS.Mars & Minerva, Special Air Service Regimental Journal Magazine, Issue 7, Volume 2 1995 Memorial In 2002 a controversy occurred when a memorial to Mac Giolla Bhrighde, Fleming and Joe MacManus was sited close to the place where Protestant workmen William Hassard and Frederick Love were killed by the IRA in 1988.

Armen Karo was a leading member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation for more than two decades. He was one of the masterminds of the 1896 occupation of the Ottoman Bank in response to the Hamidian massacres and Operation Nemesis, in which several perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide were assassinated. Between 1918 and 1920 he served as the first ambassador to the United States from the First Republic of Armenia. Biography =Early life= Armen Garo in his youth Karekin Pastermadjian was born in Karin (present day Erzurum Province). He finished his elementary education as one of the first graduates of the Sanasarian College of Erzerum (Sanasarian Varjaran Academy) in 1891. Later in 1894, he continued his studies in France to study agriculture at the Agricultural School of Nancy-Universit√©. During this period he was introduced to Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) and become younger generation of Armenian students of ARF in Europe. =1895 Zeitun Resistance= His plans to return to his hometown after graduating came to a halt when massacres and conflict began in Zeitun. He left his studies to aid his compatriots in Zeitun. He soon found himself in Geneva, where he became an activist alongside his friends. He was sent to Egypt to assist the Zeitun Resistance. With Sarkis Srentz, Haig Tiriakian (who assumed the name Hratch), and Max Zevrouz, he left Egypt and returned to the Ottoman Empire to participate in the efforts of the ARF. It was around this time that Karekin Pastermadjian first assumed the name Armen Garo. = Ottoman Bank Takeover = The 1896 Ottoman Bank Takeover, executed on 26 August 1896, was his and Papken Siuni's brainchild. The attack took place at about 1 p.m. Armen Garo entered 10 minutes prior to the attack. He was to keep the teller busy and the bank officers from escaping. His men didn't arrive quickly so he went to a coffee shop across the street. When he saw the men through the doorway, he ran out to meet them. During the long and bloody battle, the group leader, Papken Siuni, was killed. Armen Garo took over as leader, ordering his group for much of the standoff. = Graduate studies, 1897-1900 = The Fedayee's in Marseille France, after the Ottoman Bank takeover After these events, Karekin Pastermadjian returned to Europe to continue his unfinished studies. French Foreign Minister Gabriel Hanotaux declared the Armenians who had been connected with the Ottoman Bank Takeover as persona non grata and denied their stay in France. Armen Garo transferred to Switzerland and studied natural sciences at the University of Geneva. During his studies, he continued his activities with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. He was on the delegate roster of the second ARF general conference in 1898, representing the party committee in Egypt. Despite his youth, he had gained trust and authority in the leading circles of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. In 1900 he completed his courses at the University of Geneva and received a doctoral degree in physical chemistry. In 1901 he founded a lab in Tiflis for chemical research. =Armenian-Tatar massacres, 1905-1907= During the Armenian‚ÄìTatar massacres of 1905‚Äì1907 the ARF was involved in armed activities.Tadeusz Swietochowski. Russian Azerbaijan, 1905‚Äì1920. The Shaping of a National Identity in a Muslim Community. Cambridge, cambridge University Press, 1985. —Ä.41 Pastermadjian organized the self-defense of the Armenians in Tiflis. He and five hundred volunteers succeeded in securing peace in the capital of Transcaucasia. =Deputy from Erzurum 1908-1912= The situation in the Caucasus came back almost to normal. Pastermadjian was able to create a fairly prosperous life for himself. He secured the right to develop a copper mine, and worked towards a partnership with a large company. His business required that he should stay in the Caucasus to continue his successful enterprise. When the Young Turk Revolution occurred in 1908, the Armenians in Erzeroum, as well as the ARF, telegraphed Pastermadjian and asked him to become their candidate in the coming elections for Representative to the Ottoman Parliament. He became a member of the Ottoman parliament part from the Armenian Revolutionary Federation deputies. After the end of the Balkan Wars, issues affecting the Armenians dominated mainstream politics during which Armen Karo was a deputy from Erzurum. During his four years in Constantinople (Istanbul) as a deputy, he worked for the railroad bill which was known to the public as Chester's bill. Its main objective was to build railroads as soon as possible in those vilayets which were considered to be Russia's future possessions. For that reason neither France nor Germany wished to undertake it, lest they should arouse the enmity of Russia. Another fundamental object was to build those lines with American capital, which would make it possible to counteract the Russo-Franco-German policies and financial intrigues. But in spite of all efforts unable to overcome the German, opposition in Constantinople, although, as the outcome of the struggle in connection with that bill, two ministers of public works were forced to resign their post. Talaat, on behalf of the \\"Committee of Union and Progress\\", offered the portfolio of public works, refused these proposals, for the simple reason that he did not wish to compromise in any way with the leaders of the government. He had taken too active a part in 1913 in the conferences held for the consideration of the Armenian reforms, and especially because, while parliamentary elections were going on during April, 1914, he was in Paris and the Netherlands, as the delegate of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, to meet the inspectors general who were invited to carry out the reforms. =World War I= The staff of Armenian volunteers of the 2nd Battalion in November 1914. Khetcho, Drastamat Kanayan, and Karekin Pastermadjian are among those pictured In the autumn of 1914, a month and a half before the beginning hostilities, Armen Garo went to the Caucasus on a special mission given after the Armenian congress at Erzurum, and joined the committee which had been appointed by the Armenian National Council of the Caucasus to organize the Armenian volunteer units. In November 1914, he accompanied the second battalion of the Armenian volunteers as the representative of the executive committee of Tiflis. Ambassador Armen Garo with the United States ambassador On 14 November, at the Bergmann Offensive, the second battalion of the Armenian volunteers engaged in battle for the first time, near Bayazid. In the course of a bloody combat which lasted twenty-four hours, Dro, the commander of the battalion, was seriously wounded, and Armen Garo was forced immediately to take his place. From that day to March of the following year, he remained at the head of that battalion, and led it into eleven battles in the neighborhood of Alashkert, Toutakh, and Malashkert, until Dro recovered and returned to resume the command. In the summer of 1915, he went to Van during Defense of Van, becoming one of the first to enter the city after the Russians had liberated it. Khetcho (Catchik), his assistant, died on the shores of Lake Van in July 1915. In the spring of 1917, when the Russian Revolution turned the Caucasus upside down, Armen Garo and Dr. Hakob Zavriev were sent from the Caucasus to Petrograd to negotiate with the Russian provisional government concerning Caucasian affairs. He left for America in June 1917 as the representative of the Armenian National Council of Tiflis. He was elected to be ambassador of the First Republic of Armenia to the United States in Washington, D.C. Armen Garo during the last years of his life  Death and legacy  When the 1915 Armenian Genocide broke out, Armen Garo became very depressed and sick. When Armenia lost its independence, his sickness grew worse. He died of heart disease in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 March 1923, where he was attending a conference on Russia.Time Saturday, April 7, 1923 He is regarded as a national hero by Armenians, especially ARF supporters due to his numerous efforts in helping his people. There are several organizations with chapters named after him, including the Armenian Youth Federation \\"Armen Garo\\" Chapter of Racine, Wisconsin, and the \\"Armen Karo\\" Armenian Revolutionary Federation Student Association of Canada.

The ship was transferred to the Pacific Squadron upon completion and based at Port Arthur from 1903. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, she participated in the Battle of Port Arthur and was seriously damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and again in the Siege of Port Arthur. The ship was scuttled before the Russians surrendered, then salvaged by the Japanese and placed into service with the name . Partially rearmed, Sagami was reclassified by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) as a coastal defense ship in 1912. In 1916, the Japanese sold her to the Russians, their allies since the beginning of World War I. En route to the White Sea in early 1917, she sank off Port Said, Egypt, after striking mines laid by a German submarine. Design and description The design of the Peresvet class was inspired by the British second-class battleships of the . The British ships were intended to defeat commerce- raiding armored cruisers like the Russian ships and , and the Peresvet class was designed to support their armored cruisers. This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor.McLaughlin 2003, p. 108 Peresvet was long overall, and had a beam of and a draft of . Designed to displace , she was almost overweight and displaced . Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three vertical triple-expansion steam engines using steam generated by 30 Belleville boilers. The engines were rated at and designed to reach a top speed of . Peresvet, however, reached a top speed of from during her sea trials in November 1899. She carried a maximum of of coal, which allowed her to steam for at a speed of .McLaughlin 2003, pp. 107‚Äì108, 114 The ship's main battery consisted of four guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The secondary armament consisted of eleven Canet quick-firing (QF) guns, mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and in the bow, underneath the forecastle. Several smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included twenty QF guns, twenty Hotchkiss guns and eight guns. She was also armed with five torpedo tubes, three above water and two submerged. The ship carried 45 mines to be used to protect her anchorage. Peresvets waterline armor belt consisted of Harvey armor and was thick. The Krupp cemented armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of nine inches and her deck ranged from in thickness.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 107‚Äì108, 112‚Äì114 Construction and career Peresvet was named after Alexander Peresvet, a Russian Orthodox monk who fought and died at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, against a Mongolian army. Her keel was laid down on 21 November 1895 by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg and she launched on 19 May 1898.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 107, 115 She was not completed, however, until July 1901,Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 182 at the cost of 10,540,000 rubles.McLaughlin 2003, p. 112 Peresvet entered service in August,McLaughlin 2008, p. 45 and was sent to Port Arthur in October 1901. En route, she ran aground on the tip of Langeland Island while passing through the Danish Great Belt on 1 November, but was apparently not seriously damaged. Upon arrival she was assigned to the Pacific Squadron and became the flagship of the squadron's second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky.McLaughlin 2003, p. 115 =Battle of Port Arthur= After the Japanese victory in the First Sino- Japanese War of 1894‚Äì95, tensions had arisen between Russia and Japan over their ambitions to control both Manchuria and Korea. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised. Japan had begun negotiations to ease the situation in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted these as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These led the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable. The Pacific Squadron began mooring in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased, in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.Westwood, pp. 15‚Äì21 On the night of 8/9 February 1904, the IJN launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. Peresvet was not hit by the initial torpedo-boat incursion and sortied the following morning when the Combined Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, attacked. T≈çg≈ç had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his assault. The Japanese vessels had been spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore, and alerted the Russian defenses. T≈çg≈ç chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese and six-inch guns inflicted inconsequential damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on their opponents with some effect.Forczyk, pp. 41‚Äì43 Peresvet was hit three times with little effect during the battle. On 22 March, Peresvet joined several other battleships firing indirectly at Japanese ships bombarding Port Arthur's harbor. While training outside Port Arthur on 26 March, she accidentally collided with the battleship and sustained minor damage. Peresvet participated in the action of 13 April, when T≈çg≈ç successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, the battleship . When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur and Petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes following the explosion of one of her magazines, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, T≈çg≈ç resumed long-range bombardment missions.Forczyk, pp. 45‚Äì46 Two days later, Peresvet hit the armored cruiser once as the latter ship was bombarding Port Arthur. Peresvet sailed with the rest of the Pacific Squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok. The new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese fleet shortly before sunset, as he did not wish to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle.Warner & Warner, pp. 305‚Äì306 Peresvet bombarded Japanese positions besieging Port Arthur on 28 July.McLaughlin 2008, pp. 45‚Äì46 Some of the ship's guns were removed during the summer to reinforce the defenses of the port. Peresvet lost a total of three 6-inch, two 75-millimeter, two 47-millimeter and four 37-millimeter guns.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 115, 163 She was hit on 9 August by two shells fired by a battery with a narrow view of the harbor, but they caused only slight damage.McLaughlin 2008, p. 46 =Battle of the Yellow Sea= Peresvet after having been scuttled The Japanese bombardment, coupled with a direct order from Tsar Nicholas II, forced Vitgeft to make an attempt to reach Vladivostok. The squadron sortied in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok in the morning of 10 August. At 12:25, it was spotted by Japanese cruisers and intercepted by the Combined Fleet in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Peresvet was fourth in line during the battle,Forczyk, p. 48 and was not seriously damaged during the early long- range stage of the action. Around 18:00 her topmasts were destroyed and two 12-inch shells from the battleship penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the captain, and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian battleline started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind Tsesarevich, including Peresvet, to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship. As the Japanese ships continued to pound the Tsesarevich, the battleship , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet, boldly charged T≈çg≈ç's battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away.McLaughlin 2003, p. 163 Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized. Peresvet received a total of 39 hits of all sizes that killed 13 men and wounded 69. Her forward 10-inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding; compartments of the double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her stability. Repairs were not completed until late September. =Siege of Port Arthur= Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August, the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the Japanese Third Army led by Baron Nogi Maresuke. The new commander, Rear Admiral Robert N. Viren, decided to use the men and guns of the Pacific Squadron to reinforce the defenses of Port Arthur and even more guns were stripped from the squadron's ships. On 20‚Äì22 September Japanese troops attacked 203 Hill, which overlooked the harbor; Peresvet, Retvizan, the battleship Poltava and the gunboat bombarded the Japanese positions to support the successful defense of the hill. The Japanese began firing blindly into the harbor on 30 September and hit Peresvet with at least six and 4.7-inch shells. She was struck once more the following day. On 2 October she was hit by nine shells that failed to penetrate her deck armor, but did considerable damage to the unprotected portions of the ship. The Japanese troops were able to seize Hill 203 on 5 December. This allowed the Imperial Japanese Army's siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships and they hit Peresvet many times. The Russians scuttled her in shallow water on 7 December 1904 without, however, seriously damaging her, possibly in the hope of fooling the Japanese into switching targets. =Japanese career= Sagami (center, rear) at anchor in Yokohama harbor during the Great White Fleet's visit, September 1908 Peresvet was refloated by Japanese engineers on 29 June 1905 and steamed under her own power to Sasebo Naval Arsenal, where she arrived on 25 August. She was renamed Sagami,Lengerer, p. 44 after the eponymous ancient province.Silverstone, p. 336 She was classified as a first- class battleship on 25 August and arrived at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 16 September. Her repairs began on 30 September and continued until 20 July 1908, although she participated in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905. To improve her stability, Sagamis forward fighting top was removed. Sagami was rearmed with four 10-inch 45 caliber guns, ten guns and sixteen QF 12-pounder 12 cwt\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. guns. Two above-water 18-inch torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament and her crew now numbered 791 officers and enlisted men. She was one of the reception ships when the American Great White Fleet visited Japan in late 1908 and was often used as an \\"enemy\\" ship during the annual fleet maneuvers. Sagami was reclassified as a first-class coastal defense ship on 28 August 1912.Lengerer, pp. 43‚Äì44 =Return to Russia= In 1916 the Russian government decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the Baltic and Black Seas. As Japan and Russia were allies during World War I, the Japanese government sold Sagami and some other ex-Russian warships back to Russia in March. She arrived in Vladivostok on 3 April, where she re-assumed her former name of Peresvet, and was classified as an armored cruiser two days later.McLaughlin 2008, pp. 47, 55 The ship ran aground on 23 May while conducting trials and was refloated by the IJN on 9 July. Peresvet arrived at Maizuru Naval Arsenal for repairs on 30 July and sailed for European Russia on 18 October. She was intended to serve with the White Sea Fleet and paused en route in Port Said for machinery repairs at the beginning of 1917. On 4 January 1917, about north of the harbor, the ship struck two mines that had been laid by the German submarine . Holed forward and abreast one of her boiler rooms, Peresvet sank after catching fire. Losses were reported as either 167Preston, p. 207 or 116 men.

She signed her novels with her married or maiden names ‚Äì Sheila Holland, Sheila Coates ‚Äì and under the pseudonyms Sheila Lancaster, Victoria Wolf and Laura Hardy. She was married to Richard Holland. They had five children, including a set of twins: - Michael Holland, Sarah Holland, Jane Holland, Charlotte Holland and David Holland.  Biography  = Personal life = Born Sheila Ann Mary Coates on 22 December 1937 at Dagenham, Essex, England. As a child, she was moved from relative to relative to escape the bombings of World War II. She attended the Ursuline Convent for Girls in Ilford, Essex. She worked as a typist-secretary at the Bank of England in London, from 1954 to 1956, and then as a junior researcher for the BBC at Broadcasting House from the 1956 to 1958. In 1959, she married Richard Holland, then a Fleet Street journalist, later a sub-editor of The Times and a classical biographer. They had five children, including a set of twins: - Michael Holland, Sarah Holland, Jane Holland, Charlotte Holland and David Holland. Her husband prompted her to begin writing in the early 1970s. She died suddenly on in her baronial-style home 'Crogga' on the Isle of Man. She had been living on the island since 1977 with her husband and four of her five children. = Writing career = A voracious reader, she wrote her first book in three days with three children underfoot. In between raising her five children, she wrote many more novels. She began her writing career as her married name Sheila Holland and as her maiden name Sheila Coates. In 1973 she signed Follow a Stranger as her most famous pseudonym: Charlotte Lamb, but later she used several other pseudonyms, among them Sheila Lancaster, Victoria Woolf and Laura Hardy. Her first historical and romantic novels were published by Robert Hale and serialised in Woman's Weekly Digest. By the late 1970s, she was an established and successful author, publishing as many as twelve novels a year with Mills and Boon. That annual number rose over the next few years; by the late 1990s, she had published over 160 novels, most of them romances, others historical novels and romantic thrillers, achieving over 200 million sales worldwide. During the course of her career, she wrote for a variety of different international publishers including: Penguin, Collins, Fontana, Hodder & Stoughton, Hodder Headline and Simon & Schuster. Known for her swiftness, literary style and versatility, Sheila Holland was able to write in several different genres - hence her plethora of pseudonyms as well as publishers. She typically wrote a minimum of two thousand words per day, working from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. While she once finished a full-length novel in four days, she herself pegged her average speed at two weeks to complete a full novel. She was a true revolutionary in the field of romance writing. One of the first writers to explore the boundaries of sexual desire, her novels often reflected the forefront of the \\"sexual revolution\\" of the 1970s. Her books touched on then-taboo subjects such as child abuse and rape, and she created sexually confident -even dominant- heroines. She was also one of the first to create a modern romantic heroine: independent, imperfect, and perfectly capable of initiating a sexual or romantic relationship.

The section from Bow Interchange to Gallows Corner formed the original route of the A12 until the designation was transferred to the Eastern Avenue soon after the latter opened in 1925. Parts of the route have an even older pedigree, forming the Camulodunum (Colchester) to Londinium (London) extension of the Pye Road. Recently, the A118 was extended westwards from its former terminus at Stratford to Bow, taking over the former A11 Stratford High Street when the A12 extension opened in 1999. Thus 70 years after the Eastern Avenue was built, the A12 finally by-passed the whole of the A118, unlike the situation previously, where the A12 ended on the A11 due north of Stratford at Leytonstone. The road is known as Romford Road for much its length in the London Borough of Newham, High Road while in the London Borough of Redbridge and the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham and London Road while in the London Borough of Havering.

It is operated independent of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo. History The Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart was founded by the Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity in 1877 to provide an education rich in the arts, sciences, and humanities for the daughters of immigrant families. The school included instruction in matters of faith and development of moral character. The first enrollment consisted of eight young women. By 1889 the academy's campus included the convent, a five-story school building, an annex, and a building used for science labs. The academy outgrew its quarters on Washington Street in downtown Buffalo, New York. In 1928 the Sisters secured a property in Eggertsville, and began supervising construction of the new building. On May 11, 1930, 230 students and 14 faculty members moved into the new Sacred Heart Academy.\\"History - Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart \\". Retrieved 2013-08-07 In 1997 the campus was expanded by the purchase of an adjacent building, providing additional learning areas for SHA's music students. Clare Music Hall, named in honor of St. Clare of Assisi, opened in September 1999. Over the summer of 2012, the academy expanded yet again. With the convent no longer in use, the school expanded to include a new state-of-the-art language and English section, which opened that fall. This area includes new technology and the school now being able to teach Mandarin Chinese, among other LOTE. In July 2013 the academy received permission to demolish a 40-year-old garage in order to build a new gymnasium. The gym will also include a dance studio. The academy anticipates having use of the new gym by the 2014-2015 basketball season.

It concentrated its attention on the Australian & New Zealand white nationalist, fascist and neo-Nazi scenes. The group is named after a reggae song by Linton Kwesi Johnson . Politics The group was founded by a collective of internet activists from across Australia and New Zealand in late 2004. In Sydney, these people included the lawyer Mat Henderson, generally known as 'Darp', who prior to starting the group was mainly known as a prolific blogger, winning best NSW blog in the 2005 Australian blogging awards. In Melbourne, the organisation was headed up by Cam Smith, a multimedia producer and radio journalist. In Perth, Donald Oorst, a part-time academic and author helped build the group up. In New Zealand, the public faces of the group were Robert Trigan and well known community activist and anarchist Asher Goldman from Wellington. Trigan left FDB and New Zealand in July 2005 for New York see Website seeks net loss for Nazis, by Peter Kohn, Australian Jewish News, 17 June 2005see Website target of hate emails, by Mike Houlahan, Christchurch Press, 14 June 2005see Extremely Vulnerable, by David King and Paige Taylor, The Australian, 24 December 2005 By these criteria, Fight dem Back should be compared to the more moderate groups such as Searchlight, as it describes its operations as purely intelligence gathering and dissemination. However the split between moderate and radical anti- fascists does not seem to have happened in relation to the group. For example, they interviewed, with implied approval, two former members of the British Anti-Fascist Action , and there has been little or no criticism of the group from the left. They also ran an approving article marking the anniversary of the 'Battle of Cable Street' . Fight dem back officially espouse a non- sectarian platform. The group draws its membership from traditional left- leaning cliques but also directly from the various ethnic community groups who are affected by race-hate activism. Membership policies Compared to similar groups, FightDemBack gave a low priority to recruiting new members, and to 'screen' potential members more rigorously. A 2006 post on their discussion forum authored by Henderson was \\"just a gentle reminder dear readers that being 'IN' FDB comes as a result of the senior and founding members voting you in\\", and stated that there were only thirteen members in Australia and New Zealand. Activities FDB conducted a number of disruption campaigns against allegedly racist organisations and their supporters. FDB's campaigns included attempts to reveal the identity of a person responsible for an anti-immigration campaign in Toowoomba, QLD; and general campaigning against the Australia First Party, the Patriotic Youth League and the New Zealand National Front. These campaigns resulted in a number of reprisals from radical organisations which have ranged from libel to vandalism and death threats.see The Age, 18 December 2005, \\"White Supremacists Hide in Quiet Suburbs.\\".

Purpose Prior to the introduction of the lateral motion device, the coupled driving wheels on steam locomotives (often simply called \\"drivers\\") were held in a straight line by the locomotive's frame. The flanges of the drivers were spaced a bit closer than the rail gauge, and they could still fit between the rails when tracking through a mild curve. At some degree of curvature, though, the flanges on the center driver would begin to bind in the curve. The closer the front and rear drivers were, the smaller the radius of curve that the locomotive could negotiate. One solution was to make the center driver(s) \\"blind,\\" i.e. without flanges on the tires.For example, the Pennsylvania class I-1s 2-10-0 had no flange on the middle drivers. The other solution was to allow at least one of the axles (often the front driver) to move laterally relative to the frame, and such designs incorporated various devices to permit this motion. Variations Typically the bearing boxes were designed to allow the axle to slide some either way, and the wheel cranks and the coupling rods were modified to accommodate this extra range of motion. Spring centering might also be provided to keep the wheels on such axles from hunting side to side. One example was the Italian State Railways class 640 2-6-0. The frontmost axle did not carry a conventional pony truck. Instead this axle along with the front driven axle together carried a bogie. This driving axle had a lateral play of about 20 mm, and spherical bearings were used on the cranks and coupling rods to this axle. (The engine used inside cylinders driving the middle set of drivers.) The first two axles worked together to guide the locomotive, similar to a conventional leading bogie.Hollingsworth, B. and Cook, A. Steam Locomotives. 2000, Salamander Books. . 72-73 The Dovregubben class 2-8-4 on the Norwegian State Railways also used this Zara bogie.Hollingsworth & Cook. 133. \\"Zara\\" is Giuseppe Zara, the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Italian State Railways when the class 640 was designed. The Southern Pacific class 5000 4-10-2 employed a conventional leading bogie but used lateral motion devices on the leading driven axle to reduce the rigid wheelbase.Swengel, F.M. The American Steam Locomotive. 1967, Midwest Rail Publications, Inc. 222 Their GS-4 class 4-8-4 also did and employed springs to control the lateral motion, thereby assisting the bogie in easing the engine into curves.Hollingsworth & Cook. 140 On the Hungarian State Railways class 424 4-8-0s, the rear axle was given 50 mm of lateral motion \\"to ease the running on sharp curves.\\"Hollingsworth & Cook. 104 The experimental AA20 4-14-4 was the only locomotive ever to have seven coupled driving axles. It used lateral motion devices on the first and seventh axles as well as blind drivers on the third, fourth and fifth axles but these measures were not enough to allow it to negotiate curves without damaging the track, derailing, or both.

Plot =\\"A Friend of Dorothy's\\"= In the 1950s, Dorothy Nelson (Brittany Murphy) joins the United States Navy where she meets the Friends of Dorothy, a code name for a group of gay and lesbian sailors. Nelson meets Billy (Jason Priestley), who takes her to an interracial nightclub that tolerates gay people. However, the NIS raids the nightclub, and Nelson is among those servicemembers who receive a Blue discharge for \\"sexual perversion.\\" Returning to Homer, she tries to restart her life as a public school teacher, but her Section 8 discharge prevents her from getting a job. When her homosexuality becomes public knowledge, her mother expels her from the house, forcing her to seek shelter at a family friend's grocery store. However, the townspeople disapprove of this arrangement, and Nelson becomes homeless. An independent-minded woman named Janet (Helen Shaver) at the local diner defends her against the verbal harassment and advises Nelson to go to the bohemian Greenwich Village, a place where she might be free to be herself. =\\"Mr. Roberts\\"= The second story flashes forward to the town of Homer in the 1970s, towards the end of the Vietnam War. There a closeted gay high school French language teacher, Mr. Roberts (Steven Weber), has a student named Tobias Anderson, nicknamed Toby, (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) who is on the verge of coming out of the closet, and who he suspects wishes to confide in him. Roberts must keep his homosexuality a secret for the fear of losing his job, but his live-in boyfriend Gus (Scott McCord) pressures him to set a good example for the students by illustrating the importance of tolerance and justice. Toby visits a prostitute on the advice of his swimming coach, with the idea that she can help him \\"become a man\\", but rather instead gives him some good advice about being himself. After Toby is sexually assaulted by bullies and is discovered by Roberts, Roberts then himself comes out to his students and lectures them on the evils of bias- motivated hatred. Toby graduates from high school and leaves Homer to attend college in the big city. =\\"Andy and Amos\\"= The final short story takes place in the present day (2000), when a father and the townspeople have to come to terms with the fact that two men will be getting married during a commitment ceremony to be held in the town. Ira (Ed Asner), the father, is planning to lead a protest march against the wedding, while his son, Amos (James LeGros), is nervous about getting married and going against the cultural stereotype of gay men. The film ends on a positive note, with father and son reconciling and the wedding taking place as scheduled.

He received the Ph.D from Berkeley in 1982 under the direction of Alexandre Chorin. Afterward he was a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow at the Courant Institute, under Peter Lax. He returned to Berkeley in 1985 where he is now a full professor. Sethian was elected member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2008 as well as the National Academy of Sciences in 2013. Sethian has acted as Interim Director Research at Thinking Machines Corporation, as well as held visiting positions at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Work Sethian has worked on numerical algorithms for tracking moving interfaces for over three decades, starting with his seminal 1982 work on curve and surface propagation in combustion, and his 1985 work on entropy conditions, curvature, stability of numerical algorithms. This work led to development of the level-set method in 1988, which was developed jointly with Stanley Osher. These are numerical algorithms for tracking moving interfaces in complex situations, and have proved instrumental in a wide collection of applications, including semiconductor processing, fluid mechanics, medical imaging, computer graphics, and materials science. Jointly with D. Adalsteinsson, Sethian then introduced the idea of adaptivity to level set methods, in which computational labor is focused on the evolving front: their Adaptive Narrow Band level set method and its variants are what makes level set methods efficient and practical, and are the most common form of these techniques in practice today. Together with Alexander Vladimirsky, Sethian developed a class of Dijkstra-like ordered upwind methods for solving static Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equations. In the case of an Eikonal equation, the first method to do so was developed by Jon N. Tsitsiklis using a control-theoretic approach: followed shortly by Sethian's work on high-order finite-difference Dijkstra-like Fast Marching Methods. Ravikanth Malladi and Sethian pioneered the application of these techniques to image segmentation, Ron Kimmel and Sethian introduced them to robotic navigation and extended them to curved domains, and Mihai Popovici and Sethian were the first to use them as fast wave solvers in geophysical seismic imaging. Together with Sergey Fomel, Sethian invented Escape Arrival Methods for computing multiple arrivals in wave propagation and geophysical imaging. Algorithms based on the work of Sethian and his colleagues are now commonly used throughout science and engineering. Examples include informing engineers how to design more precise ink jet plotters, allowing physicians to analyze brain and cardiac images, aiding oil companies in locating petroleum reserves, and telling process engineers how to build reliable computer chips. He maintains the \\"level set methods and fast marching methods\\" webpage , which is a popular resource for these methods, and provides a variety of applets, movies, and explanations for both the popular and technical audiences. Awards Sethian won the ICIAM Pioneer Prize in 2011 for pioneering work, introducing applied mathematical methods and scientific computing techniques to an industrial problem area and new scientific fields of applications. Sethian was elected member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2008 for the development of efficient methods of tracking moving interfaces. He received the Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics in 2004, jointly awarded by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematicians (SIAM) and the American Mathematical Society (AMS). This prize was awarded \\"for an outstanding contribution to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense.\\" Sethian was honoured \\"for his seminal work on the computer representation of the motion of curves, surfaces, interfaces, and wave fronts, and for his brilliant applications of mathematical and computational ideas to problems in science and engineering.\\" Previous recipients include Richard Bellman, Peter Lax, Alexandre Chorin, Jerrold Marsden, Tosio Kato, Gerald Whitham, Arthur Winfree, and Harold Widom. Sethian, in collaboration with Robert Saye, won the Cozzarelli Prize of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2012 for the best paper published that year in engineering and applied sciences in that journal.

The village is a spring line settlement at the foot of the Cotswold escarpment, about southwest of Broadway in neighbouring Worcestershire. Broadway is Stanton's postal town. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 198. The parish is about long on a northwest ‚Äì southeast axis, embracing both low-lying land northwest of the village and high Cotswold land to the southeast. On the opposite northeast ‚Äì southwest axis the parish is about across at its widest point. Its highest point is Shenberrow Hill on the escarpment in the southeast of the parish, above sea level. The low-lying northwestern part of the parish is bounded mostly by two streams, which converge and then join the River Isbourne about outside the parish. A report in 1712 indicated that the village consisted of 60 houses and 300 inhabitants, including 29 freeholders. Much of the area of the village was owned by the Stott family from 1906 to 1949. In addition to restoring the properties, these owners built a reservoir in 1907, added lighting to the main street, improved the church, extended the school, built a swimming pool and cricket field. Today, the village has no school, post office or shops. The village is built almost completely of Cotswold stone, a honey-coloured Jurassic limestone. Several cottages have thatched roofs. It has a high street, with a pub, The Mount, at the end. David Verey calls it \\"architecturally, the most distinguished of the smaller villages in the North Cotswolds\\". The Daily Telegraph described Stanton in 2017 as \\"arguably the most beautiful Cotswold village of them all\\" while the Huffington Post said that it's \\"one of the prettiest and idyllic unspoilt villages of the Cotswolds\\". The Cotswold Way long-distance footpath passes through the village. Archaeology Shenberrow, on the hill southeast of the village, is a hill fort enclosing about . It is bivallate, meaning that its defences include two concentric ditches. It was excavated in 1935, when Iron Age pottery, iron artefacts and a bronze bracelet were found. Romano-British pottery from the second century AD was also found. The fort is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Manor Built in 1557 by Thomas Warren, the manor belonged to Winchcombe Abbey until the Dissolution and then to a series of owners, including Sir Philip Sidney Stott in the early 1900s. The English architect, civil engineer and surveyor, is credited with rescuing Stanton village from oblivion after he bought the estate in 1906. He put his fortune and skills into restoring Stanton Court and other historic buildings in the village. Parish church St Michael and All Angels parish church A church was built on this site circa 1100; the earliest remaining features are three Norman columns from about 1200 which form the north arcade. The south arcade was rebuilt with Early English Gothic pointed arches, a bay longer than the previous arcade, together with a new tower of cut stone at the West end. There are hagioscopes (squints) in both transepts, an aumbry is in the north and two more in the south transept and aisle. The village's Web site provides this comment about its early history. \\"It seems possible that a Saxon church on the present site was served in early times by the monks of Winchcombe Benedictine Abbey, as the Manor, tithes and patronage of Stanton were bestowed on the Abbey by Kenulf, King of Mercia in 811 CE. Unfortunately, most records were destroyed in the disastrous fire at Winchcombe Benedictine Abbey in 1151 CE.\\" The font, porch and parvise are 15th-century. The original pulpit and lectern date from about 1375 and were restored in 1982. There is a second pulpit added in 1684. There are medieval encaustic tiles at the east end. One of Stanton's two First World War memorials. This one is in St Michael's parish churchyard and was designed by Sir Ninian Comper. An 1881 report refers to the building as Fragments of ancient painted decoration survive. There are fragments of Medieval stained glass in the east window, the south transept and the west window, which also shows the White Rose of York. The reredos of 1915, the rood screen and the east windows of the chancel and transepts are by Sir Ninian Comper and Squire Stott. In the north transept are murals of the Annunciation and Purification, fragments of the Medieval screen. Still visible on the south wall is evidence of stone benches for the old and infirm, dating from when most of the congregation would stand during the parts of the service that did not require kneeling. There are Medieval benches at the back of the nave: \\"their poppy heads ringed with the chains of shepherds' dogs\\".Church leaflet, circa 1990s There is a wooden roundel of Mauritius Wrabury. The west tower has a ring of six bells. Humphrey and James Keene of Woodstock, Oxfordshire cast the second, third, fourth and fifth bells in 1640. John I Martin of Worcester cast the tenor bell in 1659 and the treble in 1660. Sir Philip Stott hired designer Ninian Comper to improve the church with reredos and stained glass. The church is a Grade I listed building. Historic buildings Old Manor Farmhouse The Manor (also known as Warren House) and Warne Cottage, also called Warren House, is Elizabethan, with the year 1577 on a datestone. This was formerly manor house, and is now one house and an attached cottage. Old Manor Farmhouse, built circa 1678, is also Elizabethan. A full 43 of the buildings in this village are Listed, all as Grade II. Some of the noteworthy properties include the following. =Wormington Grange= Wormington Grange Wormington Grange was built in the 1770s. Its stables were designed by Henry Hakewill and completed in 1827. It is Grade II listed. =Sheppey Corner= Sheppey Corner Cottage Sheppey Corner is a thatched cottage built about 1650 at the top of the High Street. Like the rest of the village it is built of Cotswold stone. It was built as one large house and barn but was altered in the mid 18th century and then, extensively altered in 1922 for then-owner Sir P. Stott. It is now divided into three cottages that are Grade II Listed: Little Sheppey House, No 3 and Pixie Cottage. =Stanton Court= A Grade II listed building Stanton Court is a Jacobean manor house built for the Izod family in the \\"early and later part\\" of 17th Century. It passed to their relatives, the Wynniatt family, in the early 18th century, who then extended the house adding a wing with Georgian sitting room. The house was extensively restored for Sir Philip Stott in the 20th century. =The Mount Inn= Though not listed, this very quaint 17th century inn, atop a steep hill at the end of the village, is a popular spot for tourists because of its views over the Vale of Evesham and the Malvern Hills to the Black Mountains in Wales. It has an interesting history. The building was originally a farmhouse, known as \\"The Bank\\" until 1897 when it became a pub owned by Donnington Brewery and Richard Arkell. It was operated by the Troughton family until 1962. It was an off-licence facility for decades, known as \\"The Five Elms\\"; since alcoholic beverages could not be sold inside, the inn operator made cider in an outbuilding. Finally in 1947, the inn received its licence. Railway New track being laid for the restoration of the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway through Stanton parish The Great Western Railway's main line between and was built through the parish between 1900 and 1904, passing about west of the village. The nearest station was about north of Stanton. British Railways closed the line to passenger trains in 1960 and freight in 1976. The Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway heritage railway is currently rebuilding the line. By 2018, the line had reached beyond the Stanton Lane bridge.

More significantly, in 1130, Antipope Anacletus II had crowned Roger II king. The legitimate pope, Innocent II, did not recognise this title and many of Roger's peninsular vassals took exception to his exercising royal authority over them. Over the decade of the 1130s, Roger defeated his vassals one by one until in 1137, the Emperor Lothair II came down with the pope and conquered most of the south. Lothair's death deprived the southern barons of their support, however, and Roger quickly reconquered his territories. In 1139 the papal-imperial duke of Apulia, Ranulf of Alife, died. Innocent and the dispossessed Prince Robert II of Capua marched to reassert their authority. At Galluccio, Roger's son ambushed the papal troops with only a thousand knights and captured the pope and his entourage. Three days later, on 25 July at Mignano, Innocent confirmed the elder Roger as rex Siciliae ducatus Apuliae et principatus Capuae and invested him with his titles. He also invested his son as duke, and another son, Alfonso, as prince of Capua. In 1143, Innocent refused to recognise the treaty, but Roger sent Robert of Selby to march on papal Benevento. Mignano was reaffirmed. In 1156, by the Treaty of Benevento, the tribute to the pope of 600 schifati agreed upon by Roger II in 1139 was affirmed and another 400 schifati was added for newly conquered lands.

Its bishopric was thus a suffragan of Ephesus, the metropolitan see of that province. Its site is now near the Turkish town of Beydaƒü. Under the Ottoman Empire, it was in the vilayet (province) of ƒ∞zmir.  History  The secular history of this city is unknown. In the 6th century AD it is mentioned by Hierocles (Synecdemus 660, 4). It is found in the Notitiae Episcopatuum as late as the 13th century, among the suffragan sees of Ephesus. Le Quien (Oriens christianus I:729) mentions seven bishops of this city known by their presence at councils: Rhodon at Ephesus, 431; Basilicus at Chalcedon, 451; Eusebius at Constantinople, 536; George at Constantinople, 692; Gregory at Nicaea, 787; Peter at Constantinople, 869; Julian at Constantinople, 879.

It opened in 1904 and has been Listed Grade II since 1983. It is long. The pier's pavilion has been destroyed by fire on two occasions, in 1930 and 2008. It is one of two major piers in the town, along with Birnbeck Pier, which closed in 1994 and stands derelict. History =1903‚Äì2008= The pier with its original pavilion, prior to the 1930 fire Work began on building the pier on 7 November 1903, with P. Munroe acting as engineer, and it opened on 11 June 1904. At the pier's end was a 2,000-seat theatre which was used as a music hall and for opera, stage plays and ballet. On 16 May 1907 an extension of the pier measuring was opened, with the intention that the pier would be used as a docking point for boats to Cardiff. The dangerous currents in the bay made this too difficult, however, and the extension was demolished. The pier with its second pavilion, prior to the 2008 fire The theatre at the pier's end was destroyed by fire on 13 January 1930. As the building was underinsured the pier was put up for sale and bought by Leonard Guy , who opened a new pavilion three years later. This second pavilion housed a large undercover funfair rather than a theatre. The pier was sold in 1946 to Mr. A. Brenner, who went on to improve the pier's facilities, adding new shops and an amusement arcade to the pavilion in the early 1970s. As a result of the extra investment, the pier became a Grade II listed building in 1974. Brenner continued his ownership of the pier until 6 February 2008, when it was sold to brother and sister partnership Kerry and Michelle Michael. The pier immediately underwent a multi-million-pound revamp, which included a new branding scheme. was spent installing a new go-kart track, a fully licensed bar, and a climbing wall into the pavilion. =2008 fire= The pier on fire on 28 July 2008 At 01:35 BST on 28 July 2008, a fire at the foot of the north tower on the shoreward (eastern) end of the pavilion triggered the privately monitored fire alarm, but the Essex-based alarm monitoring company were unable to contact the key-holder by mobile phone and no further action was taken. It was not until 06:46 BST that the Avon Fire and Rescue Service was notified. It deployed 13 fire engines, special appliances, and more than 85 firefighters to tackle the blaze, but the pavilion was soon destroyed. Robert Tinker, a Grand Pier employee, was later praised by the fire brigade as he braved the extreme intensity of the heat from the flames to rush around the side of the building to remove several gas canisters which had been stored within the premises; had these not been removed the fire brigade claimed that the blaze could have been much worse, with the possibility of local residents and traders needing to be evacuated. Preliminary investigations suggested that the fire started due to a number of deep fat fryers which had been located within the pavilion; however after further investigation this was later ruled out, as was arson. On 22 October 2008 at a news conference held by the fire brigade it was announced that the cause of the fire would be recorded as unknown, but that the most likely cause was electrical. =2008‚Äìpresent= The pier's third pavilion under construction in February 2010 Work began dismantling the wreckage on 12 September 2008, and the Bristol architects Angus Meek won the contract to design the new pavilion on 15 October. North Somerset Council approved the plans on 12 March 2009. Contractors John Sisk and Son were selected to construct the new pavilion, which was expected to be completed by June 2010. Following delays, it instead opened in time for half-term break on 23 October 2010, having cost . The opening day attracted more than 52,000 visitors, and an estimated 100,000 for the whole weekend. The pier was officially reopened on 25 July 2011, by Anne, Princess Royal. In January 2013, security company System 2 Security Limited was proven in court to be responsible for the fire damage to the pier in 2008 due to negligence. Kerry and Michelle Michael , the pier owners, were awarded by a judge at Bristol Mercantile Court. On 10 March 2019, the pier suffered a small fire and was evacuated, however the fire was contained and the pier reopened the following day. In popular culture One scene from the film The Remains of the Day was filmed on the pier in 1992. The comedy television series Bliss filmed scenes on the pier in 2017. The reality television series Come Dine With Me, Don‚Äôt Tell the Bride and Flog It!, the news programme BBC Breakfast, and the cookery television series Saturday Kitchen have also filmed at the pier. Accolades The pier won the National Piers Society Pier of the Year award in 2001, and again in 2011, becoming the first pier to win the award twice.

He is most often associated with the water skiing thrill show based in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, known as Tommy Bartlett's Thrill Show. The success of this and other traveling water ski shows led to Bartlett's induction into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in 1993. His shows have toured the United States, the Far East, and four World Fairs, and have been seen by 50 million spectators. Early career Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Bartlett began his career in entertainment by becoming a broadcaster at radio station WISN at the young age of 13. After moving to Chicago, Illinois, he became a staff announcer at the CBS-owned WBBM radio station. He continued here until the outbreak of World War II, when he learned to fly and subsequently became a flight instructor for the United States Army Air Corps. In 1945, he returned to radio, hosting a show called Meet Tommy Bartlett. In 1947, he hosted the Tommy Bartlett Show and Welcome Travelers. During his WBBM tenure, Bartlett was popular as host of two transcribed daily shows catering to housewives, Meet the Missus and The Missus Goes to Market. Both shows would become the top-rated local daytime radio shows in the Chicago market, and were sponsored by Fitzpatrick Brothers, manufacturers of Kitchen Klenzer, Big Jack Soap and Automatic Soap Flakes. Water skiing In 1949, Bartlett went to the Chicago Railroad Fair, where he witnessed a water skiing show on the Chicago lakefront. After seeing several more such shows over the course of the fair, Bartlett decided to create and produce his own traveling water ski show using surplus equipment that he bought from the performers. The \\"Tommy Bartlett Water Ski & Jumping Boat Thrill Show\\", as it was first called, was highly successful. In 1953, after the show called at Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, Bartlett was asked by the local Chamber of Commerce to keep the show in the city permanently. Bartlett agreed to the request, keeping one arm of the show at Wisconsin Dells for daily performances on Lake Delton, while four additional road groups continued touring in cities across the United States. The success of the shows led the United Service Organizations (USO) to ask Bartlett to send the show overseas to entertain U.S. soldiers in the Far East, launching a branch of the tour in Asia. Bartlett had a long-term partnership with motor manufacturer Mercury Marine's owner Carl Kiekhaefer. Through his show, Bartlett has been credited both with popularizing water skiing from a smalltime hobby to a major sport, and with the establishment of Wisconsin Dells as a tourist mecca. He is credited with introducing colorful costumes, and establishing themes for \\"dancing water\\", jumping boats, night shows, Polynesian dancers, show ski jumping, and skydivers. Bartlett's Wisconsin Dells show offered bumper stickers for its visitors to put on their cars, thus becoming advertisements for the show and the city across the nation, especially so in the Chicago metropolitan area. In addition to his water ski show, Bartlett invested in other tourist attractions in Wisconsin Dells, building \\"Tommy Bartlett's Robot World\\", a hands-on science museum, in the 1970s. The attraction is now known as the Tommy Bartlett Exploratory. Bartlett also continued his career in broadcasting while both his ski show and Wisconsin Dells ventures were ongoing. He was an announcer at the Calgary Stampede from 1966 to 1992, as well as at the 1988 Winter Olympics. Bartlett's widespread ventures in the entertainment industry led him to become very wealthy. In 1997, Bartlett purchased one of three spare core modules for the space station Mir from a Moscow museum. The object is now the centerpiece of the Tommy Bartlett Exploratory in Wisconsin Dells. It was used as a backdrop by CNN while the network reported on Mir's re-entry to the atmosphere in 2001. Bartlett was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in 1993 for his contributions to promoting the sport, despite having only water skied once in his life, on his seventieth birthday in 1984. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003. Death On September 6, 1998, Bartlett died of kidney failure at the age of 84. His name, however, lives on in the Tommy Bartlett Show and Tommy Bartlett Exploratory, which each continue to entertain thousands of visitors every year.

Gresford is one of Britain's worst coal mining disasters: a controversial inquiry into the disaster did not conclusively identify a cause, though evidence suggested that failures in safety procedures and poor mine management were contributory factors. Further public controversy was caused by the decision to permanently seal the colliery's damaged districts, meaning that only eleven of those who died were recovered. Background Painting in All Saints' Church, Gresford commemorating the disaster, above a book with the names of those who died. The Westminster and United Collieries Group began to sink the pit at Gresford in 1908. Two shafts were sunk apart: the Dennis and the Martin. They were named after Sir Theodore Martin, the company chairman, and Mabel Dennis, wife of the company managing director Henry Dyke Dennis, who had ceremonially cut the first sods for each of the respective shafts. Work was completed in 1911. The mine was one of the deepest in the Denbighshire Coalfield: the Dennis shaft reached depths of about and the Martin shaft about . By 1934, 2,200 coal miners were employed at the colliery, with 1,850 working underground and 350 on the surface. Three coal seams were worked at Gresford across several sections: #Crank (South-East and No. 1 North sections), a seam producing high-quality household coal. #Brassey (South-East and No. 1 North sections), a to seam delivering harder 'steam' coal for commercial use. #Main (Dennis, South-East and No. 1 North sections), a seam that produced softer industrial coal. Lying east of the Bala Fault, the mine was extremely dry, unlike mines to the west of the fault, and was therefore prone to firedamp. The Main Coal in particular, which made up most of Gresford's output, was \\"of a very gassy nature\\". The explosion occurred within the Main seam of Dennis. This section, which began more than from the shaft bottom, was mined down a shallow gradient following the 1:10 dip of the seam. At the time of the disaster Dennis was divided into six \\"districts\\": 20's, 61's, 109's, 14's, 29's, and a very deep area known collectively as the \\"95's and 24's\\". Most districts in Dennis were worked by the longwall system where the coal face was mined in single blocks. Gresford was considered a modern pit by standards of the time and most districts in the Dennis section were mechanised except 20's and 61's, which were furthest from the main shaft (approximately ) and which were still worked by hand. Evidence given at the inquiry into the disaster suggested there were a number of adverse conditions in the pit prior to the explosion. Firstly, underground mine ventilation in some districts of Dennis was probably inadequate; in particular, the 14's and 29's districts were notorious for poor air quality. The main return airway for the 109's, 14's and 29's districts was said to be by and far too small to provide adequate ventilation. Secondly, working conditions in the deep 95's and 24's district were always uncomfortably hot. Thirdly, it was alleged, there were also numerous breaches of safety regulations leading to the districts being in an unfit condition to operate. The disaster inquiry was told that one of the pit deputies, whose job was to oversee the safety of a district, admitted that he also carried out shotfiring during his shifts, in addition to his other duties. It was revealed that he fired more charges during his shift than a full-time shotfirer could have safely carried out. The colliery had made an operating loss in 1933, and the pit manager, William Bonsall, is thought to have been under pressure from the Dennis family to increase profitability. Henry Dyke Dennis was reputed in the Wrexham district to be a forceful individual who had more control of the pit than the manager. Bonsall was not a trained mining engineer and at Gresford the role of mine agent, which would normally be held by a technically experienced person with authority to stand up to both manager and owners, had for some time been temporarily filled by the company secretary since the retirement of the previous agent Sydney Cockin. Gresford had previously had a good safety record, but there were suggestions that in the two years Bonsall had not had Cockin to help him the pit's management had come under increasing commercial pressure. Bonsall admitted he had spent little time in the Dennis section of the pit in the months before the disaster, as he was overseeing the installation of new machinery in the \\"Slant\\", an area in the South-East section. Work on improving the Dennis section ventilation had been halted, and the inquiry's chair later confessed to \\"an uneasy feeling that Mr. Bonsall was overridden\\" on the matter. Explosion On Saturday 22 September 1934 at 2:08 a.m. a violent explosion ripped through the Dennis section. The explosion started a fire near 29's district and blocked the main access road, known as \\"142's Deep\\", to all the section's other districts. At the time up to 500 men were working underground on the night shift with more than half in the affected areas. The rest were in the Slant district of the South-East section about from the explosion; many there were unaware for some time afterwards that a disaster had occurred. In Dennis the night overman, Fred Davies, who was on duty at the bottom of the main shaft, heard a crashing sound and was enveloped in a cloud of dust for around 30 seconds. When it cleared he telephoned the surface and told Bonsall, the manager: \\"something has happened down the Dennis. I think it has fired.\\" Bonsall immediately went into the mine to try to establish what had occurred. At approximately 3.30am the afternoon shift overman, Benjamin Edwards, reported that parts of the Dennis main road were on fire beyond a junction, known as the Clutch, where the haulage motors were located, and that a large number of miners were trapped beyond the blaze. Meanwhile, the shift that was working the Slant was ordered to the pit bottom and told to get out of the mine. Only six men had escaped from the Dennis section, all of whom were working in 29's district: Robert (Ted) Andrews, Cyril Challoner, Thomas Fisher, David Jones (the district's night shift deputy), Albert (Bert) Samuels, and Jack Samuels. Some of the group were sitting taking a mid-shift break about north of the Clutch when the initial explosion happened. Jack Samuels, in his testimony at the inquest, described hearing a \\"violent thud [...] followed at once by dust\\" while at the face and commenting \\"that's the bloody bottom gone\\". By the \\"bottom\\", Samuels clarified that he meant 14's district, which lay below them. A colleague advised them to leave the district via the \\"wind road\\" which was the 29's air return drift. Samuels told a further 30 men working in the 29's district to follow. But as the six-man lead group went ahead attempting to fan the air to mitigate the effects of the deadly afterdamp, they soon realised the other miners had not followed them. Jack Samuels described how Jones repeatedly fell back, commenting he was \\"done\\", but Samuels told him to \\"stick it\\" and shouldered the deputy up a ladder; Samuels was commended at the inquest for his bravery and leadership of the group. After a long and difficult escape up 1:3 gradients, several ladders, and past rockfalls, the six miners eventually rejoined the Dennis main road and met Andrew Williams, the under-manager, who along with Bonsall had immediately descended the Dennis main shaft on being notified of the explosion. Williams took David Jones and went on towards the Clutch, while the remaining five went to the pit bottom and safety. Beyond the Clutch, Williams found three falls in the main haulage road. Once he got past them he discovered a fire had started about 20 yards before the main entrance to 29's district, blocking escape from the districts further inbye, and immediately sent back for men and materials to fight it. The evidence of Williams, Bonsall and Ben Edwards, who all saw the fire at this critical point, differed on how large it was: Bonsall thought they could not get close enough to it to fight it, but Edwards, who was able to view the burning spot directly, said that it did \\"not seem much of a fire\\", and the final report of the inquest was inconclusive as to whether the fire could have been put out at this stage if better equipment had been to hand. Williams and the overman Fred Davies made an initial attempt to get up to the fire using breathing apparatus, but were driven back by fumes. Rescue attempts Shortly before dawn, volunteers began entering the pit with ponies to tackle the fire and help clear debris. The area's trained mine rescue teams were alerted, though there were delays in doing so which were later suggested to reflect management disorganisation. In the interim many volunteers from the area's mines were sent below to assist: a manager from another colliery, sent down at about 4:30 am, described his attempts to extinguish the fires. Six dead miners, all men who had been working near the Clutch, were soon brought to the surface. By 5:00 am the Gresford rescue team was already in the pit and some of the teams from the neighbouring Llay Main Colliery were at the surface, though they grew increasingly frustrated while waiting to be called down. At 8:40 am, the 18-man Llay team finally received a call down the pit and went in accompanied by a Gresford miner who was to show them the way. In a somewhat disorganised fashion John Charles Williams and his two rescue men making up the No. 1 Llay team, along with a Gresford rescue man W. Hughes, were instructed by the Gresford staff then below ground to check the mile-long return airway of the 20's district. Bonsall later stated that his intent had only been that the team establish the atmosphere in the return: he claimed that his order had been \\"not to go in until they got definite instructions from me, because what I had in my mind was that it would be charged with carbon monoxide, and I did not want them to go through that because there would not be the slightest chance of getting men back through it.\\" The instruction was, however, misinterpreted by a deputy as meaning that the team should physically enter the return; accordingly the rescue team entered the airway using breathing apparatus, despite the fact that their canary died instantly. Williams, the team's leader, ordered them back when after several hundred yards after the airway ahead narrowed to by and less. Two of the team then in Williams' words \\"seemed to get alarmed\\" and collapsed, possibly after removing their nose clips; Williams then tried dragging a third team member for over towards safety before being overcome himself by poisonous gases. Williams would be the only survivor; he was said by his family to be the man who later wrote the anonymous broadside ballad \\"The Gresford Disaster\\", which was highly critical of the mine's management. Despite the fact that the carbon monoxide levels in the 20's return suggested that no-one further inbye could be left alive, rescue efforts became focused on trying to fight the fire at 29's Turn, using sand, stone dust, and extinguishers. The miners trapped in the most northerly districts, the 20's and 61's, would have been more than on the other side of the fire, and rockfalls at the entrance to the 29's soon made it clear there was little chance of escape for the men trapped in the affected districts. As the falls were levelled, the fire become more severe: Parry Davies, captain of the Llay No. 2 rescue team, described the whole end of the level as \\"one mass of flame, the coal sides of the roadway, burning in one white mass, and the more stones we moved to one side, the more air we put on to the flames [...] It was most peculiar to see the flames from that fire, all the colours of the rainbow, a sight which I will never forget.\\" By early Saturday morning large crowds of concerned relatives and off-duty miners had gathered silently at the pit head awaiting news. Hopes were raised in the evening when rumours began circulating that the fire in the Dennis main road was being brought under control; families waiting at the surface were told rescue teams would soon be able to reach the miners in the 29's, the nearest district beyond the Clutch. However, by Sunday evening it became clear that conditions in the pit had become extremely hazardous. Fire took hold in 29's haulage road as well as 142's Deep, and the rescue teams were withdrawn as further explosions took place behind a heavy fall on the far side of the fire. Relatives were told the shafts into the Dennis section would be capped because no one could have survived and it was far too dangerous to try to recover any further bodies. The final man to leave the pit, John McGurk, president of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation, commented \\"there is no chance that any man is alive. I have been down in pits after ten explosions, but I have never seen anything like this. From the point where the fire is raging for twenty yards the stones are red-hot\\". More explosions continued to occur within the pit over the next few days. On 25 September, a surface worker named George Brown became the disaster's final victim when he was killed by flying debris after one blast blew the cap off the Dennis shaft. Recovery efforts In total, only 11 bodies (eight miners and the three rescue men) were ever recovered from the mine. Inquests recorded the cause of death as carbon monoxide poisoning. The mine shafts remained sealed for six months, after which unaffected districts were gradually re-entered. Recovery teams first entered the pit, using breathing apparatus, on 7 March 1935. The damage caused by explosions and by the water directed down the pit was severe, and efforts concentrated on building stoppings so that fresh air could be readmitted to the pit. In May, Parry Davies, captain of the Llay Main No. 2 rescue team, accompanied by two inspectors and a Ministry of Mines doctor, entered into the 20's return airway to recover the body of John Lewis of Cefn-y-Bedd, one of the members of the No. 1 team killed in the initial rescue attempts. By July, a party of men using breathing apparatus had proceeded 700 yards beyond the stoppings into the Dennis section as far as the top of the haulage road of the 142's Deep, though they found no trace of any of the missing miners. Within a matter of months, normal ventilation was restored to the Slant section: this work was, to that date, the first ever reopening of a pit by men working in an irrespirable atmosphere. However, after retrieving air samples from beyond the permanent stoppings, the mining inspectors refused to allow recovery teams to go further into the Dennis districts to retrieve bodies, despite calls from the workers themselves that they should be allowed to do so. Dennis was never reopened; the bodies of the remaining 254 victims of the disaster would be left in the sealed districts. Inquiry By the end of September 1934, 1,100 Gresford miners had signed on the unemployment register. Relief funds were set up by the Mayor of Wrexham, the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire, and the Lord Mayor of London. Their efforts raised a total of more than ¬£580,000 for the dependants of the victims . Stafford Cripps, who represented the miners at the inquiry. Cripps was consistently critical of Gresford's management, colliery officials, and the Mines Inspectorate. On 25 October 1934 the official inquiry opened at Church House on Regent Street in Wrexham. It was chaired by Sir Henry Walker, His Majesty's Chief Inspector of Mines, who had himself been in the pit during the rescue attempts. The miners, through the North Wales Miners' Association, were represented by Sir Stafford Cripps; the mine owners, mindful of the fact they could face criminal charges, hired a formidable legal team including Hartley Shawcross. Two mining assessors, one approved by the miners and the other by the colliery management, were also appointed to assist Walker and the inquiry. Local interest in the inquiry was enormous: as time went on the colliery officials called as witnesses faced increasing hostility from the public gallery, to the degree the atmosphere began to affect the quality of their evidence. The inquiry was marked by sensational allegations about the conduct of both sides: it was claimed that the deputies had after the accident held meetings together with the inspectorate, leading to a protest by miners, and there were several comments that the unions had paid miners to give evidence, causing an uproar in court. The miners' legal representatives presented several theories at the inquiry as to cause of the explosion. Evidence had rapidly emerged that for much of the time, and especially during the night shifts, the pit was not under the direct supervision of the under-managers and manager but was effectively run by the colliery officials - the overmen and deputies or 'firemen' - and often by the deputies alone. While the deputies called to give evidence all claimed the pit was safe, miners alleged that the deputies had actively encouraged unsafe working, and many said that the deputies ignored complaints about safety: one claimed \\"if you talked to a fireman it was like talking to a prop\\". Cripps said he believed an explosion was triggered on 142's Deep near to 95's district by shotfiring near a main airway, noting that the explosion had occurred about the time the 95's night shift deputy, Sam Matthias, would have arrived at this point. The blast had ignited a pocket of firedamp which, Cripps suggested, had accumulated in the airway because of inadequate ventilation and the lax attitude of the management to monitoring gas levels, contrary to Section 29 of the Coal Mines Act 1911. The heart of Cripps's argument was that the mine's management had focused quite calculatedly on maximum production, and that the deputies had accordingly been encouraged to ignore safety regulations. While the regulations also gave individual miners safety responsibility, many said in evidence that they were unwilling to speak out for fear of victimisation at the hands of the deputies, or that they would lose their jobs. The assessor approved by the miners, Joseph Jones, also theorised that a large quantity of methane gas, which had accumulated at the coal face in the 14's district, might have been ignited through an accident with a safety lamp or from a spark from a mechanised coalcutter. Jones was sharply critical of the management, stating that 14's was a \\"veritable gasometer\\", that there had been \\"flagrant and persistent breaches of the Coal Mines Act and General Regulations\\" and that the deputy responsible for ordering the rescue men into 20's airway was \\"guilty of manslaughter\\". Both Cripps and Jones suggested the Inspectorate itself was partly culpable for the explosion through its failure to enforce the Regulations: Jones noted the inadequate work of the local and divisional inspectors, Dominy and Charlton, at Gresford in the months leading up to the disaster and Cripps argued the Inspectorate had an interest in turning a blind eye to safety failings. Cripps went so far as to describe Dominy's inspections as \\"an absolute farce\\" and commented that it was \\"pathetic that a person who answers questions like that should be in charge of the inspection of mines in a large area of the country\\". The inquest was initially adjourned on 14 December 1934, pending reopening of the Dennis section to obtain further evidence. Although recovery teams wearing self-contained breathing apparatus re-entered the sealed pit in May 1935, both government inspectors and officials from the Westminster and United Collieries Group would not allow any further attempts to be made to access the Dennis section. Evidence of 'heating' in the air samples taken beyond the stoppings, and the consequent risks of restarting fires, were cited as the reason: Walker agreed, though at the time of writing his report he hoped \\"that this heating will subside in time and that then it will be safe to re-enter the Dennis Section\\". As there were no other reports concerning the deeper parts of the section, the inquiry considered explanations presented by the legal representatives of the pit's management and by the inspectors. The divisional inspector, Charlton, countered the miners' theories by suggesting that firedamp had actually accumulated further up the Dennis main road just beyond the Clutch. This gas was ignited at the Clutch when a telephone was used to warn miners of the influx of firedamp. Shawcross suggested that the explosion might have been caused by the spontaneous heating of a pillar of coal, based on reports of a burning smell in the area of the Clutch prior to the disaster. Shawcross had been able to demonstrate that the evidence of the miners with respect to stone dusting on the main haulage roads was exaggerated or untrue, and used this to cast doubt on their reports of gas and dangerous shotfiring practices at the face. The assessor chosen by the mine owners, John Brass, also argued that the explosion, judging by the positions in which the bodies of the haulage men were found, had taken place at the Clutch, and that the gas had come from a new drift being driven from there to 29's for ventilation. Brass dismissed the miners' testimonies of poor conditions in 14's as \\"extravagant and contradictory\\", claiming that the district's high productivity would have been impossible if lamps were constantly being extinguished by gas, and stating that witnesses had claimed to smell gas when \\"firedamp has no smell such as has been described\\". A year before the inquiry published its conclusion, coal production resumed at Gresford from the South- East Martin section in January 1936. In 1937 the inquiry published its findings. Despite being presented with evidence of management failures, a lack of safety measures, bad working practices and poor ventilation in the pit, Walker drew very cautious conclusions about the cause in his final verdict. This was largely because the two assessors chosen by the miners and by the pit's management, and the barristers representing them, had given widely different suggestions as to the source of the explosion; though Walker stated he had \\"grave suspicions\\" regarding shotfiring near an airway in 95's, the cause suggested by Cripps. Unusually, as neither Jones nor Brass agreed with Walker's findings, both appended individual reports to the main text. Without any decisive evidence, Walker's conclusions did not attribute any outright blame or definitive cause for the disaster. But in a debate in the House of Commons in February 1937 following the release of Walker's report, the politician David Grenfell condemned the management of the colliery because the miners' testimonies had told: > ...of lamps having been extinguished by gas, blowing the gas about with a > banjack, of protests and quarrels about firing shots in the presence of gas. > There is no language in which one can describe the inferno of 14's. There > were men working almost stark naked, clogs with holes bored through the > bottom to let the sweat run out, 100 shots a day fired on a face less than > 200 yards wide, the air thick with fumes and dust from blasting, the banjack > hissing to waft the gas out of the face into the unpacked waste, a space 200 > yards long and 100 yards wide above the wind road full of inflammable gas > and impenetrable for that reason. Later in 1937, legal proceedings were started in Wrexham's petty sessions court against the pit manager, the under-manager and United & Westminster Collieries Limited, the owners of the mine. Aside from the evidence of poor working practices, it was discovered that Bonsall had after the accident instructed an assistant surveyor, William Cuffin, to falsify records of ventilation measurements during several weeks when none had actually been taken. However, the court dismissed most of the charges without the mine owners ever being called to give evidence. The only conviction against the management at Gresford Colliery was for inadequate record-keeping, for which Bonsall was fined ¬£150 plus costs. Permission to re-enter the Dennis section was never given, and no examination or inspection of the deeper parts of Dennis was ever undertaken. This decision was widely perceived by the public as a deliberate attempt by the mine owners and Inspectorate to cover up any evidence of their culpability in the cause of the explosion. The miners' unions continued to press for entry into the sealed districts to recover bodies, with Grenfell and senior union officials including Herbert Smith and Joe Hall of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain volunteering to lead the recovery teams personally, but the matter was finally settled when the three Gresford rescue teams themselves said they would follow the Inspectorate's advice in the matter. It is probable that resentment at the dominance of the North Wales industry by Yorkshire, represented by Smith and Hall, played a part in their decision. Legacy HRH Prince of Wales in 1982 Bonsall was portrayed by Cripps and others as a ruthless and cynical manager, but researchers now think that he is more likely to have been a \\"weak man driven beyond his capabilities\\" whose evidence was affected by the extreme exhaustion and stress of enduring 4000 questions and 20 hours of cross-examination at the inquiry. One exchange between Cripps and Bonsall regarding the ventilation of 29's district largely destroyed the manager's credibility and left him in a state of near collapse. Bonsall was, however, effectively a substitute for the real target of the miners' anger, the owners of Gresford. By contrast there was widespread sympathy for Williams, the under-manager, despite him facing equally harsh questioning from Cripps. Williams was understood to have recognised the dangerous conditions on taking the job at Gresford and had begun to rectify them: he also had three sons working in the pit, giving him, it was suggested, a personal interest in its safety. Cripps used the evidence obtained at the inquiry to call for nationalisation of the coal industry. This eventually occurred in 1947 when the pit, and others like it, were taken over by the National Coal Board. As part of the takeover agreement, nearly all the operating records and correspondence relating to the private management of Gresford Colliery were deliberately destroyed by the trustee. Gresford Colliery finally closed on economic grounds in November 1973. In the 1980s the site was redeveloped as an industrial estate. In 1982 a memorial to the victims of the disaster was erected nearby; it was constructed using a wheel from the old pit-head winding gear. The last direct link to the disaster, Mr Eddie Edwards, who began work in the mine aged 14, and who participated in the rescue efforts, died on 6 January 2016, aged 102. Music The disaster is commemorated by the hymn tune \\"Gresford\\". Known as \\"The Miners' Hymn\\", it was written by a miner named Robert Saint from Hebburn, South Tyneside. The tune remains popular with many colliery brass bands, and is always played at the annual Miners Picnics around the North of England, especially at the Durham Miners' Gala. \\"The Gresford Disaster\\" is a folk song in 6/8 time which appears to have been published anonymously and distributed as a broadside shortly after the colliery explosion. It has been widely recorded, including versions by Ewan MacColl, The Hennessys, Alex Campbell and The Albion Band. It is included in the Roud Folk Song Index (no:3089), and is discussed by Roy Palmer in his 1974 book Poverty Knock: a picture of industrial life in the nineteenth century through songs, ballads and contemporary accounts (despite being a 20th-century composition). The song \\"The Colliers\\" on Seth Lakeman's 2006 album Freedom Fields is about the disaster.

The earliest mention of Daoxin is in the Hs√º kao-seng chuan (Further Biographies of Eminent Monks (645) (Pin-yin, Xu gao-seng zhuan; Japanese, Zoku kosoden;) by Tao-hsuan (d. 667)) A later source, the Ch'√ºan fa pao chi (Annals of the Transmission of the Dharma-treasure), written around 712, gives further details of Daoxin's life.McRae, 1986:31-33 As with many of the very earliest Chan masters, the accuracy of the historical record is questionable and in some cases, contradictory in details.‚ÄúGiven the tenuous nature of our sources, the sequence of the first five Ch√°n patriarchs cannot be determined with full certainty.‚Äù Dumoulin (1994, 1998) p 98 The following biography is the traditional story of Daoxin, culled from various sources, including the Wudeng Huiyuan (Compendium of Five Lamps), compiled in the early thirteenth century by the monk Dachuan Lingyin Puji (1179‚Äì1253). Biography Daoxin, whose surname was Si-ma, was born in Yongning County, Qizhou ÔºàChinese: Ëï≤Â∑ûÂ∫úÊ∞∏ÂÆÅÂéøÔºâ. (The former Guangji CountyÔºà742-1987), now Wuxue CityÔºà1987-Ôºâ, Hubei Province) ÔºàChinese: ÂâçÊπñÂåóÁúÅÂπøÊµéÂéøÔºåÁé∞Âú®ÁöÑÊ≠¶Á©¥Â∏ÇÔºâ.McRae, 1986:33 He began studying Buddhism at the age of seven and although his teacher was a man of impure moral conduct, Daoxin maintained the Buddhist morality on his own without his teacher‚Äôs knowledge for five or six years. According to Jianzhi Sengcan‚Äôs chronicle in the Compendium of Five Lamps, Daoxin met Sengcan when he was only fourteen years old. The following exchange took place: :Daoxin: I ask for the Master‚Äôs compassion. Please instruct me on how to achieve release. :Sengcan: Is there someone who constrains [binds] you? :Daoxin: There is no such person. :Sengcan: Why then seek release when you are constrained by no one? Zong (see also :Ferguson, 2000:24) Upon hearing these words, Daoxin was enlightened. He attended to Sengcan for the next nine years. When Sengcan went to Mount Lo-fu he refused permission for Daoxin to follow him, saying ‚ÄúThe Dharma has been transmitted from Patriarch [Bodhi]dharma to me. I am going to the South and will leave you [here] to spread and protect [the Dharma].‚Äù(from the Ch‚Äô√ºan fa pao chi) McRae, 1986:261 For ten years he studied with Zhikai at Great Woods Temple on Mount Lu. Zhikai (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Shih-k‚Äôai) was an adept of the Tiantai and Sanlun schools and also chanted the Buddha‚Äôs name as part of his practice; Daoxin‚Äôs practice was influenced by these other schools.Ferguson, 2000:26 (note: McRae disputes that Daoxin met Zhikai; see p 283, n. 60) Daoxin received ordination as a monk in 607. In 617, Daoxin and some of his disciples traveled to Ji Province (modern Ji'an City in Jiangxi Province) and entered the town, which was under siege by bandits. Daoxin taught the residents the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra (Perfection of Wisdom) which caused the bandits to abandon their siege. Daoxin eventually settled at East Mountain Temple on Shuangfeng (\\"Twin Peaks\\") where he taught Chan Buddhism for thirty years and attracted large numbers of practitioners, some records say five hundred laypeople and monks.McRae, 1986:32 In 643 the emperor Tai Zong invited Daoxin to the capital city but Daoxin refused to appear. Three times the emperor sent emissaries and three times Daoxin refused the invitation. The third time the emperor instructed to either bring back Daoxin or his head. When the emissary related this instruction to Daoxin, Daoxin exposed and stretched out his neck to allow the emissary to chop off his head. The envoy was so shocked he reported this event to the emperor, who then honored Daoxin as an exemplary Buddhist monk.Ferguson, 2000:28) In August, 651, Daoxin ordered his students to build his stupa as he was soon to die. According to the Hs√º kao-seng chuan, when asked by his disciples to name a successor, Daoxin replied, ‚ÄúI have made many deputations during my life.‚Äù He then died.The Ch‚Äô√ºan fa-pao chi (Annals of the Transmission of the Dharma-treasure) gives a different story regarding who would receive transmission upon Daoxin‚Äôs death. When asked, Daoxin paused and replied with a sigh, ‚ÄúHung-jen is a bit better [than any of the others]‚Äù (McRae, 1986:263) The emperor Dai Zong honored Daoxin with the posthumous name ‚ÄúDayi‚Äù (Great Healer). Teachings The teachings of Daoxin (and his successor, Hongren) are known as the East Mountain Teachings, a precursor to the flowering of Chan on a national scale some seventy-five years later at the beginning of the eighth century.McRae, 1986:30 Of significance is that Daoxin was the first Chan master to settle at one spot for an extended period of time, developing a stable community life which would lead to monastic Chan communities throughout China. Dumoulin p 99 speculates that as alms begging was no longer viable (due to the size of Daoxin‚Äôs community and its relative isolation from centers of population), the monks had no choice but to work in the fields and develop administrative skills as well as engage in meditation practice.McRae disputes this, asserting that the community received outside financial support and that it was ‚Äúunlikely that the monks ‚Ä¶maintained an agricultural operation of any significant size‚Äù p 286 n. 86 Henceforth, Chan practice could no longer be confined to the meditation hall but the spirit of practice had to extend to the daily duties as well. The need to extend religious practice to all aspects of one‚Äôs life became a central theme in Chan teachings. As the record of Daoxin‚Äôs teachings (The Five Gates of Daoxin) did not appear until the second decade of the eighth century, after Hongren‚Äôs record, its historical accuracy is in some doubt.see McRae, 2003:37-38 The Chronicle of the Lankavatara Masters, which appeared in the early eighth century, has Daoxin quoting from the Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wisdom) and Pure Land sutras Dumoulin (1994, 1988) p 99 but whether study of these sutras formed part of Daoxin‚Äôs teachings is unlikely.McRae, (1986:33) calls the anecdote in the Chronicle ‚Äúentertaining, but it cannot be taken seriously‚Äù. It is clear, however, that Daoxin taught meditation. The Zen scholar Seizan Yanagida stated that the expression ‚Äúsamadhi of one practice‚Äù was the heart of Daoxin‚Äôs practice.cited in Dumoulin (1994, 1988) p 99 The Five Gates of Daoxin quotes him as saying ‚ÄúBuddha is the mind. Outside of the mind there is no Buddha.‚Äù Dumoulin (1994, 1988) p. 100 In a later chronicle he is quoted exhorting his students to ‚ÄúSit earnestly in meditation! Sitting in meditation is basic to all else‚Ä¶.Do not read the sutras, discuss with no one!‚Äù (ibid) On his deathbed, the Compendium of Five Lamps records that Daoxin said, ‚ÄúAll of the myriad dharmas of the world are to be dropped away. Each of you, protect this understanding and carry it into the future.‚Äù Ferguson, 2000:28 References Sources *Dumoulin, Heinrich (1994, 1998) Zen Buddhism: A History, Volume I, India and China, Simon & Schuster and Prentice Hall International *Ferguson, Andy (2000) Zen‚Äôs Chinese heritage: the masters and their teachings, *McRae, John R (1986) The Northern School and the Formation of Early Ch'an Buddhism, University of Hawaii Press, *Zong, Desheng (2005) Three Language-Related Methods in Early Chinese Chan Buddhism, Philosophy East and West 55.4 (Oct 2005) p 584 (19) Further reading *Chappell, David W.

Horne and starring Laurel and Hardy. It was produced by Hal Roach for Hal Roach Studios. Although the film begins in Scotland, a large part of the action is set in India. Plot After escaping from jail where they had \\"one more week to serve,\\" Laurel and Hardy travel to Scotland as stowaways on a cattle boat, where Laurel (as \\"Stanley McLaurel\\") believes he is heir to his grandfather's fortune. As it turns out, Laurel has only been bequeathed a set of bagpipes and a snuff container. Use of the latter causes Hardy, trying to demonstrate to Laurel the proper way to use snuff, to fly off an old bridge. His clothes are soaked. In the boarding house, Laurel swaps their overcoats for a large fish for dinner. In quick succession the fish \\"shrizzles\\" to about 1/10 its size, Hardy's pants are burnt and ruined, and an attempt to hide the still-hot stove results in the landlady throwing the two out and confiscating their luggage for non-payment of rent. Receiving an ad for a tailor's offer of a new suit, Laurel and Hardy accidentally go to the wrong floor and join a Scottish regiment of the British Army and travel to India, where they frequently run afoul of their Sergeant Major (Jimmy Finlayson), and help their friend Alan (William Janney) reunite with his love (and Laurel's cousin) Lorna McLaurel (June Lang).

Psychologists have indicated that though many people obsess over film, television, sport and pop stars, the only common factor between them is that they are all figures in the public eye. This is commonly found on sites such as Twitter and Instagram. Classifications = Simple obsessional = Simple obsessional stalking constitutes a majority of all stalking cases, anywhere from 69‚Äì79%, and is dominated by males. This form of stalking is generally associated with individuals who have shared previous personal relationships with their victims. However, this is not necessarily the case between a common member of the public exhibiting celebrity worship syndrome and the famous person with whom they are obsessed. Individuals that meet the criteria of being labeled as a ‚Äúsimple obsessional stalker‚Äù tend to share a set of characteristics including an inability to have successful personal relationships in their own lives, social awkwardness, feelings of powerlessness, a sense of insecurity, and very low self-esteem. Of these characteristics, low self-esteem plays a large role in the obsession that these individuals develop with their victim, in this case, the famous person. If the individual is unable to have any sort of connection to the celebrity with which they are obsessed, their own sense of self-worth may decline. = Love obsessional = As the name suggests, individuals who demonstrate this sort of stalking behavior develop a love obsession with somebody who they have no personal relation to. Love obsessional stalking accounts for roughly 20‚Äì25% of all stalking cases. The people that demonstrate this form of stalking behavior are likely to suffer from a mental disorder, commonly either schizophrenia or paranoia. Individuals that are love obsessional stalkers often convince themselves that they are in fact in a relationship with the subject of their obsession. For example, a woman who had been stalking David Letterman for a total of five years claimed to be his wife when she had no personal connection to him. Other celebrities who have fallen victim to this form of stalking include Jennifer Aniston, Halle Berry, Jodie Foster, and Mila Kunis, along with numerous other A-list stars. = Erotomanic = Erotomanic, originating from the word erotomania, refers to stalkers who genuinely believe that their victims are in love with them. The victims in this case are almost always well known within their community or within the media, meaning that they can range from being small town celebrities or famous personalities from Hollywood. Comprising less than 10% of all stalking cases, erotomanic stalkers are the least common. Unlike simple-obsessional stalkers, a majority of the individuals in this category of stalking are women. Similar to love- obsessional stalkers, the behavior of erotomanic stalkers may be a result of an underlying psychological disorder such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. Individuals who suffer from erotomania tend to believe that the celebrity with whom they are obsessed with is utilizing the media as a way to communicate with them by sending special messages or signals. Although these stalkers have unrealistic beliefs, they are less likely to seek any form of face-to-face interaction with their celebrity obsession, therefore posing less of a threat to them. = Entertainment-social = This level of admiration is linked to a celebrity‚Äôs ability to capture the attention of their fans. Entertainment-social celebrity worship is used to describe a relatively low level of obsession. An example of a typical entertainment- social attitude would be ‚ÄúMy friends and I like to discuss what my favorite celebrity has done.‚Äù It may also be seen in the form of obsessively following celebrities on social media, although considered the lowest level of celebrity worship. It has been seen to have a number of negative effects with regards the development of unhealthy eating tendencies, poor body image and low self esteems especially in young adolescents. This can be supported by a study carried out on a group of female adolescents between the ages of (17‚Äì20). = Intense-personal = This is an intermediate level of obsession that is associated with neuroticism as well as behaviors linked to psychoticism. An example of an intense-personal attitude toward a celebrity would include claims such as ‚ÄúI consider my favorite celebrity to be my soul mate.‚Äù It has been found that in particular, people who worship celebrities in this manner often have low self-esteem with regards to their body type, especially if they think that the celebrity is physically attractive. The effects of intense- personal celebrity worship on body image are seen in some cases of cosmetic surgery. Females who have high levels of obsession are more accepting of cosmetic surgery than those who do not obsess over celebrities to this extent. = Borderline-pathological = This classification is the most severe level of celebrity worship. Mental health Evidence indicates that poor mental health is correlated with celebrity worship. Researchers have examined the relationship between celebrity worship and mental health in United Kingdom adult samples. One study found evidence to suggest that the intense-personal celebrity worship dimension was related to higher levels of depression and anxiety. Similarly, another study in 2004, found that the intense-personal celebrity worship dimension was not only related to higher levels of depression and anxiety, but also higher levels of stress, negative affect, and reports of illness. Both these studies showed no evidence for a significant relationship between either the entertainment-social or the borderline- pathological dimensions of celebrity worship and mental health. Another correlated pathology examined the role of celebrity interest in shaping body image cognitions. Among three separate UK samples (adolescents, students, and older adults), individuals selected a celebrity of their own sex whose body/figure they liked and admired, and then completed the Celebrity Attitude Scale along with two measures of body image. Significant relationships were found between attitudes toward celebrities and body image among female adolescents only. The findings suggested that, in female adolescence, there is an interaction between intense-personal celebrity worship and body image between the ages of 14 and 16, and some tentative evidence suggest that this relationship disappears at the onset of adulthood, which is between the ages of 17 and 20. These results are consistent with the authors who stress the importance of the formation of relationships with media figures, and suggest that relationships with celebrities perceived as having a good body shape may lead to a poor body image in female adolescents. This can be again supported by a study carried out, which investigated the link between mass media and its direct correlation to poor self-worth/ body image in a sample group of females between the ages of (17‚Äì20). Within a clinical context the effect of celebrity might be more extreme, particularly when considering extreme aspects of celebrity worship. Relationships between the three classifications of celebrity worship (entertainment-social, intense-personal and borderline- pathological celebrity worship and obsessiveness), ego-identity, fantasy proneness and dissociation were examined. Two of these variables drew particular attention: fantasy proneness and dissociation. Fantasy proneness involves fantasizing for a duration of time, reporting hallucinatory intensities as real, reporting vivid childhood memories, having intense religious and paranormal experiences. Dissociation is the lack of a normal integration of experiences, feelings, and thoughts in everyday consciousness and memory; in addition, it is related to a number of psychiatric problems. Though low levels of celebrity worship (entertainment-social) are not associated with any clinical measures, medium levels of celebrity worship (intense-personal) are related to fantasy proneness (approximately 10% of the shared variance), while high levels of celebrity worship (borderline- pathological) share a greater association with fantasy proneness (around 14% of the shared variance) and dissociation (around 3% of the shared variance, though the effect size of this is small and most probably due to the large sample size). This finding suggests that as celebrity worship becomes more intense, and the individual perceives having a relationship with the celebrity, the more the individual is prone to fantasies. It has been proven that celebrity worship syndrome can lead to the manifestation of unhealthy tendencies such as materialism and compulsive buying, which can be supported by a study carried out by Robert.A.Reeves, Gary.A.Baker and Chris.S.Truluck. The results of this study link high rates of celebrity worship to high rates of materialism and compulsive buying. \\"Celebrity worship\\" is a term coined by Lynn E. McCutcheon, Diane D. Ashe, James Houran in a series of articles published primarily in the North American Journal of Psychology and a non-peer reviewed working paper series called Current Issues in Social Psychology, the Journal of Psychology and British Journal of Psychology. A number of historical, ethnographic, netnographic and auto-ethnographic studies in diverse academic disciplines such as film studies, media studies, cultural studies and consumer research, which ‚Äì unlike McCutcheon et al. focused mainly on a student sample (with two exceptions) ‚Äì have actually studied real fans in the field, have come to very different conclusions that are more in line with Horton & Wohl's original concept of parasocial interaction or an earlier study by Leets. The way in which female celebrities are portrayed in the media has an adverse effect on the way that young women, especially teenage girls, view themselves. This has a catastrophic effect on the self-image of these women. This poor self-image may lead to these women developing unhealthy eating habits and becoming fixated with obtaining what is deemed to be the perfect body.

She is best known as the 2005 winner of the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition. Cabell was born in Panorama City, California. Her grandfather, Luther Lanier, was the first African American Chief in the Sheriff's Department in Los Angeles. She is of African American, Korean and Caucasian ancestry, and was brought up in the California beach town of Ventura. As a child, she did not listen to classical music, but she did play the flute in her junior high school band. She and a classmate used to play basketball together and would \\"imitate opera singers\\". Her mother encouraged her to join the school choir and she tried out for a school musical and was a success. Early life and education At the age of 15, Cabell began to notice that \\"People obviously can hear something, even if I can't\\", she said. \\"That's sort of how it's been: I've been walking through doors as they've been presented to me\\". She had three years of private singing lessons in high school with soprano voice teacher Linda Brice (MM, Indiana University School of Music) and voice instructor and coach Vincent Sorisio (MM, California State University, Northridge; BM Indiana University School of Music.) It was with Sorisio that, at the age of 18 in 1997, she took 2nd prize in the NATS competition for the Western Region. Subsequently Sorisio continued to teach Miss Cabell; he prepared her for her auditions for various music schools and public performances. At Eastman Nicole studied with John Maloy. She then entered the Juilliard School, but only for a very brief time, as she had been asked to join the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists at the Lyric Opera of Chicago where she remained for three years. During this period of time the Center's then-director, Richard Pearlman, famous soprano and Director of Vocal Studies Gianna Rolandi, and opera legend Marilyn Horne were her mentors. Cabell continues to study with Rolandi, who was the director of the newly renamed Ryan Opera Center. Cabell returned home to Ventura and performed for the Ventura Music Festival, which included a reunion with pianist Vincent Sorisio in a performance for her former school, Ventura High School in 2008. Debuts After winning the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition in June 2005, Cabell made her London d√©but on August 2, 2006 at The Proms, singing Benjamin Britten's Les Illuminations, with Sir Andrew Davis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

She also sang the role of Adina in L'elisir d'amore in Montpellier. She was planning to make her debut at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin in mid-December 2006, but due to the last- minute indisposition of soprano Angela Gheorghiu, Cabell was asked to step in, and her debut took place somewhat earlier - on 7 December - as Juliette in Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette alongside Neil Shicoff. She had previously sung the role at the Spoleto Festival USA in May 2006. Cabell made her debut with the Metropolitan Opera on December 22, 2008, singing the role of Pamina in The Magic Flute. In 2007, she gave her first solo recital at St John's Smith Square in London, sang the title role in Donizetti's Imelda de' Lambertazzi at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and Musetta in La boh√®me in Munich; during the Santa Fe Opera's 2007 summer festival season; at the Washington National Opera; and at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Repertoire Cabell's repertoire includes Pamina (Die Zauberfl√∂te), Juliette (Rom√©o et Juliette), The Countess (Le nozze di Figaro), Adina (L'elisir d'amore), The Vixen (The Cunning Little Vixen), Musetta (La boh√®me), Lauretta and La Ciesca (Gianni Schicchi), Clara (Porgy and Bess), La Princesse in Ravel's L'enfant et les sortil√®ges, La Femme in Poulenc's La voix humaine, Miss Jessel in The Turn of the Screw and Arsamenes in Xerxes. She has recently added the role of Ilia in Mozart's Idomeneo and will be performing the role of Mica√´la in \\"Carmen\\" at the Chicago Lyric Opera in the 2010-2011 season. Her concert repertoire includes Mahler's Symphonies No. 2 and 4, Poulenc's Gloria, Orff's Carmina Burana, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Tippett's A Child of Our Time, Andr√© Previn's Honey and Rue and Henryk G√≥recki's Symphony of Sorrowful Songs. Cabell has collaborated with major conductors such as Sir Andrew Davis, James Conlon, Daniel Barenboim, Antonio Pappano, Andr√© Previn and Sir Raymond Leppard. In 2011 she sang Donna Elvira in Cologne and Berlin, and was invited to be a commentator on the 2011 Cardiff Singer of the World competition.

At the end of the 1954 NSWRFL season Preston played for Newtown on the wing in their grand final loss to South Sydney. The 34 tries he scored in the 1954 season made him the competition's leading try scorer, and is also the Newtown club's record for most tries ever in a season. This record has never been bettered. His other winger in 1954, Kevin Considine, scored 22 tries in the same season, and their combined try total of 56 tries from a pair of club wingers is also a record.

This step is often referred to as \\"validation.\\" During the validation process, the prospect will call on as many franchisees as possible and conduct extensive interviews to gather information about the franchise opportunity. Interviewing franchisees is a valuable source of information for the prospect since it is a way to get unfiltered opinions about the franchise system. A complete list of current franchisees will be listed in a franchise's Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD). In addition, some franchisors will provide a list of current franchise owners to contact. Contacting franchisees can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience for the prospect, and for that reason many drop out of the investigation process at this stage. Franchisees are typically busy people; once contacted, many will openly and honestly share the lessons they've learned. While happy franchisees are generally a strong sign of a healthy franchise system, a prospect should expect some negative feedback. In fact, a prospect should seek out unhappy franchisees as diligently as happy ones, since their perspectives can help prospects identify potential pitfalls and set appropriate expectations. There are firms that independently survey franchisees and offer this validation service. Be certain to review the methodology used by the research company before using the data for making decisions.  Validation Topics  When talking to franchisees, a prospect should ask a wide range of questions. Some of the topic to cover include: 1\\\\. Training Programs and Opening Support - Determine how well the initial training programs and support through getting the first unit opened prepared the franchisees for opening and running their business. 2\\\\. Ongoing Training and Support - How effective is the ongoing support services of the franchisor in terms of helping franchisees deal with problems that come up in the running of their business. 3\\\\. Advertising, Marketing and Promotional Programs - Most franchisors collect marketing dollars from every franchisee into a pool that is spent to promote the brand. Determine whether the franchisees are happy and supportive of the way this process is handled. Note: This is typically the area you will find the most complaining about in any franchise you look at. 4\\\\. Quality of Products/Services ‚Äì Determine if the franchisees are happy with the quality of the services and/or products offered through the franchisor. 5\\\\. Franchisor/Franchisee Relations - Determine how the franchisees feel about the franchisor in general. Is the franchisor supportive, knowledgeable, responsive, accessible, organized, and trustworthy? 6\\\\. Financial Health ‚Äì Some franchisees will be guarded about revealing financial details of their operation but others will be open. Is the franchisee meeting his financial expectations? How much is his total investment in the business and over what time period? How long before they reached break-even?  Validation Services  It can be difficult to get a hold of enough franchisees to gather enough information for a proper validation process. Many systems recognize this and hire 3rd party validation services to assist their prospects through this stage. These services survey existing franchisees about their satisfaction on a wide variety of topics and publish the results. Typically the information provided by the service answers many questions for the prospect who can then focus energies finding answers to more specific questions, saving time and effort with all parties involved.

As she was a Christian from Kent, their marriage triggered the initial phase of the conversion of the pagan north of England to Christianity. Early life and marriage √Üthelburh was born in the late 6th century, as the daughter of King √Üthelberht of Kent (sometimes spelled Aethelberht) and his queen Bertha, and sister of Eadbald. In 625, she married Edwin of Northumbria as his second wife. A condition of their marriage was Edwin's conversion to Christianity and the acceptance of Paulinus's mission to convert the Northumbrians.Stowe 944: ' √Üthelburh‚Äôs children with Edwin were: Eanfl√¶d, Ethelhun, Wuscfrea and Edwen. Her daughter Eanfl√¶d grew up under the protection of her uncle, King Eadbald of Kent. Bede, Ecclesiastical History (2.20) states that √Üthelburh did not trust her brother, or Edwin's sainted successor Oswald, with the lives of Edwin's male descendants whom she sent to the court of King Dagobert I (her mother's cousin). Christianity and founding of monastery Saxon church at Lyminge founded by √Üthelburh in 633, excavated in 2019 Stone in Lyminge Church marking the burial site of the founder King Edwin‚Äôs conversion was due to his marriage to √Üthelburh, who brought her bishop Paulinus with her. Both √Üthelburh and her mother, Bertha, received letters from popes Gregory and Boniface respectively, urging them to do their Christian duty by converting their pagan husbands. Their daughter Eanflaed was one of the first to be baptized in Northumbria. After King Edwin was wounded, √Üthelburh's alarm caused an early onset of childbirth. Both the mother, as well as the infant, appeared to be in danger. The prayers of Paulinus were offered for the queen and child. After they recovered, 12 of the royal households, as well as the baby, were baptized by Edwin‚Äôs permission and request. According to the Kentish Royal Legend, after Edwin's death at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in 633, she returned to Kent. She then established one of the first Benedictine nunneries in England, at Lyminge, near Folkestone, which she led until her death in 647, and where her remains were later venerated. Modern research has shown that the buildings at Lyminge were designed to contain a convent of monks as well as of nuns. The church is built from Roman masonry, and was possibly built out of the fragments of a villa, which was customary practice by Anglo-Saxons, or it may have been a Roman basilica.

Early life and career Ellis was born in Carter County in northeastern Tennessee. With a rudimentary education, Ellis was a farmer and wagonmaker until volunteering for service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, serving in Company K, 5th Regular Tennessee Volunteer Infantry. Most of his war service was spent battling the \\"intestine foe\\" which would plague him for the rest of his life, ultimately leading to his death. He returned home from Mexico to regain his health and resume his expectedly ordinary life. Ellis married Martha May of Sussex County, Virginia, with whom he had seven children between 1852 and 1866. Civil War The Civil War found East Tennessee strongly divided in its loyalties with many citizens‚Äîlike Ellis‚Äîfavoring the Union. When Tennessee seceded, Confederate troops were sent in to control Union sympathizers. Ellis became involved in a failed plan to burn railroad bridges to precipitate an invasion by Union forces. Branded a bridge burner, a capital offense, Ellis lived in exile in the east Tennessee mountains. He eventually became a pilot, leading Unionists, Confederate deserters, prison escapees, slaves, and all manner of fugitives through the mountains into Kentucky or wherever the Union lines would advance. At the same time Ellis recruited for several regiments, provided information on Confederate activities to federal authorities, and maintained a mail service between mountain Unionists and their men in the Union army. Possibly the most successful of all such pilots, and despite a bounty on his head, Ellis always (often narrowly) escaped capture, and became known as \\"The Old Red Fox\\". War in the mountains was a brutal, bloody, often lawless affair, and the likelihood for the survival of Ellis and his family was enhanced by his reputation for extraordinary viciousness when crossed. Armed with the best weapons his contacts could secure, Ellis and his band of guerillas proved a formidable force. In all, Ellis made 20 expeditions, covering 8,000 miles, leading approximately 4,000 fugitives through the mountains. Over half of these joined the Union army. Ellis was a constant aggravation to Confederate authorities, and contributed incalculably to the morale of the beleaguered Unionist east Tennesseans. As the war waned and his piloting duties were less in demand, he formally joined the Union army as captain of Company A, 13th Regiment, Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry. His official duties included leading raids against Confederates in northeast Tennessee counties, guiding federal troops through the northwestern North Carolina mountains, and tracking and arresting federal soldiers who were deserters. Ellis mustered out of service in September 1865. Later life After the war, trying to eke out a living in the war-savaged mountains and often the victim of his own altruistic nature, Ellis petitioned the U.S. Congress for compensation for his efforts on behalf of the Union. He was recognized with an award of $3,060‚Äîabout two years' pay and allowances for an army captain. In 1867 Ellis first published his war memoirs, Thrilling Adventures of Daniel Ellis. Ellis was probably assisted in writing the book by William R. Fitzsimmons, who was a prominent East Tennessee newspaperman, and whose name appears as \\"part-proprietor\\" on Ellis' contract with the publisher, Harper & Brothers (for an examination of Ellis' authorship of Thrilling Adventures, see Ellis, Allen. \\"The Lost Adventures of Daniel Ellis.\\" in The Journal of East Tennessee History no. 74 (2002), pp. 58‚Äì68). Despite the popularity of his book, and partly because of his tendency to give copies away, Ellis remained in poor financial straits. In 1878 Ellis was chosen, by virtue of his reputation for integrity and courage, to act as bodyguard in the congressional campaign of Robert Love Taylor. Taylor rewarded Ellis with a position within the U.S. House of Representatives. Years later, writer James R. Gilmore (\\"Edmund Kirke\\") was shocked to find Ellis, whom he considered \\"the hero of the late war\\" living in obscurity and poverty in the east Tennessee mountains. Gilmore worked to provide more government compensation for the old scout, and used him as a supporting character in one of his novels, A Mountain-White Heroine (1889). Due to continued Confederate loyalties in the east Tennessee region, the nature of Ellis' wartime activities, and to reactions toward his vitriolic book, Ellis' life was threatened for years after the war. As long as he was able, he was compelled to travel well-armed and always on the alert. Nonetheless, Ellis lived into old age, always preferring to walk when possible, recounting his exploits, and enjoying a measure of local celebrity. Ellis is buried in the family cemetery near Elizabethton, Tennessee. Influence today Today Ellis is hardly remembered outside of Carter County, with his legacy perhaps swept up in a healing repression of the horrors, cruelty, and upheaval of the Civil War in the Appalachian mountains. However, his writings seem to be emerging from obscurity as the Civil War experience of the Appalachian south gains more attention from historians. Thrilling Adventures of Daniel Ellis remains in print and, despite its narrative excesses, is largely regarded as an invaluable, if highly partisan, accounting of conditions in wartime Appalachia. Some modern critics feel Ellis exaggerates his own role, while Ellis' contemporaries maintain that he was too modest to adequately convey his war record. Ellis' wartime tales have also made some recent inroads into popular culture: *Thrilling Adventures was used as a source (and inspired a scene or two) by Charles Frazier for his celebrated novel, Cold Mountain, which was later adapted into a major motion picture released in 2003. *A character based upon Ellis (and Ellis himself) appears in Cameron Judd's \\"Mountain War Trilogy\\": **The Phantom Legion: A Novel of Unionist Resistance in Tennessee and North Carolina, February‚ÄìDecember 1863 (New York, 1997). **Season of Reckoning: A Novel of Unionist Resistance in Tennessee and North Carolina, January 1864 ‚Äì February 1866 (New York, 1997). **The Shadow Warriors: A Novel of Unionist Resistance in Tennessee and North Carolina, September 1860 ‚Äì January 1863 (New York, 1997).

Ideology and Industrial Relations\\" article by Braham Dabscheck in Journal of Industrial Relations JIR December 1987 Vol. 29 No. 4 425-449, accessed 17 September 2010 It advocates full workplace deregulation, contains some Liberal MPs as members and is seen to be of the New Right. It was created in March 1986 after John Stone, Peter Costello, Barrie Purvis, and Ray Evans organised a seminar aimed at discussing the Hancock Report and other industrial matters. Regular contributors to the Society's publications have been Ray Evans, Adam Bisits and Des Moore, the Director of the Institute for Private Enterprise. Adam Bisits was the President of the Society until 2017, replacing Evans, who stepped down in 2010. The Society is named after Henry Richard Nicholls (6 January 183013 August 1912), an editor of the Hobart newspaper The Mercury, who in 1911 published an editorial criticising H. B. Higgins, then a High Court judge and President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, accusing Higgins of behaving in a politically partisan and unjudicial manner after attacking a barrister. This led to Nicholls being prosecuted for contempt of court by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, only to be acquitted by the full bench of the High Court. (1911) 12 CLR 280 at p.286 (\\"if any Judge ... were to make a public utterance of such character as to be likely to impair the confidence of the public ... in the impartiality of the Court ... fair comment, would, so far from being a contempt of Court, be for the public benefit\\") Aims and objectives The Society supports the deregulation of the Australian Industrial Relations System, including the abolition of the award system, the widespread use of individual employment contracts and the lowering of minimum wages. The Society only believes in limited labour market regulation, as it believes that excessive minimum wages and employment inflexibility lead to higher unemployment and lower productivity. Since its inception, the Society has advocated what it views as reform of the labour market in order to ensure what it views as Australia's international competitiveness and prosperity. On its website, the Society lists its aims and objectives: * To promote discussion about the operation of industrial relations in Australia including the system of determining wages and other conditions of employment. * To promote the rule of law with respect to employers and employee organisations alike. * To promote reform of the current wage-fixing system. * To support the necessity for labour relations to be conducted in such a way as to promote economic development in Australia. Politics The Society has strong ties with the Liberal Party of Australia. For example, former Federal Treasurer Peter Costello was one of the society's founding members. In 1986, then Prime Minister and former president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Bob Hawke, branded the Society as a group of \\"political troglodytes and economic lunatics\\". Former Federal Finance Minister Nick Minchin caused controversy in early 2006 in a speech at a Society function where he told the audience that the coalition \\"knew its reform to WorkChoices were not popular but the process of change must continue\\", and that \\"there is still a long way to go... awards, the IR commission, all the rest of it...\\" The Australian Labor Party has stated that \\"We know the HR Nicholls society supports the abolition of awards, supports the abolition of the minimum wage, supports the abolition of the independent umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission\\".Australian Labor Party : Senator Nick Minchin And The HR Nicholls Society; Alp Internal Matters In 2007, the Society criticised the WorkChoices legislation for creating even more regulation. The Society, which in fact supports deregulation of the labour market to the extent that employers and employees simply form contracts with each other and then deal with any disputes via the courts, admonished the WorkChoices model particularly for its length and the amount of red tape, claiming it was \\"all about regulation\\" and comparing it to the \\"old Soviet system of command and control\\", as well as on federalist grounds saying \\"This attempt on his part to diminish the role of the states, to concentrate all power in Canberra, is very much to Australia's detriment\\". Society President Ray Evans stated that in creating WorkChoices \\"John Howard has assumed an omnipotence that Labor will inherit and to which no mortal should aspire. It will end in tears.\\" Des Moore stated on behalf of the Society that \\"The HR Nicholls Society is very disappointed with the work choices changes.\\" External links *Official site References Category:Political advocacy groups in Australia Category:Think tanks based in Australia Category:1986 establishments in Australia ","title":"H.

Canon Jean-Marie-Robert de Lamennais (or de la Mennais) (1780‚Äì1860) was a Breton Catholic priest, and brother of the noted philosopher Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais, whom he influenced in their youth. He was a leading figure in the revival of the Catholic Church in France after the French Revolution, involved in founding three religious institutes as part of this effort. Pope Paul VI proclaimed him to be Venerable in 1966 and his cause of canonization is ongoing. Life =Early life= Lamennais was born at Saint-Malo, then in the ancient Province of Brittany, on 8 September 1780, the son of Robert de Lamennais, a wealthy merchant who had recently received a coat of arms from the king, and Marie des Saudrais. He was five years old when his mother died, and as a result, he and his younger brother were sent for education to an uncle, Robert des Saudrais, at La Ch√™naie, an estate near Saint-Malo. During the period of the Revolution, the family sheltered non- juring priests who would lead Mass secretly in their home in the middle of the night. Jean-Marie began to express an interest in priesthood. In October 1790 he made his First Communion and received Confirmation from Gabriel Cortois de Pressigny, the last Bishop of Saint-Malo, who went into exile the following May. The Reign of Terror came to Brittany in December 1793. Their father Robert was arrested and barely escaped the guillotine. Soon after he had returned from exile, Bishop Cortois de Pressigny installed Lamennais as a subdeacon on 21 December 1801 at the chapel of the Ursulines in Paris. The following year Lamennais helped the former rector of a secondary school previously run by the Church, closed by the Revolution, to re-open the institution. To house the revived school, he and his brother, Hugues-Felicit√© purchased a former hospital. He was ordained a deacon at the Cathedral of Rennes on 24 September 1803 by Bishop Jean-Baptiste-Marie de Maille, Bishop of Rennes. =Pastor and author= Lamennais was ordained a priest by de Maille on 4 May 1804,Houssay, Yannick. \\"Jean-Marie de Lamennais\\", √âglise catholique en France and was quickly named Vicar of the diocese for the region of Saint- Malo, based at the former cathedral of the local diocese there which had been suppressed under the recent Concordat of 1801 with the Holy See. In 1807, upon the death of the rector, the College of Saint-Malo was converted into a minor seminary and the Lamennais brothers both joined the faculty of the school. Together the brothers wrote two major works, Reflections on the State of the Church in France in the 18th century and Its Current Situation and The Tradition of the Church on the Institution of Bishops, which they published anonymously in Paris in 1808. The books urged a religious revival in the nation with an active role by the clergy. They defended the Holy See as the true authority over the Catholic Church in France. The government of the Emperor Napoleon judged the ideas of the books dangerous and banned their further printing. The following year they published a translation of the work of the noted 16th-century spiritual writer, the Benedictine Abbot Louis de Blois. In 1810 Lamennais was named a canon of the cathedral of Rennes. The seminary which he had helped to found, however, was closed in 1812 due to an imperial decree of the previous year affecting Church instruction in the Empire. He was then appointed by the Bishop of Saint-Brieuc, Jean-Baptiste de Caffarelli du Falga, as Vicar General for the diocese. At the same time, the family business had suffered from the blockade of France, enforced by Great Britain as part of the Napoleonic Wars, to such an extent that it went bankrupt and he was required to oversee the legal process of the liquidation of the family estate. Upon the death of Caffarelli in January 1815, Lamennais was elected as the Vicar of the cathedral chapter, placing the administration of the diocese in his hands. He immediately became active in supporting the faith of the people of the diocese, supporting the re-establishment of religious communities and schools, and reforming the seminaries of the region. He led parish missions throughout the diocese. After the arrival of a new bishop for Saint-Brieuc in October 1819, Lamennais was appointed as Vicar General of that diocese.D√©gert, Antoine. \\"Jean-Marie-Robert de Lamennais.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 November 2015 He was also appointed as Vicar of the Grand Almoner of France, in charge of charitable works throughout the nation. Lamennais threw himself tirelessly into the work required of him. In addition to his holding the office of Vicar General for Saint-Brieuc, the Bishop of Rennes, his canonical superior, appointed him simultaneously to that same office for his own diocese. In addition to these other duties, he took an active role in the founding of the Congregation of St. Peter, dedicated to the administration of the diocesan seminary and of parish missions, having to act as its Superior General for a brief period. One prelate, Bishop John Dubois, S.S., of New York, was so impressed by Lamennais' dedication and capability after receiving help from him, that he appointed him Vicar General for his own diocese in the United States. =Founder= As he carried out his ministry, Lamennais became aware of a great problem of juvenile delinquency among the children of the working class, especially among the Breton population, who frequently had no access to education. He became convinced that education was a major means to combat this problem and sought to find a way to provide teachers to the rural population of the region. For this, he worked in the establishment of two religious congregations in the region. Daughters of Providence In November 1816, under the guidance of Lamennais, three young women formed a religious community dedicated to the education of the local youth and the care of orphans. The women were allowed to make private vows on Christmas Day 1818, and, after doing a canonical novitiate, they made religious profession on the Feast of the Assumption 15 August 1819 and were formally established as a congregation of Religious Sisters in 1821 called the Daughters of Providence. Their motherhouse is in Rennes. Brothers of Christian Instruction Lamennais was also concerned about the needs of the young boys in his diocese, and sought teachers for them. He initially sought the help of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, founded by John Baptist de la Salle to educate poor boys. He was stymied, however, as the regulations of those Brothers forbade their working alone, while the mission he envisioned often needed only one teacher for an isolated location with a small student population. He began to recruit young men he found working in the fields whom he considered capable of learning. He brought them into his own home and provided them a basic education. Lamennais learned of the establishment of a small group of Religious Brothers by the Abb√© Gabriel Deshayes (1767-1841), pastor of Auray and Vicar General of the Diocese of Vannes. They agreed to cooperate and, to this end, they signed an agreement on 6 June 1819 to provide their people teachers of \\"solid piety\\". With the arrival of the new bishop, Lamennais was able to direct more of his energies to this project. In response to this, the two priests began to recruit men to commit themselves to this life as part of a religious community. The first recruits received their canonical training from the Brothers of the Christian Schools. They then made a spiritual retreat at Auray, at the end of which, on 15 September 1820, they took religious vows, through which the institute became formally established as the Brothers of Christian Instruction. The community was successful and began to grow. Deshayes obtained a house in Plo√´rmel, which became their motherhouse in 1824. Missionaries of Rennes As part of his effort at the renewal of theological education for the local clergy and the spiritual life of the people of the diocese, Lamennais gathered a group of men to work in these ministries, both clergy and laymen, which was based at Saint-M√©en, who were called the Missionaries of Rennes. Soon after this, disillusioned with the failure of his vision, his brother F√©licit√© withdrew to the family estate of La Ch√™naie. Joined by a group of his supporters, there they formed a religious community called the Society of St. Peter. Soon the men recruited by Jean- Marie asked to be incorporated into that community. The community was then allowed to make religious vows by the Bishop of Rennes and became the Congregation of St. Peter. A seminary was opened at Malestroit, located near the Brothers' Motherhouse at Plo√´rmel. F√©licit√© remained at La Ch√™naie and taught the younger members of the new congregation and worked to spell out the ideas of his long-cherished project of forming a community of priests thoroughly equipped for the pressing needs he foresaw for the future of the Catholic Church in France. By 1829, however, F√©licit√© had withdrawn from all involvement in the Church, at which point Jean-Marie was appointed by the bishop as the Superior General of the small congregation. The members of the congregation still at the estate left for the seminary, and the congregation became one exclusively composed of clergy, taking the formal name of Mission Priests of the Immaculate Conception. At the time of Lamennais' death, there were some 200 members living in nine communities. It ceased to exist with the dissociation of religious orders in France.The Catholic Encyclopedia: Supplement. I-, Part 1, (Charles George Herbermann, ed.), 1922 =Death= After the death of Deshayes, Lamennais became the full-time Superior of the Brothers, and lived at the motherhouse. By the time of his death in December 1860, the Brothers had 852 members serving throughout France and its far flung colonies in the world, from French Guiana to Senegal. Legacy The Brothers of Christian Instruction have expanded their service throughout the world. As of the early 21st century, they had schools in Europe, Africa, North and South America and in Asia. In 1897 the Sisters established their first overseas mission in Canada, later followed by a school in England in 1903.

A TWAP strategy underpins more sophisticated ways of buying and selling than simply executing orders en masse: for example, dumping a huge number of shares in one block is likely to affect market perceptions, with an adverse effect on the price. High-volume traders use TWAP to execute their orders over a specific time so they trade to keep the price close to that which reflects the true market price. TWAP orders are a strategy of executing trades evenly over a specified time period. Volume-weighted average price (VWAP) balances execution with volume. Often, a VWAP trade will buy or sell 40% of a trade in the first half of the day and then the other 60% in the second half of the day.

Meyer (January 12, 1918 - December 30, 2007) was a composer, author, and philosopher. He contributed major works in the fields of aesthetic theory in music, and compositional analysis. Career Meyer studied at Columbia University, where he received both a B.A. in Philosophy, and an M.A. in Music. He continued on to study at University of Chicago, where he was awarded a Ph.D. in History of Culture in 1954. As a composer, he studied under Stefan Wolpe, Otto Luening, and Aaron Copland. In 1946, he became a member of the music department at the University of Chicago, in 1961 he was appointed professor of music at the University of Chicago and in 1975 professor of music and the humanities at the University of Pennsylvania. He became professor emeritus at Pennsylvania in 1988. His most influential work, Emotion and Meaning in Music (1956), combined Gestalt Theory and theories by Pragmatists Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey to try to explain the existence of emotion in music. Peirce had suggested that any regular response to an event developed alongside the understanding of that event's consequences, its \\"meaning\\". Dewey extended this to explain that, if the response was stopped by an unexpected event, then an emotional response would occur over the event's \\"meaning\\". Meyer used this basis to form a theory about music, combining musical expectations in a specific cultural context with emotion and meaning elicited. His work went on to influence theorists both in and outside music, as well as providing a basis for cognitive psychology research into music and our responses to it. Meyer's 1967 work \\"Music, the Arts, and Ideas,\\" was influential in defining the transition to postmodernism in light of new works such as George Rochberg's Music for the Magic Theater, which was premiered at the University of Chicago in 1967.Leonard B.

It is 1.5 or more times larger than an average pelvis in every direction and is at least 42 cm (16.5 inches) biiliac width. Even though this condition is classified as a congenital abnormality, it is not a medical disease or abnormality of the pelvis (as the pelvis is a true gynecoid shape, only larger). Women with this condition, at the time of delivery, may have a precipitous birth. There is virtually no resistance of the huge pelvic opening to the size of a newborn so only the soft parts resist the birth. With a huge Justo Major Pelvis, there is no pelvic bone \\"molding\\" of the fetal head. With the average pelvic size (2/3 or less Justo Major size) the usual pelvic molding process slows the birth, resulting in a slow and gradual stretching of the vaginal opening for primiparous women. When a huge Justo Major Pelvis allows such an extremely rapid vaginal birth, there can be tears of the perineal soft tissues. At the time of delivery the strong uterine contractions and maternal bearing down almost instantly overwhelm the integrity of a tightened and previously unstretched vaginal orifice. This is often the case if such women have not previously practiced vaginal stretching to the degree that allows such an instant birthing, especially so for a primiparous woman. This \\"instant delivery\\" problem causes many OBGYN doctors to stress the importance of women with a huge pelvis practicing pre-delivery vaginal stretching to avoid perineal injury. Such a large size for the female pelvis is present in less than one in a thousand adult women. When women reach their maximum pelvis size, often by 21 years of age, if they have a huge pelvis the resulting big hips will not go away‚Äîno matter how much they diet, as bone will not shrink. It is not unusual for such women, whose pear shape is due to a huge pelvis, to give up watching calories for smaller hips... leading to obesity. However, such pear shaped obese women do not necessarily have a huge pelvis and a measurement scan or anthropometry by calipers is required to diagnose the Justo Major condition. The incidence of Justo Major Pelvis is not found to be a strictly standard deviation type variation as it follows a tail skewed deviation to the right. Incidence varies with geographic regions of the world (e.g. Poland has a high incidence). Justo Major Pelvis is classified as congenital and thought to be partially inherited, especially from the maternal side.

In 1867 Wingate drew up rules for systematic rifle practice by Company A, 22d regiment, New York National Guard, of which he was then captain. The publication of these rules (the first of the kind to be formulated in the United States) led to the organization (in 1871) of the National Rifle Association of America, of which he was first secretary and later president from 1886 to 1900.

Founded in 1935, by Lord and Lady Strickland and Lord Strickland's daughter Mabel, it is the oldest daily newspaper still in circulation in Malta. It has the widest circulation and is seen as the daily newspaper of \\"reference\\" of the Maltese press. The newspaper is published by Allied Newspapers Limited which is owned by the Strickland Foundation, a charitable trust established by Mabel Strickland in 1979 to control the majority of the company. History Previous logo as The Times. The history of The Times of Malta is linked with that of its publishing house, Allied Newspapers Limited. This institution has a history going back to the 1920s, when it pioneered journalism and the printing industry in Malta. It all started with the publication, by Gerald Strickland, of Malta's first evening newspaper in Maltese, Il-Progress. This was a four-page daily with its own printing offices in what was then 10A, Strada Reale, Valletta. The name \\"Progress\\" is retained to this day by the commercial sister of Allied Newspapers Limited, Progress Press Company Limited, formed in 1946.https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080430/news/from-the- beginning.206197 Bilingual journalism, Maltese and English, was introduced in Malta with the publication, on 3 February 1922, of an English supplement to Il-Progress. The Times of Malta and Il-Progress lasted till 1 March 1929. The English supplement then became The Times of Malta Weekly (forerunner of The Sunday Times of Malta). The Maltese side was named Ix-Xemx, later changed to Id-Dehen and later still to Il-Berqa, first published on 29 January 1932. Il- Berqa ceased publication on 30 November 1968. In February 1931, Progress Press moved from Strada Reale to 341, St Paul Street, Valletta, until recently the site of Allied Newspapers Limited, also known as Strickland House. As readership of the English supplement to Il-Progress soared, Lord Strickland was quick to see that there was room for an English daily. This would happen so long as the new publication achieved and maintained a high standard of public service in information. The first issue of The Times of Malta was published in full co-operation with the British MI5 on 7 August 1935 under menacing war clouds as Italy planned the invasion of Abyssinia, which began in October of that year. On 2 September 1935, Mabel Strickland, who was a founder member of Allied Malta Newspapers Limited and formed part of the first Board of Directors, became the first editor of The Times of Malta. She also edited The Sunday Times of Malta from 1935 to 1950 when she was succeeded by the late George Sammut who retired in 1966. Anthony Montanaro was the next editor. He retired on 1 March 1991 and succeeded by Laurence Grech. On 6 August 1960, the 25th anniversary of The Times of Malta, Strickland wrote that The Times of Malta, whilst originally a party paper, had become a national newspaper. The paper won for itself a reputation for objective reporting whilst upholding its own strongly held editorial opinion. Strickland's editorship covered the difficult years of World War II. Nevertheless, none of the newspapers forming part of the Group ever missed an issue in spite of continuous bombing and all kinds of shortages in the siege years between 1940 and 1943. The building was bombed twice, receiving a direct hit on 7 April 1942, when sixteen rooms were demolished but sparing the printing machines. Thomas Hedley took over as editor from Strickland in 1950. He edited the paper through the traumatic years of political and industrial change culminating in Malta's Independence in 1964. Under the editorship of Charles Grech Orr, The Times kept up the tradition of never missing an issue when twice hit by industrial action in 1973 and when political arsonists burned the building down on 15 October 1979. That date came to be known as \\"Black Monday\\". In the face of serious danger, the editor and his staff had to abandon the building. Printing of the following day's paper continued at another printing press, Independence Press. The paper was out on the street as usual the following morning, reduced in size but a triumph for freedom of expression. During the last 10 years, its website timesofmalta.com has become the primary news source in Malta and one of the main news websites in the Mediterranean. In June 2019, Herman Grech was appointed editor in chief, Bertrand Borg online editor and Mark Wood print editor.

He is regarded as one of the founders of the modern Bulgarian fine art tradition. Biography Born in the village of Vidim near Dub√°, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague and the Munich Academy. Mrkviƒçka came to Plovdiv in 1881 after an invitation by the then-Eastern Rumelian government and worked as a teacher in the Cyril and Methodius high school, where he co-operated with the most important cultural figures in the city ‚Äî Ivan Vazov, Konstantin Velichkov, Petko Karavelov, Petko Slaveykov. Mrkviƒçka set up his first independent exhibition in 1886 and participated in two common exhibitions with Anton Mitov, another teacher at the high school. During his Plovdiv period Mrkviƒçka created some of his best known works: Plovdiv Marketplace (1883), Sakadzhii (1886), Gypsy Revelry (1887), Poulterer (1887), Marketplace in Plovdiv (1888) and others. Mrkviƒçka settled in Sofia in 1889 and was one of the founders of the National Academy of Arts in 1896, but briefly returned to Plovdiv in 1892 to take part in a special exhibition in the Plovdiv Fair main pavilion. He there presented 15 paintings, including Street in Plovdiv, and a sculpture called Bulgaria ‚Äî Patroness of Agriculture and Crafts. He was also the author of the exhibition's official poster. The painter's most significant achievements are in the everyday life genre, although he also worked in the historic painting sphere and is the author of many high-quality portraits. One of the creators of the then-coat of arms of Bulgaria and the coat of arms of Sofia, he became a Bulgarian Academy of Sciences member in 1918.

bird-of-paradise family, Paradisaeidae. It is distributed and endemic to mountain forests of southeast and eastern Papua New Guinea. Occasionally, the eastern parotia is considered a subspecies of P. lawesii. The species is similar to the western parotia (Parotia sefilata). Like most birds of paradise, male Lawes's parotia are polygamous. The few eggs that have been studied were about 33 x 24 mm in size, but these were possibly small specimens.Mackay (1990). It eats mainly fruit, seeds and arthropods. The bird's home was discovered by Carl Hunstein on a mountain near Port Moresby in 1884. Its name honors the New Guinea pioneer missionary Reverend William George Lawes. Widespread and common throughout its range, Lawes's parotia is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES. Description The male is a velvet black bird with an erectile silvery white forehead crest, iridescent purple blue nape and golden green breast plumesStavenga (2010). which are structurally colored. The breast plumes have V-shaped barbules, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colors, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the color switches sharply between these two colors, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection. The inside of its mouth is lime-colored. Adorned with three ornamental spatule head wires from behind of each eye and elongated black flank feathers, that spread skirt-like in courtship display.Scholes (2008). The female is a brown bird with dark head, yellow iris and dark-barred yellowish brown below. The iris is colored in various amounts of blue and yellow, changing according to the bird's mood.

He commissioned the building of Clandon Park House in the 1730s. Early life Onslow was the only surviving son of Richard Onslow, 1st Baron Onslow. He was educated at Eton College from 1691 to 1693, and the travelled abroad in Holland and France from 1697 to 1698. He married Elizabeth Knight, the daughter of John Knight, a merchant of Jamaica, and niece of Colonel Charles Knight, and was heir to both their fortunes. Political career He represented a continuous succession of constituencies in the Parliament of England and Great Britain. He first entered Parliament in 1702, aged 22 or 23, as the MP for Gatton, Surrey, an underpopulated rural borough that had once had a market in the medieval period. He was then returned in 1705 to represent the larger settlement of Chichester, West Sussex, followed by Bletchingley (1708‚Äì1715) and finally the county seat of Surrey (1715‚Äì1717), which then included much of today's Greater London including, for example, Battersea and Lambeth. He was awarded LL.D at Cambridge Univiversity in 1717 and became 2nd Baron Onslow on the death of his father in 1717. He was a Teller of the Receipt of the Exchequer from 1718 to his death Personal finances and family life Clandon Park House was transformed from a large manor house to a lavish English country house by this Lord Onslow, but the 3rd Lord Onslow had its interiors finished. It features a two-storey Marble Hall and marble chimney and other pieces by the Flemish sculptor Michael Rysbrack, but the interior was gutted by fire in 2015. As Lord Onslow he was a leading participant in an insurance business known as Onslow's Insurance or Onslow's Bubble, which secured incorporation under the Bubble Act as Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation.W. R. Scott, The Constitution and Finance of ... Joint-Stock Companies to 1720 (Cambridge University Press, 1911) III, 396-409. The Onslow family seat remains Clandon Park, East and West Clandon, Surrey. Clandon Park House and its 7-acre garden, was gifted to the Nation in 1956, a National Trust and this mansion and gardens was for the most part commissioned by him. The senior branch of the Onslow family continue to own and manage their agricultural business and the Clandon Park parkland to this day. However, in the 18th and 19th century the family owned several thousand acres of farmland scattered across many villages in Surrey from which they derived an income. According to research carried out under University College London's Legacies of British Slave-ownership project, Clandon House was built by Onslow possibly as a result of his wife's slavery-derived fortune. The slave plantation which Elizabeth inherited was her uncle Charles' Whitehall Plantation in St Thomas- in-the-East, Jamaica. He had one son, Richard, who succeeded him on his death in 1740.

Ancient examples include Hipparchia of Maroneia (active ) and Arete of Cyrene (active 5th‚Äì4th centuries BCE). Some women philosophers were accepted during the medieval and modern eras, but none became part of the Western canon until the 20th and 21st century, when some sources indicate that Susanne Langer, G.E.M. Anscombe, Hannah Arendt and Simone de Beauvoir entered the canon.Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005. In ancient philosophy in Asia, women made many vital contributions. In the oldest text of the Upanishads, c. 700 BCE, the female philosophers Gargi and Maitreyi are part of the philosophical dialogues with the sage Yajnavalkya. Ubhaya Bharati (c. 800 AD) and Akka Mahadevi (1130‚Äì1160) are other known female thinkers in the Indian philosophical tradition. In China, Confucius hailed the female Jing Jiang of Lu (5th c. BCE) as being wise and an example for his students, while Ban Zhao (45‚Äì116) wrote several vital historical and philosophical texts. In Korea, Im Yunjidang (1721‚Äì93) were among the most notable women philosophers during the enlightened mid-Chos≈èn era. Among notable female Muslim philosophers are Rabia of Basra (714‚Äì801), A‚Äôishah al-Ba‚Äôuniyyah of Damascus (d. 1517), and Nana Asma'u (1793‚Äì1864) from the Sokoto Caliphate of today's Nigeria. In early colonial Latin-America, the philosopher Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz (1651‚Äì95) was known as \\"The Phoenix of America\\". In ancient Western philosophy, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, female philosophers such as Hipparchia of Maroneia (active ca. 325 BC), Arete of Cyrene (active 5th‚Äì4th century BC) and Aspasia of Miletus (470‚Äì400 BC) were active during this period. Notable medieval philosophers include Hypatia (5th century), St. Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179) and St. Catherine of Sienna (1347-1380). Notable modern philosophers included Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) and Sarah Margaret Fuller (1810-1850). Influential contemporary philosophers include Edith Stein (1891-1942), Susanne Langer (1895‚Äì1985), Hannah Arendt (1906‚Äì1975), Simone de Beauvoir (1908‚Äì1986), Elizabeth Anscombe (1919‚Äì2001), Mary Midgley (1919‚Äì2018), Philippa Foot (1920‚Äì2010), Mary Warnock (1924‚Äì2019), Julia Kristeva (born 1941), Patricia Churchland (born 1943) Martha Nussbaum (born 1947) and Susan Haack (born 1945). In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began admitting women, producing more female academics. Nevertheless, U.S. Department of Education reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy, and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the humanities.\\"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities.\\"National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000‚Äì173; 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93).

U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93). Women make up as little as 17% of philosophy faculty in some studies.U.S. Department of Education statistics in above-cited reports seem to put the number closer to 17%, but these numbers are based on data from the mid-1990s. Margaret Urban Walker's more recent article (2005) discusses the data problem and describes more recent estimates as an \\"(optimistically projected) 25‚Äì30 percent.\\" In 2014, Inside Higher Education described the philosophy \\"...discipline‚Äôs own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment\\" of women students and professors. Jennifer Saul, a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, stated in 2015 that women are \\"...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against.\\" In the early 1990s, the Canadian Philosophical Association claimed that there is gender imbalance and gender bias in the academic field of philosophy. In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that \\"out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total.\\" The editors of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers. According to Eugene Sun Park, \\"[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline.\\" Susan Price argues that the philosophical \\"...canon remains dominated by white males‚Äîthe discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender.\\" According to Saul, \\"[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest). While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics.\\" History While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical Western canon. Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, \\"Feminist History of Philosophy\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/ According to Eugene Sun Park, \\"[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male.

Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the \\"...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms.\\" Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as Margaret Cavendish, Anne Conway, and Lady Damaris Masham. Price argues that the philosophical \\"...canon remains dominated by white males‚Äîthe discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender.\\" Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that ‚Äú...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field.\\" The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which as published in 1967, had \\"...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for Wollstonecraft, Arendt or de Beauvoir. \\"[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal\\" to the canon set out at the time. Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic Camille Paglia (born 1947) argues that \\"...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated.\\" In the Aeon essay \\"First women of philosophy\\" in December 2018, the global historian of ideas Dag Herbj√∏rnsrud writes about the many women philosophers of the Global South, and concludes: \\"Philosophy was once a woman‚Äôs world, ranging across Asia, Africa and Latin America. It‚Äôs time to reclaim that lost realm.\\" Herbj√∏rnsrud argues that women and philosophers of color were excluded from the philosophical canon by Kant, Hegel and their supporters. =Ancient philosophy= Hipparchia of Maroneia. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the Villa Farnesina in Rome. Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as Hipparchia of Maroneia (active ca. 325 BC), Arete of Cyrene (active 5th‚Äì4th century BC) and Aspasia of Miletus (470‚Äì400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character Diotima in the Symposium on her.K. Wider, \\"Women philosophers in the Ancient Greek World\\", 21‚Äì62I. Sykoutris, Symposium (Introduction and Comments), 152‚Äì153 Socrates attributes to the (possibly fictional) Diotima of Mantinea his lessons in the art of Eros (or philosophical searching). Plato's final views on women are highly contested, but the Republic suggests that women are equally capable of education, intellectual vision, and rule of the city. Other notable female philosophers of this era include: *Theano of Croton (6th century BC) *Aristoclea of Delphi (6th century BC) *Sosipatra of Ephesus (4th century AD) *Nicarete of Megara (flourished around 300 BC) *Catherine of Alexandria (282-305 AD) *Ptolemais of Cyrene (3rd century BC) *Aesara of Lucania (3rd century BC) *Diotima of Mantinea (appears in Plato's Symposium) *Ban Zhao (c. 45‚Äì116 AD) *Xie Daoyun (before 340 AD - after 399 AD) *Gargi Vachaknavi (7th century BC) =Medieval philosophy= \\"Death of the philosopher Hypatia, in Alexandria\\" (she was killed by an angry mob) - artwork by Louis Figuier (1866). Medieval philosophy dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. Hypatia (AD 350 ‚Äì 370 to 415) was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher in Egypt, then a part of the Eastern Roman Empire. She was the head of the Neoplatonic school at Alexandria, where she taught philosophy and astronomy.Krebs, Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries; The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: \\"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria.\\"Columbia Encyclopedia, Hypatia citation:Alexandrian Neoplatonic philosopher and mathematicianHypatia, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"Egyptian Neoplatonist philosopher who was the first notable woman in mathematics.\\" Other notable woman philosophers of this era include: *Aedesia of Alexandria (5th century AD) *Catherine of Siena (1347-1380) *Tullia d'Aragona (c. 1510-1556) *Moderata Fonte (1555‚Äì1592), critic of religion, feminist =Modern philosophy= The 17th century marks the beginning of the modern philosophy era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced Ren√© Descartes and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on John Locke‚Äôs philosophy. Laura Bassi (1711‚Äì1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. Olympe de Gouges (1748‚Äì1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by Judith Sargent Murray (1751‚Äì1820) in her essay \\"On the Equality of the Sexes\\" and Mary Wollstonecraft in her essay A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). During the 19th century, Harriet Martineau (1802‚Äì1876) criticized the state of women's education and Harriet Taylor Mill (1807‚Äì1858), Sarah Margaret Fuller (1810-1850) and Antoinette Brown Blackwell (1825‚Äì1921) called for women's rights. Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860‚Äì1935) argued that women were oppressed by an androcentric culture. Near the start of the 20th century, Mary Whiton Calkins (1863‚Äì1930) was the first woman to become president of the American Philosophical Association. Women thinkers such as Emma Goldman (1869‚Äì1940), an anarchist, and Rosa Luxemburg (1871‚Äì1919), a Marxist theorist, are known for their political views. 17th century *Marie de Gournay (1565‚Äì1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated. *Anna Maria van Schurman (1607‚Äì1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of female education. *Elisabeth of Bohemia (1618‚Äì1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably Ren√© Descartes, who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of dualism, or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. *Margaret Cavendish (1623‚Äì1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy. *Anne Conway (1631-1679) was an English philosopher whose work, in the tradition of the Cambridge Platonists, was an influence on Leibniz. Conway's thought is original as it is rationalist philosophy, with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems. *Damaris Cudworth Masham (1659‚Äì1708) was an English philosopher, proto-feminist, and advocate for women's education. *Mary Astell (1666‚Äì1731) was an English feminist writer and rhetorician known for advocacy of equal educational opportunities for women, which earned her the title of \\"first English feminist.\\"Batchelor, Jennie. \\"Mary Astell\\". The Literary Encyclopedia. 21 March 2002. Accessed 6 July 2008. Her most well known books outline her plan to establish a new type of educational institution for women. 18th century Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) was an English writer and philosopher. *Catharine Trotter Cockburn (1679‚Äì1749) published her first major philosophical work, A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on gender studies. *√âmilie du Ch√¢telet (1706‚Äì1749) was a French mathematician, physicist, and author during the Age of Enlightenment. She translated and commented on Isaac Newton's work Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. She criticized John Locke‚Äôs philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about free will and on the way to do metaphysics.Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54) *Laura Bassi (1711‚Äì1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies. She received a doctoral degree from the University of Bologna in May 1732, the third academic qualification ever bestowed on a woman by a university,Findlen, Paula.

Web. 3 June 2013.\\" and the first woman to earn a professorship in physics at a university in Europe. She was the first woman to be offered an official teaching position at a university in Europe. *Catharine Macaulay (1731‚Äì1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked Edmund Burke's Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents, calling it \\"a poison...\\".. In her 1790 Letters on Education, she argued along the lines that Mary Wollstonecraft would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis- education. *Olympe de Gouges (1748‚Äì1793) was a French playwright and political activist whose feminist and abolitionist writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen (1791), she challenged the practice of male authority and the notion of male‚Äìfemale inequality. *Judith Sargent Murray (1751‚Äì1820) was an early American advocate for women's rights, an essayist, playwright, poet, and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes‚Äîthat women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay \\"On the Equality of the Sexes\\" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other feminist writers of the century. The essay predated Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman which was published in 1792. *Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of women's rights. She is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers. In A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her most famous and influential work,Tomalin, 144‚Äì155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192‚Äì202. she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason. 19th century The only known daguerreotype of Margaret Fuller (by John Plumbe, 1846). *Harriet Martineau (1802‚Äì1876) was an English social theorist and political writer, often cited as the first female sociologist.Hill, Michael R. (2002) Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives. Routledge. She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective. In Society in America, she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the \\"intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction\\" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free. *Harriet Taylor Mill (1807‚Äì1858) was a philosopher and women's rights advocate. In John Stuart Mill's autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that \\"when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen.\\" Together, they wrote \\"Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce\\", published in 1832. The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing. *Sarah Margaret Fuller (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and women's rights advocate. Her book Woman in the Nineteenth Century is considered the first major feminist work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including Susan B. Anthony, cite Fuller as a source of inspiration. *Antoinette Brown Blackwell (1825‚Äì1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the United States. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as abolition of slavery and she sought to expand women's rights. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women. *Victoria, Lady Welby (1837‚Äì1912) was a self-educated English philosopher of language. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, Mind and The Monist. She published her first philosophical book, What Is Meaning? Studies in the Development of Significance in 1903, following it with Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word significs for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary semantics, semiotics, and semiology. *Bertha von Suttner (1843‚Äì1914) was a Czech-Austrian pacifist and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of Immanuel Kant, Henry Thomas Buckle, Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin and Leo Tolstoy (Tolstoy praised Die Waffen nieder!).Bertha von Suttner by Irwin Adams. The World Encyclopedia of Peace. Edited by Ervin L√°szl√≥, Linus Pauling and Jong Youl Yoo. Oxford : Pergamon, 1986. , (vol. 3, pp. 201‚Äì4). *Helene von Druskowitz (1856‚Äì1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in Z√ºrich. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant sexism of the era. *Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860‚Äì1935) was an American feminist, sociologist, novelist, writer and social reformer. Her short story \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.Ann J. Lane, To Herland and Beyond, 230. Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an androcentric culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.Davis and Knight, Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries, 206. She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women. Early 20th century *Mary Whiton Calkins (1863‚Äì1930) was an American philosopher and psychologist. She was also the first woman to become president of the American Psychological Association and the American Philosophical Association. Calkins studied psychology under William James and studied at Harvard University, which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men. James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as \\"the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard.\\" Hilgard, E. R. (1987). Psychology in America: A historical survey. San Diego, CA: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. She published four books and over one hundred papers in her career in psychology and philosophy. She was also an avid supporter of women's rightsChristopher Green (Producer). (n.d.). Katharine Milar on the first woman president of the APA, Mary Whiton Calkins. [Audio podcast].

Retrieved from http://www.yorku.ca/christo/podcasts/ and an advocate of women's right to vote. *Emma Goldman (1869‚Äì1940) was an anarchist known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a free-thinking \\"rebel woman\\" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from first-wave feminism and its efforts toward women's suffrage, she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. *Rosa Luxemburg (1871‚Äì1919) was a Marxist theorist, philosopher, economist and revolutionary socialist of Polish-Jewish descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous grass roots-based class struggle. =Contemporary philosophy= Contemporary philosophy is the present period in the history of Western philosophy beginning at the end of the 19th century with the professionalization of the discipline and the rise of analytic and continental philosophy. Some influential women philosophers from this period include: *Susanne Langer (1895‚Äì1985) was an American philosopher of mind and of philosopher of art, who was influenced by Ernst Cassirer and Alfred North Whitehead. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in philosophy and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled Philosophy in a New Key. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one's world. Simone de Beauvoir (1908‚Äì1986) was a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist, feminist and social theorist. *Hannah Arendt (1906‚Äì1975) was a German-born American assimilated Jewish political theorist. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with \\"man in the singular\\" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that \\"men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world.\\"Arendt, Hannah. The Human Condition. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998. Her works deal with the nature of power, and the subjects of politics, direct democracy, authority, and totalitarianism. The Hannah Arendt Prize is named in her honor. *Simone de Beauvoir (1908‚Äì1986) was a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist, feminist and social theorist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory.Bergoffen, Debra, \\"Simone de Beauvoir\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and monographs on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise The Second Sex, a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism. *Elizabeth Anscombe (1919‚Äì2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British analytic philosopher. Anscombe's 1958 article \\"Modern Moral Philosophy\\" introduced the term \\"consequentialism\\" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary virtue ethics. Her monograph Intention is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of intention, action and practical reasoning can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work. Mary Warnock described her in 2006 as \\"the undoubted giant among women philosophers\\" while John Haldane said she \\"certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know\\". *Mary Midgley (1919-2018) was an English moral philosopher. Midgley was a senior lecturer in philosophy at Newcastle University, and is known today for her work on science, ethics and animal rights. Midgley strongly opposed reductionism and scientism, and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities‚Äîa role for which it is, she argued, wholly inadequate. She wrote extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. The Guardian described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's \\"foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'\\" *Philippa Foot (1920-2010) was a British Philosophyphilosopher, most notable for her works in ethics. She was one of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics, inspired by the ethics of Aristotle. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize Aristotelian ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern deontological and utilitarian ethics. Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of normative ethics within analytic philosophy, especially her critique of consequentialism and of non-cognitivism. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the trolley problem. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of Wittgenstein, although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him. *Patricia Churchland (born 1943) is a Canadian-American philosopher noted for her contributions to neurophilosophy and the philosophy of mind. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the University of British Columbia, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Oxford, she taught philosophy at the University of Manitoba from 1969 to 1984. *Mary Warnock (1924-2019) was a British philosopher who worked in ethics, philosophy of education, and philosophy of mind. She also wrote on existentialism. From 1984 to 1991, Warnock was Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge. Warnock studied at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984. She delivered the Gifford Lectures, entitled \\"Imagination and Understanding,\\" at the University of Glasgow in 1992. She has written extensively on ethics, existentialism, and philosophy of mind. *Susan Haack (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at Cambridge University. She has written on logic, the philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics. Her pragmatism follows that of Charles Sanders Peirce. Haack's major contribution to philosophy is her epistemological theory called foundherentism, which is her attempt to avoid the logical problems of both pure foundationalism (which is susceptible to infinite regress) and pure coherentism (which is susceptible to circularity). Haack has been a fierce critic of Richard Rorty. She is critical of the view that there is a specifically female perspective on logic and scientific truth and is critical of feminist epistemology. She holds that many feminist critiques of science and philosophy are overly concerned with 'political correctness'. * Mar√≠a Zambrano (1904-1991) was a Spanish philosopher associated with the Generation of '36 movement. She wrote on intersections of the divine, civics engagement, and the poetic. She was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award (1981) and the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (1988). *Ayn Rand (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named Objectivism, which affirms objective reality and advocates holding reason as absolute.http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.htmlhttp://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html In ethics, Rand championed rational egoism and individualism.http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html In politics, she advocated for individual rights and capitalism.http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.htmlhttp://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html In esthetics, she upheld romanticism.http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html Rand regards Aristotle as her sole major philosophical influence.http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html *Giannina Braschi (born 1954) is a Latinx philosopher from Puerto Rico who writes on decolonialization, \\"feardom\\", enculturation and immigration, and the contradictions of Puerto Rican citizenship. *Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff (born 1955) is a Latinx philosopher from Panama whose coedited \\"Stories of Women in Philosophy\\"). Her subjects spans decolonial practices and the salience of racial identify. Other notable philosophers include: *Alice Ambrose (1906‚Äì2001) *Simone Weil (1909‚Äì1943) *Raya Dunayevskaya (1910‚Äì1987) *Jeanne Hersch (1910‚Äì2000) *Iris Murdoch (1919‚Äì1999) *Ruth Barcan Marcus (1921-2012) *Mary Hesse (1924-2016) *Judith Jarvis Thomson (born 1929) *Cora Diamond (born 1937) *Marilyn Frye (born 1941) *Julia Kristeva (born 1941) *Genevieve Lloyd (born 1941) *Onora O'Neill (born 1941) *Nancy Fraser (born 1947) *Martha Nussbaum (born 1947) *Barbara Cassin (born 1947) *Rebecca Goldstein (born 1950) *Christine Korsgaard (born 1952) *Judith Butler (born 1956) *Ruth Hagengruber (born 1958) *Nancy Bauer (philosopher) (born 1960) *Tamar Gendler (born 1965) *Alice Crary (born 1967) *Rahel Jaeggi (born 1967) Contemporary representation and working climate American philosopher Martha Nussbaum, who completed a PhD in philosophy at Harvard University in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare. In the early 1990s, the Canadian Philosophical Association claimed that \\"...there is compelling evidence\\" of \\"...philosophy‚Äôs gender imbalance\\" and \\"bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products.\\" In 1992, the association recommended that \\"fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.‚Äù In a 2008 article ‚ÄúChanging the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),‚Äù MIT philosophy professor Sally Haslanger stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty. In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that \\"out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total.\\" The editors of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia ‚Äúencourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.‚Äù In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled \\"Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis.\\" The article states that a \\"...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to bias against women or some kind of wrongful discrimination\\". Evidence cited includes \\"gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member\\"; \\"anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy\\"; \\"research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines\\"; \\"psychological research on implicit bias\\"; \\"psychological research on stereotype threat\\" and the \\"...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals\\". Sesardic and De Clercq argue that \\"proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively.\\" American philosopher Sally Haslanger stated in 2008 that \\"...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn‚Äôt actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.‚Äù Haslanger states that she experienced ‚Äúoccasions when a woman‚Äôs status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‚Äòmature‚Äô student), or was in a long-distance relationship\\". American philosopher Martha Nussbaum, who completed a PhD in philosophy at Harvard University in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter. In July 2015, British philosopher Mary Warnock addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is \\"... against intervention, by quotas or otherwise, to increase women‚Äôs chances of employment\\" in philosophy. She also argues that \\"... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance\\" and she states that she does not \\"...believe it shows a conscious bias against women.\\" Philosopher Julian Baggini states that he believes that there is \\"...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy\\". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a \\"...great deal of unconscious bias\\" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity. =Allegations of sexual harassment= In 2014, Inside Higher Education described the philosophy \\"...discipline‚Äôs own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment.\\" On March 28, 2011, the blog New APPS published a post examining the allegations of persistent sexual harassment faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to \\"serial harassers\\" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? ‚Äì New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science.

She received numerous allegations of sexual harassment by male philosophy faculty, including a \\"job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place\\", an \\"undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples\\" and a \\"... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues.\\" Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations. In 2013, the American Philosophical Association formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty. Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a \\"...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: ‚ÄúShow me a grad student I can fuck‚Äù.\\" Saul states that women are \\"...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against.\\" In 2014, Inside Higher Education reported allegations that a Yale University philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the \\"alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result\\". In an interview with Inside Higher Ed, the alleged victim stated that she \\"...suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the ‚Äúbrowbeating‚Äù she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials.\\" In 1993, the American Philosophical Association's sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that: *\\"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection.\\" *\\"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on.\\" *\\"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board.\\" =Black women= Angela Davis (born 1944) is an American political activist, philosopher and author. Her research interests include African-American studies and the philosophy of punishment and prisons. Nana Asma'u (1793-1864), from the Sokoto Caliphate in today's Nigeria, is one of many notable black women philosophers. She was a founder of the educational network Yan Taru (‚ÄòThe Associates‚Äô), which is still active today. She wrote in the Fulfulde, Hausa and Arabic languages, and her first text had the title: ‚ÄòWarning for the Negligent and Reminder for the Intelligent Regarding the Ways of the Pious‚Äô. She argued for humility between people, and for \\"good relations with one‚Äôs relatives, servants, and comrades. This is shown by being cheerful with them; doing good things for them; serving them; never acting as if superior to them; consulting them in many matters; helping them financially and physically [...]\\" Phillis Wheatley and Ida B. Wells are other notable women thinkers of African and African-American background in the 19th century. There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, African-Americans and other individuals from the African diaspora. According to philosopher Sally Haslanger, the \\"numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling\\"; in a 2003 study, there \\"...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report.\\" In the United States, the \\"...representation of scholars of color is plausibly worse than in any other field in the academy, including not only physics, but also engineering.\\" According to professor L.K. McPherson, there is a \\"gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy.\\"L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black- underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html McPherson states that there is a \\"...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk.\\" The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was Joyce Mitchell Cook, who obtained her degree in 1965 from Yale University. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include Angela Davis, a political activist who specializes in writing about feminism, critical theory, Marxism, popular music, social consciousness, and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; Kathryn Gines, the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in continental philosophy, Africana philosophy, philosophy of race and Black feminist philosophy; Anita L. Allen, the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by President Obama to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and Adrian Piper, an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from Stanford University, and who specializes in Nietzsche, nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and African-American philosophy. In 2018, Mpho Tshivhase became the first black woman in South Africa to complete a PhD in philosophy. = Asian women = Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a New York Times interview with George Yancy, Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at California State University, Fullerton, states, \\"I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued.\\" She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. University of Washington philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the American Philosophical Association's newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: \\"Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy.\\" On the other had, \\"Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in passive rather than aggressive terms.\\" Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and \\"derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity\\" may also contribute to the wide disparity. = Latinx women in philosophy = The burgeoning field of Latinx philosophy acknowledges the role of Chicana Feminism and the cultural theories by Gloria E. Anzald√∫a (1947-2004) as precursors to the field. Latinx women philosophers who practice in the United States and publish widely in Spanish and English include: Maria Lugones (1948-) , and Susana Nuccetelli (1954) from Argentina; and Ofelia Schutte (1944) from Cuba; Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff (1955) from Panama (editor of \\"Stories of Women in Philosophy\\"); and Giannina Braschi (1953) from Puerto Rico. Giannina Braschi's writings on Puerto Rican independence and capitalism focus on financial terrorism, gender identity, debt structures, and ‚Äúfeardom‚Äù. Whereas, Susana Nuccetelli widely questions the nature of justice and women's rights, and Latinx cultural identity. Forerunners to other women in the field of Latinx philosophy are Spanish and Latin American women philosophers who wrote in Spanish: Teresa de Avila (1515-1582), Oliva Sabuco (1562-1622), Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz (1648-1695), Maria Zambrano (1904-1991), and Victoria Camps (1941). One of the earliest Latin American feminist philosophers was Graciela Hierro (1928-2003), who introduced feminist philosophy into the academic curriculum of Mexican universities in the 1970s and organized the first panel on feminism at a national Mexican philosophy conference in 1979. In spite of a strong tradition of women practising philosophy in Spanish there does not yet appear to be organization dedicated to Spanish, Latin American, nor Latinx Women in Philosophy. Academic platforms for their work include Letras Femininas, Chasqui, Latinx Cultural Center at Utah State University, APA Newsletter on Hispanic/Latino Issues on Philosophy, Society for Mexican- American Philosophy, and the annual Latinx Philosophy Conference. These forums span a wide range of Latinx social justice and cultural issues (ie. Imperialism, coloniality of gender, race theories, gender discrimination, gender in grammar, immigration, incarceration, decolonialization, citizenship, queer desire, and disability within Latin American and US Latinx feminisms). Reports from the US  U.S. Department of Education reports indicate that philosophy is one of the least proportionate fields in the humanities with respect to gender. Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‚Äòin philosophy.‚Äô This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one data set exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers. The National Center for Education Statistics' 2000 report, \\"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities,\\" estimates in Table 23 that the total number of \\"History and Philosophy\\" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, \\"In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy.\\"NCES (2000), previously cited. Anita L. Allen (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. In their 1997 report, \\"Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities,\\" NCES notes, that about \\"one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4).\\" In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men), 12.7 are female (971 women).NCES (1997), previously cited. The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men); female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy. The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.NCES (1997): \\"Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time.\\" Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.NCES (1997): \\"Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively).\\" Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.Hoffer, T.B., V. Welch, Jr., K. Williams, M. Hess, K. Webber, B. Lisek, D. Loew, and I. Guzman-Barron. 2005. Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities: Summary Report 2004. Chicago: National Opinion Research Center. (The report gives the results of data collected in the Survey of Earned Doctorates, conducted for six federal agencies, NSF, NIH, USED, NEH, USDA, and NASA by NORC.) Organizations and campaigns = Minorities and Philosophy (MAP) = Minorities and Philosophy (MAP) is an international movement of graduate and undergraduate students and faculty members in philosophy working on issues related to ‚Äúthe underrepresentation of women an minorities in philosophy.‚Äù MAP consists of chapters at universities around the world, and the format can vary from school to school. However, all chapters focus broadly on issues minorities face in the profession, philosophical issues regarding minorities, and work done by minority philosophers, as well as issues that are specific to that school's philosophy department. MAP's short-term goals include providing a space for students to discuss and work on these issues, and long-term goals include contributing to the culture of academic philosophy and increasing participation and recognition of minorities in philosophy. In recent years, MAP has fostered collaborative work between chapters, establishing \\"connections between chapters that benefit both members and departments long-term,\\" increased work on inclusive pedagogy, and organized efforts to bring philosophy into communities outside of university campuses, such as prisons and elementary schools. =Committee on the Status of Women (American Philosophical Association) = The Committee on the Status of Women is a committee of the American Philosophical Association devoted to the assessment and reporting on the status of women in philosophy. It is currently chaired by Hilde Lindemann. In April 2007, the Committee on the Status of Women co-sponsored a session on the central question \\"Why Are Women Only 21% of Philosophy\\". At this session, Sharon Crasnow suggested that the low numbers of women in philosophy may be due to: * Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the classroom. * Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. * Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy. =Society for Women in Philosophy= The Society for Women in Philosophy is a group created in 1972 that seeks to support and promote women in philosophy. It has a number of branches around the world, including in New York, the American Pacific, the United Kingdom and Canada.SWIP Website http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/SWIP/hist.html Each year, the society names one philosopher the distinguished woman philosopher of the year.

It was one of the first buildings in the French Second Empire style to be built in the United States. After the building's completion, the Second Empire style was used extensively elsewhere in Boston and for many public buildings in the United States, such as the Old Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C., as well as other city halls in Providence, Baltimore and Philadelphia. The building's architects were Gridley James Fox Bryant and Arthur Gilman. History Boston City Hall habitu√©es, c.1910 Old City Hall, built between 1862 and 1865, is located at 45 School Street, along the Freedom Trail between the Old South Meeting House and King's Chapel. The Boston Latin School operated on the site from 1704 to 1748, and on the same street until 1844. Also on the site, the Suffolk County Courthouse was erected in 1810 and converted to Boston's second city hall in 1841, being replaced by the current building twenty-four years later. Thirty-eight Boston mayors, including John F. Fitzgerald, Maurice J. Tobin, and James Michael Curley, served their terms of office on School Street at this site over a period of 128 years. With the move to the current Boston City Hall in 1969, Old City Hall was converted over the next two years to serve other functions ‚Äì an early and successful example of adaptive reuse. The Boston-based architecture firm Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc completed the adaptive use and renovation. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1970. Statue of Ben Franklin = Points of architectural interest = *The granite exterior characterized by ornamented columns, the mansard roof, and the projecting central bay *The massive front doors, unusual in the use of different wood, as well as the inlay of the marble circle in each door *The murals in the building entrances on School Street and Court Square illustrating the history of both the building and the site *The marble plaque in the first floor lobby commemorating the laying of the cornerstone in 1862 by Mayor Joseph Wightman and the dedication of the building in 1865 by Mayor Frederic W. Lincoln, Jr. *The hopscotch in the School Street sidewalk recognizing this as the site of the Boston Latin School *The statues in the courtyard: **Benjamin Franklin, who attended school on this site. Scenes of Franklin's accomplishments appear in bas-relief on the square pedestal of the statue. The statue (1856) was the first portrait statue to be erected in Boston. Franklin is depicted as he would actually appear, rather than draped in toga, cloak, or classical attire. The statue was designed by Richard Saltonstall Greenough, as are two of the bas-reliefs. **Josiah Quincy III, Boston's second mayor; the statue (1879) was designed by Thomas Ball. **A donkey, signifying the Democratic Party, with two bronze footprints in front of it labeled \\"stand in opposition\\" and a plaque explaining the origin of the donkey as the party's symbol.

Early life Nagai was born in the My≈çd≈ç District, Awa Province in what is now the Tokushima Prefecture, as the son of a doctor and started studying rangaku medicine at the Dutch Medical School of Nagasaki (Igaku-Denshujo) in 1864. While in Nagasaki, he made the acquaintance of ≈åkubo Toshimichi, It≈ç Hirobumi, and other future leaders of the Meiji government. Career Nagai continued his studies at Tokyo Imperial University and became the first doctor of pharmacy in Japan. He was sent under government sponsorship to Prussia in 1871 to study at the University of Berlin. He was the only civilian in a group of military students sent to study in Great Britain and France, and he traveled by way of the United States and Great Britain. While in Berlin, he resided at the home of Japanese diplomat Aoki Sh≈´z≈ç. He was influenced by the lectures of von Hofmann, and received a doctorate with a study on eugenol while working as an assistant at von Hofmann's laboratory. He decided to take up organic chemistry in 1873. Nagai returned to Japan in 1883 to take up a position at the Tokyo Imperial University, and became Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy there in 1893. His research centered on the chemical analysis of various Japanese and Chinese traditional herbal medicines. While in Germany, Nagai married Therese Schumacher, the daughter of a wealthy lumber and mining magnate. On their return to Japan, she became a professor of German language at Japan Women's University, and was active in introducing German foods and culture to Japan.

The mission is affiliated with a primary and secondary school, Domino Servite School, and a teachers training college, Cedar International Academy. History Kwasizabantu Mission was founded in 1970 by Erlo Hartwig Stegen (born in 1935 near Durban). Stegen had been a travelling evangelist among the Zulu population of Natal since the 1950s up to 1970. In 1966-67, Stegen's efforts culminated in a revival, accompanied by mass conversions and miraculous healings. In 1970, its base was established at a place called KwaSizabantu (Zulu for \\"the place of help for people,\\" or \\"the place where people are helped\\"). This became the ministry's eponym. This mission station is situated on a farm of 550 hectares between Greytown and KwaDukuza (also known as Stanger) in KwaZulu-Natal, and is currently one of the largest and most successful mission stations in Africa. The Mission has a few non-profit initiatives, as well as some successful commercial enterprises which fund its activities. One of the non-profit initiatives is Radio Khwezi, a community radio broadcasting station which started broadcasting in 1995. Radio Khwezi is available in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands region on FM 90.5 and 107.7 and is available worldwide through live streaming on the Internet. Radio Khwezi broadcasts a variety of programs aimed at informing and edifying the community. The Sunday services of Kwasizabantu Mission are broadcast live from 11h00 South African time. On 12 August 2006, Kwasizabantu Mission officially opened the Emseni Care Center (meaning \\"place of grace\\"). The Emseni Care Center provides free care and counselling to HIV and AIDS patients. Some of the patients have fully recovered. The KwaSizabantu Mission houses the water factory aQuell√© and has 8.5 hectares of advanced greenhouses where sweet peppers are grown hydroponically. KwaSizabantu Mission also has an extensive avocado farming enterprise. The produce is packaged in a packaging facility on the mission station for Woolworths, Checkers, Spar and other local markets. Some of the produce is exported. It also produces dairy products which are marketed through their Bonl√© brand. They also have a Saverite supermarket on the premises with its own bakery and deli. The profit of the different enterprises is used to help those in need and to further the aims of the Mission. The director of the KwaSizabantu Mission in Kranskop, the Reverend Erlo Hartwig Stegen, was named co-recipient of a major international award ‚Äî the Robert W. Pierce Award for Christian Service ‚Äî by World Vision International on 9 December 2007. In 2013 Rev EH Stegen was awarded the Chancellor's Medal by the North-West University (NWU) for his humanitarian work among poor rural communities. Controversy In September 2020, News24 released an expos√© alleging that Kwasizabantu is a cult with allegations from former members of abuse‚Äîincluding rape. This sparked an official, ongoing probe by KwaZulu-Natal local authorities.. As a result several South African vendors temporarily stopped selling the mission owned bottled water, aQuell√©. KwaSizabantu Mission referred to the allegations as false and a \\"vicious attack\\", and said they had appointed an external committee consisting of legal, financial, business and community individuals to investigate the allegations and publish their findings. The mission also said they were working with law enforcement to deal with the allegations and to take action against those making false allegations.

It is the third largest of 11 nature parks in the state of Brandenburg. In 1997, it was declared a nature park by the State Minister for the Environment. There is a visitor center in Rabenstein/Fl√§ming offering information, an interesting exhibition, a bike rental and a shop with regional products. Geography The park is located about 80 km southwest of Berlin and Potsdam and covers the higher parts of the Fl√§ming hill chain. The highest elevation is the Hagelberg (200,24 m). In the southwest, the region borders the Fl√§ming Nature Park in the state of Saxony- Anhalt. Belzig is the largest and most important town in the region, which is home to around 27.000 inhabitants overall. Other towns include Wiesenburg/Mark, G√∂rzke, Niemegk and Br√ºck. The population density is 30 inhabitants per km2. About half of the area is forests, the other half is agricultural land. There are few lakes, but some clear creeks and small rivers that provide a habitat for several protected species. The nature park has very good traffic infrastructure. It can be reached by car using the A2 (Berlin- Hannover) (exits at Ziesar (76), Wollin (77), Brandenburg (78)) or A9 motorways (Berlin - Leipzig) (exits at Br√ºck, Niemegk und Klein Marzehns). The region is also served by a good railroad connection from Berlin, Potsdam and Dessau. Nature Western march orchid =Landscape= The nature park is divided into two sections: In the south, the hilly and wooded landscape of the High Fl√§ming and in the north a flat lowland, called \\"Belziger Landschaftswiesen\\" (Belzig landscape meadows). The more than 140,000-year-old heights are moraines. The nature park area is about half wooded, and the other half is agricultural land. It is characterized by a constant change of forest and field. In some places, you will see the original beech forest. Open lakes and other water - apart from a few ponds - there are hardly any. However, there are many brooks that are among the cleanest in Brandenburg and are very valuable for nature protection. With the so-called \\"Rummeln\\", a form of dry valleys, the High Fl√§ming has a unique botanical and geological feature. =Animals and plants= The Fl√§ming is rich in wildlife (fallow deer, red deer, raccoon dog and the mouflon). Among the most noteworthy species in the nature park are the black stork, the common noctule, a microbat, and the middle spotted woodpecker, the mascot of the nature parks. In the creeks the brown trout, the white-throated dipper, the brook lamprey and the European crayfish can be found. The great bustard and the western marsh orchid are native to the lowlands. =Protected areas= Rummel close to Preu√ünitz Virtually the entire natural park area is a landscape protection area. The regulation on the landscape conservation area \\"Hoher Fl√§ming und Belziger Landschaftswiesen\\" of 17 November 1997 became effective on 3 December 1997. Moreover, there are nine nature reserves in the nature park . Some of the valuable streams in the Fl√§ming are protected (Verlorenwasserbach, Bullenberger Bach, Planetal). There is also protected forest and moorland (Rabenstein, Spring, Werbiger Heide). Some nature reserves have been set up by the GDR. The nature protection areas (with the date of entry into force) in the nature park are those: * Bullenberger Bach / Briesener Bach (24 May 2003) * Klein Marzehns (1 May 1961) * Fl√§mingbuchen (30 March 1961) * Planetal (19 October 1967) * Rabenstein (20 June 1978) * Spring (17 March 1986) * Verlorenwasserbach, Oberlauf (26 May 2005) * Werbiger Heide (19 November 1999) * Belziger Landschaftswiesen (24 May 2003) Culture Wiesenburg Castle Stone church in Jeserig/Fl√§ming Art Trail: \\"Unter Kiefern\\" by Susken Rosenthal =Castles and palaces= Of particular interest are the four medieval castles in Fl√§ming: Eisenhardt Castle in Belzig, Rabenstein Castle, Ziesar Castle and Wiesenburg Palace. In its present form Wiesenburg Palace is a neo-Renaissance building, but it was originally built as a medieval castle of which some elements are still preserved. Presently there is a museum and a hotel in Eisenhardt Castle in Belzig. Wiesenburg Palace is privately owned and is used for residential purposes. The castle tower can be visited and houses the tourist information of the community. The Palace has a park that is designed as a landscape park. The 123-hectare park is considered the most important park between Potsdam and the Dessau-W√∂rlitz Gardens. In 2004, there was a sculpture exhibit in the park. Ziesar Castle houses a museum on the history of Christianity the Mark Brandenburg. There is a hostel and a restaurant in Rabenstein Castle. =Historic town centres= The historic town centres of Belzig and Ziesar and are worth visiting. Both cities are members of the Association of Cities with Historic City Centres in Brandenburg\\". Niemegk also has a historic city centre with a Renaissance town hall. =Stone churches= Typical for the Fl√§ming are medieval churches, made of stones that were gathered in the region. =kunst land hoher fl√§ming - land art= Under the brand \\"kunst land hoher fl√§ming\\" artists and others involved organize artistic activities in the countryside. It started in 2004 with the Sculpture Park at Wiesenburg Castle Park. In 2006, an \\"art trail\\" was realized, a 2.5 km long track with works of art designed by local artists. In the summer of 2007, a 17-km-long art track that connects the train stations of Belzig and Wiesenburg was opened. Ten works of art can be seen along the trail. The ten artists whose works have been realized, had prevailed in a nationwide art competition. =Theatre and concerts= Theater performances are regularly given in the summer in Wiesenburg Castle Park and in the courtyard of Ziesar Castle. In Belzig, the birthplace of the composer Carl Gottlieb Reissiger, his works are occasionally performed. Visitor Center \\"Old Distillery\\" The visitor center The visitor center of the nature park is located in the village Raben in the municipality Rabenstein/Fl√§ming. The building now used as visitor center is called \\"Old Distillery\\" because in the 18th century it was a liquor distillery. It was constructed around 1700 as a commercial building for Rabenstein Castle. From 1863 it was used as a pumping station to secure the water supply of the castle. Remnants of the horse-driven gear and water boilers can still be seen today. After a period of decline from 1945, in 1996 the historic building was finally restored by Potsdam-Mittelmark County in order to become the visitor center of the new nature park. In May 1997, the visitor center was opened to the public. The visitor information is run by the Nature Park Association Fl√§ming. An exhibition on the upper floor of the visitor center informs about all aspects of the nature park. In addition, there is tourist information which offers maps and leaflets with route recommendations and literature. In the basement vaults of the Garden House there is a shop selling local products, like pottery, honey, beeswax candles, jams and jellies and fruit schnapps. There is also a bike rental. The visitor center is open daily from 9:00 to 17:00. In the visitor center, the nature park administration and the Nature Park Association Fl√§ming have their offices.

A Draft Manifesto (Per un'Europa libera e unita. Progetto d'un manifesto), is a political statement written by Altiero Spinelli while he was imprisoned on the Italian island of Ventotene during World War II. Completed in June 1941, the Manifesto was circulated within the Italian Resistance, and it soon became the programme of the Movimento Federalista Europeo. The Manifesto called for a federation of Europe and the world. In the text, European Federalism and World Federalism are presented as a way to prevent future wars. Vayssi√®re notes that the manifesto is widely seen as the birth of European federalism. Spinelli (1907‚Äì86), a former Communist, became a leader of the federalist movement due to his primary authorship of the Manifesto and his postwar advocacy. The manifesto called for a break with Europe's past to form a new political system through a restructuring of politics and extensive social reform. It was presented not as an ideal, but as the best option for Europe's postwar condition.Bertrand Vayssi√®re, \\"Le Manifeste de Ventotene (1941): Acte de Naissance du Federalisme Europeen,\\" Guerres Mondiales et Conflits Contemporains (Jan 2005), Vol. 55 Issue 217, pp69-76 Key text The most important assessment was the assertion that :\\"The dividing line between progressive and reactionary parties no longer follows the formal line of greater or lesser democracy, or of more or less socialism to be instituted; rather the division falls along the line, very new and substantial, that separates the party members into two groups. The first is made up of those who conceive the essential purpose and goal of struggle as the ancient one, that is, the conquest of national political power ‚Äì and who, although involuntarily, play into the hands of reactionary forces, letting the incandescent lava of popular passions set in the old moulds, and thus allowing old absurdities to arise once again. The second are those who see the creation of a solid international State as the main purpose; they will direct popular forces toward this goal, and, having won national power, will use it first and foremost as an instrument for achieving international unity.\\"\\"La linea di divisione fra i partiti progressisti e partiti reazionari cade perci√≤ ormai, non lungo la linea formale della maggiore o minore democrazia, del maggiore o minore socialismo da istituire, ma lungo la sostanziale nuovissima linea che separa coloro che concepiscono, come campo centrale della lotta quello antico, cio√® la conquista e le forme del potere politico nazionale, e che faranno, sia pure involontariamente il gioco delle forze reazionarie, lasciando che la lava incandescente delle passioni popolari torni a solidificarsi nel vecchio stampo e che risorgano le vecchie assurdit√†, e quelli che vedranno come compito centrale la creazione di un solido stato internazionale, che indirizzeranno verso questo scopo le forze popolari e, anche conquistato il potere nazionale, lo adopereranno in primissima linea come strumento per realizzare l'unit√† internazionale\\" This statement was in contrast with the idea, then prevailing, that unity could be achieved almost naturally and only as a secondary goal, after the attainment of political purposes (communism, democracy and so on) in individual countries.

Early life Born in London on 9 May 1821, was the third son of Sir Henry Chamberlain, 1st Baronet by his second wife. Sir Neville Bowles Chamberlain was an elder brother. After education at private schools and under tutors Crawford obtained a cadetship in the Bengal army in 1837, and was posted to the 28th Bengal infantry. From this corps, he was transferred to the 16th Bengal infantry. Afghan and Sikh Wars With the outbreak of the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1839 Chamberlain's active service began. He was present at the siege of Ghazni (23 July 1839) and at the operations around Kandahar. In September 1841 he was appointed to the command of the 5th Janbaz cavalry, and in the following month, he became adjutant of Christie's horse. Until the end of the Afghan campaign, he was engaged in constant heavy fighting. In 1843 Chamberlain was sent to Scinde with two squadrons of Christie's horse as an independent command, to be known as Chamberlain's horse. In 1845 he was invalided to the Cape of Good Hope, where he married. Next year he returned to India as second in command of the 9th irregular cavalry, into which his own corps had been absorbed. During the First Anglo-Sikh War and the Second Anglo-Sikh War he was constantly in action. He was at the battle of Chillian walla on 13 January 1849, receiving the medal and clasp. On 30 January he was again engaged in the neighbourhood; here he was wounded and was made the subject of a special despatch by Lord Gough (31 January). At the Battle of Gujrat on 21 February, he had to be lifted into the saddle, where he remained throughout the day. He was awarded the clasp, was mentioned in despatches, and, being promoted to captain and brevet major in November 1849, was given the command of the 1st irregular cavalry, formerly Skinner's Horse. He served with them in the Mohmand expedition of 1854 and received a medal and clasp. Indian Rebellion of 1857 On the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion, Chamberlain's men volunteered to shoot condemned rebels at Jullundur (4 June 1857). He was given the duty of disarming the 62nd and 69th regiments at Multan. At Chichawatni (September) Chamberlain was attacked by a superior force of the enemy, and housed his cavalry in a caravanserai. He held out until he was relieved three days later. For his services, Chamberlain was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. In April 1862 he was made colonel. Later life In 1864 Chamberlain was appointed honorary A.D.C. to the governor-general, and two years later was made Companion of the Order of the Star of India, and was included in the first list of twelve officers for good service pension. In 1866, too, he was transferred to the command of the central Indian horse, and next year to the command of the Gwalior district with the rank of brigadier-general. In 1869 Chamberlain was officiating political agent at Gwalior; from October 1869 to February 1870 he was acting political agent at the court of Scindia until his promotion to major-general. During his unemployed time as major-general he served on various commissions and courts of inquiry, and from 1874 to 1879 he commanded the Oudh division. He became lieutenant-general in October 1877 and general in January 1880. In 1880 Chamberlain returned to England for the first time since 1837. In 1884 he was retired from the active list. In 1897, on the occasion of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, he was made Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire. He died at his residence, Lordswood, Southampton, on 13 December 1902, and was buried at Rownhams. Family Chamberlain married twice: # in 1845, at the Cape, to Elizabeth, daughter of J. de Witt; she died on 19 January 1894; and # in 1896 to Augusta Margaret, daughter of Major-general John Christie, C.B., who survived him. There was no issue by either marriage.

In contrast, centralized computing exists when the majority of functions are carried out, or obtained from a remote centralized location. Decentralized computing is a trend in modern-day business environments. This is the opposite of centralized computing, which was prevalent during the early days of computers. A decentralized computer system has many benefits over a conventional centralized network. Desktop computers have advanced so rapidly, that their potential performance far exceeds the requirements of most business applications. This results in most desktop computers remaining idle (in relation to their full potential). A decentralized system can use the potential of these systems to maximize efficiency. However, it is debatable whether these networks increase overall effectiveness. All computers have to be updated individually with new software, unlike a centralised computer system. Decentralised systems still enable file sharing and all computers can share peripherals such as printers and scanners as well as modems, allowing all the computers in the network to connect to the internet. A collection of decentralized computers systems are components of a larger computer network, held together by local stations of equal importance and capability. These systems are capable of running independently of each other.  Origins of decentralized computing  The origins of decentralized computing originate from the work of David Chaum. During 1979 he conceived the first concept of a decentralized computer system known as Mix Network. It provided an anonymous email communications network, which decentralized the authentication of the messages in a protocol that would become the precursor to Onion Routing, the protocol of the TOR browser. Through this initial development of an anonymous communications network, David Chaum applied his Mix Network philosophy to design the world's first decentralized payment system and patented it in 1980 (Patent US4529870). Later in 1982, for his PhD dissertation, he wrote about the need for decentralized computing services in the paper Computer Systems Established, Maintained and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups. He would go on to launch the world's first digital payment system in 1990 called eCash. (Digicash)  Peer-to-peer  Based on a \\"grid model\\" a peer-to-peer system, or P2P system, is a collection of applications run on several local computers, which connect remotely to each other to complete a function or a task. There is no main operating system to which satellite systems are subordinate. This approach to software development (and distribution) affords developers great savings, as they don't have to create a central control point. An example application is LAN messaging which allows users to communicate without a central server.  File sharing applications  One of the most interesting debates over decentralized computing involved Napster, a music file sharing application, which granted users access to an enormous database of files. Record companies brought legal action against Napster, blaming the system for lost record sales. Napster was found in violation of copyright laws by distributing unlicensed software, and was shut down. After the fall of Napster, there was demand for a file sharing system that would be less vulnerable to litigation. Gnutella, a decentralized system, was developed. This system allowed files to be queried and shared between users without relying upon a central directory, and this decentralization shielded the network from litigation related to the actions of individual users.

This handgun is available in three main chamberings: .380 ACP, 9√ó18mm Makarov and 9√ó19mm Parabellum. It also uses a detachable, box-type, double-column magazine.  History  The design of MP-444 is based on the design of MP-443 pistol. In November 2000 one MP-444 pistol was presented at \\"INTERPOLITEX-2000\\" Arms exhibition in Moscow, and it was offered for export–Æ—Ä–∏–π –ê–º–µ–ª–∏–Ω. \\"–ë–∞–≥–∏—Ä–∞\\" –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –æ—Ç \\"–ì—Ä–∞—á–∞\\" // –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª \\"–û—Ä—É–∂–∏–µ\\", ‚Ññ 9, 2000. —Å—Ç—Ä.38-43.  Design  The frame of the pistol is made of strong thermosetting plastic, with the operational steel elements, which makes this a lightweight weapon, built into a plastic construction. The travel of barrel in the close/open cycle is achieved by interaction of two slopes; a primary slope located on the lower part of the barrel and the secondary scope located on the base of the return/buffer mechanism. The buffer is made available to absorb and reduce shock loads of both barrel and slide in their extreme rear positions. The striker has a special cocking feature that looks like a hammer of a standard pistol. This construction allows the shooter to cock the striker manually, thus enabling a double-action operation or an operation with a preliminary cocked striker. An extractor has a dual function: that of extracting an empty case and the second case, which is an indicator of ammo in the magazine. If the extractor's front tip is slightly elevated, the pistol has ammunition. If the extractor is flush and even, this tells the pistoleer that he ran out of cartridges.

The valley, being an important place in Hawaiian religion, includes several historical structures including stone terraces and walls constructed during the time of the Hawaiian monarchy. The nutrient-rich volcanic soil combined with a rainy environment provided the resourceful Hawaiians of the area the opportunity to create one of the most prosperous farming communities in all of Polynesia. The area had complex fish ponds, domesticated animal pens, various large farming beds, and was famous for the cultivation of pink taro root stock, a coveted item to the Ali\`i (the Hawaiian elite). Much of the garden floor was once cultivated for taro, sweet potato, and bananas, with new crops and orchards introduced by Europeans after their arrival.  Sacred Hawaiian mythology  Waimea Valley was considered one of the more recognized locations for its spiritual significance. Ancient Hawaiians were thought to partake in various indigenous religious activities, like human sacrifice. O‚Äôahu‚Äôs largest heiau, or temple, resides there, overlooking the valley.  Ancient ownership of Waimea Valley  In 1092 Waimea Valley was given to the high priests or the Kahuna Nui. It eventually became the home of one of the most distinguished priesthoods in the islands, the Pa'ao. Kamehameha the Great's exclusive Kahuna, Hewahewa, was a descendant of the Pa'ao. The Kahuna Nui were essential to Hawaiian society because they were the experts in various fields like farming, healing, spiritual guidance, fishing, and teaching both the Ali‚Äôi and the common people. Over the course of time, Waimea became known as ‚Äúthe valley of the priests‚Äù. After O\`ahu was conquered by Kamehameha, he then gave ownership of Waimea Valley to Hewa Hewa Nui, to maintain the sacred importance of the area.  Western contact  The first Europeans to touch the island of O‚Äôahu were the crews of the Resolution and the Discovery shortly after the death of Captain Cook in 1779. Historical nature park Formerly known as the Waimea Valley Audubon Center and the Waimea Arboretum and Botanical Garden, the Waimea Valley is a historical nature park including botanical gardens. It is located at 59-864 Kamehameha Highway, Haleiwa, Oahu, Hawaii and is open daily except for Christmas and New Year's Day; an admission fee is charged. The garden was managed until 2003 by the City and County of Honolulu, when management was assumed by the National Audubon Society. In 2008, management was handed over to Hi'ipaka LLC, a non-profit company created by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. The garden now contains 35 distinct collections, representing some 5,000 taxa from around the world. It contains one of the finest collections of Polynesian plants in existence, as well as excellent collections of very rare Hawaiian plants, rare and endangered species native to Lord Howe Island, and individual gardens dedicated to plants from Guam, Madagascar, the Mascarene Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and the Seychelles. Other major collections include the hibiscus evolutionary garden, araceae, bauhinia, bromeliaceae, heliconia, liliaceae, as well as bamboo, begonia, ferns, tropical fruit, etc. Among many other tropical plants of note, there are Calamondin citrus trees in the parking lot. The garden valley is approximate in length, with a small waterfall and swimming hole at the valley's hind end. =Images= Image:Waimea Valley Audubon Center - general view.JPG Image:Waimea Valley Audubon Center, Oahu, Hawaii - lake view.JPG Image:Waimea Valley Audubon Center, Oahu, Hawaii - waterfall view.JPG Waimea Valley.jpg Activities The falls have been used for cliff diving featuring hourly exhibition.

It never raced, and only one was produced. The car has not been officially valued, but a ¬£7 million bid for it was declined by the owners in 1996. It was more than 3 times the price of a Ferrari 250 GTO at the time. Development Jaguar had considered the manufacture of a DOHC V12 engine as far back as 1950, initially for racing purposes, and then developing a SOHC road going version, unlike the XK which was designed as a production engine and later pressed into service for racing. The engine design was essentially two XK 6-cylinder engines on a common crankshaft with an aluminium cylinder block, although there were differences in the inlet porting, valve angles and combustion chamber shape. The first engine ran in July 1964. The design structure of a mid-engined prototype was first mooted in 1960 by William Heynes, but it was not until 1965 that construction began, with the first car running by March 1966. The aluminium body exterior was designed by Malcolm Sayer, the aerodynamicist responsible for aerodynamic air flow work on the Jaguar C-type, D-type, who used his Bristol Aeroplane Company background to build it using techniques borrowed from the aircraft industry. The task of building the car was entrusted by Heynes to Engineer Derick White, Ted Brookes, Mike Kimberley, Bob Blake in the Browns Lane experimental department's \\"competition shop\\" - Blake described by his contemporaries as \\"An Artist in Metal\\". William Heynes recognised as early as 1964 that a car such as the XJ13 needed an experienced race driver to help develop it. Jack Brabham was approached in this regard but the challenge was eventually taken up by ex-Jaguar Apprentice David Hobbs. David Hobbs was recruited as the XJ13's main test driver. In 1969 Hobbs was included in a FIA list of 27 drivers who were rated the best in the world. Hobbs achieved an unofficial UK closed lap record with the XJ13 which stood for 32 years. The XJ13‚Äôs main test and development driver, Hobbs, was joined at Silverstone for the XJ13‚Äôs final test at full racing speed by another racing driver (and ex-Jaguar apprentice) Richard Attwood. The XJ13 had mid- engine format with the 5.0 litre V12 engine designed by Heynes and Claude Bailey, mounted behind the driver, used as a stressed chassis member together with the five-speed manual ZF Transaxle driving the rear wheels. The front suspension wishbones were similar to that of the E-Type, however where the E-Type used longitudinal torsion bars, the XJ13 had more conventional coil spring/damper units. At the rear there again remained similarities with the E-Type‚Äîthe use of driveshafts as upper transverse links‚Äîhowever the rest was quite different, with two long radius arms per side angling back from the central body tub together with a single fabricated transverse lower link. The development of the XJ13, although treated seriously by the designers, was never a priority for company management (despite assistant MD Lofty England's Le Mans success in the 1950s), and became less so following the 1966 merger with BMC. By that time Ford had developed the 7.0 litre GT40, and so the XJ13 was considered obsolete by the time the prototype was complete. The prototype was tested at MIRA and at Silverstone, which confirmed that it would have required considerable development to make it competitive. The prototype was put into storage and no further examples were made. MIRA crash Jaguar XJ13 during assembly at Abbey Panels after the MIRA crash In 1971 the Series 3 E-type was about to be launched with Jaguar's first production V12 engine. The publicity team wanted a shot of the XJ13 at speed for the opening sequence of the film launching the V12 E-Type. On 21 January 1971, the XJ13 was taken to MIRA for the filming with Jaguar test driver Norman Dewis at the wheel. Sadly, the car was driven by Dewis at speed on a damaged tyre, against the instructions of Jaguar director England. The resultant crash heavily damaged and nearly destroyed the car, although Dewis was unharmed. The wreck of the car was put back into storage. Some years later, Edward Loades spotted the crashed XJ13 in storage at Jaguar and made the offer to 'Lofty' England that his company Abbey Panels should rebuild the car. The car was rebuilt, to a specification similar to the original, using some of the body jigs made for its original construction and at a cost of ¬£1,000 to Jaguar. In Jaguar's own words, \\"The car that can be seen today is not an exact reproduction of the original.\\" The XJ13 made its public debut in July 1973 when 'Lofty' drove it around Silverstone at the British Grand Prix meeting. It is now displayed at the British Motor Museum at Gaydon, UK. Replicas Neville Swales, Building the Legend, creates \\"exact replicas\\" of the pre-crash 1966 Jaguar XJ13. His first recreation, powered by an original quad-cam prototype engine, was built with the knowledge of the Jaguar Heritage Trust and under the guidance of surviving XJ13 Team members. The car, painted and with its engine running, was shown in February 2016 at the London Classic Car show.

Biography Sophie was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 21 May 1801. She was the daughter of King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden and his wife, Frederica of Baden. After her birth, she was raised under the supervision of the royal governesses Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie and Charlotte Stierneld in succession. Sophie was eight years old when her father was deposed by the Coup of 1809 and she left Sweden with her family. Between the time of the coup which deposed her father, and leaving Sweden, she and her mother were under house arrest. During this period, she was described in the famous diary of Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp as a stubborn girl who was much more haughty and possessed less self-control than her brother Gustav. An anecdote describes the contrast between the siblings. When Fredrika and her children were given permission to join the deposed king, famous Swedish nobleman Axel von Fersen came to discuss the arrangements. When he was about to leave, Sophie's older brother ran to the door to open it for Fersen. The former queen Fredrika is quoted as saying, \\"Sophie would never in the world have done that, she thinks of herself too highly for that.\\" (search for all versions on WorldCat) In 1815, she was engaged, and on 25 July 1819 in Karlsruhe, Sophie married her half-grand-uncle Prince Leopold of Baden, the son of a morganatic marriage. The marriage with Leopold had been specifically arranged by her uncle, Grand Duke Karl I of Baden, to improve the chances that Leopold would one day succeed him as grand duke because of Sophie's royal lineage; Leopold, though his right to the throne was recognized, was originally the issue of a morganatic marriage. During the reign of Louis I, Grand Duke of Baden, they lived a modest life away from court, as Louis did not want the heir to the throne at court. In 1830, her husband ascended to the grand ducal throne as Leopold I, and Sophie became Grand Duchess of Baden. Sophie is described as wise and dutiful but strict.Heribert Jansson (in Swedish). Drottning Victoria (Queen Victoria). H√∂kerbergs Bokf√∂rlag. (1963) ISBN. She kept late hours and arose late in the mornings, after which she spent hours writing letters to various relatives around Europe in her n√©glig√©e. She was interested in science, art and politics, and kept herself well informed on all political events of the day through her correspondence. Her ties to the Viennese court were particularly tight, and it was to Vienna her sons were sent to complete their education. Sophie retained a certain bitterness over the deposition of her father, and took it very badly when her brother was deprived of his status as a Swedish prince. During the tumult caused by the appearance of Kaspar Hauser, Sophie was rumoured to have ordered Hauser's assassination in 1833. This damaged her relationship to her husband, and Sophie was said to have had an affair. During the revolution of 1848, she was forced to flee from Karlsruhe with her family to Strasbourg. They returned in 1849, after the revolt had been subdued by Prussian forces. She became a widow in 1852. Sophie convinced her son Frederick to enter an arranged dynastic marriage rather than a marriage to his love, Baroness Stephanie von Gensau. In 1852, the Swedish royal house wished to make peace with the deposed Swedish royal house, and Oscar I of Sweden and Josephine of Leuchtenberg tried to arrange a meeting, but without success. In 1863, however, Sophie met the Swedish heir presumptive Prince Oscar II of Sweden and his consort Sophie of Nassau. The meeting was a success: Sophie asked him about how the Stockholm of her childhood had changed, and when they left, she presented the couple with a gift to their son prince Gustaf, a medallion with the inscription \\"G\\" and the crown of the Swedish Crown Prince, because he had the same name as her brother. In 1864, Sophie was interviewed by an unnamed Swedish writer, an interview which was published in her biography about famous Swedish women by Wilhelmina St√•lberg (who was likely the unnamed writer in question): > Her palace was placed in a little park and had the appearance of a beautiful > private residence rather than a royal palace. Beautiful trees, well tendered > lawns and alleys surrounded the building. No grandeur in regard of staff or > other things was visible anywhere. In the room, in which I first entered, > there were an abundance of flowers and paintings. Everything there seemed to > represent the home of a soul living in the solitude of her memories. I was > also told that the Grand Duchess seldom appeared. She soon entered with > light, bearely audible steps, a gracious figure who arrived with open arms > to embrace and kiss me. [...] She soon turned the conversation to Sweden and > her memories of it.

While visiting the Institute of Knowledge he runs into his old friend Carlos Wu. Carlos is the father of Janss' two children, a fact that he found so embarrassing that he decided to leave Earth rather than face Bey upon his expected return. But Bey proves perfectly happy to hear about the children, as his albinism denies him a license to have children of his own, and he and Sharrol had agreed that Carlos should act as a surrogate. Reconciled, Carlos mentions that he has been contacted by Sigmund Ausfaller of the Bureau of Alien Affairs, who has offered him a ride to Earth. Bey has had several run-ins with Ausfaller in the past; Ausfaller aims to protect human-alien relations in any way he can, and at one point he planted a bomb on Bey's alien-provided General Products' #2 hull to prevent him from stealing it and potentially causing a sticky diplomatic incident. Worried about what might happen to Carlos at Ausfaller's hands, he decides to accompany him on his next meeting. Bey, Carlos and Ausfaller meet. Ausfaller explains that alien passengers were aboard some of the vessels that disappeared, and he has been given the job of finding out what is going on to avoid further issues. His ship, the Hobo Kelly, appears to be a cargo and passenger ship, but in reality is a warship built out of a nearly invulnerable General Products' #2 hull, capable of 30G of acceleration, armed with guided missiles, an x-ray laser and smaller laser cannons. Additionally, of the eight ships that have disappeared to date, only two were incoming, the other six were outgoing. Their inbound mission should thus be safe. This proves to be the case for most of the journey, but only moments before entering the outskirts of Sol the ship suddenly lurches and drops out of hyperspace. Examining the area they discover three small tugs at some distance, but nothing else of interest. They turn towards Sol and continue on their way home while Bey checks the ship to try to find out what happened. He discovers that the hyperdrive motor is completely missing from the hull. When he informs the crew, Carlos uses the ship's hyperwave communications to retrieve information from Elephant's databanks on Earth, looking up a number of black hole related topics. When his inquiries are finally answered, he finds that one of bits of information was written by Dr. Julian Forward, a researcher Carlos has wanted to meet. Carlos calls him and they discuss the disappearing hyperdrive motor. Forward invites them to Forward Station to wait for a ferry to Earth. They agree to his plans, although Forward Station is right where the ships are disappearing. Ausfaller agrees that Carlos and Bey can go to Forward Station; he did not reveal himself during the conversation and the small ship would not give away the fact that there was a third crewmember. After equipping for potential combat, Bey and Carlos ferry to the station to meet with Forward. He shows them his prize possession, the \\"Grabber\\", an electromagnetic assembly that lets him shake masses of neutronium to produce polarized gravitational waves, which he is attempting to use to establish communications with alien races who may not have discovered hyperwave. When Forward asks Carlos what he thinks has happened, Carlos explains that a black hole might have been able to do it - gravity is one of the few forces that can penetrate a General Products starship hull. When Carlos admits that he has heard of quantum black holes, Forward takes them both captive. Forward explains that he found the Tunguska meteorite, which was actually a small black hole. Returning it to the station he fed it the sphere of neutronium he was previously using for his communications attempt, thereby increasing its mass, and then fed in the exhaust of an ion engine to give it a permanent electric charge. The hole could now be manipulated with magnets, and towed around by the tugs. The tugs move it into the path of incoming starships to disable them, and then pirate the now-defenseless ships. When the tugs return to the station, Forward suddenly asks if someone else is aboard the Hobo Kelly, a question that is answered when Ausfaller fires on the tugs, destroying two and causing the third to flee. The tugs drop the black hole, but Forward and his assistant Angel manage to catch it in the Grabber. However, by this time Bey has managed to free himself enough to cut through his bonds, which turns out to be the power cable feeding the Grabber, releasing the black hole once again. As the hole falls towards the station it hits the dome and cuts a hole in it, sucking Forward's assistant into it. Forward makes some adjustments on his control panel and is then sucked into the hole as well. Ausfaller rescues Bey and Carlos, who explain what was happening. They speculate that Forward deliberately turned up the air pressure in his final moments in order to allow the two to live until Ausfaller returned. They watch as the quantum black hole collapses the asteroid and it disappears in a searing blast of light. Trivia * According to the afterword Niven wrote for this story in the collection Playgrounds of the Mind, the character Julian Forward is named in honor of science fiction author Robert Forward. Forward returned the 'favor' by naming a character in his own novel Dragon's Egg Pierre Carnot Niven. * Niven originally pitched this story as an episode of Star Trek: The Animated Series in 1973, but it was rejected by D. C. Fontana. They bought his story The Soft Weapon instead which was produced as The Slaver Weapon. * The story is retold, from the point of view of Sigmund Ausfaller, in Juggler of Worlds. * Pluto is dismissed as an escaped moon of Neptune, while the solar system's outer planets are listed as Neptune, Persephone, Ca√Øna, Antenora, and Ptolemea, after the rounds of Cocytus in Dante's Inferno, with Judecca reserved by the International Astronomical Union for the next discovery. Persephone has a retrograde orbit that is tilted 120 degrees to the ecliptic.

Accessed 11 February 2008 Military career Chamberlain was commissioned a sub-lieutenant in the 11th Foot on 9 August 1873, and promoted to lieutenant on 9 August 1874. In 1878, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, he joined the staff of Field Marshal Sir Frederick Roberts, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Afghanistan. He was wounded slightly at the Battle of Kandahar.Peter Ainsworth, The Origin of Snooker: The Neville Chamberlain Story , International Billiards and Snooker Federation He served with Roberts at Ootacamund between 1881 and 1884. He was promoted to captain on 9 August 1885, to brevet major on 7 November 1885, and to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 July 1887.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1901 In 1890 he became Military Secretary to the Kashmir Government. He was promoted to brevet colonel on 6 January 1894, while his actual rank was still that of captain. Substantive promotion to major followed on 9 August 1894, and the promotion to colonel was made substantive on 6 February 1899, when he was appointed Colonel on the Staff in Delhi. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Lord Roberts had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in South Africa. Chamberlain rejoined Lord Roberts in South Africa in December 1899, as \\"First Aide-de-Camp and Private Secretary\\", and was highly commended by Roberts in despatches from the war (despatch dated 31 March 1900). He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1900. Royal Irish Constabulary In 1900 Chamberlain was appointed Inspector-General of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), the armed police force for the whole of Ireland except Dublin. The force was under the direct control of the British Administration in Ireland, based in Dublin Castle. It was responsible for intelligence gathering as well as maintaining order, and was seen as the \\"eyes and ears\\" of the government.W. J. McCormack, The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture, Blackwell, 1999, , p. 477 He formally resigned from the British Army on 1 November 1901. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) during a royal visit to Ireland in August 1903, Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1911 and Knight of Grace in the Venerable Order of Saint John in April 1914, and was awarded the King's Police Medal in the 1915 New Year Honours. Chamberlain's years in the RIC coincided with the rise of a number of political, cultural and sporting organisations with the common aim of asserting Ireland's separateness from the UK, which were often collectively referred to as Sinn F√©in,Brian Feeney, Sinn F√©in. A Hundred Turbulent Years, O'Brien, 2002, , p. 38 culminating in the formation of the Irish Volunteers in 1913. In reports to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Augustine Birrell, and the Under-Secretary, Sir Matthew Nathan, Chamberlain warned that the Volunteers were preparing to stage an insurrection and proclaim Irish independence.Michael Foy and Brian Barton, The Easter Rising, Sutton, 2004, , p. 51 However, in April 1916, when Nathan showed him a letter from the army commander in the south of Ireland telling of an expected landing of arms on the south-west coast and a rising planned for Easter, they were both \\"doubtful whether there was any foundation for the rumour\\".Leon √ì Broin, Dublin Castle and the 1916 Rising, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1966, p. 79 The Easter Rising began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, and lasted for six days, ending only when much of O'Connell Street had been destroyed by artillery fire. Although the Royal Commission on the 1916 Rebellion (the Hardinge commission) cleared the RIC of any blame for the Rising, Chamberlain was eventually forced to resign following continued criticism of the force's intelligence handling. Later life After his retirement Chamberlain lived in Ascot, Berkshire, England. On 19 March 1938 he had a letter published in The Field in which he claimed to have invented the game of snooker at the officers' mess of the 11th Devonshire Regiment in Jubbulpore (Jabalpur), India in 1875. His claim was supported by the author Compton Mackenzie in a letter to The Billiard Player in 1939, and has been accepted ever since.

SR 401, which heads north as a four-lane divided highway, has an intersection with Eisenhower Avenue, an east-west arterial through the industrial southern edge of Alexandria, and has a trumpet interchange with a connector to Eisenhower Avenue and the Van Dorn Street station on the Washington Metro's Blue Line. There is no ramp from the connector to northbound SR 401. The state highway crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Washington to Atlanta Main Line and Backlick Run and intersects Edsall Road. SR 401 continues through a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 236 (Duke Street) adjacent to Landmark Mall. North of the mall, the state highway becomes an undivided highway, crosses Holmes Run, and begins to closely parallel I-395 (Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway).

Organogermanium chemistry is the corresponding chemical science.Main Group Metals in Organic Synthesis, Hisashi Yamamoto (Editor), Koichiro Oshima (Editor) 2004 Germanium shares group 14 in the periodic table with silicon, tin and lead, and not surprisingly the chemistry of organogermanium is in between that of organosilicon compounds and organotin compounds. One reason that limited synthetic value of organogermanium compound is costs of germanium compounds. On the other hand, germanium is advocated as a non-toxic alternative to many toxic organotin reagents. Compounds like tetramethylgermanium and tetraethylgermanium are used in the microelectronics industry as precursors for germanium dioxide chemical vapor deposition. The first organogermanium compound, tetraethylgermane, was synthesised by Winkler in 1887, by the reaction of germanium tetrachloride with diethylzinc. The organogermanium compound bis (2-Carboxyethylgermanium)sesquioxide was first reported in 1966. Organogermanes Organogermanes of the type R4Ge with alkyl (R) groups are accessed through the cheapest available germanium precursor germanium tetrachloride and alkyl nucleophiles. The following trends are observed going down the carbon group: The nucleophilicity increases Si2CHCH2)GeH3 is the organogermanium hydride that is a high vapor pressure liquid germanium source for MOVPE. Isobutylgermane is currently investigated as safer and less hazardous alternative to toxic germane gas in microelectronic applications. Tris(trimethylsilyl)germanium hydride (Me3Si)3GeH has been investigated as a non-toxic alternative to many tin hydrides such as tributyltinhydride. =Other compounds= Triphenylgermanol (Ph3GeOH) is known, existing as colorless solid. Like the isostructural silanol, it engages in hydrogen bonding in the solid state.Ferguson, George; Gallagher, John F.; Murphy, Denis; Spalding, Trevor R.; Glidewell, Christopher; Holden, H. Diane \\"The structure of triphenylgermanium hydroxide\\" Acta Crystallographica, Section C: Crystal Structure Communications 1992, vol. C48, 1228-31. Many germanium reactive intermediates are known: germylenes (carbene pendants), germyl free radicals, germynes (carbyne pendants). Digermynnes only exist for extremely bulky substituents. Unlike alkynes, the C-Ge-Ge-C core of these Digermynnes are nonlinear, although they are planar. The Ge-Ge distance is 2.22 √Ö, and the Ge-Ge-C angles are 131¬∞. Such compounds are prepared by reduction of bulky arylgermanium(II) halides.Philip P. Power \\"Bonding and Reactivity of Heavier Group 14 Element Alkyne Analogues\\" Organometallics 2007, volume 26, pp 4362‚Äì4372. As with silicon and contrasting with carbon, compounds containing Ge=C (germenes) and Ge=Ge (digermylenes) double bonds are rare.

Its significance lies in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759) and the Battle of Sainte-Foy, fought six months later on today's Des Braves park. It was established as a park by law on March 17, 1908, it features an interpretive centre and walking trails, and is sometimes used for outdoor concerts, especially during the national festival events. The park contains a collection of about 50 historical artillery pieces scattered about its grounds. It is managed by the National Battlefields Commission, a federal government agency under the Minister of Canadian Heritage with members appointed by the Queen in her Canadian, Ontarian, and Qu√©b√©cois Councils. The commission also oversees its own police service since 1948. Martello towers Martello Tower No. 1. Note the reconstruction of the gun, carriage, and swiveling gun carriage platform that originally surmounted the tower. Built by the British to prevent the Americans from drawing close enough to lay siege to the walls of Quebec, the four Martello towers were begun by James Craig in 1808 and completed in 1812. The towers were arranged to provide for each other's defence, being situated along an axis that bisects the Plains of Abraham from the northwest to the southeast in order to screen the western approach to Quebec City, and were numbered rather than named. Tower No. 3 was demolished in the 1900s but the other three remain. The limited openings on the tower were designed to prevent the enemy from taking it by storm, while the tower's rounded shape (to deflect projectiles) and thick masonry walls made it nearly impervious to artillery fire. Martello Tower door The doors to the tower are at a height of twice the height of a man - about - and could only be reached by a removable ladder. The towers were never tested in battle, and became obsolete in the 1860s with the development of rifled artillery, which was powerful enough to breach their walls. Using the theme of military engineering Martello Tower No. 1 is open for visitors to view its three floors during the summer months. The Martellos were originally fitted with removable roofs in the fall to keep snow from accumulating on the gun platform at the top and removed in the spring. The roofs were later replaced with newer permanent ones which look almost the same. The three towers were designated a national historic site in 1990, and also form part of the Fortifications of Quebec National Historic Site. One of the three towers is located within the city streets away from the park.

Arguably, the pied raven could be considered a f. loc. (local form) of the North Atlantic subspecies of the common raven which was only found on the Faroe Islands and has disappeared since the mid-20th century. It had large areas of white feathering, most frequently on the head, the wings and the belly and its beak was light brown. Apart from that, it looked like the black North Atlantic ravens (C. c. varius morpha typicus). History The pied raven received binomial names such as Corvus leucophaeus (by Vieillot, 1817) and Corvus leucomelas (by Wagler, 1827). It is currently referred to as Corvus corax varius morpha leucophaeus. Description Replica pied raven specimen at the F√∏roya N√°tt√∫rugripasavn. In modern Faroese, the bird is called hv√≠travnur (\\"white raven\\"), older name gorpur bringu hv√≠ti (\\"white-chested corbie\\"). Normal individuals of the subspecies varius, which is found on Iceland and the Faroe Islands, already show a tendency towards more extensive white feather bases compared with the nominate subspecies. But only on the Faroes, a mutation in the melanin metabolism would become fixed in the population, causing some birds to have about half of their feathers entirely white. While albinotic specimens sometimes occur in bird populations, the pied raven seems not to have been based on such occasional \\"sports\\", but on a constantly or at least regularly present part of the local raven population. Skarvanesi's 18 fuglar with the pied raven in the lower right corner The first record of the pied raven seems to be in the pre-1500 kv√¶√∞i Fuglakv√¶√∞i eldra (\\"The elder ballad of birds\\") which mentions 40 local species, including the great auk. Later, the pied raven is mentioned in the reports of Lucas Debes (1673) and Jens Christian Svabo (1781/82). Carl Julian von Graba in 1828 speaks of ten individuals he saw himself and states that these birds, while less numerous than the black morph, were quite common. D√≠√∞rikur √° Skarvanesi, the first Faroe painter, painted the Fuglar series, a number of portrayal of birds. On his 18 fuglar (\\"18 birds\\"), the animal in the lower right corner can be identified as a pied raven. The painting is currently on display in the Listask√°lin museum of Faroe art in T√≥rshavn. Extinction The 6 Zoologisk Museum specimens As exemplified by Skarvanesi's painting, which obviously was done from stuffed birds, the pied raven was an object of interest to collectors. During the nineteenth century, the pied birds were selectively shot because they could fetch high prices; the s√Ωsluma√∞ur (sheriff) of Streymoy, Hans Christopher M√ºller once paid two Danish rigsdaler for a stuffed specimen from N√≥lsoy. Such sums, a healthy amount of money for the impoverished Faroe farmers, made shooting a pied raven a profitable enterprise. Additionally, ravens in general were hunted as pests. In the mid- nineteenth century, every Faroe male of hunting age was ordered by royal decree to shoot at least one raven or two other predatory birds per year or be fined four skillings. One of the last pied raven specimens was shot on November 2, 1902, on Mykines. In the autumn of 1916, another bird was seen at Velbasta√∞ur and on Koltur. The last known individual was found in the winter of 1947 on N√≥lsoy and disappeared late in 1948. As these last sightings raised widespread interest, it seems probable that after 1948, no pied raven has been seen. The pied raven on Faroe postal stamp FR 276 The pied raven, being a colour variation, only differed in one or very few alleles (as opposed to numerous genes in a true subspecies) from the black birds. The \\"piebald\\" allele(s) was or were recessive or (if more than one) only caused the novel coloration if they were all present. This is evidenced by the last sightings which occurred in the absence of a regular breeding population of piebald birds, and the observations of H. C. M√ºller. Thus, it is not certain that the form is indeed extinct, if one can speak of \\"extinction\\" in any but a population genetical sense anyway. Theoretically, the allele(s) could still be present but hidden in black individuals of the subspecies and thus, a pied raven could once again be born one day. As the raven population on the Faroes has declined to a few hundred birds at best over the recent decades, this does not seem very likely. Illustration from the 1850s Today, 16 museum specimens of the pied raven are known: six in Copenhagen (Zoologisk Museum), four in New York, two in Uppsala, one in Leiden, one in Braunschweig (Naturhistorisches Museum), one in Dresden and one in the Manchester Museum. On June 12, 1995, the Postverk F√∏roya issued the postal stamp FR 276, which featured a pied raven. It was designed by the famous Faroese artist and scientific illustrator Astrid Andreasen.

Norwich City In October 1985, Norwich City manager Ken Brown paid ¬£50,000 for Culverhouse, who would go on to spend almost a decade Carrow Road. At the time Culverhouse joined Norwich, they were in the Second Division and were favourites to win promotion back to the First Division. They duly did so, and Culverhouse ended his first season at Carrow Road with a Second Division championship medal. For a while it look as though he might add a First Division title medal the following season, as Norwich emerged as surprise title contenders, although they eventually had to settle to a fifth-place finish - the highest final position in the club's history at the time.

They first appeared in the Givetian stage of the Middle Devonian. Within the group sizes ranged from a few tens of centimeters (Tristichopterus) to several meters (Hyneria and Eusthenodon). Some tristichopterids share some of the features of the elpistostegalians, a paraphyletic assemblage of fishes close to the origin of tetrapods. This mainly concerns the shape of the skull and a reduction in size of the posterior fins. An old and persistent notion is that Eusthenopteron was able to crawl onto land using its fins. However, there is no evidence actually supporting this idea. All tristichopterids went extinct by the end of Late Devonian.

He was head of the company from 1886 until 1930. Early Life Berwind was born on June 17, 1848 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was one of five sons born to German immigrants Augusta (n√©e Guldenferring) Berwind (1821‚Äì1904) and John Berwind (1813‚Äì1893). His sister was Julia A. Berwind, a social welfare activist who in later life lived with Edward. Berwind was appointed to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in July 1865 by President Abraham Lincoln, and graduated in June 1869 as a midshipman. He was promoted to ensign in July 1870 and to master (equivalent to the modern rank of lieutenant, junior grade) in March 1872. He was placed on the Retired List in May 1875. While in the Navy, he served during the Franco-Prussian War and as an Ensign, met the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, who became a lifelong friend of Berwind. During the Grant administration, he served as a naval aide at the White House. Career Upon leaving the Navy, Berwind went into business with his older brother, Charles Berwind, and Judge Allison White; co-founding Berwind, White & Company, which was incorporated as Berwind-White in 1886. Berwind worked closely with J. P. Morgan in the consolidation, reorganization, integration, and expansion of his coal mining operations. In his day he was also considered to be the world's largest individual owner of coal mining properties. Berwind also refused to bargain with his employees, making his mines among the last open shops in the coal fields. Berwind and Peter A. B. Widener established the New York subway system and Berwind, along with Widener, was a director of International Mercantile Marine Company which owned the White Star Line and, subsequently, the RMS Titanic.A legacy company continues to operate today as the Berwind Company Berwind controlled the steamship business in New York and Philadelphia and supplied much of the coal used by the ships of the US Navy. After his brother's death in 1890, Edward became sole manager of the company. Personal life In 1886, Berwind was married to Sarah Vesta Herminie Torrey (1856‚Äì1922), at Leghorn, Italy where her father was U.S. Consular Agent. Sarah was a daughter of Franklin Torrey, a prominent sculptor, and Sarah Lincoln (n√©e Spinney) Torrey. Her brother was Charles Franklin Torrey, who inherited the residue of her estate. After the death of his wife in 1922, his sister served as hostess for Edward in New York and Newport. He died on August 18, 1936 at his home, 2 East 64th Street in New York City. After a funeral held at St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue in New York, he was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, along with his wife, in a mausoleum (modeled after the Tower of the Winds in Athens) that was designed by Horace Trumbauer, the architect of The Elms, his summer home in Newport, Rhode Island. His sister Julia and nephew, Charles E. Dunlap, were his principal beneficiaries. File:Berwind house 2 E64th St front 828 5th Av jeh.jpgEdward J.

Originally formed in 1986 by Rob Woebber and Jerry Hollis under the name Virginia Dare, they pulled together with drummer Paul Garafola to form a mix of originals and covers and would go on to play songs in the influence of The Cure, Sisters of Mercy, Depeche Mode and The Smiths to name a few. After the addition of bassist Dave Isham, they changed the name of the band to New Life Crisis and went on to play the tri-state circuit for years performing to packed clubs and developed a large following. After Rob Woebber, guitarist and keyboardist, left the band in 1992, the band went on for a few years cycling through members until the other founding member, Jerry Hollis left and handed the band over to his brother Paul Mahos. Paul Mahos, Stephen Dupree, Matt Kutner, Seth Tieger and Michael Maisano joined together in September 1999, signing to Tommy Boy Records in Spring of 2000.

The East Navidad River begins in southern Fayette County and runs southeast until it reaches Colorado County., The West Navidad River also begins in Fayette County and wanders south for 23 miles to its confluence with the East Navidad near Oakland, where they become the Navidad River. The town of Schulenburg is centered between the two branches, which are both somewhat seasonal, and navigation can be difficult due to low water levels and obstructions.Texas Parks and Wildlife: An Analysis of Texas Waterways The river then winds south, passing the small communities of Sublime, Speaks, and Morales and then feeding Lake Texana about 7 miles east of Edna.

This can be applied to both animals and humans or micro-organisms; for instance, in religions that practice Ahimsa, both are seen as holy and worthy of life. In Christianity The phrase sanctity of life refers to the idea that human life is sacred, holy, and precious, used mainly in political and moral debates over such controversial issues as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, embryonic stem-cell research, and the \\"right to die\\" in English- speaking countries, comparable phrases are also used in other languages. Although the phrase was used primarily in the 19th century in Protestant discourse, since World War II the phrase has been used in Catholic moral theology and, following Roe v. Wade, Evangelical Christian moral rhetoric. The sanctity of life principle, which is often contrasted with the \\"quality of life\\" to some extent, is the basis of all Catholic teaching about the sixth commandment in the Ten Commandments.  In Eastern religions  In Western thought, sanctity of life is usually applied solely to the human species (anthropocentrism, sometimes called dominionism), in marked contrast to many schools of Eastern philosophy, which often hold that all animal life is sacred‚Äïin some cases to such a degree that, for example, practitioners of Jainism carry brushes with which to sweep insects from their path, lest they inadvertently tread upon them.  In Logic  To expand into other areas of philosophy, ask the following question: \\"Would you kill Hitler in 1939?\\". Both possible answers (yes/no) can be seen as contrary to sanctity of life.

Born in a mud house in a remote and largely illiterate village in China, he was awarded a scholarship funded as a result of the Boxer Rebellion of the late 19th century to attend Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University. As part of that scholarship, he came to the U.S. in 1926 to study electrical engineering and physics at MIT. He completed his graduate studies first at the University of Pennsylvania, and then in physics at Harvard University. Jen was among the first to provide experimental proof of the existence of the ionosphere. In addition, he obtained the first theoretically calculated value for the electron affinity spectrum of the hydrogen atom, a problem of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics and astrophysics. In 1937, Jen returned to China, and subsequently joined in the \\"Academic Long March\\" to set up a wartime refugee university (the National Southwestern Associated University) in Kunming. His wartime teaching and research contributed to the training of what would become the nucleus of the present-day Chinese scientific intelligentsia. After the war, Jen returned to the Physics Department at Harvard, and eventually settled at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University to carry on pioneering research in trapping free radicals and other topics in microwave spectroscopy. In 1972, following Richard Nixon's visit to China, Jen led a ground-breaking delegation of Chinese American scientists to that country. The delegation conferred with Premier Zhou Enlai, and initiated what was to become a steady stream of scientific exchanges between the U.S. and China. Jen subsequently made numerous visits to China. He continued to work on strengthening U.S.-China scientific relations, and in addition was a leader in improving scientific education in Chinese universities. Full Biography C K Jen was born on October 2, 1906 in Hexi Village on the west bank of the Qin River in Shanxi Province in northern China. Shanxi Province is part of the Yellow River Valley which served as the \\"cradle of Chinese civilization,\\" but by the time of Jen's birth, was a largely arid region populated by poor farmers struggling with overworked soil and periodic flooding. Jen was the second son in a family with five children. He began his elementary school education at age 11 and two years later entered middle school. At age 15, he was admitted to the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. The students at Tsinghua were chosen from each province on the basis of that province's indemnity payment for the Boxer Uprising of 1900. While at Tsinghua, Jen participated in the May Fourth Movement, the first expression of what was to be a lifelong opposition to imperialism and colonialism throughout the world. In 1926 he came to the US to study at MIT, where his mentors included Norbert Wiener, Vannevar Bush, and others. He received a graduate fellowship to the University of Pennsylvania in 1928, where he published with G. W. Kendrick two papers on the experimental proof of the existence of the ionosphere. The following year he entered Harvard and in 1933 received his PhD in physics. While there, he derived the first theoretically calculated value for the electron affinity of the hydrogen atom (six years later to be improved by HSW Massey). He returned to Tsinghua in 1934 and continued his research in numerous areas of experimental physics, including the effects of microwave radiation on animate objects, anticipating the microwave oven by some thirty years. His scientific research however inevitably became entwined with the political events of the time. After occupying Manchuria in the early 1930s, Japan invaded Beijing on July 27, 1937 (as luck would have it, the exact day Jen was to wed his wife :pl:Paocheng Tao Jen). Subsequent to the Japanese invasion, Jen joined many of the remaining faculty and students of the three leading North China universities‚ÄîPeking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University‚Äîin what became known as the \\"Academic Long March.\\" The refugees fled first to Changsha in Hunan Province and then to Kunming in Yunnan Province, a distance of some 3000 km. In Kunming the 800-some faculty and student established the National Southwestern Associated University. Over the next eight years of bombing, deprivation and hardship, Jen persisted in his theoretical and experimental radio research as well as in his physics teaching responsibilities. His students during this period included future Nobel Prize winners C. N. Yang and T. D. Lee, and other distinguished researchers such as Chen-To Tai. At the end of World War II, he returned to the United States on sabbatical leave at Harvard and turned his research focus to microwave spectroscopy. His work in this area was influenced by senior colleagues at Harvard including John Van Vleck, Charles Townes, Edward Purcell and others. In 1950, he became a senior physicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (APL), where he continued his research on microwave spectroscopy, and, together with collaborators including Samuel Foner, Edward Cochran, and others, carried out pioneering research on trapping of free radicals. Their paper on electron spin resonance (1958) proved to be one of the most frequently cited APL publications into the 21st century (Berl 1996). As stated in Physics Today (Moorjani 2001), the study led by Jen on the trapping of hydrogen atoms in a solid hydrogen matrix at liquid helium temperatures \\"allowed Norman Ramsey to infer the lifetime of hydrogen atoms bouncing around in the maser chamber and to conclude that the system will not be too lossy. Ramsey could therefore confidently proceed with the building of the hydrogen maser.\\" Jen was the author of numerous entries on microwave physics in the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology and in the Encyclopedia of Physics. Through the 1960s and 1970s, Jen became an outspoken political activist and participated in numerous anti-Vietnam War demonstrations. Following President Nixon's successful trip to China in February, 1972, he decided to organize a group of scholars to visit China as well. Overcoming numerous obstacles and objections, he led the first trip by a group of Chinese-American scientists to the People's Republic of China since World War II. The group was received by Premier Chou En-Lai. At the reception, Chou spoke for the first time in public on the fate of Lin Piao and arrangements were made for Jen's youngest daughter, Erica, to become the first American student to study in China since 1949. Jen made eight more visits to China. He devoted the latter part of his life to improving relations between the U.S. and China, and to the modernization of education, especially in physics, in China.

Childhood The eldest child of one of three Huguenot brothers who fled France with considerable wealth after the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Peter Faneuil was born on June 20, 1700 in New Rochelle, New York to Benjamin Faneuil and Anne Bureau. Having emigrated to America about a decade earlier and become freemen of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, Peter's father, Benjamin, and his uncle, Andrew, had subsequently been early settlers of New Rochelle. Shortly thereafter, Andrew made Boston his permanent residence. Benjamin married Anne Bureau in 1699 and they had at least two sons and three daughters who lived to maturity. Little is known of Peter's boyhood. His father, prominent and fairly well-to-do, died in 1719 when Peter was 18, and soon Peter, his brother, Benjamin Jr., and his sister Mary moved to Boston. Their widowed, childless uncle Andrew had become one of New England's wealthiest men through shrewd trading and Boston real estate investments. Andrew may have formally adopted his two nephews. Peter Faneuil's first claim to fame occurred in 1728 when he helped his brother-in-law Henry Phillips escape to France after he killed Benjamin Woodbridge in the first duel ever to take place in Boston. Life as a merchant Peter Faneuil entered Boston's commission and shipping business and soon proved a competent trader, assisting his uncle in running a lucrative mercantile establishment that traded with Antigua, Barbados, Spain, the Canary Islands, and England, only a few of the places from which Faneuil's correspondence survives. Prominent in the triangular trade, Peter shipped enslaved people to the West Indies and brought molasses and sugar to the colonies. He handled merchandise from Europe and the Caribbean, exported rum, fish, and produce, and engaged in shipbuilding. When he ventured both ship and cargo in transatlantic or coastal commerce, he customarily shared the risk with others. Charging 5% for handling consignments, he used advanced business methods and kept careful records. Fishing-grounds agents kept him informed of market prices and furthered his commercial connections. Not all of his trade was legal. When in 1736 his ship Providence was seized for exchanging fish and oil for French gold, he complained that only the \\"caprice\\" of the admiralty judge, a \\"Vile\\" man, was responsible for \\"Impositions\\" on a \\"fair trader\\" that was \\"in no way founded on law and justice.\\" A childless widower, Andrew Faneuil for some reason threatened to disinherit either of his two nephews if they married. Benjamin Jr. preferred wedlock to a share of the enormous Faneuil fortune, which in addition to ships, shops, and a mansion in Tremont Street included ¬£14,000 in East India Company stock. During his uncle's final illness Peter managed Andrew's business as well as his own. Peter, who was swarthy, stocky, and disabled since childhood, remained single, inheriting most of the fortune. Peter became--despite handsome bequests to his sisters--one of America's wealthiest men, living sumptuously in a Beacon Street mansion. For the five brief years of life that remained to him after his uncle's death in February 1738 he lived up to the name of one of his best ships: The Jolly Batchelor. Writing to his London partners to inform them of his uncle's death, he also requested five pipes of Madeira wine: \\"As this wine is for the use of my house, I hope you will be careful that I have the best.\\" Soon thereafter, he requested a \\"handsome chariot\\" emblazoned with the family crest, accompanied by a coachman unlikely \\"to be debauched with strong drink, rum, etc.\\" as were most European servants. He also asked for \\"the latest, best book of the several sorts of cookery, which pray let be of the largest characters, for the benefit of the maid's reading.\\" Faneuil Hall and other gifts Faneuil Hall in 1789 Most noteworthy was Faneuil's gift to the town of Boston of Faneuil Hall, which opened in September 1742, scarcely six months before his death. In July 1740 Faneuil had offered the town a large market building. This offer was by no means uncontroversial: Bostonians had debated throughout the eighteenth century whether a centralized market was preferable to peddling in the streets, bringing conveniences such as home delivery but also inconveniences including noisy push-cart hucksters and higher prices. Markets built by the town had been destroyed by a mob disguised as clergymen in 1737. Only by a vote of 367 to 360 did the Boston Town Meeting accept Faneuil's offer. The building took two years to construct and was named for Faneuil after his death. It was gutted by fire in March 1761; the walls remained, but the interior structure, to which the town meeting frequently adjourned to protest British policy as the American Revolution approached, was added after the fire. The room above the market stalls became a civic center where so many prerevolutionary meetings were held that Faneuil Hall became known as America's \\"Cradle of Liberty.\\" Faneuil Hall still stands, although it is dwarfed by the Quincy Market complex built behind it in the nineteenth century. Peter Faneuil School on Boston's Beacon Hill is named after Faneuil. Although Faneuil enjoyed the good life, his contemporaries and posterity honor him most highly as a public benefactor. John Lovell, who gave his funeral eulogy, said that Faneuil \\"fed the hungry and he cloathed the naked, he comforted the fatherless, and the widows in their affliction.\\" An obituary noted that he was \\"a gentleman, possessed of a very ample fortune and a most generous spirit,\\" his \\"noble benefaction to his town and constant employment of a great number of tradesmen, artificers, and laborers, to whom he was a liberal paymaster . . . made his life a public blessing, and his death a general loss.\\" In Faneuil's case such praise was more than routine kindness to the recently deceased. He donated liberally to the Episcopal Charitable Society, an endowment for the families of the deceased clergymen of Trinity Church, to which he belonged, and was treasurer of the project to build the present King's Chapel. Other wealthy Boston Anglicans apparently lacked his fervor, for the project languished for five years after his death following his gift of ¬£200 sterling. Peter Faneuil by John Smibert (copy by Henry Sargent), located in Faneuil Hall, Boston, Massachusetts. Death Peter Faneuil's tomb in Granary Burying Ground Faneuil died in Boston of dropsy on 3 March 1743 at the age of 43, being interred in the Granary Burying Ground. The unmarried Faneuil left his fortune, including five enslaved black people and 195 dozen bottles of wine, to his sister Mary and brother Benjamin Jr. (later to become a Loyalist), who ironically enjoyed his uncle's bequest far more than his short-lived brother. Nineteenth-century historian Lucius M. Sargent said of Peter Faneuil that he \\"lived as magnificently as a nobleman, as hospitably as a bishop, and as charitably as an apostle.\\"  See also  *  References  Bibliography * Category:1700 births Category:1743 deaths Category:People of colonial New York Category:People from colonial Boston Category:Businesspeople from New Rochelle, New York Category:Philanthropists from New York (state) Category:18th-century American Episcopalians Category:Colonial American merchants Category:American slave traders Category:18th-century philanthropists Category:18th-century American businesspeople Category:Deaths from edema Category:Burials at Granary Burying Ground ","title":"Peter Faneuil"},{"id":"5694744","text":"Air flows in and around a convective cloudEntrainment is a phenomenon of the atmosphere which occurs when a turbulent flow captures a non-turbulent flow. It is typically used to refer to the capture of a wind flow of high moisture content, or in the case of tropical cyclones, the capture of drier air. Detrainment is the opposite effect, when the air from a convective cloud, usually at its top, is injected in the environment.  Theory  thumbDiagram showing the variation of temperature (T) with height in the environment and the effect of the entrainment rate (\\\\lambda) on the top height of a cumulonimbus Entrainment is the mixing of environmental air into a preexisting air current or cloud so that the environmental air becomes part of the current or cloud. The entrainment coefficient in clouds is one of the most sensitive variables causing uncertainty in climate models.Knight CG, Knight SHE, Massey N, Aina T, Christensen C, et al., (2007). Association of parameter, software, and hardware variation with large-scale behavior across 57,000 climate models. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104, 12259‚Äì64 Homogeneous mixing is a model that assumes that the timescale for the mixing within a cloud was short compared to the evaporation timescale. This would imply that the dry, unsaturated, environmental air would be entrained throughout the cloud before it would start to evaporate the cloud droplets. The entrainment mixing that results from this model manifests as a partial evaporation of all the drops within the cloud, but no change in the number of cloud drops.Jonas, P.R., (1996). Turbulence and cloud microphysics. Atmospheric Research, 40(2-4), 283-306, .Lu C., Y. Liu, S. Niu, S. Krueger, and T. Wagner, 2013: . J. Geophys. Res., 118, 185-194. A contrasting model of entrainment is inhomogeneous mixing. This model assumes that the time it takes to evaporate cloud drops is short compared to the mixing timescales. Therefore, the saturated air that mixes with the unsaturated environment air would completely evaporate the cloud drops within the entrained area, which would reduce the total number of cloud drops. The major difference between the two models is how they affect the shape of the cloud drop spectrum. Homogeneous mixing changes the shape of spectrum because the supersaturation is not the same over large and small drops. Exposing a cloud to homogeneously mixed entrained air will result in a narrower cloud drop spectrum, while inhomogeneous mixing does not change the cloud drop spectrum. Entrainment rate Cumulus clouds have a significant impact on transport of energy and water vapor, and then influence precipitation and climate. In large scale models, cumulus clouds need to be parameterized. Entrainment rate is a key parameter in cumulus parameterization. Henry Stommel was the first to study entrainment rate in cumulus clouds.Stommel, H. Entrainment of air into a cumulus cloud. Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 1947, 4: 91-94.

It was instituted on April 1, 1942 by the Royal Decree No. 1014, of King Michael I of Romania. It was commissioned to recognise the distinguished service of Romanian and other Axis Powers military and civilian personnel operating on both the Eastern and Home fronts. Medal The medal, of 31.5 mm in diameter and of brass construction features on the front side a clenched fist holding a sword representative of the campaign. The same side also displays the date 1941 and around its circumference is written CRUCIADA √éMPOTRIVA COMUNISMULUI. The reverse side features the Romanian liberty symbol and the phrase ROM√ÇNIA RECUNOSCƒÇTOARE, translated in English as \\"Romania is Grateful\\". The reverse sometimes features the name \\"P. GRANT\\" under the liberty symbol. The medal is suspended by medal ribbon which is of primarily of red, bordered by white and the centre featuring the national colours of Romania, red, yellow and blue. Bars When issued to the recipients operating on the front lines one of 15 bars was included indicative of area of service. Like the medal, these were brass-made and worn over the ribbon bar. The bars stood for: *Azov *Basarabia *Bucovina *Southern Bug *Calmucia *Caucaz *Crimeea (occasionally spelled Crimeia) *Dobrogea *Done≈£ *Marea NeagrƒÉ (occasionally spelled Mare Negru) *Nipru *Nistru *Odessa *Prut *Stalingrad *Don *Traditia Bars awarded subsequently were worn below the original one on the medal ribbon, and all of the additional bars were silver. The rarest of all bars is the Stalingrad one, due largely to the fact that very few Axis survived the 1943 battle (those recipients who were captured often lost or discarded their awards, or had these confiscated). Other characteristics The medal continued to be awarded until its disestablishment in October 1944, after Romania joined the Allies, and issued retrospectively to the starting date of Operation Barbarossa (the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union). Cruciada √Æmpotriva comunismului was produced by a number of firms within Romania, and was also made under licence by the German maker C. E. Junker of Berlin. The number of medals made and awarded is unknown, but believed to be in excess of 1,250,000. Whilst not rare today, following the war, many awards were discarded by their owners for fear of prosecution and reprisal by the Soviet occupiers and later by Communist authorities.

The motorway can be seen and heard as most of the area is elevated and the wind's prevailing direction is westerly. It is part of the Hunsbury residential area, which also constitutes East Hunsbury east of Towcester Road. Shelfleys is an earlier name for the area and still appears on signs, maps and bus destination indicators. However Hunsbury is an old name. Iron ore was formerly quarried in the area.This had begun by 1873 and an ironworks called Hunsbury Ironworks was in the course of being built in that year. The quarries were worked by several companies and individual owners, two of which companies used the name \\"Hunsbury\\" in their titles. The area is part of the Borough of Northampton. The area was developed in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s as part of the expansion of Northampton.  The Iron Industry  The industry operated in the area from the early 1870s until 1921. The Hunsbury Ironworks was being built in 1873. The works were by the canal and the Northampton to Blisworth railway, south of Duston Mill and west of Briar Hill Farm. The works smelted local ore as well as ore from elsewhere in southern Northamptonshire. At first the quarries were next to the works but later quarries were in the area of Hunsbury Hill Camp and further east ceasing in 1920. The quarries were connected to the works by a 3-foot eight inch gauge tramway. At first this was worked by a combination of gravity and horses, according to whether the gradient was in favour of the trains of wagons. In 1912 three steam locomotives were obtained to work these trains. The actual quarrying was done by hand with a pick and shovel. The quarrying took place in fIve areas. The first was next to the works before 1877. The second was to the north west of Hunsbury Hill Camp (Danes Camp), between 1877 and 1882. The third area was to the east of this, to the north of the Camp and south of Rothersthorpe Road between 1882 and 1889 extending over the top of the main railway tunnel. The eastern part of this quarry was served by another tramway running to the Blisworth line east of Briar Hill Farm, where a tipping dock would have been necessary. The fourth area was to the south of the Camp from 1882 to 1920 extending into what is now East Hunsbury, over top of the railway tunnel and on both sides of the railway south of the tunnel portal This quarry went as far as what was then Towcester Road (now Hill Farm Rise.) The last area quarried was to the east of this road between 1912 and 1920. The works ceased production on 28 January 1921. The owner Pickering Phipps proposed to reopen it and the last quarry but died before he could do this. The works and quarrying lease were bought by Richard Thomas & Co Ltd in 1935 but their proposal to reopen the works and quarries was not carried out either. The quarries were not landscaped after abandonment and for many years the quarry faces and uneven ground created by the quarrying were clearly visible. However following the building of the housing estate from 1970 onwards the only visible remains are now in Hunsbury Hill Park and in what is now East Hunsbury. The industry was commemorated by the name of the Ironstone Pub (now closed) and a street name Ironstone Lane.Tonks op cit 106-21 Demographics The 2001 census shows a population of 7,468 of which 3,727 were male and 3,741 female, in 3,005 households.

There is also the Danes Camp Leisure centre and swimming pool. Collingtree Park Golf Course is in Windingbrooke Lane and accessible from Rowtree Road in East Hunsbury. The Hunsbury Hill Centre is a collection of old farm buildings built about 1770 overlooking the River Nene valley to the north. The main farmhouse is a grade II listed building. The centre is for community use and has three separate function rooms surrounding an octagonal courtyard which can host a variety of events. The main hall seats up to 120 and there is ample free parking in the pleasant and peaceful grounds. The centre is owned by Northamptonshire ACRE, \\"Action with Communities in Rural England\\" an independent charitable organisation, working with rural communities in Northamptonshire.

Allerton house. Allerton Garden, also known as LƒÅwai-kai, is a botanical garden, originally created by Robert Allerton and John Gregg Allerton, located on the south shore of Kauai, Hawaii. The garden covers an area and is situated beside the LƒÅwai Bay, in a valley transected by the LƒÅwai Stream. It is one of the five gardens of the non-profit National Tropical Botanical Garden. Garden history Queen Emma of Hawaii resided above this valley for a short interval, and a modest house that was perhaps her residence has subsequently been moved to the valley floor and renovated. The entire valley, including what is now the adjacent McBryde Garden, was purchased by the McBryde family in the late 19th century for a sugarcane plantation. Robert Allerton, who had a lifelong passion for garden design, sculpture, and landscape architecture had already expressed it at \\"The Farms\\" estate and sculpture gardens in Illinois (now Robert Allerton Park). His adopted son John Gregg Allerton had studied architecture at the University of Illinois in the 1920s. In 1938 they came to Hawaii and purchased a relatively small portion of Queen Emma's plantation for a residence and gardens. They quickly began designing the landscape master plan and individual gardens, incorporating Hawaiian and new plants they had acquired from tropical Asia and other Pacific Islands, built landscape elements, and sculptures from \\"The Farms.\\" Tropical Botanical Garden Allerton would later join a group of individuals and organizations who were pushing for the establishment of a tropical botanical garden on U.S. soil. In his final year before he died, Allerton was able to witness the charter being granted and the creation of the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden (now National Tropical Botanical Garden). John Gregg Allerton maintained the garden until his death in 1986, and left it in trust. In the early 1990s, management was assumed by the National Tropical Botanical Garden and the garden was named after its founding fathers. Garden touring Allerton Garden includes garden rooms, pools, miniature waterfalls, fountains, and statues. It is open to visitors. An admission fee is charged. \\\\---- Image:Allerton Garden, Kauai, Hawaii - Lawai Bay.JPGLƒÅwai Bay Image:Allerton Garden, Kauai, Hawaii - Mermaid Fountain.JPGMermaid Fountain Image:Allerton Garden, Kauai, Hawaii - stream.JPGDiana Waterfall (below Diana Fountain) Image:Allerton Garden, Kauai, Hawaii - Garden walk.JPGGarden walk  Films and TV This picturesque setting has been used in a number of films and TV shows, including South Pacific, Donovan's Reef, Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Caribbean, Starsky and Hutch and Magnum, P.I.

In 2005, it was integrated into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. SFOR (NATO Stabilization Force) still plays a large role in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which consists of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. Under the leadership of one president, the ministry of defense of both entities merged into one single ministry of defense with one chief of joint staff commanding both Air Forces. In 2004 there was again a restructuring of the armed forces, bringing the number of Air Force personnel down to 4,000. Next to the command, the 1st Regiment V i PVO consists out of a platoon, a radar battalion, artillery rocket ADF battalion, AF logistics battalion and aviation assets, a Fighter Bomber Squadron and Mixed Helicopter Squadron. In 2006 the Air Force of Republika Srpska was disbanded. History =Creation= Following the declarations of independence by Slovenia, Croatia and Republic of Macedonia, the leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina also declared independence at the end of 1991 after a referendum which was boycotted by most Bosnian Serbs. Feeling themselves Serbs because of their history, religion and traditions, Bosnian Serbs rejected the declaration, and established an alternative assembly, holding a referendum in November 1991 on remaining in the rump Yugoslav federation. After the declaration of independence by Bosnia and Herzegovina the Bosnian Serbs began to form autonomous enclaves and finally on 9 January 1992 the independent state of Republika Srpska was declared within Bosnia- Herzegovina. The Air Force and Air Defense (Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo i Protivvazdusna Odbrana Vojske Republike Srpske - RV i PVO VRS) was established, and took over operations from the Yugoslav Air Force and Air Defense (Jugoslovensko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo i Protiv Vazdusna Odbrana or JRV i PVO). The barracks at Zalu≈æani became home to the Command and subordinated units of the newly created Air Force and Air Defence of the Army of the Republika Srpska. The official ceremony that was intended to mark the creation of the Bosnian Serb Air Force and Air Defence Forces took place at Zaluzani air base on 27 May 1992. The majority of the fixed-wing aircraft were originally part of the 82nd Aviation Brigade, consisting out 237th lbae (Fighter Bomber Squadron with the J-21 Jastreb), 238th lbae (named \\"Vrbas Lynxes\\" flying the J-22 Orao) and 351st iae (Reconnaissance Squadron with the IJ-21, J-22 and IJ-22), which were located at the Cerklje ob Krki Air Base in Slovenia. On the night of 27 to 28 June 1991, following an attack by Slovenian forces, 67 aircraft were flown out of Cerklje to Zadar-Zemunik air base in Croatia. Among others, the Yugoslav People's Army completely withdrew the 474th vazduhoplovna baza (Air Base) from Slovenia, a unit that was responsible for Cerklje ob Krki Air Base. During the withdrawal every movable object, including the runway lighting and ILS systems, were dismantled and removed. On 12 August 1991, the 474th Air Base was re-established in Banja Luka and became responsible both for Mahovljani and Zaluzani airfields. Finally, on 11 August 1991, the majority of the aircraft from the 82nd Aviation Brigade were once again relocated, but this time to their final destination, the Mahovljani airfield near Banja Luka. At Mahovljani, the 474th Air Base was renumbered to 74th Air Base, and the former Yugoslav Air Force 237th Fighter-bomber Aviation Squadron and 238th Fighter-bomber Aviation Squadron, were re-established as the Republika Srpska Air Force 27th Fighter-bomber Aviation Squadron and 28th Fighter-bomber Aviation Squadron, respectively, each reporting directly to the command of the air force and air defense. The helicopter fleet used to be part of the 111th Aviation Brigade at Zagreb-Pleso (Croatia) composed of four squadrons: 679th Transport Aviation Squadron equipped with An-2 and An-26 transport aircraft, 711th Anti-armour Helicopter Squadron, equipped with Gazelle GAMA anti-tank helicopters, 713th Anti-armour Helicopter Squadron, equipped with Gazelle GAMA anti-tank helicopters and 780th Transport Helicopter Squadron, equipped with Mi-8T transport helicopters. Elements of all three helicopter squadrons along with Gazelle-HERA liaison helicopters inherited from the helicopter flight of former 896th Helicopter Reconnaissance and Liaison Squadron under command of headquarters of the 2nd Sarajevo Military Districts of the former Yugoslav People's Army were used as a base for creation of the Republika Srpska Air Force 111th Helicopter Regiment, based at former tank-barracks of Zaluzani, consisted of two squadrons: 711th Anti-armour Helicopter Squadron, equipped with Gazelle-GAMA and Gazelle-HERA helicopters, and 780th Transport Helicopter Squadron equipped with Mi-8T transport helicopters. Additional reinforcement to the Republika Srpska Air Force was ensured with the introduction of the 92nd Light Multi-role Aircraft Squadron, which was in fact a mixed collection of light aircraft which were confiscated from sport aeroclubs around Bosnia. It has been confirmed that the 92nd Light Multi role Aircraft Squadron was equipped with An-2, UTVA-66, UTVA-75, Zlin 526F, PZL-104 Wilga 80, Piper PA-18-150 Super Cub and Cessna 172 aircraft that were divided into three flights, based at Zaluzani, Prijedor and Bratunac airfields. The air defense units which have become part of Republika Srpska Air Force and Air Defense were 155th Air Defense Missile Brigade, which was relocated from area of Zagreb and Cerklje to Banja Luka in 1991, equipped with S-75M Volhov and SA-75Mk Dvina missiles, 84th Air Defense Light Rocket- Artillery Regiment, 172nd Air Defense Self-Propelled Missile Regiment equipped with 2K12 Kub SAM's and 51st Air Reconnaissance Battalion. On 26 July 1992, just two months after the initial structure of the Bosnian Serb Air Force was established, the flying units were once again reorganized. The 111th Helicopter Regiment was disbanded, and a new unit designated 92nd Mixed Aviation Brigade was formed to control both fixed-wing and helicopter squadrons. Later, during the same year, the 711th Anti-armour Helicopter Squadron and the 780th Transport Helicopter Squadrons were merged to create the new unit designated 89th Mixed Helicopter Squadron. During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb Air Force had conducted 17,316 sorties of all kinds, a large proportion of these being combat flights under the nose of NATO's Operation Deny Flight. However, it is important to note that 18 percent of all the sorties conducted between 27 May 1992 and December 1995 were medical evacuation flights, a total of 3.179 sorties. Over the war years, the Republika Srpska Air Force has lost 18 aircraft: five J-22 Oraos, six J- 21Jastrebs, five Gazelles and two Mi-8s as a result of enemy fire or accidents. =After the war= A Bosnian Serb SOKO J-22 Orao In March 1996 the entire Republika Srpska Army was reorganized and the Bosnian Serb air arm was renamed Aviation and air defense of the Army of the Republika Srpska (Vazduhoplovstvo i Protivvazdusna Odbrana Vojske Republike Srpske or V i PVO VRS). Additionally, all the units of the Bosnian Serb Air Force were once again reorganized and renumbered: the 74th Air Base was renumbered to 874th Air Base, the 92nd Mixed Aviation Brigade became 892nd Mixed Aviation Brigade and the 89th Mixed Helicopter Squadron became simply known as the 2nd Mixed Helicopter Squadron. The 27th and 28th Fighter-bomber Aviation Squadrons were merged to create the new unit that became known as 1st Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron. The 92nd Light Multi role Aircraft Squadron was disbanded and its aircraft were returned to their respective owners: the sport air clubs at Banja Luka, Bratunac and Prijedor. However, the V i PVO VRS retained two UTVA-75 aircraft in order to secure regular training flights to its Air Force pilots. According to the Florence Agreement on Sub-Regional Arms Control (Article IV), signed in June 1996, the Republika Srpska was allowed to possess 21 combat aircraft and seven attack helicopters. In order to comply with the Florence Agreement, the Republika Srpska Air Force disarmed and withdraw from service four J-21 Jastreb ground attack aircraft and also disarmed six A√©rospatiale Gazelle helicopters. Due to the reorganisation of both armed forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, since June 1, 2004 the Republika Srpska Air Force is officially called 1st Regiment Air Force and Air Defence of Army of Republika Srpska (Serbo-Croatian: 1.

The entire branch has been downgraded to a regiment that consistent from two squadrons (fighter-bomber and mixed helicopter), and rocket-artillery air defense, air reconnaissance and logistics battalions. =Disband= As the both Army of Republika Srpska and Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been disbanded and united into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina (OSBiH), the V i PVO VRS has ceased to exist. The personnel and some equipment have continued their service in new OSBiH. Jet aircraft are put in storage because of the lack of spare parts and the high costs to operate them. Because of that, some jet pilots have been retrained to be helicopter pilots, but left the service. Mixed Helicopter Squadron has become Helicopter Battalion, equipped with six overhauled Gazelle utility helicopters, while two Mi-8T's will soon return from the overhaul. A radar battalion has become Air Reconnaissance Battalion, AF logistics battalion has become Air Support Battalion, and both units remain in the Banja Luka, while artillery rocket ADF battalion has become Air Defense Battalion relocated to Sarajevo. Before disbanding of V i PVO VRS, seven Gazelle helicopters were donated from the Air Force to the Ministry of Interior and the Department of Civil Aviation. The 17 fixed-wing aircraft will be offered for sale, and currently, Serbian Air Force is only one interested to buy seven J-22 Orao ground attack aircraft and a single G-4 Super Galeb advanced training and light attack aircraft.

In 1999‚Äì2000, they were relegated to the third tier (which became Liga Artzit following the formation of the Israeli Premier League as the top tier in 1999), before returning to the second tier (now Liga Leumit), after winning Liga Artzit in the 2004‚Äì05 season. The club reached the State Cup final for the first time in 2007, but despite taking the lead, lost 5‚Äì4 on penalties to Hapoel Tel Aviv after a 1‚Äì1 draw. At the end of the season, the club finished 11th and relegated to Liga Artzit. In 2008‚Äì09, the club finished as runners-up in Liga Artzit and promoted back to Liga Leumit. In 2009‚Äì10, the club finished as runners-up in Liga Leumit and promoted back to the Israeli Premier League. Just a season later, the club finished 15th, and relegated back to Liga Leumit. In 2013‚Äì14, the club finished 15th in Liga Leumit, and relegated to Liga Alef. The club made an immediate return to Liga Leumit, after winning Liga Alef South division in the following season. In 2015‚Äì16, the club won the Leumit Toto Cup following a victory of 1‚Äì0 against F.C. Ashdod. At the end of the season, they finished as runners-up and made a return to the Israeli Premier League, their second successive promotion under the guidance of Yuval Naim.Very nice: Hapoel Ashkelon is officially in the Premier League Gil Michaeli, Doublepass, 6 May 2016 =Little Argentina= Over the years, Hapoel Ashkelon has developed a tradition of signing Argentine footballers, both Jewish and non-Jewish.

Trophy The Shillelagh Trophy is a trophy exchanged between Notre Dame and Purdue, being held by the winner of the game. The two in-state rivals first played each other in 1896 and the game has occurred annually from 1946 to 2014. The trophy, first presented in 1957, is a Shillelagh (club) donated by Joe McLaughlin, a merchant seaman and a Fighting Irish supporter who brought it from Ireland. Notable games Notable games since 1946 include: ;1950 ‚Äì Purdue 28, Notre Dame 14: Notre Dame's 39-game unbeaten string came to an end at the hands of the Boilermakers. The Irish finished 4‚Äì4‚Äì1, easily the worst season for head coach Frank Leahy. ;1954 ‚Äì #19 Purdue 27, #1 Notre Dame 14: The top-ranked Irish were done in by their intrastate rival as their 13-game unbeaten streak ended. It was their only loss of the year as they finished 9‚Äì1 under new coach Terry Brennan. ;1957 ‚Äì Notre Dame 12, Purdue 0: A psychological ploy enabled the Irish, coming off their worst season in history at that point, to start off on the right foot. Purdue coach Jack Mollenkopf heard that Terry Brennan had installed the single wing after spending some time in Knoxville, and wasn't sure how to prepare for Notre Dame. As it turned out, the single wing was not used against the tentative Boilermakers. ;1960 ‚Äì Purdue 51, Notre Dame 19: Purdue set two records for Notre Dame opponents in this game that still stand: most points ever scored against the Fighting Irish in the second quarter (31) and the most points ever by an opponent in Notre Dame Stadium. To date, it is the only time the Irish have ever given up 50 points in a game at Notre Dame Stadium. It was the worst defeat for the Fighting Irish under coach Joe Kuharich and at the time, it was only the fourth time in which the Fighting Irish had ever given up 50 points in a game. ;1964 ‚Äì Notre Dame 34, Purdue 15: The Fighting Irish made a statement under new coach Ara Parseghian as they throttled the Boilermakers. Alan Page blocked a punt and returned it for a touchdown and defensive back Nick Rassas caught a touchdown pass late in the game. ;1965 ‚Äì Purdue 25, Notre Dame 21: In a seesaw battle, Purdue scored the winning touchdown late in the game. Bob Griese set a Notre Dame opponent record by completing 19 of 22 passes, a record that stood until 1991. ;1966 ‚Äì Notre Dame 26, Purdue 14: This game is best remembered for the debut of one of Notre Dame's greatest passing combinations ‚Äì Terry Hanratty to Jim Seymour. Hanratty completed 16 of 24 passes for 304 yards and three touchdowns, all to Seymour, who had 13 receptions. The teams traded quick touchdowns early on when Purdue's Leroy Keyes grabbed an errant pitch out of the air and returned it 95 yards for a score, only to have Fighting Irish halfback Nick Eddy return the ensuing kickoff 97 yards for the equalizer. Notre Dame finished 9‚Äì0‚Äì1 and win the national championship while Purdue made its first trip to the Rose Bowl a memorable one, beating USC, 14‚Äì13. ;1967 ‚Äì Purdue 28, Notre Dame 21: Once again, the top-ranked and defending national champion Fighting Irish were done in by the Boilermakers despite the efforts of Terry Hanratty, who completed 29 out of a still- standing record 63 attempts. The loss snapped a 12-game unbeaten streak by the Fighting Irish. ;1968 ‚Äì Purdue 37, Notre Dame 22: In the only #1 vs #2 matchup in the history of this rivalry, the top-ranked Boilermakers and quarterback Mike Phipps walloped the #2 Fighting Irish. ;1970 ‚Äì Notre Dame 48, Purdue 0: After three years of frustration, the Irish exploded all at once against the Boilermakers, holding them to 144 total yards and six first downs. Joe Theismann threw three touchdown passes to Tom Gatewood and Ara Parseghian was carried off the field after the game. ;1971 ‚Äì Notre Dame 8, Purdue 7: In a game played in the rain, the Fighting Irish, trailing 7‚Äì0, took advantage of a botched snap on a punt to score a touchdown late in the game, then executed a successful two-point conversion to win. It was their first win in West Lafayette since 1961. ;1974 ‚Äì Purdue 31, Notre Dame 20: A four-touchdown underdog, Purdue once again broke a Notre Dame winning streak and derailed any hope for the Fighting Irish to repeat as national champions by jumping out to a 24‚Äì0 lead in the first quarter, setting a record for most points scored against Notre Dame in the opening stanza. Boilermaker coach Alex Agase finally notched a victory against his close friend, Ara Parseghian. ;1975 ‚Äì Notre Dame 17, Purdue 0: Notre Dame led, 3‚Äì0 in the fourth quarter when Purdue threatened to take the lead. Luther Bradley's 99-yard interception return for a touchdown on a halfback-to-quarterback pass attempt broke the game open, and the Fighting Irish, who had played five days earlier and won, improved to 2‚Äì0 under new coach Dan Devine. ;1977 ‚Äì Notre Dame 31, Purdue 24: Notre Dame trailed, 24‚Äì14 in the fourth quarter when Joe Montana entered the game. Montana, who had not played since 1975, engineered a comeback victory and nailed down the starting quarterback job for the remainder of his Notre Dame career. The Fighting Irish, coming off a 20‚Äì13 loss to Ole Miss, did not lose the rest of the way and won the national championship. ;1979 ‚Äì Purdue 28, Notre Dame 22: Notre Dame, rotating three quarterbacks in place of the injured Rusty Lisch, took a 20‚Äì7 lead in the third quarter before Boilermaker quarterback Mark Herrmann came alive. Purdue took an intentional safety late in the game, downing the ball in its own end zone out of punt formation rather than risking a blocked punt. ;1980 ‚Äì Notre Dame 31, Purdue 10: The Irish opened Dan Devine's final season with an impressive win over the Boilermakers in a game that was moved up to September 6 to accommodate national television. Purdue quarterback Mark Herrmann did not play, having injured his throwing hand earlier in the week, and freshman Scott Campbell took his place. The Irish finished 9‚Äì2‚Äì1, losing to eventual national champion Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. ;1981 ‚Äì Purdue 15, Notre Dame 14: Purdue pulled this one out late in the game after the Fighting Irish had taken a 14‚Äì7 lead. It was the start of a pattern under new coach Gerry Faust, whose teams developed a knack for losing games in the closing moments. ;1983 ‚Äì Notre Dame 52, Purdue 6: Notre Dame could do no wrong as they rang up the highest point total by a Purdue opponent in Ross-Ade Stadium. Despite the impressive start, the Fighting Irish lost their last three games of the season to finish 6‚Äì5 before holding off Boston College in the Liberty Bowl. ;1986 ‚Äì Notre Dame 41, Purdue 9: Lou Holtz notched his first victory as head coach of the Fighting Irish and the first of eleven straight wins against the Boilermakers (Holtz never lost to Purdue during his tenure at Notre Dame). ;1988 ‚Äì Notre Dame 52, Purdue 7: En route to a national championship, Notre Dame took a 42‚Äì0 halftime lead and coasted the rest of the way. Irish coach Lou Holtz cleared the bench in the second half. ;1997 ‚Äì Purdue 28, Notre Dame 17: The Boilermakers ended their 11-game losing streak against the Fighting Irish in a matchup of new head coaches, Purdue's Joe Tiller and Notre Dame's Bob Davie. Tiller's predecessor, Jim Colletto, was now the offensive coordinator for the Fighting Irish. ;1998 ‚Äì Notre Dame 31, Purdue 30: Tony Driver's two interceptions late in the game enabled the Fighting Irish to squeak by Purdue. His first interception set up a game- winning field goal while the second moments later sealed the victory. ;1999 ‚Äì Purdue 28, Notre Dame 23: For the second week in a row, Notre Dame came up short as Fighting Irish quarterback Jarious Jackson was sacked on the game's final play with the Fighting Irish at the Purdue nine-yard line. ;2000 ‚Äì Notre Dame 23, Purdue 21: Nick Setta's field goal as time ran out lifted the Fighting Irish to a come-from-behind victory. Fighting Irish quarterback Gary Godsey, making his first start in place of the injured Arnaz Battle, outdueled Drew Brees. ;2001 ‚Äì Notre Dame 24, Purdue 18: This game was played on December 1, having been rescheduled after the September 11 attacks. The Fighting Irish finished a dismal season with a 5‚Äì6 record. It was Bob Davie's last game as head coach; he was fired the next day. ;2002 ‚Äì Notre Dame 24, Purdue 17: Notre Dame's defense and special teams accounted for all three touchdowns. ;2004 ‚Äì Purdue 41, Notre Dame 16: The Boilermakers notched their first win at Notre Dame Stadium since 1974 despite the efforts of Fighting Irish quarterback Brady Quinn, who set a stadium record by passing for 432 yards because they were playing from behind the entire game. ;2009 ‚Äì Notre Dame 24, Purdue 21: Fighting Irish quarterback Jimmy Clausen's touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph with 24 seconds left lifted the Fighting Irish to a come-from-behind victory. ;2010 ‚Äì Notre Dame 23, Purdue 12: Coach Brian Kelly notched his first win as Notre Dame's coach by incorporating the spread offense and 3‚Äì4 defense. Dayne Crist makes his first start as Notre Dame's quarterback, throwing for 205 yards and 1 TD. On the other side of the ball, quarterback Robert Marve makes his debut for the Boilermakers after transferring from Miami (FL) throwing for 220 yards, 0 TDs, and 2 INTs. ;2013 ‚Äì Notre Dame 31, Purdue 24: The #21 ranked Irish came in to West Lafayette a 3 touchdown favorite over Purdue. Purdue took the ball to start the game and drove it 75 yards to score first. Purdue had a 10‚Äì0 lead before the Irish were able to make it 10‚Äì3 at halftime. The game went back and forth until up 24‚Äì17, Notre Dame picked off quarterback Rob Henry and took it to the house to go up 31‚Äì17 with 8 minutes left. The Boilermakers drove down the field and score to get the game within 7. Purdue forced a Notre Dame fumble on the next drive, but could not take advantage of it as Notre Dame went on to win 31‚Äì24. ;After the 2014 game, the annual series ended. The teams are set to play again in 2021, then will then resume an annual game from 2024 until at least 2028.

This film was shut down halfway through the shooting schedule due to an overwhelming amount of bounced checks from the producer. Some footage was salvaged and integrated into another film called Fright House.http://www.lindenmuth.com/interview_rochon.shtml Several attempts to finish the film were made, but failed due to lack of money. Each subsequent crew was less experienced (and cheaper) than the preceding one. This explains the inconsistent quality of the film with the best footage shot by Ernest Dickerson. Horror film icon Duane Jones starred in Negatives as psychic researcher Charles Harmon. Fright House is a hybrid film and contains two sixty-minute (approx) features: Fright House and ABADON. Fright House, the first half stars Al 'Grandpa' Lewis, is about a coven of witches in an old mansion. ABADON, the second half, is about a new female student Ione arriving at a private art school to join her boyfriend Gary. There she discovers the nasty secret to why the school mistress Madeline Abadon, played by Jackie James, looks (and remains) so young. This second part of the Fright House feature was pulled and reedited from the footage shot for the original Negatives. However Debbie Rochon's scenes do not appear in the renamed film Fright House. Negatives was one of the first movies in which Rochon appeared and helped launch her career as a horror film Scream Queen. Duane Jones suffered a fatal heart attack during production and was unable to complete the film. Ernest Dickerson was the original DP/Cinematographer.

Some of the game's distinctive features include a neon light running along the right-hand ramp, a pop bumper that rises up from the middle of the playfield at certain times, and a magnet at the top of the left ramp that can catch balls and divert them into the locks. The most notable feature is the Ringmaster, a head that rises at certain times and taunts the player. Description right It was the first Williams/Bally pinball machine missing a real replay-knocker, a device driven by a coil to produce a loud bang when hammering against the wood of the cabinet or backbox. Instead this sound effect was pre-recorded and played via the regular speakers. It was also the second machine (after Capcom's Flipper Football, released in 1996) to move the dot-matrix display (DMD) from the backbox right into the cabinet, in order not to distract the player from gameplay when watching the DMD (an idea that was taken to the maximum with the Pinball 2000 architecture two years later).  Modes  This game features nine \\"marvels\\" the player must complete before they are invited to \\"Join the Cirqus.\\" The marvels are arranged in a 3x3 square grid, with each row/column corresponding to one letter in the word C-I-R-Q-U-S. After filling the grid, the player must shoot the left or right orbit to start the \\"Join the Cirqus\\" wizard mode. * Juggler - Shoot the left orbit three times to enable locks, then shoot it three more times to lock balls and start Juggler Multiball. * Side Show - Shoot the left orbit when the Side Show is lit to spot this marvel and receive a random award. * Ringmaster Frenzie - Defeat the Ringmaster twice to start Frenzie Multiball. * Menagerie - Hit a set of targets on the left side a set number of times, either directly or by knocking a large plastic captive ball into them. * Defeated All Ringmasters - Defeat the Ringmaster four times to start Special Multiball. * Highwire Multiball - Hit the \\"Light Lock\\" targets on either side of the left ramp, then shoot the ramp itself three times to lock balls and start Highwire Multiball. * Spin - The spinner target in the small loop that curves around the Ringmaster can be shot to light letters in S-P-I-N; the marvel is awarded once all four letters are lit. * Boom! - Hit the rollover targets on the field to light letters in V-O-L-T. Once all four letters are collected, a third pop bumper rises from the field for a short time; the marvel is awarded after the time runs out. Hits on this bumper count toward lighting an extra ball. * Acrobats - Shoot the right ramp/orbit four times.  The Ringmaster  The Ringmaster normally resides below the playfield, with a flat circular platform attached to the top of his head. This platform sits directly in front of the three W-O-W targets in the upper right corner and contains a hidden magnet. Once the targets have been hit a total of three times, the magnet catches and holds the ball as the Ringmaster rises and taunts the player. The ball is then flung off in a random direction, with a brief ball saver in case it flies out of play. After the Ringmaster and/or the standup targets immediately to either side are hit a total of five times, he rises farther to expose a hole; shooting a ball into this hole results in his defeat. Until Join the Cirqus is played for the first time, each defeated Ringmaster after the first starts a multiball mode, in the following order: * Ringmaster Frenzie - Completing this multiball awards the Frenzie marvel. * Ringmaster Razz - Starting this multiball for the first time lights an extra ball. * Ringmaster Special - Completing this multiball awards the \\"Defeated All Ringmasters\\" marvel. * Ringmaster Battle - Can only be played if \\"Defeated All Ringmasters\\" is not the last marvel collected. This is the only Ringmaster multiball styled as a fight that the player can win or lose. If the player wins, an extra ball is lit and the Ringmaster is disabled until Join the Cirqus has been played. After Join the Cirqus is played and regular play resumes, the first Ringmaster defeat starts Frenzie and further defeats follow the above progression. If the Ringmaster throws the ball into the Highwire Multiball lock, the player is credited with a \\"Sneaky Lock\\" toward starting that mode.  Multiball  This game features eight multiball modes, which can be \\"stacked\\" or made to run concurrently in various combinations. These are: * Highwire Multiball (see \\"Marvels\\" above), three balls * Juggler Multiball (see \\"Marvels\\" above), three balls * Neon Multiball (one of the Side Show random awards), three balls * Strike-an-Arc Multiball (started by shooting the left ramp a set number of times), two balls * Ringmaster (see \\"The Ringmaster\\" above), two balls each ** Ringmaster Frenzie ** Ringmaster Razz ** Ringmaster Special ** Ringmaster Battle When multiballs are stacked, a total of four balls are put into play.  Join the Cirqus  After collecting all nine marvels, the player can start Join the Cirqus by shooting either orbit. Play then proceeds through four phases, with all other features disabled. After each of the first three phases is completed, the flippers and targets briefly go dead and all the balls drain as part of the lead-in to the next phase. # Spell C-I-R-Q-U-S: A three-ball multiball. Hit all six major shots (both orbits, left ramp, Menagerie, Ringmaster loop, W-O-W targets) in any order. # Unmask Voltaire: A three-ball multiball. Hit the Ringmaster and then the left ramp, alternating between them four times, and hit the Ringmaster a fifth time. # Meet the Cirqus: Make six lit shots to the orbits and Ringmaster loop. This phase starts with one ball and adds one for each successful shot, to a maximum of three. # Party Multiball: A four-ball multiball with all major shots lit for jackpots. Join the Cirqus ends when either all balls drain in any of the first three phases, or when three balls drain in the fourth. Digital versions Cirqus Voltaire was formerly available as a licensed table of The Pinball Arcade for any platform until June 30, 2018 due to WMS license expiration. The license was then passed to Zen Studios, who then brought back an official digital version of the table as an add-on for Pinball FX 3 and an unlockable table in the Williams Pinball mobile app for iOS and Android as part of the fifth wave of Zen Studios' curation of Williams tables. Unlicensed recreations of the game are available for Visual Pinball that runs on Windows.

The Quaranta family is an ancient and noble Italian family, with its origin in Scandinavia, established at the end of the 11th century in the district of Salerno. This surname now has roots that spread all over the world. When researching the Quaranta name, several different variations of the name can be found. Language changes and carelessness contributed to this. Additionally, high instances of illiteracy contributed to the numbers of ways a name may have been spelled and articulated. Many times a town clerk would spell names the way they sounded. Because of this, surname dictionaries list such spelling variations as Quarantelli, Quaranti, Quatanto, Quarantas, Quartarara, Quaranto, and Quartararo which all stem from the root surname Quaranta. The first evidence of this family's existence in America is verified by the \\"Italians in America\\", which notes that Salvatore and Commaso Quaranta arrived at New York City's Ellis Island on December 14, 1880 aboard the \\"Italia\\", which sailed from Marseilles, Naples, and Palermo. There is a possibility, however, that the name Quaranta could have been introduced in America at an earlier date.  History  The Founder of the Quaranta family was a medieval Norman knight who returned from the Crusades in the 11th century during the government of Guaimar IV of Salerno. He led forty pilgrims from the Holy Land and dislodged the Saracens (Muslims) from the sieged city Salerno. Therefore, he was nicknamed ‚Äúdei Quaranta‚Äù (of the forty). For such merit Knight Quaranta was rewarded with an immense property between Salerno and Cava de'Tirreni, where the family settled and where the family established the Church of the SS Quaranta Martiri (the holy Forty Martyrs), what made the family the most prestigious family in the region. On their property, in the Norman era, the tremendous Quaranta palace was built. With the arrival of the Angioina (Angevin) dynasty several members of the family moved to Naples where they became eminent members of The Neapolitan parliament, as representatives of the city districts (seggi) Forcella and Porto (port). The family prospered in the following centuries and has spread out to all parts of Italy.

This beautiful region of fluvial topography is one of the main attractions for tourism in Saxony-Anhalt, particularly for bicycle tourism. History The history of the Reserve originates with the Anhalt Environmental Protection Law of 1923. Over the next six years, this initial protected reserve was expanded. The \\"Saalberge\\" and \\"M√∂ster Birken\\" regions were added in 1926. In 1927, conservation areas for the Elbe beaver and the \\"Wassernu√ü\\" plant (Trapa natans) were added. In 1929, areas between Aken and Tochheim were put under protection. These areas were the predecessors of the Steckby-L√∂dderitzer Forst conservation area. The Steckby-L√∂dderitzer Forst was recognized as a Biosphere Reserve by the UNESCO in 1979, and in 1988 it was extended by wide areas around Dessau and W√∂rlitz.

Norsk TV1 started in 1989. It was focused on Norwegian shows and films, and produced a lot of entertainment shows for its weekend programming. On week days, the station's programming consisted of selected re-runs from last weekend. As Norwegian state television (NRK) was particularly strong during week-ends, the station did not do very well. Its owners closed it down and sold remaining assets and rights to TVNorge in 1989 after failed negotiations to join forces with them. Some of the entertainment shows from this channel later became very popular on TVNorge, which used it to complement its own programming, which was mostly based on cheap entertainment during weekdays. TVNorge also had the advantage of being broadcast on local TV stations throughout Norway. TV1 failed mostly due to spending huge amounts of money on Norwegian productions without having the network to spread these broadcasts into most people's homes. TVNorge succeeded by first broadcasting cheap imports and then supplementing with local productions. The shows they got from TV1, particularly an evening show with popular host Rolv Wesenlund, were important in TVNorge's successful fight to become the second widely distributed commercial channel in Norway.

Symptoms may include headache, vomiting, trouble with balance, and confusion. Onset is generally sudden. Complications can include seizures, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and bleeding in the back of the eye. In hypertensive encephalopathy, generally the blood pressure is greater than 200/130 mmHg. Occasionally it can occur at a BP as low as 160/100 mmHg. This can occur in kidney failure, those who rapidly stop blood pressure medication, pheochromocytoma, and people on a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) who eat foods with tyramine. When it occurs in pregnancy it is known as eclampsia. The diagnosis requires ruling out other possible causes. The condition is generally treated with medications to relatively rapidly lower the blood pressure. This may be done with labetalol or sodium nitroprusside given by injection into a vein. In those who are pregnant, magnesium sulfate may be used. Other treatments may include anti- seizure medications. Hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon. It is believed to occur more often in those without easy access to health care. The term was first used by Oppenheimer and Fishberg in 1928. It is classified as a type of hypertensive emergency. Signs and symptoms Hypertensive encephalopathy is most commonly encountered in young and middle-aged people who have hypertension. Overall, the condition is rare even among people with hypertension. Studies report that from 0.5 to 15% of people with malignant hypertension develop hypertensive encephalopathy.Ziegler DK, Zosa A, Zileli T (1965) Hypertensive encephalopathy Arch Neurol 12: 472-478. With the development of methods for detection and treatment of hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy has been becoming more rare. Symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy typically start to occur 12‚Äì48 hours after a sudden and sustained increase in blood pressure. The first manifestation of these symptoms is a severe headache. Headache occurs in greater than 75% of patients. The patient becomes restless. Alterations in consciousness may follow several hours later, which include impaired judgement and memory, confusion, somnolence and stupor. If the condition is not treated, these neurological symptoms may worsen and ultimately turn into a coma. Other symptoms may include increased irritability, vomiting, diplopia, seizures, twitching and myoclonus of the limbs. Alterations in vision (vision blurring, hemivisual field defects, color blindness, cortical blindness) are common. They occur in 4 out of 11 cases (Jellinek et al. 1964). Hemiparesis, intracerebral hemorrhage, aphasia may also occur, but they are less common. Pathogenesis Hypertensive encephalopathy is caused by an increase in blood pressure. Several conditions may evoke blood pressure elevation: acute nephritis, eclampsia, crises in chronic essential hypertension, sudden withdrawal of antihypertensive treatment. Additionally, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in pheochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, renal artery thrombosis. The impairment of cerebral blood flow that underlies hypertensive encephalopathy is still controversial. Normally, cerebral blood flow is maintained by an autoregulation mechanism that dilates arterioles in response to blood pressure decreases and constricts arterioles in response to blood pressure increases. This autoregulation falters when hypertension becomes excessive. According to the over-regulation conception, brain vessels spasm in response to acute hypertension, which results in cerebral ischemia and cytotoxic edema.Tamaki K, Sadoshima S, Baumbach GL, Iadecola C, Reis DJ, Heistad DD (1984) Evidence that disruption of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier precedes reduction in cerebral blood flow in hypertensive encephalopathy. Hypertension 6: I75-81. According to the autoregulation breakthrough conception, cerebral arterioles are forced to dilate, leading to vasogenic edema. Cerebral edema can be generalized or focal. Brain ventricles are compressed, cortical gyri flattened. Diagnosis Diagnostic methods for hypertensive encephalopathy include physical examination, blood pressure measurement, blood sampling, ECG, EEG, chest X-ray, urinalysis, arterial blood gas analysis, and imaging of the head (CAT scan and/or MRI). Since decreasing the blood pressure is essential, anti-hypertensive medication is administered without awaiting the results of the laboratory tests. Electroencephalographic examination detects the absence of alpha waves, signifying impaired consciousness. In people with visual disturbances, slow waves are detected in the occipital areas. Treatment The initial aim of treatment in hypertensive crises is to rapidly lower the diastolic pressure to about 100 to 105 mmHg; this goal should be achieved within two to six hours, with the maximum initial fall in BP not exceeding 25 percent of the presenting value.Kaplan, NM. Hypertensive crises. In: Kaplan's Clinical Hypertension, 9th ed, Neal, W (Ed), Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore 2006. p.311. This level of BP control will allow gradual healing of the necrotizing vascular lesions. More aggressive hypotensive therapy is both unnecessary and may reduce the blood pressure below the autoregulatory range, possibly leading to ischemic events (such as stroke or coronary disease). Once the BP is controlled, the person should be switched to medication by mouth, with the diastolic pressure being gradually reduced to 85 to 90 mmHg over two to three months. The initial reduction to a diastolic pressure of approximately 100 mmHg is often associated with a modest worsening of renal function; this change, however, is typically transient as the vascular disease tends to resolve and renal perfusion improves over one to three months. Antihypertensive therapy should not be withheld in this setting unless there has been an excessive reduction in BP. A change in medication, however, is indicated if the decline in renal function is temporally related to therapy with an angiotensin (ACE) converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, which can interfere with renal autoregulation and produce acute kidney failure in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. (See \\"Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension\\".) Several parenteral antihypertensive agents are most often used in the initial treatment of malignant hypertension. * Nitroprusside ‚Äì an arteriolar and venous dilator, given as an intravenous infusion. Nitroprusside acts within seconds and has a duration of action of only two to five minutes. Thus, hypotension can be easily reversed by temporarily discontinuing the infusion, providing an advantage over the drugs listed below. However, the potential for cyanide toxicity limits the prolonged use of nitroprusside, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. * Nicardipine ‚Äì an arteriolar dilator, given as an intravenous infusion. * Clevidipine ‚Äì a short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It reduces blood pressure without affecting cardiac filling pressures or causing reflex tachycardia. * Labetalol ‚Äì an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker, given as an intravenous bolus or infusion. Bolus followed by infusion. * Fenoldopam ‚Äì a peripheral dopamine-1 receptor agonist, given as an intravenous infusion. * Oral agents ‚Äî A slower onset of action and an inability to control the degree of BP reduction has limited the use of oral antihypertensive agents in the therapy of hypertensive crises. They may, however, be useful when there is no rapid access to the parenteral medications described above. Both sublingual nifedipine and sublingual captopril can substantially lower the BP within 10 to 30 minutes in many patients. A more rapid response is seen when liquid nifedipine is swallowed. The major risk with oral agents is ischemic symptoms (e.g., angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or stroke) due to an excessive and uncontrolled hypotensive response. Thus, their use should generally be avoided in the treatment of hypertensive crises if more controllable drugs are available. Prognosis Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are promptly treated usually recover without deficit. However, if treatment is not administered, the condition can lead to death. History The first descriptions of the condition date back to the early 1900s. In 1914, Volhard and Fahr distinguished a neurological disorder caused by acute hypertension from a uremic state.Volhard F, Fahr T (1914) Die Brittische Nierenkrankheit, Vol. 2 (German). Berlin, Springer 232-265. He described this condition a \\"pseudouremia\\". The term \\"hypertensive encephalopathy\\" was introduced by Oppenheimer and Fishberg in 1928 to describe the case of a patient with acute nephritis, severe hypertension and cerebral symptoms. In the past, the term \\"hypertensive encephalopathy\\" has been applied to a range of neurological problems occurring in hypertensive patients, such as headache, dizziness cerebral hemorrhage and transient ischemic attacks. However, currently this term is narrowed down to a clinical condition produced by elevated blood pressure and which can be reversed by blood pressure reduction.

Treaty of Orihuela (also known as the Treaty of Tudmir/Theodemir) was an early Dhimmi treaty imposed by the invading Moors on the Christians in the city of Orihuela in the Iberian Peninsula in 713 History The Treaty of Tudmir was a pact made between ‚ÄòAbd al-‚ÄòAziz (son of Musa bin Nusair, governor of North Africa) and the Christian Visigoth Theodemir, Tudmir in Arabic (prince and governor of the region of Murcia in the Iberian Peninsula) in the early eighth century.Gerald Elmore. ‚ÄúPoised Expectancy: Ibn al-‚ÄòArabi‚Äôs Roots in Sharq al- Andalus.‚Äù Studia Islamica. No. 90 (2000): 54. This accord was created in 713 C. E., two years after the Islamic conquest of Spain began; it bears special significance with regard to the Muslims‚Äô diplomatic behavior and their treatment of enemies and conquered peoples. It suggests the Muslims succeeded in a peaceful take-over of southern Spain, specifically Orihuela, Villena, Alicante, Mula, Bigastro, Ello, and Lorca. The agreement stated that the Murcians could keep control and continue to practice their Christian faith but only if they paid the taxes and did not aid Muslim enemies.\\"The Treaty of Tudmir\\" in Reading the Middle Ages: Sources from Europe, Byzantium, and the Islamic World. Ed.Barbara H. Rosenwein. Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2006. p. 92. Although the Treaty of Tudmir itself may not seem to have been particularly noteworthy in its own context, and despite the fact that literature which is germane specifically to the Treaty is somewhat rare, it should be considered important in retrospect due to its cultural, religious, and sociological implications. To better understand these implications, it is important to review an initial course of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Conquest Islamic control spread greatly under the Umayyad caliphate. It had reached all the way to Western Africa in Maghrib where the Berbers lived. These peoples fought hard and mostly retreated to the mountains while some clans from the main routes and plains of the coast submitted as dhimmis too or converted to Islam and at any case were promptly joined by the Arabs to their military machine. With their superior military arms and skills the caliphs were able to extend their control into Spain.Marshall G.S. Hodgson, ‚ÄúBook One: The Islamic Infusion: Genesis of a New Social Order.‚Äù The Venture of Islam: The Classical Age of Islam. Vol 1. University of Chicago: 1974. p. 226 R. Dykes Shaw. ‚ÄúThe Fall of the Visigoth Power in Spain.‚Äù The English Historical Review. Vol 21, No 82. April 1906. p. 220 The first notable Islamic conqueror to enter Spain was the Berber commander Tariq ibn Ziyad. Mus√° ibn Nusayr was the governor of Northern Africa under the caliph of that period, and it was he who ordered Tariq to make the initial surge into Spain via Gibraltar in spring of the year 711.H. T. Norris. ‚ÄúThe Early Islamic Settlement of Gibraltar.‚Äù The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Britain and Ireland 91, no. 1 (1961): 39. Once in Gibraltar, Tariq took time to secure a base of operations for his forces and fortified it with a wall, among other defenses. As soon as this was accomplished, Tariq sent an invasion force to the city of Carteya (or Cartaja) and the district of Algeciras, and both were promptly subdued. In little more than two months, Tariq had worked his way steadily through the south of Spain; he began his plunge into central Spain in a battle with the Visigothic King Roderic at Wadi Bakkah. Here, Tariq defeated the army of Roderick against reportedly overwhelming odds.Laura Veccia Vaglieri. ‚ÄúThe Patriarchal and Umayyad Caliphates.‚Äù in The Cambridge History of Islam. Vol. 1, ed. P. M. Holt et al., 87 (London: Cambridge University Press, 1970). Tariq moved thence to the cities of √âcija and C√≥rdoba, effectively ignoring commands he had previously received from Mus√° to return to Africa or to remain stationary until the governor‚Äôs arrival in Spain.Ambroxio Huici Miranda. ‚ÄúThe Iberian Peninsula and Sicily.‚Äù in The Cambridge History of Islam. Vol. 2, ed. P. M. Holt et al., 406 (London: Cambridge University Press, 1970). After attacking and overpowering these cities, Tariq moved on with relative ease as far as Guadalajara, Spain. He quickly took control of Toledo and its surrounding territories before lack of reinforcements from Mus√° necessitated his withdrawal, whereupon he retreated to Toledo and remained there until Mus√° himself came to meet him with scorn and jealousy, demanding the spoils of the conquest.Miranda, 407. Shortly after Mus√° arrived in Toledo, the Caliph al-Walid ordered him and Tariq to appear in the royal court in Damascus to speak of their campaign in Spain. Upon Mus√°‚Äôs departure for Damascus, he abdicated his authority over the conquered regions to his son ‚ÄòAbd al-‚ÄòAziz, who carried on his father‚Äôs and Tariq‚Äôs work. It was ‚ÄòAbd al-‚ÄòAziz who eventually reached the region of Murcia in his conquests, where he encountered and signed a treaty with the above mentioned Visigothic lord of the region, Theodemir. It was this treaty that became known as the Treaty of Tudmir, and the land of Murcia thereafter was known also as Tudmir.Vaglieri, 87. Mus√° ibn Nusayr Muslim general in North Africa who led the conquest of Spain.\\"The Treaty of Tudmir\\" p. 92. He was known for his great leadership and warrior skills. His origins are slightly unknown but he may have been a freedman linked to the Yemenite tribe and is suggested that his father was a commander of the caliph‚Äôs bodyguard. He supported the Caisites against Merwan. After being accused of mistrust, he fled to Egypt and found refuge from its governor ‚ÄòAbd al-‚ÄòAziz ibn Marwan, and he changed his support in favor of the reigning caliphs. He became governor of Northern Africa in 698 and quickly extended his control all the way to Maghrib in West Africa, where he took control of the Berbers and integrated them into the Muslim army. September 714 brought an end to the Spanish conquests and the end of Mus√°‚Äôs career. He headed to Damascus with much of the spoils and captives but the caliph al-Walid viewed him with suspicion. Mus√° died penniless sometime around 716.Shaw, 219-220. Tariq ibn Ziyad A Berber commander in the Muslim army under Mus√° ibn Nusayr, he led the conquest into Spain in 711 with about 7,000 soldiers. Where he landed has since been named after him: Gibraltar, or ‚ÄúJabal Tariq‚Äù, which in Arabic means ‚ÄúMount of Tariq‚Äù.Shaw, 222. Ibn Abd-el-Hakem, History of the Conqziest of Spain, trans. by John Harris Jones (Gottingen, W. Fr. Kaestner, 858), pp. 18-22 He swept through much of southern Spain and conquered the capital of Toledo. It is also said he acquired the bejeweled ‚Äútable of Solomon‚Äù in Alcala de Henares. 'Abd al-'Aziz Son of Mus√°. He was sent on two operations in Spain: one to the west towards Huelva and the other to the east where he initiated the Treaty of Tudmir in Murcia.Shaw, 227. \\"The Treaty of Tudmir\\", 92. al-Walid Umayyad Caliph at the time of the initial conquests in the Iberian Peninsula who was influential in the events that led to the development of the Treaty of Tudmir. Al-Walid was the son of 'Abd al-Malik, and his reign was a highly prosperous one. Marked by extravagant building projects and restorations in the new capital of Damascus, the administration of al-Walid was very wealthy, though this affluence was owed in great part to the prudent management of his father from whom he inherited the Caliphate.Vaglieri, 85-86. It was under the rule of al-Walid that the realms of Carthage and the Maghrib in Northern Africa were finally subdued. Mus√° ibn Nusayr was made governor of the provinces of that region under the order of al-Walid, and from this point, the focus of expansion was set on the Iberian Peninsula.Vaglieri, 86. After the conquest of Spain, the spoils of the campaign were handed over to al-Walid, and all three figures gradually faded from notoriety, but it was under the mandate of al- Walid that 'Abd al-'Aziz made the Treaty of Tudmir with Theodemir.

In his youth Guitmund entered the monastery of La-Croix-Saint-Leufroy in the Diocese of √âvreux. By 1060 he was studying theology at the Abbey of Bec, where he had Lanfranc as teacher and Anselm as a fellow-student, each of them later Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1070 William the Conqueror called him to take up a diocese in England, to which the monk responded with his Oratio ad Guillelmum, denouncing the Norman Conquest. In his native Normandy, Guitmund defended the doctrine of transubstantiation against Berengar of Tours. During the 1070s he wrote a treatise on the Holy Eucharist, entitled De corporis et sanguinis Jesu Christi veritate in Eucharistia (\\"On the body and blood of Jesus Christ truly in the Eucharist\\"), which takes the familiar literary form of a dialogue between himself and a fellow monk, Roger, to present the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. He attributes the perceived decay of the reserved sacrament, not as an accident of its essential substance (the orthodox view), but merely as a deception of our senses. The first printed edition of Guitmund's De corporis et sanguinis was edited by Erasmus (Freiburg, 1530). Shortly after Guitmund had published his treatise against Berengar, he obtained permission from his abbot, Odilo, to make a pilgrimage to Rome, where he lived for a time in a Roman monastery under the pseudonym of Christianus, which afforded him obscurity. Pope Urban II, formerly a monk at the Abbey of Cluny, appointed Guitmund as Bishop of Aversa in 1088. Ordericus Vitalis (in his Historiae Ecclesiasticae, Book IV) states that Guitmund left his monastery, with permission, and went to Pope Gregory VII, who made him a cardinal. August Pr√©vost, Ordericus' editor, states however: \\"Guitmond n'a jamais √©t√© √©lev√© au cardinalat.\\" Paul Fridolin Kehr, too, denies the cardinalate.Paul Fridolin Kehr (1925), Italia pontificia Vol. VIII (Berlin: Weidmann 1925), p. 282: \\"fabulose narrat Guimundum a Gregorio VII cardinalem s.

She is most known for founding the Inner Healing movement, a process she described as the healing of memories. Education Agnes attended the Shanghai American School as a teenager before leaving to the United States to attend Peace College, a Presbyterian women's college in Raleigh, NC. After three years there, she received her certificate in education. Since the teaching certification only allowed her to teach in North Carolina, she then applied and was accepted at Agnes Scott College in Georgia. She planned on receiving her bachelor's degree, but after learning she would be required to take courses in math, science, and French, she switched to a non-degree \\"special\\" student so she could take additional courses in writing, poetry, and art during her final year. She finished in 1919 and returned to China where she taught English at the Presbyterian mission station before teaching at St. Mary's School in Shanghai and then the Soochow Academy, both Episcopal schools in Shanghai. It was at the latter that she met and married her husband, Edgar (Ted) Sanford. Career Sanford holds a significant place in Church history for the twentieth century. As a child of Presbyterian missionaries in China, she was taught the doctrine of Cessationism, which declared that miracles‚Äîespecially healing‚Äîhad been temporary for the New Testament Church and then had immediately ceased. Through her ministry and books, however, she demonstrated that miracles and healing still occur. Additionally, Sanford is recognized as the founder of the Inner Healing Movement, a type of prayer geared toward healing of memories and emotions. She married the Episcopal priest Edgar L. Sanford. Because of her membership in the Episcopal Church, Agnes had a profound effect upon Christians who otherwise might not accept the validity of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and the continuation of the Gifts of the Spirit. Sanford published her first book, The Healing Light, more than a decade prior to the recognized emergence of the Charismatic Movement, and it is often considered a classic in its field. Written from a scientific and metaphysical perspective, it appealed to a wide audience by connecting with those seeking a balanced, mediated position. It had already circulated enough by the 1960s to be considered by some to be the movement‚Äôs main source for a practical theology of healing prayer. Agnes became a regular speaker at Camps Farthest Out conferences and has often been referenced by well-known authors, such as Francis MacNutt, John Sandford, and Leanne Payne. These factors together resulted in her having a foundational impact on the early Charismatic Movement. In these respects, Sanford became a significant and foundational part of the Renewal Movement in the first half of the twentieth century.

He was also selected as a second-team All-Big Ten player by both the conference coaches and media. He became the second player in Michigan history to lead the team in tackles three consecutive years. (Erick Anderson led the team in tackles four consecutive years from 1988 to 1991.) In four years at Michigan, Sword started 39 games and totaled 370 tackles, including 265 solo tackles, five pass breakups, three fumble recoveries, and one interception. His 265 solo tackle ranks third in Michigan history behind Jarrett Irons (296) and Erick Anderson (286).(to retrieve a list of Michigan's all-time leaders in solo tackle, go to the \\"Individual Statistical Leaders\\" section and select the drop-downs for \\"Career\\", \\"Defense\\" and \\"Tackles\\") He was named the 1997 and 1998 winner of The Roger Zatkoff Award as the team's best linebacker. Professional football Sword was undrafted in the 1999 NFL Draft but signed as a free agent with the Oakland Raiders. He appeared in 10 games for the Raiders, five of them as a starter, during the 1999 season. In 2000, Sword joined the Indianapolis Colts and remained with the club for three seasons. He appeared in all 16 regular season games in 2001 and 2002, principally as a special teams player, and started three games at linebacker. In four NFL seasons, Sword appeared in 45 games, eight as a starter at linebacker, and recorded 66 tackles and two sacks.

He is referred to by St Ambrose as \\"Mercurinus\\", but in an extravagant document written at the height of a bitter dispute with the Imperial court, apparently in order to accuse his rival with having changed his name from Mercurinus in order to curry favour with supporters of another Auxentius who had been Ambrose‚Äôs predecessor; the robustness of this accusation is unknown.Mark O'Sullivan, The Social and Political Influence of Saint Ambrose as Reflected in his Letters, B.Phil thesis, Liverpool University, 1976.

In Milan, seat of the Western Imperial court, Nicene and Arian controversy flared high. In 386, Auxentius challenged Ambrose to a public disputation, in which the judges were to be the court favourites of the Arian empress; he also demanded for the Arians the use of the Basilica Portiana. Ambrose's refusal to surrender this church brought about a siege of the edifice, in which Ambrose and a multitude of his faithful Milanese had shut themselves up. The empress eventually abandoned her favourite and made peace with Ambrose.Baunard, Saint Ambroise, Paris, 1872, 332-348; Hefele, History of the Councils, I He wrote an account of the life and death of Ulfilas that the Arian bishop Maximinus included (383) in a work directed against St. Ambrose and the Synod of Aquileia, 381. This favourite of Empress Justina was the anti-bishop set up in Milan by the Arians on the occasion of the election of Ambrose. The Letter of Auxentius (ca 400) was preserved in the margins of a manuscript of De fide of Ambrose. Along with the Creed of Ulfilas it is one of the chief witnesses to the credence of the Arian Christians and the politics of the Church at the time when Nicene Christianity continued to be debated at the highest levels of the Catholic Church.

Neurocysticercosis is a specific form of the infectious parasitic disease cysticercosis that is caused by the infection with Taenia solium, a tapeworm found in pigs. Neurocysticercosis occurs when cysts formed by the infection take hold within the brain, causing neurologic syndromes such as epileptic seizures. It is a common cause of seizures worldwide. It has been called a \\"hidden epidemic\\" and \\"arguably the most common parasitic disease of the human nervous system\\". Common symptoms of neurocysticercosis include seizures, headaches, blindness, meningitis and dementia.  Pathophysiology  Neurocysticercosis most commonly involves the cerebral cortex followed by the cerebellum. The pituitary gland is very rarely involved in neurocysticercosis. The cysts may rarely coalesce and form a tree- like pattern which is known as racemose neurocysticercosis, which when involving the pituitary gland may result in multiple pituitary hormone deficiency.  Diagnosis  Neurocysticerosis is diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan. Diagnosis may be confirmed by detection of antibodies against cysticerci in CSF or serum through ELISA or imunoblotting techniques.  Treatment Treatment of neurocysticerosis includes epileptic therapy and a long-course medication of praziquantel (PZQ) and/or albendazole. Steroid therapy may be necessary to minimize the inflammatory reaction to dying cysticerci. Surgical removal of brain cysts may be necessary, e.g. in cases of large parenchymal cysts, intraventricular cysts or hydrocephalus. Albendazole can reduce the number of viable brain lesions and reduce seizures recurrence in those with non-viable brain lesions. Albendazole is contraindicated for spinal and ocular cysticercosis, as drug induced inflammation may result in irreversible damage to these organs. For seizures further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (AED) for seizure prevention in patients with symptoms other than seizures and the duration of AED treatment in these cases.  Epidemiology  The epidemiology of Taenia solium cysticercosis is associated with poor sanitation and is highly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia. Cysticercosis in the United States, which commonly presents in the form of neurocysticercosis, has been classified as a \\"neglected tropical disease\\", which commonly affects the poor and homeless, particularly those without access or in the habit of inadequate hand-washing and in the habit of eating with their hands.

The abbreviation refers to the homologies to the Caenorhabditis elegans SMA (\\"small\\" worm phenotype) and Drosophila MAD (\\"Mothers Against Decapentaplegic\\") family of genes. There are three distinct sub-types of Smads: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common partner Smads (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads). The eight members of the Smad family are divided among these three groups. Trimers of two receptor-regulated SMADs and one co-SMAD act as transcription factors that regulate the expression of certain genes. Sub-types The R-Smads consist of Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5 and Smad8/9, and are involved in direct signaling from the TGF-B receptor. Smad4 is the only known human Co-Smad, and has the role of partnering with R-Smads to recruit co-regulators to the complex. Finally, Smad6 and Smad7 are I-Smads that work to suppress the activity of R-Smads. While Smad7 is a general TGF-B signal inhibitor, Smad6 associates more specifically with BMP signaling. R/Co-Smads are primarily located in the cytoplasm, but accumulate in the nucleus following TGF-B signaling, where they can bind to DNA and regulate transcription. However, I-Smads are predominantly found in the nucleus, where they can act as direct transcriptional regulators.  Discovery and nomenclature  Before Smads were discovered, it was unclear what downstream effectors were responsible for transducing TGF-B signals. Smads were first discovered in Drosophila, in which they are known as mothers against dpp (Mad), through a genetic screen for dominant enhancers of decapentaplegic (dpp), the Drosophila version of TGF-B. Studies found that Mad null mutants showed similar phenotypes to dpp mutants, suggesting that Mad played an important role in some aspect of the dpp signaling pathway. A similar screen done in the Caenorhabditis elegans protein SMA (from gene sma for small body size) revealed three genes, Sma-2, Sma-3, and Sma-4, that had similar mutant phenotypes to those of the TGF-B like receptor Daf-4. The human homologue of Mad and Sma was named Smad1, a portmanteau of the previously discovered genes. When injected into Xenopus embryo animal caps, Smad1 was found to be able to reproduce the mesoderm ventralizing effects that BMP4, a member of the TGF-B family, has on embryos. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Smad1 had transactivational ability localized at the carboxy terminus, which can be enhanced by adding BMP4. This evidence suggests that Smad1 is responsible in part for transducing TGF-B signals.  Protein  Smads are roughly between 400 and 500 amino acids long, and consist of two globular regions at the amino and carboxy termini, connected by a linker region. These globular regions are highly conserved in R-Smads and Co-Smads, and are called Mad homology 1 (MH1) at the N-terminus, and MH2 at the C-terminus. The MH2 domain is also conserved in I-Smads. The MH1 domain is primarily involved in DNA binding, while the MH2 is responsible for the interaction with other Smads and also for the recognition of transcriptional co-activators and co- repressors. R-Smads and Smad4 interact with several DNA motifs though the MH1 domain. These motifs include the CAGAC and its CAGCC variant, as well as the 5-bp consensus sequence GGC(GC)(CG). Receptor-phosphorylated R-Smads can form homotrimers, as well as heterotrimers with Smad4 in vitro, via interactions between the MH2 domains. Trimers of one Smad4 molecule and two receptor- phosphorylated R-Smad molecules are thought to be the predominant effectors of TGF-Œ≤ transcriptional regulation. The linker region between MH1 and MH2 is not just a connector, but also plays a role in protein function and regulation. Specifically, R-Smads are phosphorylated in the nucleus at the linker domain by CDK8 and 9, and these phosphorylations modulate the interaction of Smad proteins with transcriptional activators and repressors. Furthermore, after this phosphorylation step, the linker undergoes a second round of phosphorylations by GSK3, labelling Smads for their recognition by ubiquitin ligases, and targeting them for proteasome-mediated degradation. The transcription activators and the ubiquitin ligases both contain pairs of WW domains. These domains interact with the PY motif present in the R-Smad linker, as well as with the phosphorylated residues located in the proximity of the motif. Indeed, the different phosphorylation patterns generated by CDK8/9 and GSK3 define the specific interactions with either transcription activators or with ubiquitin ligases.. Remarkably, the linker region has the highest concentration of amino acid differences among metazoans, although the phosphorylation sites and the PY motif are highly conserved.  Sequence conservation  The components of the TGF-beta pathway and in particular, the R-Smads, Co-Smad and I-Smads, are represented in the genome of all metazoans sequenced to date. The level of sequence conservation of the Co-Smad and of R-Smads proteins across species is extremely high. This level of conservation of components -and sequences- suggests that the general functions of the TGF- beta pathway have remained generally intact ever since. I-Smads have conserved MH2 domains, but divergent MH1 domains as compared to R-Smads and Co-Smads.  Role in TGF-√ü signalling pathway  =R/Co-Smads= TGF-B ligands bind receptors consisting of type 1 and type 2 serine/threonine kinases, which serve to propagate the signal intracellularly. Ligand binding stabilizes a receptor complex consisting of two type 1 receptors, and two type 2 receptors. Type 2 receptors then can phosphorylate type 1 receptors at locations on the GS domain, located N-terminally to the type 1 kinase domain. This phosphorylation event activates the type 1 receptors, making them capable of further propagating the TGF-B signal via Smads. Type 1 receptors phosphorylate R-Smads at two C-terminal serines, which are arranged in an SSXS motif. Smads are localized at the cell surface by Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) proteins, placing them in proximity of type 1 receptor kinases to facilitate phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the R-Smad causes it to dissociate from SARA, exposing a nuclear import sequence, as well as promoting its association with a Co-Smad. This Smad complex is then localized to the nucleus, where it is able to bind their target genes, with the help of other associated proteins. =I-Smads= I-Smads disrupt TGF-B signaling through a variety of mechanisms, including preventing association of R-Smads with type 1 receptors and Co-Smads, down-regulating type 1 receptors, and making transcriptional changes in the nucleus. The conserved MH2 domain of I-Smads is capable of binding to type 1 receptors, thus making it a competitive inhibitor of R-Smad binding. Following R-Smad activation, it forms a heteromeric complex with an I-Smad, which prevents its association with a Co-Smad. In addition, the I-Smad recruits a ubiquitin ligase to target the activate R-Smad for degradation, effectively silencing the TGF-B signal. I-Smads in the nucleus also compete with R/Co-Smad complexes for association with DNA binding elements. Reporter assays show that fusing I-Smads to the DNA-binding region of reporter genes decreases their expression, suggesting that I-Smads function as transcriptional repressors.  Role in cell cycle control  In adult cells, TGF-B inhibits cell cycle progression, stopping cells from making the G1/S phase transition. This phenomenon is present in the epithelial cells of many organs, and is regulated in part by the Smad signaling pathway. The precise mechanism of control differs slightly between cell types. One mechanism by which Smads facilitate TGF-B induced cytostasis is by downregulating Myc, which is a transcription factor that promotes cell growth. Myc also represses p15(Ink4b) and p21(Cip1), which are inhibitors of Cdk4 and Cdk2 respectively. When there is no TGF-B present, a repressor complex composed of Smad3, and the transcription factors E2F4 and p107 exist in the cytoplasm. However, when TGF-B signal is present, this complex localizes to the nucleus, where it associates with Smad4 and binds to the TGF-B inhibitory element (TIE) of the Myc promoter to repress its transcription. In addition to Myc, Smads are also involved in the downregulation of Inhibitor of DNA Binding (ID) proteins. IDs are transcription factors that regulate genes involved in cell differentiation, maintaining multi-potency in stem cells, and promoting continuous cell cycling. Therefore, downregulating ID proteins is a pathway by which TGF-B signaling could arrest the cell cycle. In a DNA microarray screen, Id2 and Id3 were found to be repressed by TGF-B, but induced by BMP signaling. Knocking out Id2 and Id3 genes in epithelial cells enhances cell cycle inhibition by TGF-B, showing that they are important in mediating this cytostatic effect. Smads are both a direct and indirect inhibitor of Id expression. TGF-B signal triggers Smad3 phosphorylation, which in turn activates ATF3, a transcription factor that is induced during cellular stress. Smad3 and ATF3 then coordinate to repress Id1 transcription, resulting in its downregulation. Indirectly, Id downregulation is a secondary effect of Myc repression by Smad3. Since Myc is an inducer of Id2, downregulating Myc will also result in reduced Id2 signaling, which contributes to cell cycle arrest. Studies show that Smad3, but not Smad2, is an essential effector for the cytostatic effects of TGF-B. Depleting endogeneous Smad3 via RNA interference was sufficient to interfere with TGF-B cytostasis. However, depleting Smad2 in a similar manner enhanced, rather than halted, TGF-B induced cell cycle arrest. This suggests while Smad3 is necessary for TGF-B cytostatic effect, the ratio of Smad3 to Smad2 modulates the intensity of the response. However, overexpressing Smad2 to change this ratio had no effect on the cytostatic response. Therefore, further experiments are necessary to definitely prove that the ratio of Smad3 to Smad2 regulates intensity of cytostatic effect in response to TGF-B. Smad proteins have also been found to be direct transcriptional regulators of Cdk4. Reporter assays in which luciferase was placed under a Cdk4 promoter showed increased luciferase expression when Smad4 was targeted with siRNAs. Repression of Smad2 and 3 did not have any significant effect, suggesting that Cdk4 is directly regulated by Smad4.  Clinical significance  = Role of Smad in cancer = Defects in Smad signaling can result in TGF-B resistance, causing dysregulation of cell growth. Deregulation of TGF-B signaling has been implicated in many cancer types, including pancreatic, colon, breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Smad4 is most commonly mutated in human cancers, particularly pancreatic and colon cancer. Smad4 is inactivated in nearly half of all pancreatic cancers. As a result, Smad4 was first termed Deleted in Pancreatic Cancer Locus 4 (DPC4) upon its discovery. Germline Smad4 mutations are partially responsible for genetic disposition for human familial juvenile polyposis, which puts a person at high risk of developing potentially cancerous gastrointestinal polyps. Experimental supporting evidence for this observation comes from a study showing that heterozygous Smad4 knockout mice (+/-) uniformly developed gastrointestinal polyps by 100 weeks. Many familial Smad4 mutants occur on the MH2 domain, which disrupts the protein‚Äôs ability to form homo- or hetero- oligomers, thus impairing TGF-B signal transduction. Despite evidence showing that Smad3 is more critical than Smad2 in TGF-B signaling, the rate of Smad3 mutations in cancer is lower than that of Smad2. Choriocarcinoma tumor cells are TGF-B signaling resistant, as well as lacking Smad3 expression. Studies show that reintroducing Smad3 into choriocarcinoma cells is sufficient to increase TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1) levels, a mediator of TGF-B‚Äôs anti-invasive effect, and thus restore TGF-B signaling. However, reintroducing Smad3 was not sufficient to rescue the anti-invasive effect of TGF-B. This suggests that other signaling mechanisms in addition to Smad3 are defective in TGF-B resistant choriocarcinoma. = Role of Smad in Alzheimer‚Äôs = Alzheimer‚Äôs patients display elevated levels of TGF-B and phosphorylated Smad2 in their hippocampal neurons. This finding is seemingly paradoxical, as TGF-B has previously been shown to have neuroprotective effects on Alzheimer‚Äôs patients. This suggests that some aspect of TGF-B signaling is defective, causing TGF-B to lose its neuroprotective effects. Research has shown that phosphorylated Smad2 is ectopically localized to cytoplasmic granules rather than the nucleus, in hippocampal neurons of patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Specifically, the ectopically located phosphorylated Smad2s were found within amyloid plaques, and attached to neurofibrillary tangles. These data suggest that Smad2 is involved in the development of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Recent studies show that the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) is involved in promoting the abnormal localization of Smad2. Pin1 was found to co-localize with Smad2/3 and phosphorylated tau proteins within the cytoplasmic granules, suggesting a possible interaction. Transfecting Smad2 expressing cells with Pin1 causes proteasome-mediated Smad2 degradation, as well as increased association of Smad2 with phosphorylated tau. This feedback loop is bidirectional; Smad2 is also capable of increasing Pin1 mRNA synthesis. Thus, the two proteins could be caught in a ‚Äúvicious cycle‚Äù of regulation. Pin1 causes both itself and Smad2 to be associated in insoluble neurofibrillary tangles, resulting in low levels of both soluble proteins. Smad2 then promotes Pin1 RNA synthesis to try and compensate, which only drives more Smad2 degradation and association with neurofibrillary tangles. = TGF-B/Smad signaling in kidney disease = Dysregulation of TGF-B/Smad signaling is a possible pathogenic mechanism of chronic kidney disease. In the kidneys, TGF-B1 promotes accumulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by increasing its production and inhibiting its degradation, which is characteristic of renal fibrosis. TGF-B1 signal is transduced by the R-Smads Smad2 and Smad3, both of which are found to be overexpressed in diseased kidneys. Smad3 knockout mice display reduced progression of renal fibrosis, suggesting its importance in regulating the disease. Conversely, inhibiting Smad2 in kidney cells (full Smad2 knockouts are embryonic lethal) actually leads to more severe fibrosis, suggesting that Smad2 works antagonistically to Smad3 in the progression of renal fibrosis. Unlike the R-Smads, Smad7 protein is typically under-expressed in diseased kidney cells. This loss of TGF-B inhibition results in increased amounts of active Smad2/3, which contribute to the progression of renal fibrosis as described above.

Overview This 1984 release was the first in what could be very loosely said to belong to a trilogy of his 1980s albums, the other two being Invisible Connections and Mask, both from the following year (1985). It is a concept album which derived inspiration from the natural elements, life processes taking place on the Earth's surface and beneath our feet. He recalls that it \\"was made because I wanted to make music, not sell a million records. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to guarantee commercial success for an album anyway, because nobody really knows what is commercial and what isn‚Äôt. Even if I went out of my way to make an album that was more accessible to the public, that would not guarantee its commercial success\\". The album cover art features the rear view of a great diving beetle. Release The album reached #55 position in the UK album charts, and #45 position in the Netherlands album charts in 1984. Composition Vangelis uses exotic synth-harmonies, creative percussion and melody-lines, as well as rare use of double bass plucking sounds. The first movement is accompanied by storm and rain-effects, and on top of this is loose improvisational skills to probably indicate the many forms of life springing into existence. The second movement has tune-like quality, and is the most tranquil piece, in contrast to the next three which are darker in atmosphere. The third movement shows the violent side of nature, indicating the struggle to survive, whilst the fourth movement is more contemplative and a bit gloomy, perhaps indicating slowed-down nightlife activity. The fifth movement is a wonderfully loose piece of improvisation, going through many moods and tempos before setting up an emotional conclusion to the life. Reception Jim Brenholts of Allmusic notes that Vangelis \\"surrounds a subtle drone with heavy sequences and dense atmospheres. He uses a symphonic synth to create pastoral textures\\", and that \\"is a very accessible album\\".

Avancini was born in the Tyrol. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1627, and for some years held the chair of rhetoric and philosophy at University of Graz, and subsequently that of theology at Vienna. He was rector of the Colleges of Passau, Vienna, and Graz, Provincial of the Austrian Province, Visitor of Bohemia, and at his death Assistant for the German Provinces of the Society. In the midst of these duties he published works on philosophy, theology, and sacred literature. His Meditations on the Life and Doctrines of Jesus Christ has maintained some popularity. This work, originality in Latin, was translated into the principal European languages and went through many editions.

Whoonu is billed as \\"the fun-filled 'what's your favorite thing?' game\\". Equipment * 300 cards labeled with random people, places, things, actions, etc. * 36 tokens in six different values (1 to 6) * Secret envelope Preparation There are different combinations for the number of tokens needed depending on how many people are playing. If there are three participants, use tokens 1 to 4 in stacks of three. If there are four players, use tokens 1 to 6 in stacks of four, tokens 1 to 4 in stacks of five if there are five, and tokens 1 to 5 in stacks of six if there are six. Also, you must remember that there are many different species of cards. For this reason, it is important to make sure you pick the right ones. The envelope is given to the player whose birthday is coming up next. This player is the first \\"Whoozit\\". Everyone except the Whoozit receives four cards and the remaining cards are put face down in a pile. Players can look at their cards, but cannot show them to anyone else. Game play In each round, players will try to guess the Whoozit's favorite things. For example, a player may have been dealt these cards: Super Bowl Sunday, New York City, string cheese and gardening. He would pick two cards (if there were three or four players) or one card (if there were five or six players) marked with things that he thinks the Whoozit prefers. All of the players other than the Whoozit put their chosen cards in the envelope without revealing them. The Whoozit then takes the cards out of the envelope and secretly puts them behind the corresponding tokens: 1 least favorite, and 6 for most favorite. The Whoozit reveals the least favorite thing first, reading it aloud. The player who chose this card takes the 1 token and gets one point. The Whoozit continues turning over cards until all of them are revealed and one token from each stack is awarded. After this process is completed, then a new Whoozit must be selected. Everyone passes their cards to player on their left. The player with no cards takes the envelope and becomes the new Whoozit. All of the revealed cards are put in a discard pile. Everyone except the Whoozit draws more cards for a total of four cards in each hand. The game continues until everyone has been the Whoozit and all of the tokens are awarded. Variations Because of the relative randomness of all responses, it is not uncommon for players to come up with their own categories for Whoonu rounds, such at \\"different flavors of soup\\" or \\"unlikely super powers\\" or any listable (or even risque, vulgar or abstract, such as using a potato) category that the players' imaginations can come up with. With such variable categories, it is not uncommon to continue beyond one round. Most games, in such cases, last until a predetermined point total (like 100 or 200) has been achieved by one player or until all 300 Whoonu cards have been played. It is relatively easy to create a homemade version of the game by taking index cards and writing other nouns, names and verbs on them and by using any other form of scoring tokens like coins or poker chips. By using other scoring tokens, it is possible to have more than the game's self-allotted maximum of 7 players. A different way of playing Whoonu includes having the same judge (or Whoonu) for everybody's category for one round. While that judge would be absent from scoring for that round and would not be able to submit any of their own cards for any of the categories in that round, all players would be absent from one round each, making it even. A variation of that judging method is to have one judge deal out 6 cards to the other 6 players (or 5 or 4 players), but none to himself. (If there is only 3 other players, deal out 12 cards to each player; if 2 players, 18 cards each.) The judge will then make up 6 categories in a row to judge and the other players can only submit cards from the remaining cards in their hand; they are not allowed to draw another card from the deck. When it comes to the sixth category, the players have to submit what card/cards remain in their hand, no matter how relevant the card is the category. Another simple variation instead has the players choose the \\"Whoozit's\\" least favorite, as opposed to the normal way of playing when the players choose the Whoozit's favorite.

It is one of the seven high schools in Modesto. Thomas Downey High is the second oldest high school in the city of Modesto and its doors opened to students in the Fall of 1951. Its mascot is the Knight, but they are sometimes humorously referred to as the \\"Downey Ducks.\\" The school's current student population is approximately 2,000 in Grades 9 through 12. The movie American Graffiti, written and directed by Downey graduate George Lucas, is based in Modesto but filmed in Petaluma, California. The school that students in the film attend is called \\"Dewey High\\", but is actually Petaluma High School, the architectural twin to Downey High. \\"Dewey High\\" is a reference to Downey. The Block \\"D\\" Athletic Jackets and school colors in the movie are Royal Blue and White, identical to Downey's school colors. Downey's yearbook and newspaper have received awards. The Agriculture Department at Thomas Downey was first created to work the school's early orchards. The orchards have been since cut down, with the department serving as the main welding area for the students of TDHS. Proficient students in welding go on to competitions for the National FFA Organization. If students win competitions, they have a chance to be recognized by superiors in the welding industry. Companies include West-Mark, Caterpillar, and others. Students also raise animals for the Stanislaus County Fair, hoping to gain a profit. The projects range from 3 to 7 months and focus on gardening, animals, and home improvement. Students also have the opportunity to take a floral design class in which students design and sell arrangements. The school has designated dress-up days during fall and winter homecoming weeks, Unity Week, and Red Ribbon week. A large rally is usually thrown at the beginning of each year for fall homecoming, where dance performances are given and homecoming court nominees play games meant to be somewhat embarrassing, but all in good fun for the spirit of Homecoming Week. Sport In 2006, the Thomas Downey High boys' varsity had a run n' gun type Offense lead by their seniors Zeph Tyson, Andre Poree, Travis Jacobson and Roderick Stevens. The team finished 1 game out of playoff contention. In 2008 the Thomas Downey High boys' varsity basketball team was crowned 2008 MMC (Modesto Metro Conference) Champions by beating Modesto High and had an inner league record of 13‚Äì2. On Saturday, February 23, 2008, the Downey Science Bowl Blue Team won the Central Valley Regional Science Bowl Competition. They defeated the other 23 teams from the area. The Downey High Boys Soccer team has won the MMC (Modesto Metro Conference) in 2008, 2010, and 2011, and had a section final appearance in 2007. The Downey High Baseball team won the MMC in 2011 for the first time with a league record of 13-2, and overall record of 20-7-1. Blake Smith (class of 2006) currently plays in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization as an outfielder for the Double A Chattanooga Lookouts. Smith was drafted in the second round by the Dodgers in the 2009 MLB draft out of UC Berkeley. In 2012, The Thomas Downey High Football team won the Modesto Metro Conference for the first time in school history with a record of 6-0-0. Overall, the team finished 10-2-0, with a victory over State Champions Central Catholic 45-42, and the school's first playoff victory in 25 years‚Äîa 41-6 victory over Jesse Bethel High of Vallejo, CA. In 2013, The Thomas Downey High Football team tied for the Modesto Metro Conference title along with Modesto(high school). Overall, the Team finished 7-4-0. Downey's Second consecutive MMC Titile was led by 15 All league Players, Offense: QB PJ Wilson, RB Mario Sanchez, WIde receivers Tristan Best, Josh Lowe, and Mike Falepouno, Offensive linemen Kyler Bourque, Michael Dean Barron, and OL Josh Roy. Defense: DB Jaedon Webb, ILB Josh Baldonado, OLB Sanjay Parmer, OLB Jozeph Camp, DL Ty Nelson, Danny Cota, and Punter Thomas Reynolds. In 2014, The Thomas Downey High Football team won the Modesto Metro Conference for the third straight year. Overall, the team finished 10-2-0, with a first-round playoff victory over Antelope High School, 20-19. In addition, Downey High Cornerback, Jakob Magana was named Sac Joaquin Section defensive player of the year by MaxPreps. He finished with 14 interceptions for the season which also placed him second in the nation in this category. And, Downey High Quarterback, P.J. Wilson, was named Sac Joaquin Section 1st Team Quarterback and finished the season with over 2,900 yards passing and nearly 600 yards rushing. The Downey High JV and Downey High Freshmen teams both completed undefeated seasons at 10-0-0. As a whole, the Downey football program (Varsity, JV, and Frosh) finished a combined 30-2-0. Singing Downey is also notable for its strong tradition in choral singing. Downey has five choirs: Concert Choir (mixed ensemble), Madrigals (advanced mixed ensemble), Knightengales (advanced women's ensemble), Knights(men's ensemble), and Gloriana (beginning women's ensemble). The choirs usually perform three concerts each year: Knight Magic in fall, the holiday concert in the winter, and the spring concert in spring. They also perform at various locations throughout the year and especially throughout the holiday season. The choirs also go on an annual choir tour to Southern California in the spring. Band For many years, Downey High had one of the most outstanding band programs in the far western United States. Things got started under the direction of the band director and composer, Roger Nixon, who later moved on to Modesto Junior College and then San Francisco State University. He wrote the music for the bicentennial of Modesto in 1970 which was performed by the MJC Concert Band under Dr. Jensen. Ken Farrell built on that foundation a truly excellent band program. By 1974 the Downey band had achieved twenty straight command performances (higher than first place) at various concert band festivals around California. The concert band recorded a record every spring for many years. Mr. Farrell wrote the school hymn and fight song and arranged and wrote music for the concert and marching bands. The marching band and pep band were also very good, and Mr. Farrell created a unique tradition of appointing student pep band directors to rehears the group and purchase music to perform, starting with Dave (Fowler) Johnson in 1969. The full marching band performed at every home football game and each game performed a different halftime show consisting of several songs with a different formation for each song. Perfection was expected and achieved by Mr. Ferrell's bands. Daily band practices for several hours would begin 6 weeks before school even began in the fall. So many Downey band students qualified for the California State Honor Band every year that a quota was set at eleven participants. The instrumentalists were critical to the success of the musical plays that were performed every year and to the school orchestra. Several professional and semi-professional musicians graduated from this program including Gary Coates, Ken Nelson, Tony Clemens, Doug Ruby, Joyce Maley, Scott Ferrel and Dave (Fowler) Johnson who attended in the mid 1960s through the early 1970s. Dave (Fowler) Johnson and Wade Muncy are also piano technicians. In 2008 the Downey Concert and Marching Band performed at the Olympics in Beijing, China.

(Hatton played horror roles ‚Äì The Creeper ‚Äì in the early 1940s without makeup because he was severely disfigured by a glandular disease.) During this time, Brabner became friendly with \\"two sometime artists who were very involved in comic fandom\\", which \\"seemed like a lot of fun.\\" Feeling burned out from \\"working with courts, with sexual abusers of children and so on,\\" Brabner began working with Tom Watkins, who \\"was doing a lot of costumes for the Phil Seuling comic shows.\\" Moonlighting \\"as a costumer while continuing to work in the prison programs [she] had organized on [her] own,\\" while not spending much time at conventions or comic shops, she nevertheless eventually became co-owner of a comic book (and theatrical costumes) store herself. Her store stocked Harvey Pekar's American Splendor, but when the store \\"ran out of an issue\\" (one of Brabner's partners selling the last copy of American Splendor #6 without her getting a chance to read it), Brabner sent Pekar a postcard directly, asking for a copy, and the two \\"began to correspond.\\" Developing a phone relationship, after a stay in the hospital by Brabner, Pekar spoke to her daily and sent her a collection of old records. =Harvey Pekar= Brabner recalls that she was: On their second date, they bought rings, and the third date they tied the knot. With the benefit of hindsight, she believes that it was Pekar's honesty that attracted her to him, crediting his work on \\"American Splendor [for giving her] a worm's-eye view of what his other marriages were like,\\" allowing for a greater degree of understanding and openness between the two of them. It was Brabner's second marriage and Pekar's third. As Pekar's third wife, she has appeared as a character in many of his American Splendor stories, as well as helping package and publish the various iterations of the comic. Citing her \\"talent for publicity,\\" Brabner recalls that American Splendor was losing money and decided (having \\"stopped working for the prison program\\") to engage in some \\"screwball publicity.\\" Utilising her costume-making skills, she The gimmick worked, and they \\"picked up nine distributors for the book!\\" The comic began to be profitable, and one of Brabner's dolls \\"ended up on 'The David Letterman Show.'\\" She still makes them occasionally for charity auctions. In addition to Pekar and American Splendor, Brabner has worked with many of independent comics' highest-profile writers and artists. She edited Eclipse's Real War Stories, which brought Mike W. Barr, Steve Bissette, Brian Bolland, Paul Mavrides, Dean Motter, Denny O'Neil and John Totleben (among others) together on behalf of the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors and Citizen Soldier. Real War Stories Lou Ann Merkle, \\"an art student and activist living in Cleveland\\" began working with the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, a \\"military and draft counseling organization\\" and sought out Pekar for advice on the costs involved in creating a comic. Seeking \\"a tool to reach teenagers with information about the military\\" in the face of the peacetime draft and what she saw as an \\"aggressive recruiting campaign\\" (aided by the release of Top Gun in 1986). Brabner recalls that Merkle was looking for some \\"counterpropaganda, a way of presenting some of the things the recruiters weren't telling the kids about the draft,\\" including the stories of \\"veterans and people from El Salvador.\\" Although Merkle had only budgeted for a black and white comic, Brabner felt strongly \\"that color was necessary if they were going to reach the kids\\", preferably with \\"popular artists and writers,\\" but \\"realized with the integrity and honesty the undergrounds had.\\" Brabner, Merkle and the CCCO managed to find a publisher willing to split the costs of printing, were given \\"some grant funding\\" and found some creators willing to defer their pay. After publication, the CCCO took on the responsibility of distributing the comic ‚Äì Real War Stories ‚Äì including getting copies \\"into some schools [where] they were used in classrooms\\". =Legal victory= This drew the attention of the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice, after an Atlanta, newspaper objected strongly at the \\"presence of Real War Stories\\" at a \\"high school 'career day'.\\" Pressure from \\"different people from around the country\\" caused the school to tell the Atlanta Peace Alliance and the CCCO that \\"they couldn't [attend the career day], prompting the APA and CCCO to file a suit against the school.\\" At the hearing, the Department of Defense \\"offered an expert witness\\" who labelled the contents of Real War Stories as being \\"all made up\\", despite Brabner's assertion that not only were they \\"all autobiographical stories\\", but that personally \\"participated in all the interviews [which]... were all carefully documented.\\" During one courtroom exchange, Brabner recalls that they \\"had military Naval court records\\" supporting the truth of some of the autobiographical comics stories, and when the case was continued, the \\"CCCO got a letter from the Department of Defense essentially withdrawing the complaint.\\" Brought to Light Her writing on Brought to Light with Alan Moore and artist Bill Sienkiewicz brought critical praise from both the artistic and activist communities. Originally a joint publishing venture between Eclipse Comics and Warner Books, the 1989 graphic novel flip book Brought to Light dealt in part with the Central Intelligence Agency's involvement in the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. The impetus behind Brought to Light was the involvement of the Christic Institute (\\"a public-interest legal firm, best known at that time for its work on the Karen Silkwood case\\") in a case \\"involving the bombing of a press conference in Costa Rica.\\" Survivors of the bombing who had investigated \\"found,\\" says Brabner \\"it involved much broader issues involving covert operations [and] possible swaps of drugs for arms.\\" Stymied in initial attempts to bring the matter to court, the initial investigators required an outside organization, bringing in the Christic Institute. \\"People at Christic had seen Real War Stories #1\\" and in trying to raise funds to investigate and document facts and allegations surrounding the \\"very complicated\\" story, turned to Brabner \\"and asked if I could communicate this very complex story in comic book form.\\" Faced with \\"two ways the stories could be told,\\" Brabner remembers she decided to utilize both. Warner Books \\"was interested in the project from the beginning,\\" thinking that they could be involved from the start in a book on the Iran-Contra affair, which could, says Brabner, have been \\"as big as Watergate.\\" Caution overtook enthusiasm, however, when \\"it became clear that this story was a lot bigger than everybody thought it was.\\" Although thoroughly scrutinised ‚Äì and Brabner says that she \\"was told at the time by Warner's attorneys that our sources were solid and our book would fly\\" ‚Äì she believes that Warner \\"realized this wasn't going to be the enormous trial, or victory, they thought it would be.\\" Ultimately, Brought to Light was published solely by Eclipse. Other works Brabner, talking in the early 1990s, described the difficulties involved in \\"publish[ing] non-fiction, public interest comics,\\" which entail \\"go[ing] outside the world of comic book publishing,\\" and often relying on \\"grant money.\\" Even with funding in place, however, she described the difficulty in finding \\"a publisher willing to take on a reprinting of the Martin Luther King comic Al Capp Studios packaged [Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story],\\" which was cited as an inspiration by one of the four students who began the February 1960 \\"non-violent sit-in demonstration\\" in Greensboro, North Carolina. Brabner refers to this event as particularly highlighting \\"the historical role of comics in social and political arenas,\\" and (with American Splendor) \\"play[ing] a vital role in Joyce's decision to build upon her work in prisons and schools, to apply the medium to controversial investigative ventures.\\" Together, and separately, Pekar and Brabner \\"have [both] tenaciously pursued a path dedicated to the truths of the human condition, contrary to the lurid escapist fantasies that fuel the main engines of the comic book industry.\\" Indeed, in the Stephen R. Bissette/Stanley Wiater-edited Comic Book Rebels, the editors draw a distinction between Pekar's stories ‚Äì which are \\"primarily by himself and about himself\\" ‚Äî and Brabner, who \\"uses her own experiences to frame broader investigative narratives about America, and the impact our social, political, and military institutions have upon not only ourselves, but the world.\\"Wiater, Stanley & Bissette, Stephen R.

In 1994, Pekar and Brabner collaborated with artist Frank Stack on the Harvey Award-winning graphic novel, Our Cancer Year. Our Cancer Year was, according to Brabner planned to be a \\"book about activism and cancer and being married and buying a house, about being sick at a time when we feel the whole world is sick.\\" It takes the reader through Pekar's struggles with lymphoma, as well as serving as a social commentary on events of that year, and was, says Brabner, written \\"together from our different points of view, in the different way we experienced Harvey's illness.\\" She and Pekar later published work in Jason Rodriguez's \\"Postcards\\" series,\\"POSTCARDS Production Blog ‚Äì An Anthology From Eximious Press\\" by Jason Rodriguez, July 12, 2006.

Illustrated by Mark Zingarelli and published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, the book was published in 2014 by Hill & Wang. With Pekar, she co- authored and appeared as herself in an opera performed by Real Time Opera in January 2009. The event was broadcast on the Internet from Oberlin College on January 31, 2009. She helped finish and publish two of Pekar's posthumously published works, Harvey Pekar's Cleveland (Zip Comics/Top Shelf 2012) and Not the Israel My Parents Promised Me, (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, July 2014). Also anticipated is another posthumous comic book from Pekar, other autobiography by Brabner, and new work with Danielle Batone.  Awards  In 1995, Brabner and Pekar shared a Harvey Award (named after cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman) for Our Cancer Year. In 2011, Brabner was awarded an Inkpot Award in recognition of her work in comics.Inkpot Award Non-writing In the early 1990s, Brabner and Pekar became guardians of a young girl, Danielle Batone when she was nine years old. Danielle became a recurring character in American Splendor, alongside Pekar's diverse cast of family and friends. Brabner was portrayed by actress Hope Davis in the film adaptation of American Splendor (2003), and also appeared as herself in some scenes. Davis's performance was met with critical acclaim, and she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture.

History Turkey's cooperation with China for the joint development of ballistic missiles began in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The story of Project J, as well as Project Kasƒ±rga which preceded it, goes back to the first half of the 1990s, when negotiations for the technology transfer and production under license in Turkey of the American M-270 MLRS artillery rocket system failed. Turkey decided to seek for other alternatives, mainly focusing on full sovereignty over critical technologies in order to establish a self-sufficient national infrastructure for the design and development of guided missiles. After signing a contract for the licensed production of the Chinese WS-1A and WS-1B rockets under the name of Kasƒ±rga in 1997, a similar contract was signed with CPMIEC (Chinese Precision Machinery Import and Export Corporation) for the Chinese B-611 SRBM system in 1998, covering the licensed production of a battery of B-611 with more than 200 missiles, at a reported cost of USD 300,000,000. The J-600T design is based on the B-611 SRBM developed by CASIC (China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation) as a low cost tactical missile system, with a range of up to 250 km in improved versions such as the B-611M, and as a replacement for the M-11 (CSS-7 and DF-11) missiles in Chinese inventory. CPMIEC officials have confirmed at the IDEF 2007 military fair in Ankara that B-611M, the improved version of B-611, was not a part of the Sino-Turkish cooperation program. Turkey's ROKETSAN has been assigned with the task of improving the range, performance and design of the J-600T, and is conducting studies on alternatives such as a sealed pod launcher box design, improved propellant, improved GCU and different types of warhead configurations. Roketsan is reportedly working on an improved version of J-600T, details of which are highly speculative for the moment. Given that the system was first revealed to the public more than 7 years of its introduction to service, it can be expected that information about the improved version, if there is any, is going to remain secret for some time. Characteristics The Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m system is composed of two units: The J-600T SRBM and the F-600T launcher vehicle, which is based on the MAN 26.372 6x6 truck, manufactured in Turkey. The same vehicle is also used for the Turkish-built T-122 Sakarya and T-300 Kasƒ±rga MBRL (Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher, or MLRS) systems, providing advantage in logistics. Each F-600T carries one J-600T on an open rail-type launcher and can be prepared for launch in less than 25 minutes, with the vehicle ready to move again in less than 5 minutes. The missile is loaded onto the F-600T vehicle by a crane from a reloading vehicle, again a MAN 26.372 6x6 truck. The missile's flight is controlled by an INS (Inertial Navigation System) which feeds trajectory correction command inputs to the four moving wings at the nozzle section. The trajectory data is loaded onto the missile's Guidance & Control Unit (GCU) (FCS) on board the F-600T vehicle before the launch. The FCS in F-600T is also supported by BAIKS (Batarya Atƒ±≈ü ƒ∞dare Komp√ºter Sistemi, eng: Battery Fire Control Computer System) and TOMES (Top√ßu Meteoroloji Sistemi, eng: Artillery Meteorology System). It is reported that the missile can also be upgraded with a GPS/INS GCU. Each J-600T Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m battery consists of: * 1 x Battery Command & Control Vehicle * 2 x Firing Team Command and Control Vehicles * 6 x F-600T Launcher Vehicles * 7 x F-600T Reload - Resupply Vehicles * 1 x Maintenance Vehicle Operation The J-600T has been operational with the Turkish Army since 2001, but it was first revealed to the public six years later, during the Victory Day (Zafer Bayramƒ±) parade in Ankara, on August 30, 2007. The TRT (Turkish Radio and Television Corporation) commentator announced the system as the \\"Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m missile system.\\" During this parade and the following two parades in the same year, both the launchers and the reloading vehicles were displayed to the public. The Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m system was also reported to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms by Turkey in March 2007. Specifications The J-600T Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m, developed and manufactured by ROKETSAN, has two versions that are currently in the inventory of the Turkish Armed Forces: * J-600T Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m I SRBM (150 km range) * J-600T Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m II SRBM (300 km range) Manufacturer: ROKETSAN (Turkey) Launcher vehicle: F-600T (Based on MAN 26.372 6x6) Warhead type: TNT+RDX Fuze: Proximity Guidance: INS Range: 150 km (J-600T Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m I); 300 km (J-600T Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m II); 900 km (J-600T Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m III) Diameter: 600 mm Length: 6.10 m Weight, total: 2,100 kg Weight, warhead: 480 kg Propellant type: HTPB (Composite) CEP: < 150 m (for J-600T Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m I) References and notes * Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems.

It is located in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, France. Courbet painted The Painter's Studio in Ornans, France in 1855. \\"The world comes to be painted at my studio,\\" said Courbet of the Realist work. The figures in the painting are allegorical representations of various influences on Courbet's artistic life. On the left are human figures from all levels of society. In the center, Courbet works on a landscape, while turned away from a nude model who is a symbol of Academic art. On the right are friends and associates of Courbet, mainly elite Parisian society figures, including Charles Baudelaire, Champfleury, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Courbet's most prominent patron, Alfred Bruyas. The 1855 Paris World Fair's jury accepted eleven of Courbet's works for the Exposition Universelle, but The Painter's Studio was not among them. In an act of self promotion and defiance, Courbet, with the help of Alfred Bruyas, opened his own exhibition (The Pavilion of Realism) close to the official exposition; this was a forerunner of the various Salon des Refus√©s. Very little praise was forthcoming, and Eug√®ne Delacroix was one of the few painters who supported the work. Of the painting, Courbet stated that The Painter's Studio \\"represents society at its best, its worst, and its average.\\" Description The painting was produced during Courbet's involvement with Realism in art in the mid-1800s. Due to the short amount of time Courbet had to paint it, many original plans for the work had to be discarded. The most noticeable example of this is in the background of the painting. On the back wall of the studio in the painting, Courbet planned to paint replications of other works of his. He ran out of time to paint these in their entirety, so he then covered them up with a reddish-brown preparation color, leaving the partially-finished paintings still relatively visible.\\"Gustave Courbet (1819‚Äì1877)\\", The Metropolitan Museum of Art, accessed September 18, 2015. =Left side= The left side of the painting depicts people of everyday life in France.\\"Gustave Courbet, The Artist's Studio\\", Mus√©e d'Orsay, accessed September 18, 2015. The Jewish man and the Irishwoman were seen on a trip Courbet took to London in 1848, according to a letter Courbet wrote to Champfleury detailing what the painting would look like. There is also a \\"lay figure\\"/\\"crucified figure\\" directly to the left of Courbet's easel. This figure appears contorted and potentially mangled. Art historians Benedict Nicolson and Georges Riat both interpret this figure as a symbol of the \\"death\\" of the art of the Royal Academy of Art in France. =Center= The center of the painting depicts Courbet painting a landscape, a nude female figure, a young boy, and a white cat. On his canvas, Courbet paints the Loue River valley. This valley in the Franche-Comt√© region of France is a tribute to Courbet's homeland of Ornans, France. The female figure is based on an 1854 photograph by J. V. de Villeneuve and has been interpreted as a representation of the art of the Academy or as Courbet's Muse for Realism. =Right side= The right side of the painting depicts a large number of Paris elites, including friends of the artist. These are figures who played a role in the development of Courbet's career as an artist, or who inspired him in some way. Portrayals included on this side of the painting include Alfred Bruyas (a patron of Courbet), Champfleury, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Charles Baudelaire, and a wealthy pair of art collectors, among other prominent society figures. A majority of these portraits were copied from previous portraits or from photographs, since the painting was entirely made in Ornans but the subjects on this side of the painting resided in Paris. For example, the portrait of Charles Baudelaire was directly copied from Courbet's 1847 portrait of the writer. Courbet was in written correspondence with Champfleury in regards to this painting (from which much of the interpretation of The Painter's Studio is derived) and requested a photograph of Proudhon, the philosopher and anarchist, so that he could be included in the painting. It is the photograph Courbet received from Champfleury on which Proudhon's portrait is based. Interpretations * The meaning of the oxymoron \\"real allegory\\" in the subtitle of the painting, as well as Courbet's intent in conjuring this phrase, is debated. * Courbet chose to paint the Lou√© River Valley on his canvas-within-a-canvas as an act of defiant provincialism. He sought to bring a symbol of his home in the Doubs department of the Franche-Comt√© region of France straight into the heart of Paris and the eyes of Paris' socialite art viewers and collectors. * The skull that rests on a copy of the Journal des d√©bats is a symbol of the death of the art of the Academy. * The cluster of items at the foot of the hunter (on the left), including a guitar, a dagger, a plumed hat, and a buckled shoe, is a symbol of the death of the Romantic art movement. It could be a symbol of the death of Romanticism due to the rising popularity of Realism, or a symbol of the death of Romanticism in Courbet's own oeuvre.

When night came, he saw a light shining and followed it to a hut. An old man lived there and, after the tailor begged, allowed him to stay for the night. In the morning, the tailor awoke to witness a fight between a great stag and a bull. After the stag won, it bounded up to him and carried him off in its antlers. It set him down before a wall of stone and pushed him against a door in it, which then opened. Inside the door, he was told to stand on a stone, which would bring him good fortune. He did so, and it sank down into a great hall, where the voice directed him to look into a glass chest. The chest contained a beautiful maiden, who asked him to open the chest and free her, and he did so. The maiden told him her story: She was the daughter of a rich count, and after the death of her parents, she had been raised by her brother. One day, a traveler stayed the night and used magic to get to her in the night, to ask her to marry him. She found the use of magic repellent and rejected his proposal. In revenge the magician then turned her brother into the stag, imprisoned her in the glass chest (coffin), and enchanted all the lands around them. The tailor and the maiden emerged from the enchanted hall and found that the stag had been transformed back into her brother. The bull he had killed had been the magician. The tailor and the maiden then married.

Early life On May 7, 1872, Frank Frantz was born in Roanoke, Illinois, the son of Henry J. and Maria Frantz. Frantz would be educated in Illinois's public schools and would spend two years attending Eureka College. Following the opening of the Cherokee Strip on September 16, 1893, Frantz and his brothers moved to Medford in Oklahoma Territory. Frantz would later work in California and Arizona Territory for an oil company. In 1898, while in Prescott, the capital of Arizona Territory, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out. On May 1, 1898, at the age of 26, Frantz enlisted in the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, which the American press called the Rough Riders. Upon joining the Rough Riders, Frantz returned to Indian Territory and met the regiment's charismatic second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt. Rough Riders After joining the Rough Riders, Frantz was assigned to A Company and given the rank of First Lieutenant, where he served as the Deputy Commander under Captain William \\"Bucky\\" O'Neill. Traveling to Daiquir√≠, Cuba, the Rough Riders would engage, on June 24, 1898, in the Battle of Las Guasimas, the first clash between American and Spanish forces. Frantz fought valiantly and his performance caught Roosevelt's eye. On June 30, Colonel Leonard Wood, the commander of the Rough Riders, was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. Likewise, Lt. Colonel Roosevelt was promoted to colonel and given command of the Rough Riders. On the following day, the fiercest battle of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War occurred: the Battle of San Juan Hill. Frantz's skill during the battle would forever gain him Roosevelt's friendship and trust. Just before the final assault on the Spanish fortifications, Captain O'Neill was warned about unnecessarily exposing himself to Spanish fire. Even as he was dismissing the danger, O'Neill was instantly killed by a bullet hitting him in the mouth. Frantz immediately took over the command and led the company to a successful charge up Kettle and San Juan Hills. After the battle concluded, in recognition of Frantz's service, Roosevelt promoted Frantz to the rank of captain and commander of A Company of the Rough Riders. On August 12, 1898, an armistice between the United States and Spain ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In the coming months, on December 10, 1898, with the Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico to the United States and Cuba gained its independence. Although Captain Frantz would leave military service behind him, he gained an abiding friendship with Roosevelt. Return to Oklahoma Governorship of Oklahoma Territory. Upon the conclusion of his military service, Captain Frantz returned to Oklahoma Territory and settled in Enid. There with his brother, Montgomery, he opened a hardware and lumber business, Frantz Brothers Hardware and Tin Shop. While in Enid, Frantz met Matilda Evans of Oklahoma City, and married her in March 1901. Their union would produce five children. On June 20, 1900, Frantz was initiated an Entered Apprentice in Enid Lodge No. 80. By December of that same year, he would be passed to the degree of Fellowcraft. However, for reasons that are unknown, it would take a full five years since the month he was initiated to earn the degree of Master Mason (a full-fledged member of Freemasonry) on June 12, 1905. He was also a Knight Templar of the York Rite of Freemasonry, as his Templar sword is currently displayed in the Senate Lounge inside the Oklahoma Capitol building.  Public service  During this time, Roosevelt was elected vice president on the Republican ticket to serve under US President William McKinley. On September 6, 1901, President McKinley was shot at the Pan-American Exposition. McKinley died on September 14, and Roosevelt succeeded him to the presidency. Frantz's wartime association with now President Roosevelt became a lifelong friendship. Frantz would, on several occasions, travel to the White House to spend time with the Commander-in-Chief. On his visits to the White House, Frantz, an athlete and a boxer, engaged in several matches with Roosevelt, knocking him out on three occasions. Immediately, Frantz's friendship with the new president proved beneficial. Frantz, a fellow Republican, was named the postmaster of Enid by President Roosevelt before the end of 1901. Frantz would serve in this post for another two years, when Roosevelt appointed him Indian Agent of the Osage Agency at Pawhuska. Roosevelt again demonstrated his friendship with Frantz by elevating him to the governorship of Oklahoma Territory. Frantz assumed the office on January 5 and would be inaugurated on January 16, 1906, being the seventh and (at age 34) youngest governor to serve in the Territory's history. Governor of Oklahoma Territory William Howard Taft would support Frantz in his bid for Governorship. However, Taft's disapproval of the Oklahoma Constitution cost Frantz the Governorship of Oklahoma.Governor Frantz assumed control of the Territory during a time when the citizens of the Territory were seeking statehood. Thus his Governorship immediately became routine. However, Frantz would do many beneficial things for the would-be state. Governor Frantz made an invaluable contribution to the future of Oklahoma's educational system. Immediately upon coming into office, Governor Frantz discovered that oil companies were drilling on land reserved for public buildings after statehood in Pawnee County without obtaining permission. In response, Frantz crafted a policy requiring those companies to lease the mineral rights to the state. After the United States Congress passage of the Enabling act of 1906, Frantz set his administration into overdrive. Frantz immediately took steps to obtain the remaining amount of land in No Man's Land, what would become the Panhandle of modern Oklahoma. The Governor's agents acquired the entire federal domain within the realm of the state. Frantz leased the land to Oklahoma's farmers, earning the new state millions in revenue. After the proposed Oklahoma Constitution was completed in early 1907, Frantz sought, and won, the Republican nomination to serve as Oklahoma's first governor. To face Frantz, the Democrats selected Charles N. Haskell, one of the proposed Constitution's main authors. Frantz would accept Haskell's challenge to joint public discussions throughout the state, and every problem concerned with the administration of the new state came up and was debated during the campaign. Frantz would lose to Charles N. Haskell in an election to become the first Governor of Oklahoma. During the course of the campaign, two nationally prominent figures spoke at various locations: Republican presidential nominee William Howard Taft and Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan. Though Taft supported Frantz, Taft's disapproval of Oklahoma's proposed constitution and his advice that the people vote against it caused the voters to react in favor of the Democrats. Frantz lost the race to Haskell on September 17, 1907. On the same day, the voters approved the Oklahoma Constitution into law. Soon after, Congress accepted the Constitution and Oklahoma became the 46th State on November 16. Haskell was also inaugurated on that day, resulting in the end of Frantz's term. Later life and death After leaving office, Frantz moved to Denver, Colorado where he resided for six years. In 1915, Frantz returned to Oklahoma to live in Tulsa, becoming the head of the Land Department of the Cosden Oil Company. Frantz then spent time working in the oil royalty business. In 1940 he was elected a director of the Investors Royalty Company. Frantz made an unsuccessful attempt to reenter politics, running to serve as the Congressman representing Oklahoma's First Congressional District in 1932. At the age of 68, overcome with health issues, Frantz lost consciousness on March 8, 1941, in Muskogee, Oklahoma. Frantz was transported to back to Tulsa where, on March 9, 1941, he died in his own home.

Initially called LƒÅwai Garden, the site was renamed in 2000 as a result of a generous donation from the McBryde descendants. Today, McBryde Garden serves as a research and conservation garden. It is home to the largest ex situ collection of native Hawaiian flora in the world, as well as extensive plantings of palms, flowering trees, heliconias, orchids and other plants collected from tropical regions.

In 1994 the company launched the first social-networking software, which included instant messaging, voice over IP (Commonly known as VoIP), chat rooms, web-based events, collaborative browsing. It is best known for the Virtual Places software product and the technology used by Lotus Sametime. It is now part of IBM Haifa Labs.  Technology  = Virtual Places = Ubique's best-known product is Virtual Places, a presence-based chat program in which users explore web sites together. It is used by providers such as VPChat and Digital Space and eventually evolved into Lotus Sametime. Virtual Places requires a server and client software. Users start Virtual Places along with a web browser and sign into the Virtual Places server. Avatars are overlaid onto the web browser and users are able to collaborate with each other while they all visit web sites in real time. Some Virtual Places consumer-oriented communities are still alive on the Web and are using the old version of it. = Instant Messaging and Chat = With the technology developed for Virtual Places, Ubique created an instant messaging and presence technology platform which evolved into Lotus Sametime.  History  1994 ‚Äì Ubique Ltd was founded in Israel by Ehud Shapiro and a group of scientists from the Weizmann Institute to develop real- time, distributed computing products. The company developed a presence-based chat system known as Virtual Places along with real-time instant messaging and presence technology software. These were the very early days of the web, which at the time had only static data. Ubique's mission was \\"to add people to the web\\". 1995 ‚Äì America Online Inc. purchased Ubique with the intention to use Ubique's Virtual Places technology to enhance and expand its existing live online interactive communication for both the AOL consumer online service and the new GNN brand service. Only the GNN-branded Virtual Places product was ever released. 1996 ‚Äì GNN was discontinued in 1996. Ubique's management, with the support of AOL, decided to look for other markets for Virtual Places technology. The outcome was that Ubique shifted Virtual Places from the consumer market to focus on presence technology and instant messaging for the corporate market. AOL divested Ubique but remained as a principal investor while Ubique sought a new owner. 1998 - Ubique was acquired by Lotus/IBM to integrate the core technology of instant messaging and presence functions into a software product integrated with Lotus/IBM. 2000 - Lotus announced Lotus Sametime using Ubique's technology. 2006 - Elements of Ubique along with other Israeli-based companies were integrated into the newly created IBM Haifa Labs. The Lab develops Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) infrastructure and features of real-time collaboration, including session management, presence awareness, subscriptions and notifications, text messaging, developer toolkits, and mobile real-time messaging infrastructure.http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/info/news_ibm_softwarelab.html IBM establishes Software Lab in Israel  References   External links  *IBM Haifa Labs website Category:Instant messaging Category:Software companies of Israel Category:Companies established in 1994 Category:IBM acquisitions ","title":"Ubique (company)"},{"id":"5695506","text":"Charles-Fran√ßois Baillargeon (April 26, 1798 - October 13, 1870) was a Canadian Roman Catholic priest and archbishop.

Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) was a West Bengal state government undertaken transport corporation. Headquartered in Kolkata, it was set up on 31 July 1948. Currently it operates under the name WBTC. It plied buses in Kolkata and nearby districts of West Bengal, along with some long-distance services. CSTC owned 11 depots in Kolkata and the districts to station its fleet of busses.  History  Calcutta State Transport Corporation started its journey on 31 July 1948 as State Transport Services with an objective to provide efficient, adequate, economical and properly coordinated passenger bus service particularly in and around the city of Kolkata and in the state of West Bengal in general. On 15 June 1960 the name of State Transport Service has changed to Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950. By 1966, it had upgraded its services and was connected to 90 percent of the national highways. To fulfill the demand of rural passengers, CSTC introduced one of the earliest Long Distance Bus Services (LDS) from Calcutta to Digha in April 1968. =Merger with WBTC= In 2017, the Department of Transport (West Bengal), under Transport Minister Protik Bhattacharya merged CSTC with other transport providers such as CTC and WBSTC and to form WBTC. Operations =Fleet= With a fleet of 782 buses, CSTC was able to set up a number of bus routes in the southern part of West Bengal which were till then not connected to any other means of transport. CSTC also pioneered the running of air- conditioned Volvo buses in Kolkata, replacing the aging fleet. Air conditioned buses were launched on July 2014 on 40 routes across the city and suburbs. They were in blue and white livery, the buses included a complete fleet of Volvo 8400 units as well as JanBus models from Ashok Leyland, the first low floor front entry public buses in the country.

It plies buses, trams and ferries in the state. It was formed by merging existing state transport agencies, namely the Calcutta State Transport Corporation, the Calcutta Tramways Company and the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation. History Bus services in Kolkata started in the year 1920 but were unorganised. The organized road transport in the public sector was given shape on 31 July 1948 with the creation of State Transport Services under the Directorate of Transportation, Government of West Bengal. It started operations on 6 intracity routes, with a fleet of 25 buses. Diesel era started with the addition of 2 (two) Double Decker buses in 1949‚Äì50. Then the STS became self-sustainable with the establishment of depots and terminals. Gradually the structure of State Transport Services turned into a full-fledged organization with spreading its network of operation throughout the entire city (mainly covering Calcutta Improvement Trust area). After about 12 years, State Transport Services became CSTC (Calcutta State Transport Corporation) on 15 June 1960. This was the start of a new era for the public transport system in the city and state. Up to 1966-67 CSTC nationalized about 90% of the City routes. After that CSTC could not sustain the increased passenger demands in the city mainly due to the financial constraints. Since then the Government decided to allow private buses to operate in CSTC routes and areas. It also started operating on long-distance routes, starting with CalcuttaDigha in 1968. Over the years, with rapid expansions of long-distance operations, CSTC connected remote rural areas of the state with Kolkata. Soon, it covered almost the whole state and connected the district headquarter towns. In the year 1989, a new body was formed, named West Bengal Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited, for the operation of Vessel services. It started with the Ferry Service on the Hoogly and the Muriganga rivers. Later this was merged into West Bengal State Transport Corporation, which provided bus services in Kolkata and different areas of South 24-Parganas, along with the CSTC. In June 2016, WBSTC, CTC and CSTC were merged into one with operational name WBTC. Till the merge, WBSTC had a fleet of 233 (Volvo AC, TATA Marcopolo AC and Non-AC) buses.

Critical reception In a contemporary review, Variety noted \\"a conventional but brisk gangster yarn,\\" concluding that \\"Herbert Lom plays the brains of the crooked organization with urbane villainy and equally reliable John Gregson makes a solid, confident job of the dedicated cop. Alfred Marks is cast offbeat as Lom‚Äôs gangster lieutenant. Marks gives a rich, oily, sinister and yet often amusing portrayal of an ambitious thug who is prepared to turn killer to get his own way. Comparative newcomer, rugged Sean Connery makes a distinct impression as an Irish crook, with an eye for the ladies. Connery combines toughness, charm and Irish blarney.\\" and more recently, AllMovie wrote, \\"The film itself is only of moderate interest, a gangster thriller that's engaging but not special; but the cast makes it worth watching.\\" References External links * * Category:1961 films Category:1961 crime drama films Category:Allied Artists films Category:British crime drama films Category:British films Category:British gangster films Category:Films directed by John Lemont Category:Films set in London Category:British neo-noir films Category:1961 drama films ","title":"The Frightened City"},{"id":"5695607","text":"Halvor N√¶s (born 19 April 1928) is a Norwegian former ski jumper who competed in the 1950s.

Dickson, first published as a serial in Analog in 1970-1971. It is part of Dickson's Childe Cycle series, in which mankind has reached the stars and divided into specialized splinter groups. The fourth book written, it is chronologically the second book of the cycle, occurring roughly a century after Necromancer, and a century before Dorsai!. The primary character, Cletus Grahame, is the ancestor of the key characters in later works: the twins, Ian and Kensie Graeme, and their nephew, Donal Graeme. (The spelling of the last name was changed in intervening generations.) The key theme here is the development of the Dorsai culture, and the creation of the Dorsai military model which makes their soldiers the best among all the settled worlds. It also shows the growth of the separate planetary cultures and their evolution to independence from Earth. Setting In the late 22nd century, humanity has settled fifteen younger worlds around nine stars, including Earth's solar system. Although Old Earth remains populated by the traditional variety of \\"full-spectrum\\" people, the younger worlds have developed \\"splinter\\" cultures, taking very divergent paths and developing specialized cultures. Most notable of these are: the Exotics, philosophers, mystics and psychologists; the Friendlies, puritan faith-holders who supplement the meager production of their rocky worlds by hiring out as mercenaries; and the Dorsai, professional soldiers. It has been less than a century since settlement of the other worlds began, and the younger worlds are still highly dependent on Earth. Two primary factions control Earth, the Western Alliance and the Eastern Coalition. Although they are not openly at war on Earth, they support opposing factions in wars on the other planets. While the Western Alliance provides soldiers to these clients, the Eastern Coalition tends to send advisors, weapons and materials, relying on local soldiers. Readers in the early 1970s could not help but notice the parallel to the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union in general, and the Vietnam War in particular, but that analogy breaks down as the story develops. Plot summary Lieutenant Colonel Cletus Grahame has been an instructor at the Western Alliance military academy since a battle injury crippled one of his knees, and forced his retirement from active duty. He has completed three volumes of a planned twenty-volume series of books on military strategy and tactics, and believes his analysis can revolutionize military science, although many do not take his work seriously. Feeling he needs to get out in the field and try putting his theories into practice, he leaves the academy and arranges to be sent to the world of Kultis, where the Alliance is supporting the Exotic colony of Bakhalla in a war against the neighboring colony of Neuland, backed by the Coalition. The heart of his military strategy, based in part on fencing, is what he labels the \\"tactics of mistake,\\" enticing one's opponent into overreaching, and being ready to take advantage of the mistake. This description is an adaptation of a similar concept in the novel Scaramouche by Rafael Sabatini when the character Moreau studies at the salon of the Master of Arms. On the first night out on the ship to Kultis, he deliberately antagonizes Dow deCastries, Secretary of Outworld Affairs for the Eastern Coalition, forcing deCastries to take notice of him. He also meets Colonel Eachan Khan, an officer of the Dorsai troops who have been hired by the Exotics, and Khan's daughter Melissa. Mondar, an Exotic official, is also present, and takes notice of Grahame. Putting his theories to work, Grahame repeatedly entices deCastries and the Neulanders into attempting incursions, where he is ready to pounce on them. Finally, after conveniently getting his own uncooperative commander out of the way, he entices them to launch a major invasion. Using the Dorsai troops, who had been underestimated and little-used by the Alliance command, he actually wins the war, handing deCastries a humiliating defeat. His victory has actually made him rather unpopular with his own command. Mondar, using the Exotic science of ontogenetics, recognizes him as a key mover of history, and tries to recruit him to join the Exotics, but he chooses instead to emigrate to the Dorsai, in order to begin building them into the kind of military force he envisions. It seems he possesses some of the advanced mental abilities of the Exotics, and with their help, he is able to heal his crippled knee. Melissa wants her father to return to Earth, and the General's rank he had enjoyed in the Western Alliance, and to do so, she needs the influence of deCastries. Grahame forces Melissa to marry him to prevent Eachan's departure, as he feels Eachan is necessary to his plans. Over the course of years, Grahame builds the Dorsai into the unique fighting force that becomes so famous in later years. With their advanced training and superior tactics, they can defeat larger forces and suffer far fewer casualties than any others, making them far more economical for other worlds to hire. Gradually, they reach a status where other worlds no longer need to depend on Earth for fighting forces to protect them, threatening Earth's control of the younger worlds through its system of client states. To prevent this loss of position, the two Earth factions, the Western Alliance and Eastern Coalition, unite their forces under deCastries, and attempt to stretch the Dorsai forces so thin that they will be conquered. When Earth invades the Dorsai, there are no soldiers to defend it, but deCastries underestimates the power of the Dorsai people themselves. The final result leads to a totally new balance of power among the settled worlds. (The actual battle for the Dorsai itself is given little coverage in this book. The ultimate battle for Foralie district, Grahame's home, ends up being between deCastries and Amanda Morgan, a woman in her late nineties who leads the home defense. In the novella, \\"Amanda Morgan\\", she is used as the ultimate example of the spirit of Dorsai.) Reception Algis Budrys gave the novel a mixed review, saying that although \\"there is no denying the power of this kind of storytelling, for all that logical analysis yields some stuff that can sound either ludicrous or gamy.\\"\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, September 1971, pp.146-47 Characters  *Cletus Grahame, a Lieutenant Colonel of the Western Alliance *Eachan Khan a Colonel of the Dorsai, formerly a General in the Eastern Coalition *Melissa Khan Grahame Eachan's daughter, later Cletus' wife *Mondar an Exotic from Kultis *Dow deCastries Secretary of Outworld Affairs for the Eastern Coalition References Sources    External links  * Category:1971 American novels Category:1971 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels by Gordon R.

Throughout his career, he played for several clubs in Italy, and also spent short spells at many top Italian clubs. At international level, he represented the Italy national under-21 football team. A highly skilful and creative playmaker, with an eye for goal, he was regarded as one of Italy's most promising players in his youth, but he failed to live up to his potential in his later career. Club career =Early years and emergence with Atalanta= Born in Pescina, Abruzzo, after joining the Atalanta B.C. youth academy in 1988, at the age of 14, Morfeo enjoyed a highly successful youth career with the Bergamo primavera squad, under manager Cesare Prandelli, winning the Campionato Allievi in 1992, and later the Trofeo Dossena, the Campionato Nazionale Primavera, and the Torneo di Viareggio in 1993, establishing himself as one of Italy's most promising under-21 players. Morfeo subsequently began his professional career when he was promoted to the Atalanta B.C. senior side, making his Serie A debut with the club later that year, at the age of 17, on 19 December, in a 2‚Äì1 home win over Genoa. he scored his first two goals for the club after coming on as a substitute against Lecce, helping Atalanta to come back from behind to earn a 3‚Äì3 draw; he finished the 1993‚Äì94 season with 9 appearances and 3 goals. After helping Atalanta to gain Serie A promotion during the 1994‚Äì95 Serie B season under manager Emiliano Mondonico, Morfeo soon came to prominence with the club during the 1995‚Äì96 season alongside Christian Vieri, scoring 11 goals in 30 league appearances, at the age of 19. The following season, he scored less frequently, managing only five goals, but provided several assists for his new attacking partner Filippo Inzaghi; together, they formed a formidable offensive partnership, and Inzaghi finished the season as the league's top-scorer. =Fiorentina and loan struggles= Morfeo's precocious performances led to a move to Fiorentina in 1997, for an undisclosed fee. During his time in Florence, despite the presence of the attacking trio of Manuel Rui Costa, Gabriel Batistuta and Lu√≠s Oliveira on the team, he initially managed to find space in the starting eleven under manager Alberto Malesani, although following the arrival of Edmundo, he later struggled to find playing time; in spite of the competition for a starting spot, he still managed 5 goals in 26 appearances for the club, and also provided several assists for his teammates throughout the season. After failing to appear in Fiorentina's opening five league matches under new manager Giovanni Trapattoni the following season, Morfeo was sent on loan to Italian giants Milan in 1998, who had been impressed by the youngster's performances the previous season; however, his time at the Milanese club was largely unsuccessful, as several injuries and disagreements with manager Alberto Zaccheroni limited his playing time, and he only managed to obtain eleven appearances, mostly as a substitute, scoring one goal. Furthermore, Milan's rigorous use of the 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 system and subsequent switch to a 3‚Äì4‚Äì3 formation, neither of which featured an attacking midfielder, meant that Morfeo was often forced to play out of position as a winger, where he was not as effective or influential to the team's attacking play; as a result, he was often benched. Despite his mixed success throughout the season, he still managed to win his only professional trophy with the club that year, as Milan finished the 1998‚Äì99 season by claiming the Serie A title. Due to his subsidiary role in Milan's title victory, his loan was not renewed the following season, and Fiorentina instead loaned him out to Cagliari. Morfeo's first half of the season was largely unsuccessful, as he managed only one goal in five appearances due to injury; in January 2000, he moved on loan to Verona, where he was reunited with his former Atalanta youth coach, Prandelli. In the second half of the 1999‚Äì2000 season, despite another injury, his performances improved drastically, and he scored five goals in ten appearances playing as a second striker, as well as providing several decisive assists, which ultimately helped Verona avoid relegation. After being sidelined through injury for the first half of the 2000‚Äì01 season with Fiorentina, Morfeo briefly returned to Atalanta on loan the following January; during this time, however, he struggled with injuries and due to his character, and ultimately failed to consistently replicate the quality performances he had managed during his first spell with Atalanta, despite some promising performances, and a respectable tally of five goals in 17 appearances. After Fiorentina's financial difficulties had forced the club to sell several key players, Morfeo returned to the side for the 2001‚Äì02 season, and was now expected to be a central figure for the club; however, Fiorentina endured a difficult season, which ultimately ended with relegation to Serie B and bankruptcy, while Morfeo was limited to just two goals in 18 appearances, once again due to injury troubles. =Inter, Parma, and later career= The following season, Morfeo was signed by Inter on a free transfer; however, he once again struggled at the club, due to several clashes with teammates, and manager H√©ctor C√∫per, who frequently deployed Morfeo on the wing, and was eventually benched. Inter narrowly missed out on the 2002‚Äì03 Serie A title, and also reached the Champions League semi-finals, while Morfeo only scored one goal in 17 appearances. Morfeo later spent five seasons with Parma, from 2003 to 2008, where he was initially once again re-united with Prandelli, whose decision to field the playmaker in his favoured number 10 role was met with notable success and a great improvement in form. In later seasons, however, Morfeo once again clashed with his managers, and was often left out of the starting eleven; in total, Morfeo managed 16 goals in 101 Serie A appearances for the Emilian side. At the age of 32, he then agreed to start the 2008‚Äì09 season with Serie B club Brescia Calcio, but in October 2008 he ultimately decided to retire from football citing lack of motivation, and did not appear for the club in league, making his only appearance for Brescia in the Coppa Italia. In January 2009 he stepped back on his decision and returned to play football for the second half of the season with Cremonese, in the lower divisions, where he was re-united with coach Mondonico once again. Following a lengthy ban, he fully retired from football in February 2011, after a season with San Benedetto dei Marsi in the Seconda Categoria division. In total he scored 56 goals in 300 professional appearances throughout his career, scoring 54 goals in Serie A; 14 of these were scored from outside the area, with 8 of them coming from free-kicks, while only three were scored with his head, and ten with his right foot. International career Morfeo was never capped by the Italy national football team at senior level, although in February 1996, he was called up by Arrigo Sacchi along with several other young, promising Italian players to an Italy training camp. Between 1991 and 1992, Morfeo represented the Italy Under-15 and Under-16 side, collecting 7 appearances and scoring two goals for the team. In 1993, he was called up to the Italy Under-18 side, with which he scored six goals in as many appearances. At Under-21 level, he was first called up under Cesare Maldini in 1995, and he was later one of the key players in Italy's victorious 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship campaign, scoring the decisive penalty in the final shoot-out victory against Spain, after coming on as a substitute for Francesco Totti in the second half; that same year, he represented the youth side at the 1996 Olympics. In total, he managed 7 appearances with the under-21 side between 1995 and 1997, scoring 1 goal for the Azzurrini. Style of play Although Morfeo usually played as an attacking midfielder, he was often not deployed in his normal position at the beginning of his career, due to the prevalence of the 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation; he was therefore capable of playing in several midfield and attacking positions, and could also play as a left winger, as a second striker, or even as a deep-lying playmaker. A talented, diminutive, and creative player, with good feet, a slender physique, and an eye for goal, he was capable of both setting-up goals and scoring them himself with his excellent left foot, which initially earned him comparisons with his idol Roberto Baggio, as well as Gianni Rivera, and in particular Diego Maradona, leading him to be nicknamed Maradonino. Although he was not a particularly prolific player, he possessed an accurate and powerful shot from outside the area, and was also an accurate free-kick taker. Gifted with an intuitive capacity to interpret the game, Morfeo was known above all for his creativity, technical skills, vision, passing, and playmaking ability, as well as his adeptness at making attacking runs into the area, which made both him a dangerous attacking threat and an excellent assist provider. A quick and skilful dribbler, he was also known for his excellent technique, close control, and ability to dribble with his head up when in possession of the ball. In addition to his footballing skills, he was known for his confident and extroverted personality; however, he also had a difficult character, which led him to be involved in several conflicts with his managers. He was also notorious for his lack of notable pace or tactical discipline, and his arrogance and poor work-rate on the pitch, as well as his inconsistency and proneness to injury; as a result, he struggled to stand out in larger teams, in which he faced more competition for a starting spot, and which did not allow him to be deployed in his favoured role as a classic number 10. In his youth, he was considered by several pundits to be one of the most promising and precociously talented players ever to come out of Italy in recent years; however, despite his ability, he never realised his full potential. After retirement Morfeo currently runs a restaurant in Parma, where he resides with his family. Personal life Domenico's brother, Mario, was also a footballer.

Biography Kephart was born in East Salem, Pennsylvania, and raised in Iowa. He was the director of the St. Louis Mercantile Library in St. Louis, Missouri from 1890 to 1903. In these years Kephart also wrote about camping and hunting trips. Earlier, Kephart had also worked as a librarian at Yale University and spent significant time in Italy as an employee of a wealthy American book collector. In 1904, Kephart's family (wife Laura and their six children) moved to Ithaca, New York, without him, but Laura and Horace never divorced or legally separated. Horace Kephart found his way to western North Carolina, where he lived in the Hazel Creek section of what would later become the Great Smoky Mountains National Park: > I took a topographic map and picked out on it, by means of the contour lines > and the blank space showing no settlement, what seemed to be the wildest > part of these regions; and there I went. Later in life Kephart campaigned for the establishment of a national park in the Great Smoky Mountains with photographer and friend George Masa, and lived long enough to know that the park would be created. He was later named one of the fathers of the national park. He also helped plot the route of the Appalachian Trail through the Smokies.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6759/is_30/ai_n28413324/ Horace Kephart and Thomas Wolfe's \\"abomination,\\" Look Homeward, Angel, Thomas Wolfe Review - 2006 Kephart died in a car accident in 1931, and was buried near Bryson City, North Carolina, a small town near the area he wrote about in Our Southern Highlanders.

The Mountain Heritage Center and Special Collections at Hunter Library, Western Carolina University have created a digitized online exhibit called \\"Revealing an Enigma\\" that focuses on Horace Kephart's life and works. This exhibit contains documents and artifacts (photos and maps) that can be browsed or searched. Ken Burns' multi-part documentary, The National Parks: America's Best Idea, features Horace Kephart in the fourth episode (1920‚Äì1933), which was initially broadcast on September 30, 2009. Kephart is a character in Ron Rash's novel Serena, as well as Walt Larimore's novels, Hazel Creek and Sugar Fork. Writings Kephart in camp in the Smokies He wrote of his experiences in a series of articles in the magazine Field and Stream. These articles were collected into his first book, Camping and Woodcraft, which was first published in 1906. While mostly a manual of living outdoors, Kephart interspersed his philosophy: He also published some more books of the same theme such as Camp Cookery (1910) and Sporting Firearms (1912). In addition, he wrote The Hunting Rifle section of Guns, Ammunition and Tackle (New York: Macmillan, 1904), a volume of Caspar Whitney's prestigious American Sportsman's Library. Combining his own experience and observations with other written studies, Kephart wrote a study of Appalachian lifestyles and culture called Our Southern Highlanders, published in 1913 and expanded in 1922. He wrote a short history of the Cherokee and other books which became standards in the field. Kephart completed a typescript for a novel in 1929. However, the book was not edited and published until 2009, when it was published under the title Smoky Mountain Magic by Great Smoky Mountains Association.

A young Robert Mitchum has a small, uncredited role as a gangster posing as an insurance salesman. Plot Dancing instructors Laurel and Hardy accept a phoney insurance deal from two gangsters posing as insurance salesman. At the same time, Grant Lawrence, a young inventor is working on creating a new invisible ray machine that will revolutionize jungle warfare for World War II. Trudy Harlan, Grant's lover and one of Stan's dancing pupils, invites Grant and the boys to her house for tea when her parents are away. Trudy's father Wentworth Harlan almost discovers Stan and Ollie when he returns home but finds Grant and angrily confronts him. Grant is ordered to leave and never talk to Trudy again, whilst the boys narrowly escape being found by Trudy's parents once again. The next morning, Stan and Ollie are confronted by their angry landlord Mr. Featherstone to pay the rent on their dancing school by twelve noon that day or else face eviction. When Ollie declares that he has not got the money to the pay the rent, Stan suggests paying the rent with Ollie's nest-egg money. Although he initially refuses, Ollie eventually gives in and reluctantly decides to draw the money out of the bank. On their way to pay the rent, however, the boys become sidetracked by an auction that they are passing. In a situation reminiscent of Thicker Than Water, the boys keep bidding against each other for an antique grandfather clock, which they were merely initially wanting to purchase for a lady who had left her money at home. While crossing the street with the clock, Stan trips and his hat falls off. The boys lay the clock down in the middle of the street while Stan retrieves his hat, but the clock is destroyed by a passing truck. Back home, Stan and Ollie decide to help Grant promote his invisible ray gun, by means of Stan posing as the inventor, an eccentric foreign scientist, and with Grant later revealing himself as the real inventor. Although the demonstration is a success at first, Stan forgets to turn the machine off after firing it and it explodes. Grant is dismayed at the destruction of his invention, but the demonstration has earned him the approval and respect of Mr. Harlan. In desperate need of money, Ollie decides to inflict a series of accidents upon Stan (using the fake insurance document) in hopes of raising money, but these events backfire and Ollie ends up receiving the intended consequence. Meanwhile, Mr. Harlan disapproves of his friend George Worthing (whom he had at first hoped to marry Trudy) attempting to steal Grant's invention and orders him to leave their home. He also decides to finance Grant's inventions following the demonstration of the invisible ray gun, much to the delight of Trudy and Grant. Ollie decides to cause Stan to have another accident after hearing from a hospital patient who had gained insurance money after standing up on a roller-coaster and suffering an injury. Stan and Ollie board a bus to the beach, but the bus driver and passengers flee from the bus mid-journey after a cake-eating (and apparently rabid) dog frightens them away. Stan manages to escape from the bus just outside a coastal amusement park and becomes the victim of a coconut-throwing amusement game. However, Ollie has had his foot caught and is stuck at the top of the bus as it careers onto a roller-coaster track. Ollie rides the bus along the roller-coaster track (whilst Stan gets pelted with coconuts) before it careers off the track just before a sharp turn. With his leg broken as a result of the bus accident, Ollie ends up in hospital and is visited by Trudy, Grant and Stan. In the film's final moment, Ollie states that his foot has gone to sleep. Stan asks in a whisper if there is anything he can do to make Ollie comfortable. When Ollie asks Stan why he is whispering, Stan answers, \\"I didn't want to wake your foot up.\\" Cast References External links  * Category:1943 films Category:Laurel and Hardy (film series) Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Malcolm St. Clair Category:1943 comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films scored by Arthur Lange ","title":"The Dancing Masters"},{"id":"5695719","text":"Arzum Onan (born October 31 1973) is a Turkish actress, former model and Miss Europe 1993.

This scene, along with the death of Prince Andrei Nikolaeitch Bolkonski is one of the most famous (and shocking) in classical Russian literature. Reception George R. Clay asserts that Tolstoy's \\"choice of fifteen-year old Petya Rostov as the one through whom to dramatize Moscow's response to the arrival of Emperor Alexander is masterful for the number of effects it accomplishes simultaneously\\".George R.

He has worked with politicians, political organisations, activist groups and members of the public in Europe, US, Brazil, Israel, Japan, Russia and South Africa as a political and organisational consultant. Clinically, Samuels has developed a blend of Jungian and post-Jungian, relational psychoanalytic and humanistic approaches. Career Andrew Samuels began his career running a commune-style radical theatre company in the late 1960s and early 1970s, directing plays in and around Oxford. At the age of 22 he declined an offer to become the assistant director at the Royal Shakespeare Company and instead went on to develop a drama and youth counselling project in South Wales, working with deprived children. He then gained a Diploma in Social Administration at the London School of Economics, subsequently qualified as a psychiatric social worker and went on to train at the Society of Analytical Psychology (founded in 1946 in London to develop the ideas of Carl Jung, and a member institution of the British Psychoanalytic Council), where he is a training analyst. He co- founded Psychotherapists and Counsellors for Social Responsibility which was formed in 1995 as an independent organisation that emerged from the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy. It was founded by a group of therapists and analysts from disparate theoretical backgrounds (psychoanalytical, Jungian and Humanistic) who wished to use the insights gained in the consulting room and elsewhere by taking them into the outside world to influence political and public discourse. Considering the sometimes enormous interdisciplinary divides, it sought to bridge these divisions. The organisation deliberately included psychoanalysts, psychotherapists and counsellors under one roof, something never previously attempted. He co-founded \\"Antidote\\": a psychotherapy-based think tank which, supported by a number of New Labour luminaries, launched its manifesto for an \\"Emotionally Literate Society\\" at the Houses of Parliament. He is also a founding member of the International Association for Jungian Studies, a learned society formed in 2002 for Jungian scholars and clinicians. Samuels and Renos Papadopoulos were among the first professors of Analytical psychology in the world (the first being David H. Rosen at Texas A&M; University in 1986). They are the co-founders of the Masters in Jungian and Post-Jungian Studies at the Centre for Psychoanalytic Studies at the University of Essex, UK. The ethos of the course is to take an informative, critical and reflective stance in relation to the core concepts of Analytical psychology as developed by Carl Jung, post-Jungians of all schools and scholars in academic disciplines. This is balanced with an emphasis on clinical theory as well as on applications of Analytical psychology in areas such as cultural and gender studies, social and political theory, philosophy and religion. In 2006, he was elected one of the first group of six honorary fellows of the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP). In 2009, he was elected chair of the UKCP. He is Professor of Analytical Psychology at Essex, Visiting Professor of Psychoanalytic Studies at Goldsmiths, Honorary Professor of Psychology and Therapeutic Studies at Roehampton and Visiting Adjunct Professor at the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis.New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis Books Samuels' books include Jung and the Post-Jungians (1985), The Father (1986), A Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis (1986, with Bani Shorter and Alfred Plaut), The Plural Psyche (1989), Psychopathology: Contemporary Jungian Perspectives (1992), The Political Psyche (1993) and Politics on the Couch: Citizenship and the Internal Life (2001).

The song was written by Lou Reed, the band's leader, who continued to incorporate the piece into live performances as a solo artist. When Loaded was originally released in 1970, the song's bridge was cut. The box set Peel Slowly and See and reissue Loaded: Fully Loaded Edition restored the missing section. The song also appears on the albums Live at Max's Kansas City; 1969: The Velvet Underground Live; Peel Slowly and See; Live MCMXCIII; Loaded: Fully Loaded Edition; American Poet; Rock 'n' Roll Animal; Live: Take No Prisoners; Live in Italy; The Concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Rock and Roll: an Introduction to The Velvet Underground; NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967‚Äì2003); Live on Letterman: Music from The Late Show; and Berlin: Live At St. Ann's Warehouse. History There are two distinct versions of \\"Sweet Jane\\" with minor variations, spread over its first four releases. The first release of the song in November 1970 was a version recorded earlier that year and included on Loaded. In May 1972, a live version recorded in August 1970 appeared on the Velvet Underground's Live at Max's Kansas City; this had an additional bridge that was missing from the Loaded release. In February 1974, a live version recorded in December 1973 (similar to the Loaded version but with extended \\"intro\\" and hard rock sound), appeared on Reed's Rock 'n' Roll Animal. The elaborate twin guitar \\"intro\\" on the Rock 'n' Roll Animal version was written by Steve Hunter and played by Hunter and Dick Wagner, two Detroit guitarists who would go on to play with Alice Cooper. In September 1974, a down-tempo live version recorded in late 1969 was included on 1969: The Velvet Underground Live, with a different song structure and lyrics. When a restored version of the original release on Loaded was eventually unveiled on Peel Slowly and See in 1995 (and in 1997 on Loaded: Fully Loaded Edition), it turned out that some of the 1969 lyrics (notably the entire bridge as heard on Live at Max's Kansas City) had originally been included in the Loaded version as well, but were scrapped in the final mix. In a 2005 interview, former Velvet Underground member Doug Yule stated that the main signature \\"riff\\" of the song (as it appears on Loaded) was finalized in the studio just before the tracks were recorded, and it was achieved by Lou Reed's playing \\"cranked-up very loud\\" through a large Sunn amplifier. In addition to recording the bass track, the drums on the recording were performed by Doug Yule because Velvet drummer Maureen Tucker was pregnant at the time and not present during the Loaded sessions. Lou Reed performed \\"Sweet Jane\\" in two keys. The 1969 and 1970 versions were in D as was 1972's American Poet version. On 1973's Rock 'n' Roll Animal and 1978's Take No Prisoners, the song is in E, and on 1984's Live in Italy, the song is back in D.

According to its mission statement, CSER was a research consultation devoted \\"to the study of religion and ethics from the standpoint of philosophical naturalism and to the critical, nonparochial, and humanistic study of religious truth claims.\\" The committee professed to serve both a \\"watchdog\\" function in relation to church- state and educational issues, and the academic community through generating original research and promoting religious literacy. The CSER was disbanded in 2010. CSER was described as a nonprofit educational organization which \\"locates its values in the humanistic principles of the American and European Enlightenment and the liberal critical traditions of post-Enlightenment culture.\\" The committee consisted of approximately one hundred elected fellows chosen from academe and the professions. Past fellows included Van Harvey, Joseph L. Blau, Carol Meyers, Morton Smith, Karen Armstrong, Vern Bullough, Joseph Fletcher, Lewis Feuer, Theodor Gaster, Gerd Luedemann, Antony Flew, John Hick, David Noel Freedman, John Dominic Crossan, Alan Ryan, Don Cupitt, Margaret Chatterjee, Richard Taylor, Susan Blackmore, Robert Carroll, Arthur Peacocke, Clinton Bennett and Peter Atkins. History The committee was formed in 1985 as an expansion of the Religion and Biblical Criticism Research Project founded by Free Inquiry magazine in 1982. The former group promoted a number of projects that scrutinized conservative and fundamentalist religious beliefs and institutions. The two men primarily responsible for organizing this group were the philosopher Paul Kurtz and the professor of archaeology and Biblical history at the University of Southern California Gerald A. Larue. One early project of this group was a national conference in Washington, DC. The conference, sponsored by the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (CODESH), was in response to President Ronald Reagan‚Äôs signing of the Congressional Resolution J-5018, which declared 1983 the \\"Year of the Bible.\\" The conference included presentations by academics, politicians, and religious leaders who were concerned that the passage of the Resolution constituted a violation of the constitutional protection of freedom of conscience in religious matters and a circumvention of the principle of separation of church and state, as defined in the First Amendment. The participants included Senators Sam Ervin (D-North Carolina), Lowell Weicker (R-Connecticut), Professor James Robinson, Henry Steele Commager, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Michael Novak, Paul Kurtz, and Gerald A. Larue. The founding members of CSER represented a wide variety of secular and religious viewpoints. Its \\"manifesto\\" was crafted in broadly humanistic language which pointed to public ignorance of Constitutional axioms, deficiencies in the public understanding of religion, science, and political history, and particular weaknesses in the American educational system in teaching about religion. Since 1983, CSER's conferences have presented religious studies scholarship to the public as well as to the academic community. The committee has widened its scope and membership base through the years to reflect its interest in the critical examination of religious traditions in a global context. CSER has sponsored educational programs and conferences in America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Larue was elected the first Chair of CSER in 1983. R. Joseph Hoffmann (History of Religion, Center for Inquiry, Amherst, NY), formerly chair of the Oxford Centre for Critical Studies in Religion was elected CSER Chairperson in 2003. The committee published its own monograph series and a journal, CSER Quarterly.

The Raymond Revuebar (1958‚Äì2004) was a theatre and strip club at 11 Walker's Court (now the location of The Box Soho nightclub), in the centre of London's Soho district. For many years, it was the only venue in London that offered full-frontal, on-stage nudity of the sort commonly seen in other cities in Europe and North America. Its huge brightly lit sign declaring it to be the \\"World Centre of Erotic Entertainment\\" made the Revuebar a local landmark. In 1980, the Boulevard Theatre section of the venue was hired by comic actor Peter Richardson to stage his alternative comedy revue, The Comic Strip. This attracted a younger punk audience to the venue. In 1989, the Boulevard became Eddie Izzard's stand-up venue. In the 1990s, the Revuebar struggled, with its dated image and competition from newer venues such as Spearmint Rhino and Stringfellow's. The name and leasehold was bought by G√©rard Simi in 1997. The Revuebar closed on 10 June 2004 and became a gay bar and cabaret venue called Too2Much, designed by Anarchitect. In November 2006, it changed its name to Soho Revue Bar and was the home of club nights and special events. On 29 January 2009, the Soho Revue Bar closed, reopening in February 2011 as The Box Soho, billed as \\"A theatre of varieties\\", under the ownership of Simon Hammerstein. History The Raymond Revuebar was the creation of Paul Raymond. The theatre was formerly the Doric Ballroom. When it opened on 21 April 1958 it offered traditional burlesque-style entertainment, which included strip tease, and was popular with leading entertainment figures of the day.Paul Willetts \\"Why Paul Raymond, the porn king of Soho, was a hero\\", Daily Telegraph, 1 September 2010 The Revuebar was one of the few legal venues in London to show full frontal nudity; by turning itself into a members only club it was able to evade the strictures of the Lord Chamberlain's Office which then barred models from moving. Even though homosexual acts between men were illegal at that time, the Revuebar also incorporated a Sunday night show aimed at a gay audience. By 1967, the venue was purely hosting striptease. This would, in turn, make way for glitzy, big budget erotic shows of the type presented by Continental clubs such as the Crazy Horse. Performers were mostly female, with a small number of male dancers. Shows involved a mixture of solo striptease acts mixed with simulated boy/girl and girl/girl sex. These were packaged together as a show known as The Festival of Erotica which ran for many years, with as many as three performances nightly. In 1980 Peter Richardson, with assistance from Michael White acquired the use of the Revuebar's second venue, the Boulevard Theatre as a new venue for Richardson's own comedy club. Richardson called it The Comic Strip, bringing with him a core group from The Comedy Store, including Peter Richardson, Nigel Planer, Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders and Alexei Sayle. It opened in October 1980 and ran until 1981. In 1989, the Boulevard Theatre was also home to Eddie Izzard's stand-up venue, Raging Bull. During the 1990s, audiences dwindled. Competing table dancing clubs such as Spearmint Rhino and Stringfellow's began to attract customers, and Soho was becoming more of a venue for gay nightlife the Revuebar was seeming outdated. The name and control of the theatre (but crucially, not the property itself) was bought by G√©rard Simi in 1997MegaStar: Home who reconfigured the show as a more conventional striptease revue. Gradually the theatre's fortunes waned, with Simi citing rising rent demands from Raymond as the cause.Erotic show choreographer Gerard Simi In 2004 the Revuebar went into administration. It closed on 10 June 2004 and became a gay bar and cabaret venue called Too2Much, designed by Anarchitect. In November 2006, it changed its name to Soho Revue Bar, where it was the home of popular club nights including Trannyshack and hosted frequent special events including the West End Gala performance of the musical Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens on 1 December 2008. On 29 January 2009, the Soho Revue Bar closed. The venue reopened on 8 January 2011, with a new name and new management, and a complete decor/equipment refurbishment/upgrade.

Beliefs and practices Members of the sect believed that by the year 2000 the world would come to an end. Their goal was to establish a commune of chosen people. As a symbol of their new life they took new names and destroyed their identity documents. Total submission to Kacmajor was required. Members married each other, refused to send children to public school (as Kacmajor stated, \\"in chemistry class they teach that you can't turn water into wine, in physics class they teach that you can't walk on water\\") and refused to take any medical treatment (Kacmajor was convinced that he can heal even AIDS). Niebo gathered approximately 50 members. Decline Because of their total social alienation the group soon started to have troubles with the law. Reports of kidnapping and children being kept prisoner started circulating. The Catholic Church and several church-related movements started a campaign against the community which resulted in bad fame and financial problems.

The original painting hangs in the Forbes Library in Northampton, Massachusetts. The Angel of Hadley is the central character in a possibly apocryphal tale combining the execution of Charles I in England, King Philip's War and Hadley, Massachusetts. According to the tale General William Goffe, who was wanted for his role in the regicide, was hiding in Hadley when it was attacked by Indians in 1675 or 1676. Goffe, by then an aging figure, is said to have come out of his hiding to lead the local residents in the successful defense of their community against the attack. The story contains many kernels of truth, although some appear to have been deliberately obscured by chroniclers of the time (notably Increase Mather) in order to protect Goffe. There is strong evidence that he was in Hadley at the times of various attacks on Hadley, and many of the political and military leaders involved, as well as chroniclers of the time, knew of his presence and sympathized with his plight. There are inconsistent accounts about which attack he would have been involved in, and uncertainty about the location of troops that are conventionally claimed to have fought off the attackers. The legend King Philip's War broke out in southern New England in 1675 following disputes between Metacom, the leader of the Wampanoag tribe, who was also called King Philip, and the English colonies. The war raged across southern New England in 1675, and numerous English frontier towns were attacked. According to the legend, one such attack was made against Hadley, Massachusetts, most commonly described as occurring on September 1, 1675. With all hope seemingly lost, a white-bearded man with a powerful bearing and wielding an old sword suddenly appeared. He organized the town militia before leading them to victory against the more numerous natives. He then disappeared. Factual background =William Goffe= William Goffe was a Parliamentarian military officer during the English Civil War of the 1640s. He was one of 59 signatories to the death warrant of King Charles I in 1649, and continued to play an influential role in the English government during The Protectorate rule of Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s. In 1660 Charles II was restored to the throne. Although many opponents of crown rule were granted amnesty, the regicides were specifically excluded. Goffe and his father-in-law Edward Whalley, another regicide, fled to New England. They were well known to Increase Mather and Daniel Gookin among others, and were able to move freely in Boston until it was known that Charles II was likely to order their arrest. Goffe and Whalley fled to the New Haven Colony, where John Davenport, a sympathetic minister, sheltered them for a time, and the political leadership disclaimed knowledge of their whereabouts. It is likely that Davenport connected them with John Russell, the minister at Hadley, Massachusetts, where the two men eventually settled into a highly secluded life. Only a small number of people are believed to have known where they were. Goffe was able to exchange letters with his wife in England through the mediation of Increase Mather, an influential Boston minister, and Daniel Gookin, a political leader in the Massachusetts government, is known to have overseen some of their financial affairs. Edward Whalley is believed to have died in roughly 1675; Goffe reported that he had suffered a stroke and was not in good condition. Goffe is assumed to have been in Hadley during some of the attacks made on the town during the war; however, by the later months of 1676 letters he sent indicated that he had relocated to the Hartford, Connecticut area, where he is assumed to have died some years later. =Military movements= There were two supposed attacks on Hadley that have been connected to the legend. The first occurred on September 1, 1675, and the second on June 12, 1676. Increase Mather, who wrote one of the first accounts of the war, described the September 1 event as an \\"alarm\\", implying that there was no actual attack, merely an urgent notice that an attack had taken place somewhere nearby. He gave a slightly more detailed account of the June 12 action, in which he implied (but did not explicitly state) that militia troops from Connecticut who had been stationed nearby were instrumental in fending off the Indian attack. There is some uncertainty about where the Connecticut troops were on the day of the attack. They had been sent north as part of a planned sweep of the Connecticut River valley, to be performed in conjunction with Massachusetts troops that were en route from the east. They were known to have arrived at Hadley a few days before June 12, but there is significant evidence that on the day of the attack they were across the river in Northampton. Potential coverup A significant number of people involved in the events surrounding the June 12 action, and the later reporting of it, had knowledge of Goffe's presence in Hadley. Major John Talcott, who led the Connecticut forces, was a brother-in-law of John Russell, who was sheltering them. The governor of Massachusetts was John Leverett, who had served in the Parliamentary Army during the civil war, and is known to have visited Hadley during the time Goffe and Whalley were there. Increase Mather, as one of the intermediaries handling their letters, wrote one of the most important early accounts of the war. The political leaders of the Connecticut Colony at the time were Robert Treat and William Leete, who had been leaders in the New Haven Colony when Goffe and Whalley passed through there. Historian Douglas Wilson suggests that at least some of these people, all of whom were sympathetic to Goffe, may have acted, either independently or in concert, to cover up any role Goffe may have had in the June 12 action. There are no significant records of the action in surviving Massachusetts and Connecticut records. Wilson notes that there is a letter, discovered in 1870, from John Russell to Increase Mather, dated 1677, after Mather's publication of his history. Russell wrote \\"I find nothing considerable mistaken in your history. That which I most fear in the matter is lest Mr. B or some of Connecticut should clash with ours and contradict each other in the story as to matter of fact.\\" Wilson concludes that \\"Mr. B\\" was probably Gershom Bulkeley, a political opponent of the Puritans who was part of Talcott's force. Historiography and influences on fiction The first publication of the angel tale was apparently in the late 18th century by Thomas Hutchinson in his History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in which he describes the tale as having originated with John Leverett's family. Subsequent historians picked up and elaborated on the story. Later in the 19th-century historians began to examine the story more critically, with George Sheldon specifically debunking it in 1874. Because of the inconsistencies raised by Sheldon, many 20th- century historians have accepted that the tale does not describe an event that actually happened, and it has been widely propagated as not having occurred. Douglas Wilson carefully reassessed the available evidence, concluding in his 1987 paper on the matter that it might have taken place, and that the event, and Goffe's involvement in it, were covered up by Goffe's protectors. The legend furnished ideas used by Sir Walter Scott in Peveril of the Peak and by James Fenimore Cooper in The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish. It is also a likely source for \\"The Grey Champion\\", a Nathaniel Hawthorne short story that features an elderly Puritan man who brandishes a sword in defense of his people. Jack Dunn wrote The Diary of General William Goffe published in 1982 which was syndicated in The Valley Advocate in weekly installments as \\"The Angel of Hadley\\".

Founded in 1887 by James William Cannon, by 1914 the company was the largest towel and sheets manufacturer in the world.Kannopolis, the town that towels built by Mary Newson, 10 May 2016 Cannon remained family-owned until 1982 when it was sold to Fieldcrest, becoming \\"Fieldcrest-Cannon\\". The recently formed company was sold to Pillowtex Corporation in 1997, which went into bankruptcy in July 2003. The remaining Cannon brands were then purchased by the Iconix Brand Group.Canon brand on Iconix Brands, 17 Aug 2020 History = Early years and development = In 1887 James William Cannon founded the Cannon Manufacturing Company in Kannapolis, North Carolina. His goal was to produce a basic textile product instead of yarn making or a product in which another company could produce. His company produced towels that were sold under the brand name \\"Cannon Towels\\". Ten years later, he opened another mill in Concord, North Carolina. James W. Cannon, founder In 1905, Jim Cannon designed and purchased of land in northwestern Cabarrus County, North Carolina. The land was formerly used as a cotton plantation. He laid out a plan for a small mill village with homes for the workers. By 1907, the first mill was completed just west of what was Town Lake. The mill, known now as Plant 1, was opened in 1908 after a brief two-year cotton shortage. By January of the next year, the Cannon Manufacturing Company had employed 840 people in its single Kannapolis plant. James William Cannon and his company built hundreds of homes for the mill workers, and also a world-class YMCA facility. At that time, it had the largest membership in the world. He also donated land and money for school construction and education. That year, the first school, McIver was opened. Cannon erected stores, businesses, and churches. Cannon also donated funds to the Cabarrus County Government to improve the main road leading to Kannapolis from Concord. In 1917, James Cannon arranged a life insurance policy for all Cannon employees. This had never yet been done for employees of a company. 1921 was an important year for the Cannon Mills Company. A strike occurred in the localized Charlotte, North Carolina area, affecting all textile mills in this area. Charles A. Cannon was already in charge of Cannon Mills affairs, since his father was trying to recuperate from ill health. On June 1, 1921, the members of the United Textile Workers Union of America went on strike. Although Cannon called the National Guard to \\"keep the peace,\\" the strike ended because union official left town. Cannon Mills did not unionize during this attempt, which left the whole World War I generation skeptical of labor unions. J.W. Cannon was recently elected as Chairman of the Board and his son, Charles Albert, was made president of the Company. Later that year, Jim Cannon developed an unknown illness in the winter of 1921 and died on December 21, 1921. He was buried at Oakwood Cemetery in downtown Concord. The Cannon Manufacturing Company was left to its president and the youngest son, Charles. By the time of J.W. Cannon's death, the population of Kannapolis was roughly 6,000 citizens and the mill had employed about 15,000 workers. = Golden years = Postcard depicting the Cannon Mills headquarters in North Carolina, c. 1930‚Äì45 With Charles Albert Cannon in charge, the Cannon Mills Corporation entered its golden years. In 1924, funds and land for James William Cannon High School were donated by the company. Later in 1928, Charles Cannon organized nine textile companies into a large corporation, Cannon Mills. 300,000 towels were produced each day, and it soon became the world's largest producer of textile products. Cannon retired in 1962 at the age of seventy and was replaced as president by Donnell S Holt, moving up to chairman of the board. Sales and profit continued to rise. The one-million-square-foot towel distribution center was built in 1962 and the sheet distribution center was constructed in the early 1970s. Cannon died on April 1, 1971 of a massive stroke. Holt remained president until 1974, helping modernize the management style and fighting hard to combat negative public images of Cannon Mills. = Fieldcrest spun off by Marshall Field's = In 1911, Marshall Field & Company, the Chicago department store, acquired seven mills in Eden, North Carolina (then known as Leaksville, Spray & Draper) from Benjamin Franklin Mebane, a local entrepreneur who had secured financing from Field's. In 1916, Field's began construction on Fieldcrest Mills in Fieldale, a mill town near Martinsville, Virginia, which was completed in 1919. Field's later purchased more mills to supply its retail and wholesale operation. In 1935, company chairman James O. McKinsey reorganized the firm's 24 textile mills into one manufacturing operation, called Fieldcrest, with headquarters in New York City. In 1953, Fieldcrest was spun off from Field's into a freestanding business. = Acquisition by Fieldcrest = In 1982, California billionaire David H. Murdock purchased the Cannon Mills Company and its of surrounding property. Murdock proposed a redevelopment plan to the company and the community which included the renewal of downtown Kannapolis (now Cannon Village) and the construction of a brand new YMCA. On November 6, 1984, the Town of Kannapolis was officially incorporated, becoming the city of Kannapolis. Also that year the new YMCA opened. The next year, the company and all of its Bath and Bedding division were bought by Eden, North Carolina- founded Fieldcrest Mills, Incorporated, for somewhat less than $250,000,000. This became the Fieldcrest-Cannon Corporation. The newer smokestack of Plant One, painted white since its construction in 1950, was repainted maroon, also bearing the corporate name. In September, 1997, Fieldcrest-Cannon was sold to the Pillowtex Corporation for $700,000,000.  Legacy  The Cannon family donated funds for projects in the area.

It is considered a mild variant of Roquefort. The cheese has a fat content of 45% and is aged for 3‚Äì6 months in Gorges du Tarn's natural limestone caves. The ripening process involving naturally temperature-controlled cellars is the major element that gives it its special aroma. History The Bleu des Causses shares an ancient history with the Roquefort, in a time where the cheese was made from mixed milk from a cow and a sheep, or pure milk from one or the other, based on the season and the cheesemaker. =Ancient Times= The traditional cheese making of Gaul was celebrated by Pliny the Elder. For him, among the traditional cheese making for quality, the grazing had a major importance. He mentioned, in the 11th tome of his \\"Natural History\\", the cheeses of Mont Loz√®re and G√©vaudan, but said nothing about their color or texture. =Middle Ages= An anecdote from Knotker the Stammer is often said to prove Charlemagne ate blue cheese, but in fact shows him cutting off the crust of the cheese, as for a white-rind cheese like Brie or Camembert. \\"15. In the same journey too he came to a bishop who lived in a place through which he must needs pass. Now on that day, being the sixth day of the week, he was not willing to eat the flesh of beast or bird; and the bishop, being by reason of the nature of the place unable to procure fish upon the sudden, ordered some excellent cheese, rich and creamy, to be placed before him. And the most self-restrained Charles, with the readiness which he showed everywhere and on all occasions, spared the blushes of the bishop and required no better fare: but taking up his knife cut off the skin, which he thought unsavoury, and fell to on the white of the cheese. Thereupon the bishop, who was standing near like a servant, drew closer and said, \\"Why do you do that, lord emperor? You are throwing away the very best part.\\" Then Charles, who deceived no one, and did not believe that anyone would deceive him, on the persuasion of the bishop put a piece of the skin in his mouth, and slowly ate it and swallowed it like butter.Early Lives of Charlemagne by Eginhard and The Monk of Saint Gall, ed. A. J. Grant, London: Morling 1905, p. 79\\" =Contemporary Period= Many artisanal cheese cellars refine cow's milk, sheep's milk, or even a mixture of both. It is sold without a provincial name. In 1925, during the administrative recognition of the original name of Roquefort, the cheese must be refined to Roquefort-sur-Soulzon and cheeses from cow's milk is banned. Because of this, producers of cheese from cow's milk begin to structure their organizations. The collective mark \\"Valmont\\" was created to support the sales of the cheese \\"bleu de l'Aveyron\\". The final name \\"Bleu des Causses\\" was decided on by two decrees in 1941 and 1946. The union constitution dated July 1948 and the delimitation of the geographical area in 1953. Official recognition of the AOC dated June 8, 1949. In 1992, the union building opened their doors to cow breeders; they added to dairies and refineries. Area of Development =Geographical Area= The geographical area of the production of the milk and the development of the cheese covers a valley region, limestone or schist plateaus, and, to a lesser extent, some mountains.

In the department of Gard, only the town of Tr√®ves and in the department of H√©rault, only the town of P√©gairolles-de-l'Escalette benefit from the classification of the boundaries. In fact, only the Aveyron and Loz√®ze parties produce cheese. The refining fourmes is much more restrictive. It concerns some regions of the district of Millau: Campagnac, Cornus, Millau-Ouest, Millau-Est, Peyreleau, Saint-Affrique, and at the towns of Tr√®ves and of P√©gairolles-de-l'Escalette. =Geology and Climatology= The terroir includes, among others, land caussenardes who gave their name to this cheese. These are characterized by a limestone subsoil drainage, causing drought when rain are scarce. Rich soil is low, giving short and bushy vegetation. However, this naturally sparse vegetation is aromatic and contributes to the flavor of the milk. The refining zone has vertical limestone cliffs carved by the erosion of the rivers Tarn, Doubie, and Jonte. Over the centuries, some rockslides have created caves ventilated by fleurines, cracks in the rock allowing the circulation of air. It is the biggest of these caves that ripening cellars were built. They have a very stable humidity and temperature, favorable to the development of blue mold. =Milk Production= It is not specified what kind of milk is needed or the feeding conditions of the animal. As long as the animal is free of brucellosis and tuberculosis. =The Manufacturing and Ripening of Cheese= Cheese making can be done in all of the defined area. Cow's milk, specifically, is whole and full of rennet. The operation takes place with hot milk (30 to 33 ¬∞C) at the same time as the seeding of spores from the Penicillium roqueforti mushroom, the mold responsible for the blue forms. These spores are from selected strains in the refining area. Under the action of the rennet, the milk coagulates. The curd is then sliced and then brewed. The grains are then become rounded and let out the whey. Draining can then be done on perforated molds. It is promoted by inverting the cheese. At demolding, the cheese is salted with dry salt (not soaking in brine). Work at the dairy then completes and the cheeses are shipped to the maturing cellar. Upon arriving at the maturing cellar, the cheeses are then brushed or washed and wiped. They are then perforated: this operation promotes internal ventilation of the cheese and allows harmonious development of mold. The cheese is then stored on racks in cellars naturally temperature controlled by fleurine. Between production and refinement, preparation should take at least 70 days. Before selling, refrigeration is not part of the refinement.

[ Eddie Boyd: Biography]. AllMusic. Retrieved October 13, 2016. was an American blues pianist, singer and songwriter, best known for his recordings in the early 1950s, including the number one R&B; chart hit \\"Five Long Years\\". Life and career Boyd was born either on Stovall's Plantation, near Clarksdale, Mississippi, or on Frank Moore's Plantation, near Stovall, Mississippi. He learned to play the guitar and the piano. His piano playing was influenced by the styles of Roosevelt Sykes and Leroy Carr. Boyd moved to the Beale Street district of Memphis, Tennessee, in 1936, where he played with his group, the Dixie Rhythm Boys. He then joined the Great Migration of African Americans north to the factories of Chicago in 1941. He recorded for Bluebird Records, accompanying such musicians as Sonny Boy Williamson, Jazz Gillum, Muddy Waters, and Tampa Red, before making his first recordings under his own name, in 1947. He decided to produce his own recordings, and took two demos to Joe Brown at J.O.B. Records, who agreed to re-record the tracks. In May 1952 he recorded \\"Five Long Years\\", which became a huge hit, topping the Billboard R&B; chart for seven weeks late in the year. He signed with Parrot Records, which then sold his contract to Chess Records. Boyd had two further hits for Chess in 1953, \\"24 Hours\\" and \\"Third Degree\\" (co-written by Willie Dixon), both of which reached number three on the R&B; chart. He went on to record for a series of smaller labels in the 1950s, but an automobile accident in 1957 in which he was injured put his career on hold for a while. Boyd toured Europe with Buddy Guy's band in 1965 as part of the American Folk Blues Festival. He later toured and recorded with Fleetwood Mac and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Unhappy with the racial discrimination faced in the United States, Boyd moved to Belgium, where he recorded with the Dutch band Cuby and the Blizzards. He moved again, in 1970, to Helsinki, Finland, where he continued to perform and recorded ten blues records, the first being Praise to Helsinki (1970). He married his wife, Leila, in 1977. Boyd died in 1994 in Helsinki. A few months later, Eric Clapton's chart-topping blues album From the Cradle, which includes interpretations of Boyd's \\"Five Long Years\\" and \\"Third Degree\\", was released. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Eddie Boyd among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

The term \\"New Negro\\" was made popular by Alain LeRoy Locke in his anthology The New Negro. Definition Historically, the term is present in African American discourses since 1895, but is most recognized as a central term of the Harlem Renaissance (1917-1928). The term has a broad relevance to the period in U.S. history known as the Post-Reconstruction, whose beginnings were marked symbolically by the notorious compromise of 1877 and whose impact upon black American lives culminated in the 1896 Supreme Court decision, Plessy v. Ferguson, which practically obliterated the gains African Americans had made through the 14th and 15th Amendments. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who in 1988 provided a comprehensive treatment of this evolution from 1895 to 1925, notes that \\"blacks regained a public voice, louder and more strident than it had been even during slavery.\\" More recently, Gates and Gene Andrew Jarrett have discussed a New Negro era of a longer duration, from 1892 through 1938, and Brent Hayes Edwards has pushed investigations of New Negro culture far beyond Harlem, noting that \\"the 'New Negro' movement [was] at the same time a 'new' black internationalism.\\" This internationalism developed in relation to informal cultural exchange among black figures in the United States, France, and the Caribbean. New Negro cultural internationalism also grew out of New Negro work in the United States's official international diplomacy.  Between 1919 to 1925  With the end of the First World War and the rise of the Harlem Renaissance, the term \\"New Negro\\" was widely publicized as a synonym for African Americans who will radically defend their interests against violence and inequality. An article in The Messenger journal published in August 1920, entitled \\"The New Negro - What Is He?\\" by The Editors, provides a clear picture of the term, in which they describe that the \\"New Negro\\" will be radical and self-defending to pursue the right to political and social equality, unlike the gentleness of the Old Negro who is satisfied with the status quo. Subsequently, in 1925, Alain Locke published the article \\"Enter the New Negro\\" and defined \\"New Negro\\" as \\"augury of a new democracy in American culture.\\" Locke took the term to a new level. Locke described the negative impression of blacks on their racial values in long-term repression of a racist society and how it also made African Americans distort their social status, and that they all needed to take a new attitude to look at themselves. He pointed out that the thinking new Blacks committed to combat stereotypes, awaken black national consciousness and pride, as well as improve the social status of African Americans.  Origins of the Term  =1895= 1895 was a crucial year. Du Bois, with a PhD from Harvard in hand, embarked on his long career in scholarship and civil rights, Booker T. Washington made his Atlanta Exposition speech and Frederick Douglass died after having made some of the bitterest and most despairing speeches on \\"race.\\" Despite their rhetorical and ideological differences, these three leaders were speaking up during the 1890s, the decade described by African American historian Rayford Logan as the \\"nadir\\" of African American history and marked by nearly 2,000 documented lynchings. New Negroes were seen invariably as men and women (but mostly men) of middle-class orientation who often demanded their legal rights as citizens, but almost always wanted to craft new images that would subvert and challenge old stereotypes. This can be seen in the 1895 editorial in the Cleveland Gazette and commentaries in other black newspapers. Books like A New Negro for a New Century (1900) edited by Booker T. Washington, Fannie Barrier Williams and N. B. Wood or William Johnson' The New Negro (1916), represent the concept. =The First World War= For African Americans, World War I highlighted the widening gap between U.S. rhetoric regarding \\"the war to make the world safe for democracy\\" and the reality of disenfranchised and exploited black farmers in the South or the poor and alienated residents of the Northern slums. African-American soldiers faced discrimination because the US government conceded that it would not admit African American soldiers to white training camps. To help these discriminated African American soldiers, the NAACP helped establish segregated training camps in Des Moines, Iowa, and Spingarn. However, the treatment of African American soldiers was still deplorable, and most of them were assigned to labor units after the basic training. However, in France, for example, the black soldiers experienced the kind of freedom they had never known in the U.S. When World War I began, African Americans wanted to demonstrate their patriotism to the country. However, they were turned away from the military service because the military only accepted a certain amount of African Americans. It wasn't until the war had actually started, that the military realized more people were needed, so African Americans were being drafted and accepted into the military. This was seen as a start for the \\"New Negro\\" to show that they are wanting to be equal and they are willing to go to war to prove that they are worthy enough to be equal like everyone else in the country. African Americans dealt with discrimination in the military and was segregated from the white people and went to different training locations. The military created two different divisions solely for African Americans, which were the 92nd division and the 93rd division. The 92nd division was made of the officers and draftees. The 93rd division's helped out the French Army during the war and had a different experience than the 92nd division. The 93rd division had the most famous infantry which was the 369th Infantry and they were known as the \\"Harlem Hellfighters.\\" The 369th Infantry repelled the German offensive and fought alongside with the 16th Division of the French Army. They fought for 191 days, which was the longest and were the first Americans to be awarded the Croix de Guerre medal by France. After the war ended, racial tensions began to boil over in the United States. Having experienced freedom and respect in France they had never known at home, African American soldiers were determined to fight for equal treatment but found that discrimination against blacks was just as present as it was before the war. A prime, but not isolated, example of this lingering racism is the case of African American soldier Wilbur Little. He was lynched in Blakely, Georgia upon his return from service after ignoring threats from a group of white men to never wear his uniform in public. In addition to this racially motivated violence there were African Americans flooding into the north in huge numbers, increasing segregation in the North and the regeneration of the Ku Klux Klan, all of which contributed to the rising racial tension which resulted in the riots that affected several major cities in the \\"red summer\\" of 1919. Because of the discrimination witnessed after World War I, the philosophy of the civil rights movement shifted from the accommodationist approach of Booker T. Washington to the militant advocacy of W.E.B. Du Bois. This shift of philosophy helped to create the New Negro Movement of the 1920s, which \\"promoted a renewed sense of racial pride, cultural self-expression, economic independence, and progressive politics.\\" For many African Americans, World War I represents a transition from the time of the \\"Old Negro to the breve New Negro.\\" =New Negro Movement= In 1916‚Äì17, Hubert Harrison founded the New Negro Movement. In 1917, he established the first organization (The Liberty League) and the first newspaper (The Voice) of the \\"New Negro Movement\\" and this movement energized Harlem and beyond with its race-conscious and class-conscious demands for political equality, an end to segregation and lynching as well as calls for armed self-defense when appropriate. Therefore, Harrison, who also edited The New Negro in 1919 and authored When Africa Awakes: The 'Inside Story' of the Stirrings and Strivings of the New Negro in the Western World in 1920, is called the \\"father of Harlem Radicalism.\\"Jeffrey B. Perry, \\"Hubert Harrison: The Voice of Harlem Radicalism, 1883-1918,\\" Vol. 1 (New York: Columbia University Press, November, 2008). The NAACP played an important role in the awakening of the Negro Renaissance which was the cultural component of the New Negro Movement. The NAACP officials W.E.B. Du Bois, James Weldon Johnson, Walter White, and Jessie Redmon Fauset provided financial support, aesthetic guidance, and literature to this cultural awakening. According to the NAACP, this cultural component of the New Negro Movement provided the first display of African-American cultural self-expression. In several essays included in the anthology The New Negro (1925), which grew out of the 1924 special issue of Survey Graphic on Harlem, editor Alain Locke contrasted the \\"Old Negro\\" with the \\"New Negro\\" by stressing African American assertiveness and self- confidence during the years following World War I and the Great Migration. Race pride had already been part of literary and political self-expression among African Americans in the nineteenth century, as reflected in the writings of Martin Delany, Bishop Henry Turner, Frances E.W. Harper, Frederick Douglass and Pauline Hopkins. However, it found a new purpose and definition in the journalism, fiction, poetry, music, sculpture and paintings of a host of figures associated with the Harlem Renaissance. The term \\"New Negro\\" inspired a wide variety of responses from its diverse participants and promoters. A militant African American editor indicated in 1920 how this \\"new line of thought, a new method of approach\\" included the possibility that \\"the intrinsic standard of Beauty and aesthetics does not rest in the white race\\" and that \\"a new racial love, respect and consciousness may be created.\\" It was felt that African Americans were poised to assert their own agency in culture and politics instead of just remaining a \\"problem\\" or \\"formula\\" for others to debate about. The New Negroes of the 1920s, the Talented Tenth, included poets, novelists and Blues singers creating their art out of Negro folk heritage and history; black political leaders fighting against corruption and for expanded opportunities for African Americans; businessmen working toward the possibilities of a \\"black metropolis\\" and Garveyites dreaming of a homeland in Africa. All of them shared in their desire to shed the image of servility and inferiority of the shuffling \\"Old Negro\\" and achieve a new image of pride and dignity. =Alain Locke= No one has articulated the hopes and possibilities associated with the idea and ideal of the \\"New Negro\\" more than the Harvard-trained philosophy professor Alain Locke, who later described himself as the \\"midwife\\" to aspiring young black writers of the 1920s. According to Locke, The New Negro, whose publication by Albert and Charles Boni in December 1925 symbolizes the culmination of the first stage of the New Negro Renaissance in literature, was put together \\"to document the New Negro culturally and socially - to register the transformations of the inner and outer life of the Negro in America that have so significantly taken place in the last few years.\\" The anthology had already sold 42,000 copies in its earlier incarnation as the March 1925 special Harlem issue on Harlem of the Survey Graphic magazine, a record unsurpassed by the Survey until World War II. Highlighting its national and international scope, Locke compared the New Negro movement with the \\"nascent movements of folk expression and self- determination\\" that were taking place \\"in India, in China, in Egypt, Ireland, Russia, Bohemia, Palestine and Mexico.\\" Locke's philosophy of cultural pluralism is analogous to the thinking of many of his white contemporaries, especially cultural pluralists such as Waldo Frank, V. F. Calverton, Randolph Bourne and Van Wyck Brooks. Sharing the optimism of other progressive reformers, Locke recognized that \\"the conditions that are molding a New Negro are [also] molding a new American attitude.\\" He defined as the creed of his own generation its belief in \\"the efficacy of collective effort, in race co- operation.\\" In Alain Locke's anthology The New Negro, of one of the main reoccurring themes is a distinction between the \\"New World\\" and the \\"Old World.\\" Locke points out \\"Harlem's significance\\" along with explaining what it stood for by saying that, \\"it's a racial awakening on a national and perhaps even a world scale\\". Locke wanted to document what was going on in the mind of African Americans. Locke had an idea to redo the \\"New Negro\\" and this is something he promotes throughout his writing. Locke had an idea of the \\"internal vs the external negro\\". He brought up points about how African Americans have always been generalized and wanted to represent more voices from within the community. The outer life with the racial standards. Locke acknowledged that some progress had been made for African Americans politically, land owning and slavery etc. Locke really wanted to document the uplift. Internally wanted to shift from the past slave movement more towards the psychology behind it all. Locke's explanation of the \\"New Negro\\" gives one a deep understanding of the term and meaning, especially during the period of the Harlem Renaissance. Holmes, Eugene C. \\"Alain Locke and the New Negro Movement.\\" Negro American Literature Forum, vol. 2, no. 3, 1968, pp. 60‚Äì68. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3041375. Like the black political leaders of the period, Locke seems to have believed that the American system would ultimately work for African Americans, but he refused to take cognizance of the disagreeable political leverage the system called for. Such an approach implied an excessive dependence of any black hopes for political change or reform upon white men of influence and their good intentions. In terms of art and literature, Locke saw no conflict between being \\"American\\" and being \\"Negro,\\" but rather an opportunity to enrich both through cultural reciprocity. In a way, Locke was reinterpreting Du Bois' \\"double consciousness\\" concept for aesthetic and cultural uses. It seems there was enough room in Locke's view for many different kinds of talents to exist and thrive together. Locke also did not see any direct connection between African arts that had influenced the works of many European artists such as Picasso. For him, the most important lesson the black artist could derive from African art was \\"not cultural inspiration or technical innovations, but the lesson of a classic background, the lesson of discipline, of style, of technical control.\\" As W. E. B. Du Bois himself recognized in his response to Locke's New Negro, the concept validated at one level the rejection of the accommodationist politics and ideology represented by Booker T. Washington and his followers around the start of the 20th century when despite Washington's access to the White House and mainstream politicians, violence against African Americans had continued unabated at a disturbing level with little progress in the area of civil rights and economic opportunities.  Different points of view  At the same time, there were also voices of doubt and scepticism. Eric D. Walrond, \\"the young West Indian writer of \\"Tropic Death\\" (1926), found all contemporary black leaders inadequate or ineffective in dealing with the cultural and political aspirations of black masses.\\" In 1923, in his essay The New Negro Faces America, he declared the New Negro to be \\"race-conscious. He does not want . . . to be like the white man. He is coming to realize the great possibilities within himself. The New Negro, who does not want to go back to Africa, is fondly cherishing an ideal ‚Äì and that is, that the time will come when America will look upon the Negro not as a savage with an inferior mentality, but as a civilized man.\\" According to Walrond, the \\"rank and file of Negroes are opposed to Garveyism; dissatisfied with the personal vituperation and morbid satire of Mr. Du Bois and prone to discount Major [Robert] Moton's Tuskegee as a monument of respectable reaction.\\" By 1929, Wallace Thurman, the bohemian and brilliant leader of young writers associated with the \\"Niggerati Manor\\" as well as journals such as Fire!! and Harlem, referred to the New Negro phenomenon as a \\"white American fad that had already come and gone\\". In several pieces of journalism and literary essays, Thurman castigated the kind of interest both whites and black middle-class readers invested in the work of younger black writers, making it harder for them to think and create independently. In one such essay, The Negro Literary Renaissance which was included in \\"Aunt Hagar's Children\\", Thurman sums up the situation thus: \\"Everyone was having a grand time. The millennium was about to dawn. The second emancipation seemed inevitable. Then the excitement began to die down and Negroes as well as whites began to take stock of that in which they had reveled. The whites shrugged their shoulders and began seeking for some new fad. Negroes stood by, a little subdued, a little surprised, torn between being proud that certain of their group had achieved distinction, and being angry because a few of them arrived ones had ceased to be what the group considered 'constructive,' having in the interim, produced works that went against the grain, in that they did not wholly qualify to the adjective 'respectable.'\\" Again in 1929, Thurman had begun his second novel, \\"Infants of the Spring\\" (1932), a satire in which he took himself and his peers to task for decadence and lack of discipline, declaring all his contemporaries except Jean Toomer as mere journeymen. And while he admired Alain Locke for his sympathy and support for the young Negro writers, the salon scene in chapter 21 signals Locke's failure at organizing the highly individualistic young writers into a cohesive movement. Beyond the lack of consensus on the significance of the term \\"New Negro\\" during the Harlem Renaissance, many later commentators such as Harold Cruse considered it politically naive or overly optimistic. As late as 1938, Locke was defending his views against attacks from John P. Davis and others that his emphasis was primarily on the \\"psychology of the masses\\" and not on offering a solution to the \\"Negro problem.\\" In dismissing the construction of the New Negro as a dubious venture in renaming, as merely a \\"bold and audacious act of language,\\" Gates confirms Gilbert Osofsky's earlier criticism that the New Negroes of the 1920s helped to support new white stereotypes of black life, different from, but no more valid or accurate than the old ones. Legacy During the Harlem Renaissance, the term ‚ÄúNew Negro‚Äù carried on a legacy of motivation and ambition to African Americans, to help them pursue greater things, things that were at one point were strongly discouraged to the African American community. The term was also significant for defining black leadership in creative, intellectual, and political pursuits in the U.S. as well as on a global scale. The middle-class leadership of NAACP and Urban League were deeply suspicious of the flamboyant and demagogic Marcus Garvey, who in turn saw Du Bois and others as dark- skinned whites. Yet all of them subscribed to some form of Pan-Africanism. Alain Locke and Charles S. Johnson rejected cultural separatism and endorsed a hybridity derived from the marriage of black experience and Euro-American aesthetic forms. In filmmaking. during the early 20th Century, it was very rare to see African Americans playing movie cast members, and if they were, they were generally portrayed to represent the Old South and/or were criminals. During the middle of the century, the film industry began opening up more opportunities to African Americans. They were able to play a more diverse set of roles and began participating in several different genres. In the political scene, between 1901 and 1928, there had been no African Americans elected to the United States House of Representatives. In 1929, this streak was broken when Oscar Stanton De Priest was elected to represent the State of Illinois in the House. However, he did not only represent his state, but the African American overcoming of oppression and their regained power in politics. After the New Negro movement, the mean time African American representative served in office increased from a measly two years to six. In education, Howard University called the post New Negro movement ‚Äúthe capstone of Negro education‚Äù. In the early 1930s, historically black Howard University began receiving federal grant money for the first time in an amount that exceeded $1 million. In addition, Howard University was the first university ever to receive more than $1 million for a science facility. Footnotes Further reading * Davarian L.

It is composed of nine dioceses and one missionary district, each headed by a bishop, among whom one is elected as the Primate of Brazil. The current Primate is Francisco de Assis da Silva, from the South-West Diocese, elected in 2013. IEAB is the oldest non-Roman Catholic church in Brazil,Calvani, Carlos Eduardo. \\"Anglicanismo no Brasil\\". Revista USP. S√£o Paulo: n.67, p. 36-47, setembro/novembro 2005. P√°gina visitada em 6 de julho de 2015. originating from the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation signed in 1810 between Portugal and the United Kingdom which allowed the Church of England to establish chapels in the former Portuguese colony. In 1890 American missionaries from the Episcopal Church established themselves in the country aiming to create a national church; unlike the English chapels, they celebrated services in Portuguese and converted Brazilians. The Anglican community of Brazil was a missionary district of the Episcopal Church until 1965, when it gained its ecclesiastical independence and became a separate province of the Anglican Communion. Twenty years later, IEAB began to ordain women. It preaches a social gospel, being known for its commitment to fight against problems that affect vast portions of the Brazilian society, such as social inequality, land concentration, domestic violence, racism, homophobia and xenophobia. Its stance as an Inclusive Church has caused both schisms and the arrival of former Roman Catholics and Evangelicals in search of acceptance. History \\"Anglicanism\\", as a distinctive Christian tradition, began to develop from 1534 when Henry VIII of England, driven by political and personal concerns, proclaimed the independence of the Church of England from the Holy See, rejecting papal authority. The church considers itself a continuation of the primitive church, since it has not rejected the Catholic and Apostolic faith. Anglicanism soon spread to the British colonies in the New World. In Brazil, however, the official religion imposed by the Portuguese settlers was the Roman Catholicism and the early attempts by Protestant missionaries ‚Äì French Huguenots and Dutch Calvinists ‚Äì failed.Kickhofel, Oswaldo. \\"Apontamentos de Hist√≥ria da Igreja Episcopal Anglicana do Brasil\\". Centro de Estudos Anglicanos. The first Anglican to set foot in Brazil was Henry Martin in 1805. His ship made a stop in Salvador on its route to India. He remained in the city for two weeks and communicated with Roman Catholic priests in French and Latin. He wrote the following about his impressions of the country: \\"What happy missionary shall be sent to bear the name of Christ to these western regions? When shall this beautiful country be delivered from idolatry and spurious Christianity? Crosses there are in abundance, but when shall the doctrine of the Cross be held up?\\"Smith, George. Henry Martyn Saint and Scholar: First Modern Missionary to the Mohammedans, 1781-1812. Library of Alexandria. . In 1810, Portugal and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which allowed the Church of England to build chapels in Brazil. These were the first non-Roman Catholic chapels in the country, intended exclusively for the attendance of Anglo-Brazilians. Nevertheless, under the terms of the treaty, these chapels could not resemble religious temples and its Masses could only be celebrated in English. The first Anglican Mass was celebrated later that year. In 1819, the first Anglican chapel, Christ Church, was established in Rio de Janeiro. According to Silva, the early Anglican community did not oppose the status quo; he points out that some Anglicans owned slaves, despite the Church of England's opposition to the slave trade. After the Independence, the first missionary activity began. In 1853, William Cooper was sent to Brazil at the request of an Episcopalian from Rio de Janeiro, probably a member of the American colony. Nevertheless, his ship sunk at the Caribbean Sea and he returned to the United States. In 1860 a Scottish priest, the Reverend Richard Holden, landed in Bel√©m. He was also sent by the Episcopal Church to do missionary work. Holden conducted the most successful mission, remaining in the country for 12 years. He chose Bel√©m as his work post due to the existence of a Bibles distribution station in the city and his expectation that the Amazon River would be open to international navigation. In Bel√©m, he tried to create an Anglican community, but was not successful. He used the local media to spread the church, writing newspaper articles that provoked the wrath of the Roman Catholic bishop, Ant√¥nio de Macedo Costa. Holden was responsible for the first Portuguese translation of the Book of Common Prayer; he also wrote a dozen hymns ‚Äî two of them featured in the 1962 hymnal. He traveled the tributary rivers of the Amazon to sell Bibles in riverside communities. In 1862, he moved to Salvador, where he also tried to spread Anglicanism through the press. His articles encountered strong opposition and he survived three assassination attempts. His strong personality and controversial preaching style also provoked opposition from the Episcopal Church, which had sponsored his trip to Brazil (although it was also in disarray due to the American Ciuil War and defeated Confederates would soon arrive in Brazil with their slaves). In 1864, Rev. Holden accepted the invitation of Presbyterian Robert Kalley to become a minister in the Fluminense Congregational Church in Rio de Janeiro. He later abandoned Anglicanism and became a Dispensationalist. Anglican missions in Brazil began to flourish after 1889, when the Republic was proclaimed and the country became officially secular; this decriminalized the conversion of Roman Catholics to Anglicanism and other churches and religions. In 1890, the priests Lucien Lee Kinsolving and James Watson Morris were sent to Brazil from the Virginia Theological Seminary. They established themselves in a rented house later known as the \\"Mission House\\" (Casa da Miss√£o) in Porto Alegre, where they held the first Anglican Mass in Portuguese on 1 June 1890. Three other American missionaries followed in 1891: Rev. William Cabell Brown (who would leave in 1914 to become bishop in his native Virginia, but after completing translations of the Bible and Book of Common Prayer), Rev. John Gaw Meem and lay woman Mary Packard. They established missions in Santa Rita do Rio dos Sinos, Rio Grande and Pelotas. These five missionaries are regarded as the founders of the Brazilian Episcopal Church, since they preached to Brazilians in Portuguese and spread Anglicanism throughout the Southern region of Brazil, which now has the largest number of Anglican communities. In 1893, Morris and Brown launched the Christian Standard (Estandarte Crist√£o), a newspaper for the Anglican community of Porto Alegre. That same year, Bishop George William Peterkin of West Virginia visited the Brazilian mission and ordained four deacons. Four years later, the Brazilian mission was visited by Waite Hockin Stirling, who ordained three priests and confirmed 159 members. In 1899, Kinsolving became a bishop, leading the Brazilian community. In 1907, the missionary efforts resulted in the creation of the Missionary District of Brazil within the Episcopal Church. In 1908, the missionaries began their activities in Rio de Janeiro, then capital of Brazil, where Kinsolving hoped to build the headquarters of the church. Four years later, the Anglicans opened schools in Porto Alegre and Santana do Livramento. In 1921, the missionaries began working in the State of S√£o Paulo, reaching the state capital in 1924. In 1926, William M. M. Thomas was elected Bishop of the Missionary District of Brazil and Kinsolving returned to the United States a year later. In 1929, the Episcopal Press was founded; it launched the most important revised edition of the Book of Common Prayer. According to Kickhofel, the Anglican worship service was envied by the Roman Catholics, since they only began praying in Portuguese after the end of the Second Vatican Council in 1965. In 1940, Athalicio Theodoro Pithan became the first Brazilian-born bishop of the missionary district; Episcopalians celebrated the 40th year of their presence in Brazil that same year. In 1949, the year of bishop Thomas' retirement and succession by Louis Chester Melcher, the Missionary District of Brazil was sub-divided into three dioceses, which prompted discussions about the ecclesiastical independence of the Episcopal Church Brazilian. In 1952, the first General Synod took place. Three years later, the chapels which were founded in the 1820s and were still being operated by the Church of England merged with the Missionary District of Brazil after a deal reached by the Episcopal Church and the Church of England. In 1965, the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil (Igreja Episcopal Anglicana do Brasil / IEAB) gained its autonomy, becoming the 19th ecclesiastical province of the Anglican Communion and electing Egmont Machado Krischke, son of an early missionary, as its Primate Bishop. Since then, the Anglican Episcopal Church has had the autonomy to develop its own liturgy. In 1966, IEAB became a member of the World Council of Churches as part of its commitment to Christian ecumenism. In 1974, the Brazilian province was visited, for the first time, by an Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey. IEAB achieved financial independence from the Episcopal Church in the late 1970s. In 1985, IEAB began to ordain women following the decision of the 1984 General Synod; the first female priest was the Reverend Carmen Etel Alves Gomes. IEAB preceded the Church of England on the matter. In 1990, during its centenary, IEAB decided to focus on three areas, considering the social- economic problems of Brazil: education, service and expansion. That same year, the Primate Bishop of IEAB and the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church established a bilateral committee with the purpose of reapproaching the churches, encouraging partnerships and mutual relations between them. The Episcopal Church still sends missionaries to Brazil and the dioceses of Pennsylvania and S√£o Paulo and Indianapolis and Bras√≠lia maintain special relations. In addition, IEAB initiated a dialogue with the Anglican churches from other Portuguese-speaking countries. Presiding Bishop Maur√≠cio Jos√© Ara√∫jo de Andrade, Primate Bishop of the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil from 2006 to 2013 Originally under the metropolitical supervision of the Episcopal Church, the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil became an independent province in 1965 and consists of a single metropolitical province, so its head serves as both metropolitan and primate. In this role he uses the style of \\"Dom\\", typical of the hierarchs of the Roman Catholic Church, but does not have the usual title of \\"Archbishop\\", being known by the alternative title of \\"Presiding Bishop\\" (Bispo Primaz). The primate bishops have been:See official website listing. * Egmont Machado Krischke, 1965‚Äî1971 * Arthur Rodolpho Kratz, 1972‚Äî1984 * Olavo Ventura Luiz, 1986‚Äî1992 * Glauco Soares de Lima, 1993‚Äî2003 * Orlando Santos de Oliveira, 2003‚Äî2006 * Maur√≠cio Jos√© Ara√∫jo de Andrade, 2006‚Äî2013 * Francisco de Assis da Silva, 2013‚Äî2018 * Naudal Alves Gomes, 2018‚Äìpresent Governance A substantial proportion of the priests of the province are women. The president of the House of Clergy and Laity for the first time is a lay woman, Selma Rosa, who was elected at the general synod for a three-year term. The general secretary of the church is Arthur Cavalcante, also appointed at the general synod for a three-year term. Dioceses and mission districts The province consists of nine dioceses, each headed by a bishop, one of whom is elected as Primate Bishop. The 30th General Synod of the church, held in July 2006, elevated the Amazon mission as the ninth diocese of the province and grouped the dioceses and the missionary district of the province into three regions.

Social issues Due to the predominance of the Liberal wing ‚Äî which defends a social interpretation of the Gospels because of the oppression that a literal interpretation may cause ‚Äî IEAB rejects fanaticism and preaches that the church should be an instrument of social change, seeking to engage congregations and communities in debates still considered taboo in Brazilian society, such as those involving land concentration, domestic violence, sexism, racism, homophobia and xenophobia. It describes itself as concerned about the social, political, moral and spiritual lives of its members. It is also considered an Inclusive Church for it accepts, as members, people from historically marginalized groups such as LGBT, women, indigenous and landless. According to the canons of IEAB, \\"as Christians, we bear the promise of the Holy Spirit, which leads us to the Word made flesh, who welcomes the oppressed, the neglected, the misunderstood and the marginalized\\". IEAB argues that \\"everyone baptized, faithful and obedient to God, regardless of their sexual orientation, are full members of the Body of Christ, the Church\\". According to Cardoso, the Church has welcomed gay people as members since 1998. In 1997, the Bishops of IEAB signed a document saying that \\"sexuality is a gift from God, and sexual intercourse, when practiced in a context of love and mutual respect, should not only be accepted but also considered as one of the good things that God has created\\". In 2001, IEAB conducted the first national consultation on human sexuality, when its members decided to reject \\"the principle of exclusion implicit in the ethics of sin and uncleanness\\" and declare inclusiveness as an \\"essence of the ministry of Jesus\\". On 12 May 2011, IEAB released a statement declaring its support for the Supreme Federal Court decision to recognize same-sex unions in Brazil. More recently, the Presiding Bishop issued a letter in support of the Episcopal Church's decision to adopt a non-gender marriage stance and stating that he wanted his church to do the same soon.Uma Palavra do Primaz do Brasil Sobre as Mudan√ßas a Respeito do Matrim√≥nio na Igreja Episcopal dos Estados Unidos, Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil Official Website (Portuguese) The Church has declared its support for the ordination of openly gay clergy and has offered a service of blessing for same-sex marriages. According to Santos, the political progressivism of IEAB's religious leaders is the reflex of their broad theological education. In June 2016, the presiding bishop convened an Extraordinary Synod to discuss amending the marriage canon to include same-sex marriage, but a consensus was not reached; the issue will be considered in the General Synod in 2017. IEAB is among the Anglican churches that are open to blessing same-sex unions. \\"Anglican churches in Brazil, South Africa, New Zealand and Scotland have moved to recognize same-sex relationships.\\" Clergy were able to enter civil partnerships, and are now also able to enter into a same-sex marriages. On 1 June 2018 the General Synod voted to change the marriage canon to allow same-sex couples to get married. Anglican realignment The Diocese of Recife, led by Bishop Robinson Cavalcanti, withdrew from IEAB in 2005, due to their disagreement with the national church policies on homosexuality. The diocese renamed itself as Anglican Church- Diocese of Recife and joined the Global South realignment movement as an extraprovincial diocese.

History The ranch was founded in 1847 and is one of the oldest ranches in the United States, pre-dating many mainland ranches in Texas and other southwestern states by more than 30 years. Spread across approximately of the island, Parker Ranch is among the nation's largest cattle ranches. A cowboy on the ranch is called a paniolo (Hawaiian language pronunciation of ), since the first cowboys were Spanish-speaking and came from California. The Hawaiian language does not have the \\"s\\" sound. During World War II, part of the ranch was used as a United States Marine Corps training base called Camp Tarawa. The Second and Fifth Marine Divisions conducted training maneuvers there in preparation for the assault of Iwo Jima. The founder of the ranch was John Palmer Parker who assisted Kamehameha I in ridding the island of feral bulls and was granted land on which he established the ranch. From 1899 to 1937 it was managed by Alfred Wellington Carter (1867‚Äì1949). The last owner of the ranch, the actor Richard Smart, died in 1992. Since then the Ranch has been governed by the Parker Ranch Foundation Trust. Two of the ranch's historic homes, Puuopelu and Mana Hale, are open for free self guided tours at 66-1304 Mamalahoa Highway about one mile outside of Waimea town. This is also the location of the Corporate Headquarters. The Parker Ranch Arena and a racetrack are located off the Hawaii Belt Road at coordinates . The Ranch holds its annual July 4th Rodeo and Horses races at this Historic location. The Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, was developed and constructed by Laurance S.

Description  Brighamia insignis is a potentially branched plant with a succulent stem that is bulbous at the bottom and tapers toward the top, ending in a compact rosette of fleshy leaves. The stem is usually in height, but can reach . The plant blooms in September through November.Hawaiian Native Plant Cultivation Database. University of Hawaii, Manoa. It has clusters of fragrant yellow flowers in groups of three to eight in the leaf axils. The scent has been compared to honeysuckle. Petals are fused into a tube long. The fruit is a capsule long containing numerous seeds.  Distribution  It is extremely rare. In 1994 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service reported five populations totaling 45 to 65 individuals, and listed the plant as an endangered species. As of today, the species is possibly extinct in the wild. The last single individual was recorded in the wild in 2014. Brighamia insignis is found at elevations from sea level to in mesic shrublands and dry forests that receive less than of annual rainfall. It grows on rocky ledges with little soil and steep sea cliffs. Associated plants include ƒÅhinahina (Artemisia spp.) akoko (Euphorbia celastroides), alahee (Psydrax odorata), kƒÅwelu (Eragrostis variabilis), pili (Heteropogon contortus), kokio ula (Hibiscus kokio), ƒÅnaunau (Lepidium serra), nehe (Lipochaeta succulenta), pokulakalaka (Munroidendron racemosum), and ilima (Sida fallax).  Endangered status  According to the U.S. Botanic Garden, its only pollinator was a certain type of now-extinct hawk moth. This has made it all but impossible for B. insignis to reproduce on its own. Therefore, individuals only produce seed when artificially pollinated by humans. Other threats to the species have included exotic plant species, feral goats and pigs, slugs, rats, fire, and infestations of carmine spider mites (Tetranychus cinnabarinus).The Nature ConservancyUSFWS. Brighamia insignis Five Year Review. January 18, 2008. There is also a hiking trail near one of the populations. The plant grows on steep, exposed cliffs and has been damaged by hurricanes and landslides.  Cultivation  Despite its rarity in the wild it is not hard to cultivate in a nursery, and it has come into use as a novel ornamental plant.National Tropical Botanical Garden Gallery Image:Brighamia insignis - flowers.JPGFlowers of the Brighamia insignis File:Flower HawaiianPalm.JPGFlower HawaiianPalm Image:alula.jpgAn alula plant at Limahuli Garden and Preserve, Kauai.

The hospital was founded in 1738 as a general hospital for the poor in the city centre, where the frontage of its building still reads Royal Mineral Water Hospital. Thus it is known locally as \\"The Mineral Hospital\\" or \\"The Min\\". The hospital moved to a new building at the RUH site in 2019. History From the 16th century the needs of the \\"deserving poor\\" who came to take the healing waters of the Roman Baths were recognised and an act of 1597 gave them the right to free use of the waters. This attracted beggars and, although the act was repealed in 1714, large numbers of people were still attracted to the city and St John's Hospital was only accessible to local residents. Plans were suggested for a hospital to receive them in 1716 with supporters who included Lady Elizabeth Hastings, Henry Hoare, Joseph Jekyll, William Oliver and Beau Nash. The hospital was founded in 1738 as The Mineral Water Hospital. It provided care for the impoverished sick who were attracted to Bath because of the supposed healing properties of the mineral water from the spa. The original building, which was designed by John Wood the Elder, was built with Bath stone donated by Ralph Allen and completed in 1742. It was later enlarged, firstly in 1793 by the addition of an attic storey and later in 1860 by a second building erected on the west side of the earlier edifice. There is a fine pediment, in Bath stone, on the 1860 building depicting the parable of the Good Samaritan. The building was classified as Grade II* listed in 1972. In 2003, the hospital became an NHS Foundation Trust, specialising in rheumatic disease and rehabilitation, which received a three-star rating in 2005. The hospital had a large brain injury rehabilitation service with separate units for adults, adolescents and children; this service closed in March 2013 as a result of financial pressures. The hospital was named by the Health Service Journal as the best acute specialist trust to work for in 2015. At that time it had 208 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.18%. 91% of staff recommended it as a place for treatment and 79% recommended it as a place to work. =Royal United Hospitals= It was announced in January 2015 that the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases NHS Foundation Trust would be taken over by Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, after financial debts had built up toward ¬£2million. During 2015 and 2016, some services were transferred to the Royal United Hospital (RUH), including endoscopy and children's services. Construction started on a building at the RUH's Combe Park site in November 2017, to house the Royal National Hospital and the Brownsword Therapies centre. The first departments from the Mineral Hospital and the RUH transferred to the new building in September 2019 and all services were transferred to the RUH site by the end of that year. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who is President of the Royal Osteoporosis Society, formally opened the hospital and therapies centre on 22 October 2019. Five 18th-century oil paintings from the Mineral Water Hospital were re-hung at the RUH, notably a work of William Hoare titled \\"Dr Oliver and Mr Pierce examining patients with Paralysis, Rheumatism and Leprosy\\". Services The hospital provides local rheumatology services, and also has specialist clinics and services which attract referrals from a national population. Specialist rheumatology clinics include connective tissue disease, ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, and Paget's disease. The hospital is a regional centre of excellence for the treatment of lupus. Nationally commissioned specialist services include: * Bath Centre for Fatigue Service ‚Äì for adults experiencing longstanding fatigue linked to a variety of illnesses * Bath Centre for Pain Services ‚Äì pain rehabilitation for people with chronic pain, of all ages * Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Service and the Complex Cancer Late Effects Rehabilitation Service ‚Äì intensive rehabilitation for adults who are living with complex regional pain syndrome or the late effects of cancer treatment  Future of Mineral Hospital building  Part of the former hospital in the city centre The historic city centre site was offered for sale by the RUH Trust in 2017. It was bought by Versant Developments & Homes Ltd of Winchester, who sold it on to Singapore-based Fragrance Group in January 2018 for ¬£21.5M. Fragrance Group, which owns other historic hotels in England, plans to convert the building into a hotel by removing 20th-century additions and building an extension, while protecting Roman features. The planning committee of Bath and North East Somerset Council rejected an application by Fragrance in September 2020, amid criticism of the size and height of a proposed extension.

It forms the basis of Mimamsa, the earliest of the six orthodox schools (darshanas) of Indian philosophy. According to tradition, sage Jaimini was one of the disciples of sage Veda Vyasa, the author of the Mahabharata. Overview The work is divided into twelve adhyayas (chapters), which are further divided into sixty padas (sections). The text provides rules for the interpretation of the Vedas and also provides philosophical justifications for the observance of Vedic rituals, by offering meaning and significance of Vedic rituals to attain Moksha.Jaimini: Mimamsasutra at Sansknet project Commentaries Over the centuries many commentaries were written on this text, most important being the ≈öabara BhƒÅ·π£ya written by ≈öƒÅbara, the only extant commentary on all the 12 chapters of the Mimamsa Sutras of Jaimini. Shabara Bhashya at Chinmaya Mission The major commentaries written on the text as well as the ≈öabara BhƒÅ·π£ya were by Kumarila Bhatta and Prabhakara Mishra. Philosophy Jaimini, in his Mimamsa Sutra, presents material activity and its results as the whole of reality (vipanam rtam). He and later proponents of Karma-mimamsa philosophy teach that material existence is endless, that there is no liberation. For Mimamsas, the cycle of karma is perpetual, and the best one can aim for is higher birth among the Devas. Therefore, they hold that the whole purpose of the Vedas is to engage human beings in rituals for creating good karma, and consequently the mature soul's prime responsibility is to ascertain the exact meaning of the Vedas' sacrificial injunctions and to execute them. Content Mimamsa Sutra consists of twelve chapters: * In the first chapter import of the collections of words which have various meanings is discussed. Such as, injunction (vidhi), explanatory passage (arthavada), hymn (mantra), tradition (smriti) etc. * In the second chapter, discussions relating to the difference of various rites, refutation of erroneously proofs etc. are held. * In the third chapter, sruti, sense of the passage (linga), context (vakya), and their respective weight when in apparent opposition to one another, the ceremonies called pratipatti-karmdni, things mentioned incidentally (anarabhyadhita) and the duties of the sacrifices are expounded. * In the fourth chapter, the influence on other rites of the principal and subordinate rites, the fruit caused by the juhu and dice-playing, which forms a subordinate part of the rajasuya sacrifice are explained. * Fifth chapter discusses relative order of various passages of sruti, different parts of sacrifice etc. * In the sixth chapter, the persons qualified to offer sacrifices, their obligations, the substitutes for materials used in sacrifices, expiatory rites and the different sacrificial fires are made clear. * In the seventh and eight chapters, transference of ceremonies and transference by virtue from one sacrifice to another are discussed. * In the ninth chapter, adaptation of hymns when quoted in a new context (uha), and melodies(samans) and mantras are discussed. * In the tenth, the discussion revolves around the non-performance of the primary rites and dependent rites, offerings to grahas etc. * In the eleventh chapter, there is discussion on tantra (combining several acts one), and avapa (performance of an act more than once). * In the twelfth chapter, prasanga, tantra and cumulation of concurrent rites (samuchchaya) is explained.

It was produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio and directed by Chang Cheh. Plot The plot is based on the story of how \\"Jade Unicorn\\" Lu Junyi came to join the outlaw band at Liangshan Marsh and the outlaws' battle with the Zeng Family Fortress. Liangshan's chief Chao Gai was ambushed and killed by Shi Wengong. His fellows vow to avenge him. The current de facto leaders of Liangshan, Song Jiang and Wu Yong, decide that given Shi Wengong's skill, Lu Junyi (Shi's former fellow student) will be the best person to assist them in taking revenge. The outlaws also note that if they succeed in recruiting Lu Junyi, they will also win over Lu's servant, Yan Qing, who is also a formidable martial artist. Wu Yong disguises himself as fortune teller and infiltrates the northern capital, where Lu Junyi stays, together with Li Kui, who is disguised as his idiotic assistant. They visit Lu Junyi and lie to him that a great calamity will befall him if he does not travel 1,000 miles to the southeast. Lu Junyi is skeptical of the advice and asks Yan Qing for his opinion. By then, Yan Qing has recognized Li Kui and provokes the hot-tempered Li into a fight. Li Kui is defeated and confined together with Wu Yong. Wu Yong uses reverse psychology on Lu Junyi and manages to persuade Lu to release them. Just then, Lu Junyi's steward Li Gu, who is in a secret affair with Lu's wife, reports the outlaws' presence to the authorities so as to seize his master's fortune. When soldiers arrive to capture the outlaws, Lu Junyi orders Yan Qing to escort Wu Yong and Li Kui safely out while he confronts the soldiers and is arrested. Yan Qing attempts to free Lu Junyi from prison but Lu is captured again when Yan leaves him for a short while. Yan Qing travels to Liangshan to seek help and he attempts to rob two men for his travel expenses. The two men turn out to be actually outlaws from Liangshan, one of them being Shi Xiu. Shi Xiu goes to find Lu Junyi while his companion brings Yan Qing back to Liangshan. While in the city, Shi Xiu sees that Lu Junyi is about to be executed in the market square so he storms the area alone in an attempt to free Lu. Both Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu are eventually overwhelmed by soldiers and taken into captive. Meanwhile, Yan Qing meets the Liangshan outlaws and they plan to infiltrate the northern capital to save Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu. They take strategic positions around the execution ground and attack the soldiers when the prisoners are about to be beheaded. This time, the outlaws overpower the guards and swiftly take control of the area. Accompanied by the outlaws, Lu Junyi marches home and kills his disloyal steward Li Gu while his adulterous wife is slain by Yan Qing. As the outlaws leave the city, they run into Shi Wengong and his men, resulting in both sides clashing in an immense battle. Shi Wengong's forces are routed so he challenges the outlaws to engage him and his five students in man-on-man duels. The five students fight with Lin Chong, Li Kui, Hu Sanniang, Wu Song and Shi Xiu, while Lu Junyi faces Shi Wengong. By the time the five heroes had defeated Shi Wengong's students, Lu Junyi was still locked his duel with Shi. Yan Qing and Li Kui join in the fray and Shi Wengong is injured gravely but still remains alive. After declaring that Lu Junyi is now the new leader of Liangshan, Shi Wengong stops everyone from approaching and commits suicide. The outlaws, seeing that their quest for vengeance is now complete, ride back to their stronghold and the film ends.

As Thailand's first UHF channel, the station was started in 1995 when the company was granted a 30-year concession by the Office of the Permanent Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office to operate a free-to-air television station in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) spectrum at 510-790 MHz (from Channel 26 to 60). After a lengthy dispute over unpaid concession fees to the Prime Minister's Office, the government's Public Relations Department took over the station in 2007. Its name was changed to Thailand Independent Television (TITV). Following a previously unannounced order of Thailand's Public Relations Department delivered the same day, the station closed on January 15, 2008. In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Service Act B.E.2551(2008), the channel's frequency was assigned to the Thai Public Broadcasting Service (Thai PBS). History =Early years= The original name of iTV's holding company was Siam Infotainment Company Limited. Its major shareholders were Siam Commercial Bank, the Crown Property Bureau (the investment organization of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Through by Sahacinema Company), and the Nation Multimedia Group.ASEAN Focus Group, Australian National University, \\"The Television Business, Democracy and The Army\\" Siam Infotainment won a 30-year concession to run a commercial television station, after offering only approximately US$3.3 million in royalties (a rival company had offered approximately US$17.5 million). This irregularity was subject to a government investigation in 1996, but the results of the investigation were never made public. Established as an independent television station, the company barred any one shareholder from having more than a 10% stake. Free from government control and shareholder liabilities, the station became known for its in-depth coverage of public affairs and investigative journalism. During the East Asian financial crisis of 1997, the station faced heavy financial loss. In addition, high concession fees (approximately US$708 million to be paid over 25 years) threatened to close the station. In 2000, iTV lost 775 million THB (US$18 million). The Democrat government worried that if iTV collapsed, shareholders like Siam Commercial Bank and the Crown Property Bureau would be adversely affected.Asiaweek, \\"Taming The Media\\", 16 February 2001 So in order to attract outside capital, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai lifted the 10% limit on share ownership in the station. Shin Corporation, owned by future Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, purchased a large portion of the company's shares for US$60 million, considered a high price for the ailing company.Handley, Paul M. \\"The King Never Smiles\\" Yale University Press 2006, page 425 =Shin Corporation= 2006 Bangkok New Year's Eve bombings Under new ownership, journalists reported being pressured to downplay negative news about Shin Corporation's then-owner, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and his Thai Rak Thai party. Twenty-one journalists were fired for speaking out. They later won a court case against iTV and were awarded several years of back pay. Taipei Times, Journalists fighting back after being muzzled , March 27, 2006 (via AsiaMedia). Originally, iTV's news-to-entertainment ratio was about 70/30. In the station's latter years, iTV increased its entertainment-based programming so that about half of its shows were entertainment. Among its popular programs was the Thailand version of the Big Brother reality TV show. In 2004, iTV was granted permission by an arbitration panel to increase the amount of entertainment programming. Additionally, iTV was required to pay the government only US$6 million in annual licensing fees, a reduction from the original agreement of US$25 million. In June 2006, as a result of iTV's changes in programming, Thailand's Central Administrative Court invalidated the arbitration panel's ruling, saying the news-to-entertainment ratio must be returned to 70/30 and that the broadcaster must pay 2.1 billion dollars in fines. iTV contested the court's decision.Bangkok Post, iTV must again focus on news , June 20, 2006, via AsiaMedia. Media-reform activists in Thailand, such as Supinya Klangnarong and Jon Ungpakorn, had suggested that the station model itself as a public broadcaster, similar to the BBC, PBS, NHK or the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Proponents believed that a public model would allow iTV to achieve its original mission as an independent public network, free from political intervention and business interests. As Jon Ungpakorn told The Nation, \\"The goal of founding iTV back in 1995 was to provide a public service via a truly independent network. That ideal should continue to be supported as we shouldn't forget that this network was set up following the 'dark age' of information which led to the Bloody May events of 1992.\\"The Nation, Could BBC model work for iTV? , June 25, 2006 =Thailand Independent Television (TITV)= In 2006, Shin Corporation, iTV's majority shareholder, was acquired by Temasek Holdings, the investment company of the Singaporean government. Thai media activists strongly criticized the sale. After the 2006 military coup that ousted Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand's interim civilian government voiced intentions to take over iTV if it failed to pay US$2.8 billion in fines. In February 2007, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont appointed a new executive board consisting exclusively of civil servants. The station was renamed \\"Thailand Independent Television\\" (TITV).The Nation, PM endorses new board of iTV , 2 March 2007 Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont announced that the government would acquire the station, intending to hand operations to the Public Relations Department, which already ran TVT Channel 11. Surayud promised that the station would not be taken off the air despite the controversy over concession fees. However, in 2007, the Prime Minister's Office announced that the station would be taken off the air at midnight on 6 March 2007, following the Cabinet's revocation of iTV's concession in early March 2007. Surayud apologized for not keeping his word.The Nation, 'Sorry' sight as govt bungles again , 7 March 2007 (print edition) Then on 7 March 2007, Surayud reversed his decision and ordered that iTV continue broadcasting after the deadline had passed. Other government- controlled television stations like MCOT were expected to reap windfalls if iTV ended.The Nation, Other channel operators may reap ad windfall from iTV fiasco , 9 March 2007 =Transformation into Thai PBS= On 14 January 2008, Thailand's Government Public Relations Department delivered a non-negotiable letter ordering closure of the station. The station complied, ending the TITV broadcast at 00:08 AM the next day.

The whole council was up for election and the Labour party gained overall control of the council from no overall control. Background Before the election Labour ran the council with the support of the Liberal Democrats. However the Conservatives targeted the council with the Conservative Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Norman Fowler, predicting that the Conservatives would make gains in Brent. The Conservatives required a 1% swing from the 1994 election to win a majority on the council, where previously no party had a majority. Election result The Labour party took a 20-seat majority on the council after gaining 15 seats, with the gains including taking all of the seats in Fryent and Roe Green wards and 1 seat in Queensbury ward from the Conservatives. The Conservatives put their defeat in Brent down to the popularity of the national Labour government and unhappiness at the closure of Edgware General Hospital's casualty department by the previous Conservative government. The Liberal Democrats failed to make gains and dropped from 5 to 4 councillors. Overall turnout at the election was 36.8%, down from 48.3% in 1994. } Ward results References 1998 Category:1998 London Borough council elections ","title":"1998 Brent London Borough Council election"},{"id":"5696232","text":"Equestrian statue of Philip Sheridan in the center of Sheridan Circle Sheridan Circle is a traffic circle in the Washington, D.C. neighborhood of Embassy Row. A number of embassies ring Sheridan Circle, including the former Turkish chancery, and the Romanian embassy on the southern side, and the Embassy of Pakistan to the northwest. Dupont Circle is visible down Massachusetts Avenue; in the other direction, the avenue rises toward a bridge over Rock Creek Park. History In 1888, the traffic circle was named for General Philip Sheridan, Union general of the American Civil War and later general of the United States Army. =Sheridan Monument= A statue to honor General Sheridan was originally proposed to stand on the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue NW near 13th Street NW, at what is now Freedom Plaza. Gen. Sheridan's widow advocated to erect the statue at Sheridan Circle instead, with which the statue commission agreed. John Quincy Adams Ward was selected to sculpt the statue. Mrs. Sheridan rejected his original model, saying it was not a good likeness of Gen. Sheridan, and the statue commission rejected Ward's model. The commission and Mrs. Sheridan both approved of a model created by Gutzon Borglum. The statue was dedicated on November 27, 1908. =Letelier Monument= The Letelier Monument, located on Sheridan Circle, is in memory of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Karpen Moffitt On September 21, 1976, Orlando Letelier and Ronni Karpen Moffitt were killed by a car bomb in the circle. Letelier had been foreign minister in the ousted Allende government of Chile. The bombing was blamed on Chilean DINA agents. Michael Townley, a DINA U.S. expatriate among those convicted for the crime, confessed that he had hired five anti-Castro Cuban exiles to booby-trap Letelier's car. According to Jean- Guy Allard, after consultations with the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations leadership (including Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch), those selected to carry out the murder were Cuban-Americans Jos√© Dionisio Su√°rez, Virgilio Paz Romero, Alvin Ross D√≠az and brothers Guillermo and Ignacio Novo Sampoll.http://www.counterpunch.org/landau08202005.html According to the Miami Herald, Luis Posada Carriles was at the meeting that decided on Letelier's death and also about the Cubana bombing two weeks later. Letelier and Moffitt are commemorated with a small plaque embedded in the grass along the curb where they died, near the Irish and Romanian embassies. =Turkish attacks= On May 16, 2017, dozens of peaceful protestors were assaulted by Turkish security officials. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, visiting the Ambassador's residence that sits on Sheridan Circle, watched the clashes from a distance. See also *List of circles in Washington, D.C.

In geography, a threshold population is the minimum number of people necessary before a particular good or service can be provided in an area. The concept is equivalent to the \\"range\\" in central place theory and retailing, which delineates the market area of a central place for a particular good or service, and is dependent on the spatial distribution of population and the willingness of consumers to travel a given distance to purchase particular goods or services.Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin. Typically a low-order shop (such as a grocer or newsagent) may require only 800 or so customers, whereas a higher-order store such as Marks and Spencer or Waitrose may need a threshold of 70,000 to be profitable, and a university may need 350,000 to be viable.Tiscali encyclopedia Thresholds may also be linked to the spending power of customers; this is most obvious in periodic markets in poor countries, where wages are so low that people can buy the goods or services only once in a while.

He mostly played a Second striker, but could also play an Attacking midfielder. Early life Itzhaki was born in Ashkelon, Israel, to a Jewish family.http://www.maccabi-tlv.co.il/en/2017/12/davidzada- believe-despite-disappointing-results/http://www.maccabi- tlv.co.il/en/2019/09/maccabi-players-visit-childrens-hospital/  Career  Itzhaki started his professional career with boyhood club Hapoel Ashkelon. During his first two seasons as a professional, Itzhaki won the Toto Cup Artzit twice. He was sold to Beitar Jerusalem and saw limited time under manager Eli Ohana. With the arrival of French manager Luis Fern√°ndez in 2005, Itzhaki received more playing time and was even a first team choice over the club's leading scorer, Lior Asulin. After watching Itzhaki play, Fern√°ndez told the club to sign Itzhaki to a long term contract. At the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, Itzhaki attracted interest from Belgian club Racing Genk. Media reports say that he was offered a ‚Ç¨300,000 per annum contract that includes a 20% yearly wage rise for a period no less than three seasons. Beitar was reluctant to see Itzhaki leave and they have put a price on the striker of no less than US$1,000,000. On June 25, 2006 an official bid was sent for the immediate transfer of Itzhaki but Beitar chairman Vladimir Sklar rejected the offer of USD $250,000. While Itzhaki and the club were in training in Arnhem, the Netherlands, a representative of Racing Genk showed up at the hotel with an improved offer of USD $500,000. It initially looked as if Itzhaki would be sold to the Belgian side but he eventually signed a long term contract with Beitar. In January 2008, Itzhaki agreed a move to Racing Genk, where he signed a 3.5 year contract. He scored his first Racing Genk goal in KV Mechelen, it is already named as the goal of the year in Belgium. After this goal he also scored against Moeskroen en Club Brugge. On July 2008, Itzhaki returned earlier as planned to Beitar Jerusalem due to home sickness. Once back in Jerusalem he became the top scorer of the 2008‚Äì09 Israeli Premier League. =Maccabi Tel Aviv= On June 9, 2010 Itzhaki signed a five-year- contract with Maccabi Tel Aviv for a transfer fee of two million USD paid to Beitar. He made his official debut for Maccabi at the home win against FK Mogren at UEFA Europa League on July 15, 2010. On August 22, 2010 Itzhaki suffered a serious injury to his ACL against Maccabi Haifa and wasn't able to play until May 7, 2011. He made his return, replacing Maor Buzaglo in a league match against Maccabi Haifa, the same team he played against when he got injured, 32 fixtures and almost 9 months after that injury. He scored his first league goal for Maccabi by a penalty shot in the 87th minute of the last game of the season against Maccabi Netanya. In the summer of 2012 Itzhaki was loaned to Anorthosis Famagusta. In that season Itzhaki was a vital part of team, scoring 13 league goals in 23 matches. Barak was the last (loan) transfer of Anorthosis for the season 2012-13 and was the most helpful transfer of the year, he scored 13 goals in the league and helped the team to achieve the second place. Towards 2013‚Äì14 Itzhaki returned to Maccabi Tel Aviv, making his first game for the club since his return in the UEFA Champions League qualifying game against Gy≈ëri ETO and accomplishing a great comeback to the club by scoring an important away goal.

Field work  The Tangra 2004/05 team covered either on ski or on foot an overall distance of some 200 km, mostly in harsh weather conditions and challenging unfamiliar terrain in eastern Livingston Island, including the first crossing of Bowles Ridge, and first visit and routes to Vidin Heights, Gleaner Heights, Melnik Ridge, Levski Ridge, Saedinenie Snowfield, Kaliakra Glacier, Struma Glacier, middle Huron Glacier, Leslie Gap, Elhovo Gap, Gurev Gap, Yankov Gap, Pirdop Gate, Lozen Saddle, and the peaks Lyaskovets, Zograf, Lozen Nunatak, Erma Knoll, Aheloy Nunatak, Ravda, Komini, Ongal, Melnik, Castra Martis Hill, Radnevo, Zemen Knoll, and Miziya, as well as the third ascent of Presian Ridge and the island's summit Mount Friesland (1700 m). In particular, the survey team traversed the main crest of Tangra Mountains between Mount Friesland and Lyaskovets Peak.Tangra 2004/05 Survey - Expedition debrief. Explorersweb, 30 June 2005 Extensive geodetic and geographic information was gathered, including coordinates and elevation data, actual sea shoreline and ice-free zones configuration, as well as a detailed photographic documentation of previously unexplored and remote areas in the interior of Livingston Island and Greenwich Island.  Legacy  Based on the survey, 146 geographical features were mapped for the first time, and the coordinates of other 8 features were updated. A new 1:100000 scale topographic map of the islands of Livingston and Greenwich was published in August 2005 in 1802 hard copies, and also made available in electronic version both in the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, and in the Wikimedia Commons. Data from the Tangra 2004/05 expedition was extensively used also in the 2009 Bulgarian map of Livingston, Greenwich, Robert, Snow, and Smith Islands. In connection with the work carried out by the Tangra 2004/05 Expedition, 126 new Bulgarian names for hitherto nameless geographical features on Livingston Island and Greenwich Island were approved on 11 April and on 4 November 2005. Invited lectures on the results of the expedition were given at the Faculty of Geology and Geography at Sofia University, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, the State Commission on Information Security, the Municipality of Radnevo etc. Field work carried out during the survey was noted in 2012 by Discovery Channel, the Natural History Museum, the Royal Collection and the British Antarctic Survey as a timeline event in Antarctic exploration.Discovering Antarctica Overview.

The game was first announced in June 2006, by which time it was reported to already have been in production and self-funded for two years; the title was then signed with Sega in 2007, but in July 2009 it was revealed that the game had been cancelled by the publisher earlier that year after over half a decade of work, as noted in the LinkedIn profile of a former internal producer at the studio. Further details surrounding the cancellation and the game's fate in their entirety remain unclear to this day, as no official announcement regarding its status has been made by either Sega or Edge of Reality, however, more recently, a U.S. federal trademark registration was filed on September 11, 2009, which as of October 19, 2011, has been granted a third extension. While confirming nothing else, this does indicate that Edge of Reality has retained the intellectual property rights to the game. Although the game was widely believed to be cancelled by Sega, game designer Phil Fogerite (who worked as level designer on the project from March 2008 to April 2009) has most stated in 2011 that Edge of Reality itself had in fact decided to put the game on indefinite hold. Gameplay Edge of Reality was hoping to \\"revolutionize\\" the stealth action genre. The main character carries out various actions with speed, precision, strength and cunning stealth to neutralize enemies. In June 2010, gameplay footage of a level from Cipher Complex was leaked online via Dailymotion, depicting the player character (Cipher) infiltrating a steel mill in China, under orders to extract a General who is being held hostage; in addition, short clips of gameplay can be seen on Edge of Reality's official homepage. An \\"in-game screenshot\\" of the steel mill level, as well as some concept art, textures and logos from the game have also been posted to Picasa by the lead environment artist, who has since clarified that it is a demo level. Part of an early cinematic as well as some character animations were again posted via Dailymotion in March 2011. Gameplay from an unreleased demo and testing environment was published by the Hard4Games channel on YouTube in April 2018. Plot The official storyline, as quoted from the game's original press release, is as follows: > U.S. surveillance satellites detect activity onboard the decommissioned > Soviet Bargration Missile Defense Station 4 off the east coast of Siberia. > When the Russians deny the U.S. access to the facility, Department of > Defense strategists suggest that a small, plausibly deniable reconnaissance > mission be sent in to investigate. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is > given the go-ahead for operation BLACKOUT, the insertion of a single expert > Operator on Russian WMDs and launch facilities. Lt. Col. John Sullivan, > callsign: Cipher is air dropped in, and what was supposed to be primarily a > reconnaissance mission becomes a race against a terrorist threat; one with > implications that will shake the foundations of American democracy and > freedoms. It is unknown to what extent the game's plot changed during development. As such, the synopsis outlined above may not be indicative of the final plot intended for the game.

The game stars Socks, the real-life presidential pet of the Clinton family during Bill Clinton's tenure in office. Originally scheduled for release in the fall of 1993, Socks the Cat experienced delays until it was ultimately canceled due to the closure of publisher Kaneko's U.S. branch in the summer of 1994. The game was complete, however, and review copies were still distributed to gaming publications. A prototype cartridge of the SNES version eventually entered the hands of private collectors, and a Kickstarter campaign to fund a relaunch of the game was started. The campaign was successfully funded and the game originally anticipated a July 2017 release, but it was delayed until February 1, 2018. Its ROM image was soon released to the public. Set in Washington D.C., Socks the Cat Rocks the Hill follows the title character as he makes his way past spies, politicians, and the news media to warn the Clinton family of a stolen nuclear missile launch device. The game makes heavy use of political satire, including bosses designed as caricatures of former U.S. presidents and other political figures. Nintendo reportedly liked the game despite their censorship policies during the era which condemned games with political content. The political satire was also praised by critics, although the game was otherwise found to be average. Synopsis The game begins with Socks observing foreign spies stealing a nuclear missile launch unit in the basement of a foreign embassy. He embarks on a journey through eleven stages through Washington D.C. landmarks like The Pentagon to return to the Oval Office in the White House and alert the Clinton family. Throughout the game, Socks must overcome the likes of foreign spies, politicians, the United States Secret Service, and the news media. The bosses are caricatures of political figures, such as Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ross Perot. In one situation, Socks must push Millie the dog, pet of former president George H. W. Bush, out the front door to avoid Arab terrorist felines. Also, Richard Nixon calls in bomb raids and Ted Kennedy is seen driving a car on a bridge. History Socks the Cat Rocks the Hill features caricatures of political figures, such as Richard Nixon Kaneko originally planned two entirely different games to feature Socks, one for the Super NES to be developed by Realtime Associates, and the other by an undisclosed developer for the Genesis. The SNES and Genesis games were both occasionally referred to as Socks the Cat Rocks the House in some early publications; however, this title would later refer to the Genesis game only. The \\"Socks the Cat\\" license was not owned by the Clinton family, but rather a fan club known as the Presidential Socks Partnership. Kaneko purchased the license from the fan club, with some of the profits given to The Humane Society of the United States and the Children's Defense Fund, one of Hillary Clinton's favorite charities. Socks the Cat was first unveiled and demonstrated by Kaneko on June 2, 1993, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The first release window provided was for fall 1993. Shortly before its scheduled release that summer, Socks the Cat was canceled due to the closure of Kaneko's U.S. division. Although Nintendo's censorship policies during the late 1980s and early 1990s condemned games that had \\"subliminal political messages or overt political statements\\", Nintendo reportedly liked the game. Former Realtime Associates employees have stated the game was finished. One former developer, David Warhol, stated the game \\"was very irreverent...maybe it's better it didn't come out after all!\\" Some time after its cancellation, a prototype copy was sold by a former Kaneko employee to video game collector Jason Wilson. In 2011, a five-minute video was uploaded to YouTube showing gameplay from the cartridge, giving proof of the game's existence. In 2012, Wilson sold the game to collector Tom Curtin for the same amount as a \\"decent used car\\". The sale was made in part because Curtin wished to release the game. He acquired the rights to the \\"Socks the Cat\\" trademark in 2015 and planned to launch a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to fund a release of the game. The campaign was launched on October 10, 2016 and finished 110% funded on November 8, 2016, the same day as the 2016 US presidential election (in which Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee). The campaign anticipated a 2017 release; the game finally released on February 1, 2018. Reception Although never released, Socks the Cat Rocks the Hill was reviewed by multiple publications who generally saw it as an average platformer albeit with excellent boss design and political satire. Nintendo Power found the boss characters to be humorous but criticized the poor controls. GamePro also praised the bosses and the satire, but were more critical with the flat graphics and poor sound. They provided scores of 3.0 for graphics, 2.5 for sound, 3.5 for controls, and 3.5 for \\"fun factor\\" (out of 5). Nintendo Power believed poor controls made the game challenging, but GamePro found the game easy and thought the controls \\"take practice but prove effective.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly dubbed it \\"a cute run-and-jump, claw the enemies game.\\" Notes References Category:Cancelled Sega Genesis games Category:Cancelled Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Platform games Category:Presidency of Bill Clinton Category:Unauthorized video games ","title":"Socks the Cat Rocks the Hill"},{"id":"5696360","text":"Elections to Bromley Council in England were held on 7 May 1998.

It is classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List. Wilkesia is one of three genera, with Argyroxiphium (silverswords and greenswords) and Dubautia (a larger group with many varied species) that are believed to be descendant from a single species related to the North American tarweed. The members of these three genera constitute what is called the silversword alliance, a group whose exceedingly close genetic heritage is not reflected in their exceptionally diverse morphologies. Description W. gymnoxiphium is a monocarpic rosette shrub, with rosettes elevated on woody stems as much as tall. Distinctive features include a usually unbranched, monocarpic axis, leaves in whorls of 9-15 that join to form a basal sheath around the stem, and peduncles that are commonly branched. Fountains of yellow, daisy-like flowers form mostly May to July. When unbranched the plant dies after flowering, but if it branches into multiple heads (as may happen if the top is broken off), each head will flower and die separately. Habitat This species occurs only on Kauai, on dry ridges or dry to mesic forests. The most common location is along the slopes of Waimea Canyon. It grows at elevations of in areas that receive of annual precipitation. Heavily grazed by feral goats in the canyon, they are most often seen on inaccessible slopes. However, a dense population can be seen in a fenced enclosure just off the road heading to K≈çkee State Park.

He studied in the College of San Carlos in Lima. When Jos√© de San Mart√≠n arrived in Peru in 1820, Salaverry left college despite his father's opposition, and made his way to Huaura Province, where he volunteered to join the general and his forces. San Martin enlisted Salaverry as a cadet of the battalion of Numancia, a campaign against the Spaniards. He led the Peruvian Cavalry at the battles of Junin and Ayacucho, helping secure the Independence of Peru and routing the Spanish Army. After the establishment of the republic of Peru, Salaverry rose rapidly in the army. At the age of twenty-eight, Salaverry obtained the rank of General Inspector of the Peruvian Army. When the garrison of Callao revolted in January 1835, against then President Luis Orbegoso, and pronounced in favor of La Fuente, Salaverry defeated the insurgents. Orbegoso appointed him governor of the fortress. But on February 23, Salaverry rose in arms against the government. After Orbegoso abandoned Lima, Salaverry occupied the capital and proclaimed himself \\"Supreme Chief of the Republic\\". In a few months he had possession of the south, and Orbegoso retreated with a small force to the northern provinces. A decree of Felipe Santiago Salaverry re-legalizes the importation of slaves from other Latin American countries. The line \\"no slave shall enter Peru without becoming free\\" is taken out of the Constitution in 1839.C√≥digo Civil de 1852: Lo nacional y lo importado, by C√©sar Luna Victoria Le√≥n. He sought the intervention of Andr√©s Santa Cruz, leader of Bolivia, with whom Orbegoso concluded a treaty giving Santa Cruz a third of Peru. Soon after, the Bolivian army invaded Peru, and Salaverry retreated to the city of Arequipa. Salaverry obtained victories at the battle of Uchumayo, February 4, 1836, but on February 7, his forces were totally routed in Socabaya, a district of the city. After wandering for several days in his way to join the Peruvian Navy stationed at the coast at Islay in Arequipa, Salaverry trusted the General Miller who was persecuting him, who delivered him to Santa Cruz. Contrary to the customs of war against enemies who surrender, Santa Cruz ordered the execution of Salaverry and his General Staff, they assaulted him at The Plaza Major of Arequipa being assassinated, he survived since the Bolivian soldiers were very respectful of this brave General who refuse to covered his eyes and who was severely injured with a bloody leg, the unjust Santa Cruz ordered to shoot him again against the rules of civility, Salaverry was only thirty years old. This led to popular resistance and ultimately defeat of the Peru‚ÄìBolivian Confederation led by Santa Cruz, who escape to Chile and then to France.

He is best known for sending over 15,000 dry specimens and seeds and 500 plant samples to Kew Gardens in the United Kingdom. By 1930, he was a recognised authority and was honoured with society membership in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, and Poland. In 1929 the Botanical Institute of Peking dedicated to him the second volume of Icones plantarum Sinicarum, a collection of plant drawings. In 1935, John William Besant was to write: 'The wealth of beautiful trees and flowering shrubs which adorn gardens in all temperate parts of the world today is due in a great measure to the pioneer work of the late Professor Henry'.Besant, J. W. (1935) 'Plantae Henryanae', Gard. Chron. 98 (9 November 1935): 334‚Äì335. Early life and education Henry was born on 2 July 1857 in Dundee, Scotland to Bernard (a flax merchant) and Mary (n√©e McManee) Henry; the family returned to Cookstown, Co. Tyrone, shortly afterwards. Educated at Cookstown Academy and later Queens College Galway (B.A.), Queens College, Belfast (M.A.) 1879 to study medicine, Henry transferred his studies to Edinburgh to finish his degree sooner and duly qualified as a doctor. At some stage, he came in contact with Sir Robert Hart who encouraged him to join the Imperial Customs Service in China. Henry entered the Imperial Customs Service in Shanghai in 1881 as Assistant Medical Officer and Customs Assistant. He was sent to the remote posting of Yichang (Ichanh) in 1882 in Hubei Province, Central China, to investigate plants used in Chinese medicine. He also served in Hupeh, Szechuan, Simao (Yunnan), Mengsi and Formosa (Taiwan). Later in his Chinese career he studied Law and became a member of the Middle Temple. Henry had studied Chinese before going to China and gained a great proficiency in the language. Henry retired with the rank of Mandarin. Plantsman career While at Yichang and in other parts of China he collected plants, seeds and specimens, many of which had not been known until then. In 1888 he published a list of Chinese plants for the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. At that time the flora and fauna of China was not well known. By 1896, 25 new genera and 500 new species had been identified from his specimens. Henry sent over 15,000 dry specimens and seed to Kew Gardens and 500 plant samples; many of these later became well known garden plantsNelson, E. C. (2000). A Heritage of Beauty, An Illustrated Encyclopaedia, Annex X11 ‚Äì Augustine Henry's Plants, 309‚Äì324. Irish Garden Plant Society 2000 . He named 19 of them, including Aconitum hemsleyanum after William Botting Hemsley of Kew. Henry gave instructions to the plant collector Ernest Wilson on where to collect Davidia involucrata, originally discovered by the French missionary priest P√®re Armand David. On his return to Europe he spent some time working on his own introductions at the Royal Botanic Garden Kew. In 1900, Henry went to France to study at the French National School of Forestry at Nancy. He later became joint author with Henry John Elwes of the 7 volume Trees of Great Britain and Ireland 1907‚Äì13.Elwes, H. J. & Henry, A. (1913). The Trees of Great Britain & Ireland. Vol. VII. pp 1848‚Äì1929. Private publication. His contribution here was unique insofar as he devised a system of identification based on leaves and twigs and on the position of buds to aid identification even in the absence of fruit and flowers. He was involved in the establishment of the Chair of Forestry at Cambridge University in 1907, and remained there until 1913. He was responsible, with A.C. Forbes, the Director of Forestry at the Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction, for the lay-out of plots of trees at Avondale, County Wicklow. Celtic Revival Henry had an interest in the Arts and Crafts movement and in the Celtic Revival. He knew the poet W.B. Yeats, George William Russell (AE), Charlotte, wife of George Bernard Shaw, and was acquainted with the families of Sir Roger Casement and Erskine Childers. Royal College of Science, Dublin He took up the Chair of Forestry at the Royal College of Science (later University College Dublin), in 1913 and assisted later in setting up a National Forestry Service.

There are a diverse range of technologies used to achieve this decreased detectability; these have largely involved the reduction of several different signatures typically generated by a rotorcraft, including those of noise, radar, and infrared. In many ways, helicopters are less suitable for stealth technology than fixed-wing aircraft are; one such area is their rotor blades, which not only generate copious noise levels but can also give off a strong radar signature. However, blade designs have been developed that can significantly reduce noise,Nusca, Andrew. \\"Silent rotor blades could lead to true stealth helicopters.\\" SmartPlanet, 2 March 2010.

Numerous helicopters have incorporated profiled fuselages to reduce their radar cross-section (RCS), constructing elements of the rotorcraft from of certain materials is another means of minimising radar visibility. It is known that some nations have used such rotorcraft operationally, albeit in a limited scope, since the 1970s; a modified Hughes 500P was used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the Vietnam War. Various helicopters have been furnished with infrared exhaust suppressors to reduce their vulnerability to infrared homing weapons. Attack helicopters, such as the HAL Light Combat Helicopter and Eurocopter Tiger, have incorporated numerous presence reduction technologies into their design to increase their survivability. The raid on the compound of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 utilized what appeared to be two Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks, heavily modified for quieter operations and employing stealth technology to be less visible to radar.Than, Ker. \\"Top Secret Copter Used in Osama bin Laden Raid, Experts Say.\\" TechNewsDaily, 6 May 2011.

It was during this time that several different stealth helicopters would first emerge.Dartford 2004, p. 26.Singer 2009, p. 206. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was one such party seeking such rotorcraft, during the early 1970s, a single modified Hughes 500P was produced for the agency; it had a reduced noise operation capability, leading to its nickname of \\"The Quiet One\\". It was reportedly used in at least one operation by the CIA, to deploy a wiretap during the Vietnam War.Chiles, James R. \\"Air America's Black Helicopter.\\" Air & Space Smithsonian, February‚ÄìMarch 2008, pp. 62‚Äì70. ISSN 0886-2257. Retrieved: 6 May 2011. Such helicopters were considered advantageous by several military planners. The United States Army sought to develop a stealth helicopter for aerial reconnaissance missions; between 1996 and 2004, work on the Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche entered the prototype stage with an eye towards production. However, the Comanche programme was ultimately cancelled, both due to rising costs and the considerable technical issues which had been experienced.Geoghegan, Tom and Sarah Shenker. \\"Stealth helicopters used in Bin Laden raid.\\" BBC News, 5 May 2011.

It is known that a number of Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks have been outfitted with stealth technologies; these features reportedly include the use of specialized materials, along with numerous harsh angles and flat surfaces across the exterior fuselage, techniques that had previously been employed upon other stealth aircraft. It is believed that one or multiple of the UH-60 Black Hawks used in the raid upon Osama bin Laden's compound on 1 May 2011 featured stealth technologies.Ross, Brian, Rhonda Schwartz, Lee Ferran and Avni Patel. \\"Top Secret Stealth Helicopter Program Revealed in Osama Bin Laden Raid: Experts.\\" ABC World News. 4 May 2011.Naylor, Sean D. and Marcus Weisgerber. \\"Army mission helicopter was secret, stealth Black Hawk.\\" Army Times, 4 May 2011.

Michael Maloof, a former Pentagon senior policy analyst, identical stealthy UH-60s have been supplied to Israel and used for intelligence gathering missions inside Iran. Various other nations have worked on stealth helicopter technology. During the 1980s, British company Westland Helicopters undertook a top secret research programme towards developing a stealth attack helicopter. Being based on the Westland Lynx, the proposed design was internally designated WG 47; its configuration included a faceted fuselage with internally stored weapons, twin canted tail rotors and the routing of engine, environmental and cooling system exhausts into a side-exiting infrared suppressor. It featured a tandem cockpit, the glazing of which was specifically angled outward to eliminate optical glint towards the horizon. The programme was concluded during 1987. A French Army NHIndustries NH90 Westland's stealth helicopter research subsequently influenced its other programmes; the NHIndustries NH90 was one such beneficiary via the application of stealth profiling techniques into its fuselage design. The AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat, an advanced development of the Westland Lynx, also incorporated several stealth features, such as infrared exhaust suppressors; such devices have been installed on other platforms by the company, including the AgustaWestland Apache.Drwiega, Andrew. \\"Is the AW159 Lynx Wildcat Wild Enough?.\\" Aviation Today, 1 April 2012.Hoyle, Craig. \\"Pictures: UK's Future Lynx programme moves into manufacturing phase\\" . Flight International, 9 October 2007. Such measures augment the effectiveness of its defensive aids suite, which includes missile warning sensors and countermeasures dispensers. Several production helicopters, including the HAL Light Combat Helicopter and Eurocopter Tiger, reportedly feature presence- reduction measures or \\"stealth\\". The use of advanced composite materials on the airframe has commonly resulted in reductions in an aircraft's radar cross- section (RCS). In the case of the Eurocopter Tiger, numerous measures were incorporated in its design so that it would possess minimal visual, radar, infra-red and acoustic signatures, which enhances the Tiger's battlefield survivability.Moxon 1995, p. 103.\\"Tiger ‚Äì Technology.\\" Eurocopter, Retrieved: 17 February 2013. HAL's Light Combat Helicopter is reported to feature a digital camouflage system. During October 2018, leaked images of a future as- of-yet unnamed Kamov helicopter that possessed stealth features appeared online. The footage was displayed in a meeting chaired by Sergei Mikheyev, General Designer of the Kamov Design Bureau, in front of Russian officials. The stealth technology used to decrease the RCS of this helicopter and to avoid its detection includes infrared heat suppressing systems and various stealthy fuselage contour constructions, in addition to an internal weapons bays. Alternative design proposals have since emerged, one harnessing an unorthodox canard configuration that was allegedly capable of great manoeuvrability and a high top speed along with its stealth features. During the 2010s, China has been working on developing stealth helicopters. The Harbin Z-19 attack helicopter, which was derived from the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin, had reportedly integrated several stealth features to enhance its survivability. In 2013, rumours circulated that China had reverse engineered its own stealth helicopter using knowledge gained from the Osama bin Laden raid; China has issued strong denials that it has ever had access to the stealth helicopter's wreckage. During late 2015, reports emerged that a new Chinese attack helicopter with stealthy characteristics was being actively developed.

It shows a man in a small dismasted rudderless fishing boat struggling against the waves of the sea, and was the artist's statement on a theme that had interested him for more than a decade.Cooper, 217 Homer vacationed often in Florida, Cuba, and the Caribbean. Background Homer crossed the Gulf Stream numerous times; his first trip to the Caribbean in 1885 seems to have inspired several related works dated from the same year, including a pencil drawing of a dismasted boat, a large watercolor The Derelict (Sharks), and a larger watercolor of the forward part of the boat, Study for \\"The Gulfstream\\".Cikovsky, 382 A later watercolor study was The Gulfstream of 1889, in which the disabled boat now includes a sailor and flailing shark. Additionally, there are other related watercolors; the shark in Shark Fishing of 1885 was later appropriated for The Gulfstream of 1889,Cooper, 143 and a watercolor of 1899 entitled After the Hurricane, in which a figure lies unconscious beside his beached boat, represents the finale of the watercolor narrative of man against nature.Cooper, 215-216 After the Hurricane, painted by Homer in 1899, depicts a man washed up on a beach after a storm. Another possible inspiration for the series of watercolors and The Gulf Stream itself was McCabe's Curse, a Bahamian tale about a British Captain McCabe who in 1814 was robbed by thieves, hired a small boat in hopes of reaching a nearby island, but was caught in a storm and later died in Nassau of yellow fever; Homer saved an account of the story and pasted it into a travel guide. A visit to Nassau and Florida between December 1898 and February 1899 immediately preceded the final painting.Cikovsky, 369 Homer began work on the painting by September 1899, at which time he wrote: \\"I painted in water colors three months last winter at Nassau, & have now just commenced arranging a picture from some of the studies.\\"Spassky, 35-37 Chronologically the first of a series of major works painted by Homer in the last decade of his life, The Gulf Stream was painted in the penultimate year of the century, the year after the death of his father, and has been seen as revealing his sense of abandonment or vulnerability. Exhibition and reaction In 1900, Homer sent The Gulf Stream to Philadelphia to be exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and after it was returned later that year he wrote \\"I have painted on the picture since it was in Philadelphia and improved it very much (more of the Deep Sea water than before).\\"Spassky, 37 In fact, comparison with an early photograph of the painting shows that Homer not only reworked the ocean, but changed the starboard gunwale by breaking it, added the sail and the red dash of color near the waterline, made the boat's name (Anna ‚Äì Key West) clearly legible, and painted in the ship at the upper left horizon‚Äîpossibly to mitigate the sense of desolation in the work. He then showed the painting at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, and asked $4,000 for it. In 1906, The Gulf Stream was exhibited at the National Academy of Design, and all the members of the academy's jury petitioned the Metropolitan Museum of Art to purchase the painting.Spassky, 39 Newspaper reviews of the work were mixed; it was seen as more melodramatic than Homer's usual work. A reviewer in Philadelphia noted that viewers had laughed at the painting, which he referred to as \\"Smiling Sharks\\", describing the scene as \\"a naked negro lying in a boat while a school of sharks [are] waltzing around him in the most ludicrous manner\\". Another contemporary critic wrote that The Gulf Stream \\"displays a certain diffusion of interest seldom seen in the canvases of [Homer's] best manner\\".Griffin, Randall C. Homer, Eakins & Anshutz: the search for American identity in the gilded age, p. 103. Penn State Press, 2004. The museum bought the painting the same year. Interpretation and influences John Singleton Copley, Watson and the Shark, 1778 Homer's intentions for The Gulf Stream are opaque. The painting has been described as \\"a particularly enigmatic and tantalizing episode, a marine puzzle that floats forever in a region of unsolved mysteries.\\"Gardner, 211 Bryson Burroughs, a onetime curator at the Metropolitan Museum, noted that it \\"assumes the proportion of a great allegory if one chooses\\".Spassky, 41 Its drama is of a romantic and heroic vein, the man stoically resigned to fate, surrounded by anecdotal detail reminiscent of Homer's early illustrative works. When a viewer requested an explanation for the narrative, Homer fairly bristled in response: > I regret very much that I have painted a picture that requires any > description....I have crossed the Gulf Stream ten times & I should know > something about it. The boat & sharks are outside matters of very little > consequence. They have been blown out to sea by a hurricane. You can tell > these ladies that the unfortunate negro who now is so dazed & parboiled, > will be rescued & returned to his friends and home, & ever after live > happily.Spassky, 38-39 The painting alludes to John Singleton Copley's 1778 composition, Watson and the Shark, as well as a handful of dramatic marine paintings of the 19th century. In American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America, Robert Hughes contrasts Homer's picture with Copley's. While Copley's shark jaw is alien in form and most likely drawn from second-hand accounts, Homer's‚Äî owing to the artist's familiarity with the subject‚Äî correctly captures the shark's anatomy. Secondly, in Copley's version, a rescue is imminent: the horizon is near and light in tone, and many boats, within the harbor and probably docked, are seen in the background. Homer's version, with its circling sharks, broken mast, lone figure, looming water spout, and open sea give a sense of abandonment. The ship at far left is so distant as to suggest that society, while present, is completely unattainable; it presents the viewer with a so- close-yet-so-far situation. These two paintings contrast in their immediacy as well. In Watson and the Shark there is constant movement: the boat moving forward, the downward thrust of the spear, the two men reaching down for the victim, and finally the shark which extends off the canvas. In Homer's painting, the scene is more static: the sharks seem to swim slowly around the boat which lolls in a trough between waves. The looming sharks of The Gulf Stream have been compared to the damned souls that besiege The Barque of Dante by Eug√®ne Delacroix.Cikovsky, 370 References to other 19th-century paintings, including The Barque of Dante by Eug√®ne Delacroix, The Slave Ship by J. M. W. Turner, and The Voyage of Life by Thomas Cole have been noted as well. These three paintings (in the case of the Delacroix, a preliminary study) were in one of the finest public art collections in America in the mid 19th century, that of John Taylor Johnston of New York, and it is likely that Homer was familiar with the paintings; one of his own works, Prisoners from the Front, was in the same collection.Cikovsky, 369-370 For art historian Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., The Gulf Stream is more richly informed by these artistic predecessors than by Homer's direct experiences at sea, with the circling sharks derived from the tortured souls of The Barque of Dante, the dramatic sea and sky inspired by The Slave Ship, and the \\"mode of pictorial utterance\\" akin to The Voyage of Life. Elements in the painting have been interpreted as possessing funereal references: in addition to the black cross in the boat's bow, the open hatch (representing a tomb), ropes (for lowering the body), broken mast and torn sail (shroud) have been cited for symbolic meanings.Cikovsky, 383 By contrast, the boat in Homer's painting Breezing Up (A Fair Wind) of 1876 featured an anchor in its bow, symbolic of hope. The sailor in The Gulf Stream ignores these allusions, as he pays no heed to the sharks, waterspout, nor the ship in the distance, and inverts the optimism of the romantic masterpiece Raft of the Medusa painted earlier in the century by Th√©odore G√©ricault. Homer biographer Albert Ten Eyck Gardner believed The Gulf Stream was the artist's greatest painting, and art critic Sadakichi Hartmann called it \\"one of the greatest pictures ever painted in America\\". Later assessments have been more critical of the \\"almost excessive pathos of the drama.\\" John Updike thought the painting \\"famous but on the edge of the absurd, with its overkill of sharks and waterspout\\".Updike, John. Still Looking: Essays on American Art, p. 67. Alfred A. Knopf, New York: 1997. For Sidney Kaplan, a scholar on black American culture, The Gulf Stream is the \\"masterpiece of the black image‚Äî the deathless Negro waiting stoically, Homerically for his end between waterspout and white-bellied shark.\\" Peter H. Wood has written a book interpreting the painting as an allegory of the situation of blacks in America during the slave trade and afterwards.Wood, Peter H. Weathering the Storm: Inside Winslow Homer's Gulf Stream (Mercer University Lamar Memorial Lectures), University of Georgia Press (July 7, 2004). The painting is referenced in a poem in the novel, This Ruler. In the book it is an allegory for the plight of teachers in American schools. The painting is referenced in Derek Walcott's Omeros, where the poem's narrator encounters the work on a visit to an unnamed museum and identifies the man in the painting with his character, Achille, referring to the painter as 'another Homer'.Walcott, Derek.

He is probably best remembered for the concept album Kaddish which he created with Andy Saunders using the band name Towering Inferno. Life Wolfson was born to an orthodox Jewish family in Solihull and educated at Solihull School. In his early years he learnt piano and guitar, and, at the age of 17, formed the first of a succession of bands with Saunders. Towering Inferno was conceived as a large scale multimedia stage project, involving film and electronics. Wolfson and Saunders met with and were impressed by the Hungarian poet Endre Szk√°rosi and his cryptic poetry was a stimulus for their major work, the stage show and album Kaddish, which was created over five years and is an extended reflection on the Jewish prayer of the same name, including references to the history and folk-lore of Central and Eastern Europe and to the Shoah. The music includes adaptations of Hungarian folk-songs, some of them sung by M√°rta Sebesty√©n and Szk√°rosi, Jewish chant and the sound of the shofar, and dramatic electronic sound-effects. Other musical guests included John Marshall, Chris Cutler, Tim Hodgkinson and Elton Dean. Kaddish was originally released in 1993 and described by its creators as 'a dream history of Europe in the wake of the Holocaust'. Brian Eno called it 'the most frightening record I have ever heard'. It received outstanding reviews from both the popular music and mainstream press, and performances were given all over the world. Wolfson also became a successful journalist, writing on music and film for the Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times. He died of an aortic aneurysm.

He was President of the Business Council of Australia from 2003 to 2005. The Howard Government appointed him to the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1996, where he remained until 2007. He also was the Founding Chairman of Asia Society Australia.  Career  Morgan was educated at Geelong Grammar School and the University of Melbourne where he studied law and commerce. He briefly worked as a lawyer for Arthur Robinson & Co. (Western Mining Corporation's law firm) then as a finance director at North Broken Hill (which later became North Limited). = Western Mining Corporation = Hugh is the son of former WMC CEO, Bill Morgan. After Bill died in the 1970s, Sir Arvi Parbo took Hugh under his wing and in 1976 made him Australia's youngest executive director. He was 36 years old at the time. In 1996, Morgan made the decision to spend $1.25 billion expanding the Olympic Dam mine in the far north of South Australia. He was CEO of WMC from 1990 until his retirement in 2003. = Reserve Bank of Australia = Morgan was first appointed to the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1981, but was not reappointed after a speech delivered in 1984 attracted criticism for his characterisation of aboriginal Australians. He was reappointed in 1996 and held the position until 2007.  Influence on public policy  Morgan is a vocal member of the Liberal Party of Australia and a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technology, Science and Engineering (ATSE). In 1993, Patricia Howard from The Canberra Times described Morgan as \\"an extremely high profile defender of a range of \\"hard\\" right-wing ideals\\" and a serial writer of letters to the editors of various newspapers. She claimed he had been \\"instrumental\\" in forming the H. R. Nicholls Society (an anti-arbitration group) and in funding the Centre for Independent Studies and \\"other right wing think tanks.\\" At the time of his exit from WMC Resources, Morgan was described in the Sydney Morning Herald as \\"a key business sounding board for the Federal Government\\". The former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett considered him to be one of the most influential people in Australia. Kennett described Morgan as having a \\"profound influence\\" on Australian policy debates in a \\"very quiet and yet qualitative way\\". He influenced public policy on matters of trade, taxation, greenhouse gas emissions and Native Title, and during the Howard Government was a frequent guest of the Prime Minister. = Aboriginal land rights = Morgan once claimed that Native Title threatened Australia's sovereignty, and was an outspoken opponent of Aboriginal Land Rights in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, Morgan spoke of reconciling mining with Aboriginal welfare and moderated his previously controversial commentary. =Opposition to action on climate-change= He is sceptical of global warming, opposed to the Kyoto Protocol and, as a member of the Greenhouse Mafia and president of the Lavoisier Group, was central to a campaign to prevent the Federal Liberal Government from acting to cut emissions (in collaboration with fellow former WMC executive Ray Evans). =Nuclear industrial development= Morgan advocates for the development of nuclear power in Australia. In June 2006, Hugh Morgan formed the company Australian Nuclear Energy with Fairfax chairman Ron Walker and fellow mining executive Robert Champion de Crespigny and planned to build nuclear power plants in Australia. Morgan has a 20% stake in the company. Controversially, prime minister John Howard revealed that he had a discussion with Walker about the company days before he announced an inquiry into nuclear power. The inquiry, known as UMPNER or the Switkowski Review went on to predict that Australia could potentially have 25 nuclear reactors producing a third of the country's electricity by 2050. Morgan was one of five individuals listed as consulting during the Switkowski Review. The others were: Morgan's former WMC colleague Ian Duncan, anti-nuclear activists Richard Broinowski and Helen Caldicott and scientist, Dr Tim Flannery. In 2007, Morgan told The Age that he was open to possible joint ventures with \\"key players\\" in the global nuclear business, such as Melbourne businessman John White, who had spent the prior decade developing the concept of nuclear fuel leasing. At the time, Morgan believed there were future opportunities in uranium mining, nuclear waste repositories and nuclear power plants. Treasurer John Costello wished Morgan's business partner Ron Walker \\"good luck\\" after he was informed of their Australian Nuclear Energy venture. When \\"conservation agreements\\" were made possible for \\"nuclear actions\\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, Morgan flagged how an internationally owned nuclear waste repository could be built. One such a proposal was announced for Aboriginal land during the Howard government but did not proceed. Morgan's nuclear industrial development plans stalled after the Labor party won the 2007 Federal election. In 2015, his company Australian Nuclear Energy was described as being \\"in commercial hibernation from which it is unlikely to return.\\" The concept of importing spent nuclear fuel for storage and disposal in Australia was further explored during the 2015‚Äì2016 Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission in South Australia. In January 2017, Morgan told The Australian that he planned to lobby state and Federal Australian government on the subject of nuclear power in Australia.

He had an heroic war record, winning a Military Cross (MC) and rising to the rank of Major. He was the grandson of Fred Spashett, an ex-mayor of Lowestoft and Lloyd's agent, who together with his son George Spashett, who had also won an MC in the First World War, had built up a large business in the port, but which had been decimated by the second war and the early death of George Spashett. Together with Bill Suddaby, Maurice Hepton and Gordon Claridge, Cartwright built up a Lowestoft fishing fleet of some 130 vessels reaching its peak in the 1960s, employing some 1,500 fishermen and giving employment to marine engineers, fish merchants and processors, ship chandlers, net manufacturers, electronic and wireless workers, fuel suppliers and a host of other suppliers.

The film consists of six different short stories. It stars Saif Ali Khan, Vivek Oberoi, Aftab Shivdasani, Shilpa Shetty, Sameera Reddy, Isha Koppikar, Nana Patekar, Sohail Khan, among many others. Its basic premise is loosely inspired from the movie Campfire Tales . Upon release it met with extremely positive response, making it as a cult classic movie, later in 2006 Verma spawned Darna Zaroori Hai, a sequel with a different ensemble cast, six new cinematographers, seven different directors. Only Rajpal Yadav and director Prawaal Raman were back from the previous installment. Plot Darna Mana Hai interweaves six stories into one film. Seven friends get stuck in the middle of a forest when their car breaks down, and all of them except Vikas find refuge in an abandoned house. To keep each other amused, they tell each other horror and supernatural stories that they have heard over a bonfire. =Story 1 - On the Way= The first story revolves around a married couple, Karan (Sohail Khan) and Anjali (Antara Mali), who get stuck in the middle of a forest. After their car suddenly stops, Karan gets out to investigate the problem. After his disappearance and his constant cries for help from the desolated forest, Anjali gets out and runs into the forest to rescue him. She finds Karan's torch covered in blood and is stalked by an unseen person or supernatural being. Panicking, Anjali runs around and finds a hand reaching out of a swamp. She then becomes terrified to find that the hand is wearing a watch identical to her husband's. After failed attempts to rescue him, the hand disappears. Someone creeps up on her and as Anjali screams; it turns out to be Karan. Karan seems completely normal and fine, while Anjali, whimpering, attempts to tell him that she heard him screaming. However, Karan tells her that he heard her screams from the forest when he went to retrieve water. She looks at the torch that she found, which is suddenly clean of the blood that it was covered in. She then hurries back to the car with Karan, telling him to get them both out of there. After quickly fixing the car problem with the water, Karan and the panicked Anjali climb into the car and drive off. After seeing Anjali's anxious and worried state, Karan puts his arm around her as she leans on him and closes her eyes. He then smirks and looks into the rearview mirror of the car, in which his reflection is not visible and Anjali seems to be leaning on nothing. After this story, one of the friends who gets frightened goes back to the car. =Story 2 - No Smoking= The second story is about a photographer, Anil (Saif Ali Khan), who checks into an inn while on his way to Mumbai. The manager and owner (Boman Irani) of the lodge is a strange and eccentric man who insists that smoking is strongly prohibited in his inn. When Anil tries to go outside for a smoke, the man restricts him, telling him about the diseases that come along with smoking. The owner then locks Anil inside the lodge and tells him that in a matter of months, he can cure his smoking addiction. The owner takes Anil to a basement of sorts and shows him piles of dead bodies, telling him that he tried to prevent them, but these people would not stop smoking. After a few months, Anil is now seen working at the lodge, acting strange and eccentric himself. When a customer walks in smoking and asks him for a room, Anil tells him that smoking is strongly prohibited. When the customer displays indifference, Anil proceeds to shoot the man with a gun. The story ends with Anil and the owner sitting together, smiling, and watching a commercial about the effects of smoking. After this story, a second friend in the group around the bonfire goes to the car looking for a blanket. When she leaves, the body of the first girl who left the bonfire is shown. The second girl is chased around the forest, caught and stabbed by an unseen assailant. =Story 3 - Homework= The third story is that of a school teacher named Dayashankar Pandey (Raghubir Yadav). He confronts a student named Pramila, who is always punished for not completing her homework. One day, when Pandey asks Pramila to hold out her hand for punishment (assuming that she did not do her homework), Pramila produces her homework instead. However, her homework elicits a strange reaction from Pandey. Every day following this, the incident repeats itself, making Pandey increasingly anxious. Upon a suggestion from a coworker that she might be receiving help from parents or a tutor, Pandey calls upon Pramila's mother (Revathi). She denies about helping her daughter. He then asks about the Om sign that Pramila draws on every page of her homework. The mother shrugs it off, which forces Pandey to drop the topic. Later, Pandey decides to go to Pramila's house. He confronts Pramila and explains that he once murdered his intelligent friend, Varun, in jealousy and that he thinks Pramila is a reincarnation of his friend. He says that he drew the Om sign to prove it. He realizes he is slipping into insanity and leaves apologizing. On the way back home, he is confronted by the spirit of his childhood friend Varun, who lets him know, \\"You are not insane [yet]. But you will be.\\" By the next morning, Pandey loses his sanity and he keeps on scribbling basic mathematics on the road. After this story is told, another friend in the group leaves the bonfire looking for the girls who had left them before. He reaches the car to discover Vikas killed by the knife that he had in his hand. When he goes back to warn his friends he also was confronted by the mysterious attacker. =Story 4 - Apples= The fourth story focuses on a housewife named Gayatri (Shilpa Shetty), who goes to a market and comes across a vendor (Rajpal Yadav) selling apples for Rs. 20 as compared to everyone else selling apples at Rs. 60. She buys the apples from the vendor, but his demeanour and behaviour unsettles her. When she gets home, her husband Sanjay (Sanjay Kapoor) eats one of the apples and finds it very tasty. Gayatri worries that something might happen to Sanjay after eating the apples, as she harbours suspicions about the vendor. The next morning, when Gayathri wakes up, she is shocked to find an apple next to her instead of her husband. She runs outside and is astonished to see apples everywhere on the ground, seemingly that every person who has eaten an apple has turned into one. The vendor then appears with an evil look, offering Gayatri his last apple for free. =Story 5 - Ghostly Lift= In the fifth story, an elderly man named John Rodrigues (Nana Patekar) is standing at a graveyard. A young man in sunglasses, Amar (Vivek Oberoi), drives by and gives John a lift. Amar asks John why he was at the graveyard, as he thinks that John's wife is dead so he might have come to visit her grave. However, John says that it is actually he who is dead. Amar dismisses it as a joke. After some more conversation, Amar gets exasperated by John's strange behavior. Amar then stops the car, gets out, and asks John to get out. John then explains that he works for MTV Bakra (a program similar to Punk'd) and Amar is the first person not to get scared. Amar says that he was not scared because he knew beforehand that John was not a ghost. He says that he knew this because he himself is a ghost. John thinks that Amar is now trying to play a prank to get back at him. Amar then takes off his sunglasses, revealing that his eyes are hollow, before disappearing. When John sees this, he dies of shock. Back in real time, at the end of the fifth story, only two friends are left, as none of the five have returned. The two of them start talking about other things when a man suddenly appears, sitting at a corner. The strange man (revealed to be Sushant Singh) approaches the two and tells them that he has heard the five stories. He asks the boy out of the two friends to tell a story, who narrates the following. =Story 6 ‚Äì Stop/Move= The sixth and final story is about a young student, Purab (Aftab Shivdasani), and his love interest, Abhilasha (Isha Koppikar). Purab contemplates suicide because Abhilasha rejects his advances and nobody else in his college likes him either. He sadly rants about not being special in front of an idol. Later, he discovers that he has developed an extraordinary ability - he can immobilize a particular person just by saying \\"Stop\\" to them. Purab uses his ability to freeze Abhilasha, and later imitates it to her by immobilizing a number of students in their college. Abhilasha, frightened of Purab's power, agrees to date him. Thereafter, Purab goes to his house and uses his power on his father on the way to his room. In his room, he, in delight of his ability, starts making plans to use his power. As he looks into the mirror, he says \\"Stop\\", which freezes him on the spot. His father finds him like that in his room, with a victorious smile frozen on his face. He is immediately rushed to the hospital but in vain. =Ending= The strange man tells the two friends that it is his turn now to tell a story. He tells them a story that they are partly familiar with. A group of seven friends are travelling when their car breaks down one night. They seek shelter under a ruined shack and start telling stories to each other to kill time. After each story, one friend in the group (supposedly frightened) goes out into the forest and gets killed, one by one, until only two are left. The two friends that are left stop telling stories to each other and the killer, who is now bored, comes out to them. The killer appears to be the very same strange man that is narrating this story. He says that his only reason for the murders is fear because he cannot stand it and would kill anyone who is scared. The man then kills the boy. The girl, Shruti (Sameera Reddy), runs into the forest as fast as she can, but the killer catches up to her and stabs her. She manages to kill the man before falling unconscious. When day breaks, Shruti awakens and walks up to the main road to find that the place is swarming with police and her friends' bodies are being taken into ambulances. Then, she sees the killer standing by a car, smiling. Shruti points at the man and tries to tell the police that he is the murderer, but the police takes no notice of her and appears not to hear her. The killer then points at a body, which she shockingly discovers to be her own. She realizes that she too is dead and is now a ghost, and watches their bodies being taken away with tears in her eyes. As she watches, she is joined by the ghosts of her friends and the killer.

Life Miller became an apprentice to William Archibald in 1814. His first published engraving was in that year, of an apple tree for William Archibald. This engraving appeared in Vol I of the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society. He spent four years with William Archibald, then setting up on his own account. At the end of 1819 he moved to Hackney to join the workshop of George Cooke. The premium paid for his 18-month stay with Cooke was ¬£240. Other apprentices with Cooke included William Shotter Boys. In the 1830s his address is listed as 4 Hope Park, in the Meadows area of Edinburgh. Works Whilst an apprentice with Cooke, Miller drew a series of plants from the neighbouring nursery of Loddiges. These were engraved by Cooke and published in volumes v - vii of Loddiges Botanical Cabinet, London, J. and A. Arch, 1820 - 1822. Cattleya labiata 2, from Jefferson's Legacy, the collection of Library of Congress (Loddiges & Sons', The Botanical Cabinet. London, 1817-1833) Miller was one of the principal engravers of J. M. W. Turner.His engravings after Turner included Portsmouth, Clovelly Bay and Comb Martin for An Antiquarian Tour Round the South Coast, J and A Arch, 1826; Bass Rock for Scott's Provincial Antiquities of Scotland, 1826; seven plates Straits of Dover, Great Yarmouth, Stamford, Windsor Castle, Chatham, Carew Castle and Durham Cathedral for Picturesque Views in England and Wales, London, Longman and Co, 1838. James Giles, one of William Miller's pupils, wrote some reminiscences of his time as an apprentice at Hope Park. Writing from Redhill on 17 September 1883 (published privately in Memorials of Hope Park): > \\"Wm Miller's admiration of Turner was unbounded, and his pupils soon caught > the infection. The drawings, which at first sight looked so mysterious and > unintelligible, the more they were pondered, unfolded their wondrous meaning > and beauty; and from my own experience I can testify, that sitting for weeks > before the same drawing, I did not tire over them, as was the case with > inferior pictures. The plates executed from 1833 to 1836 consisted of the > illustrations to Scott's Works, Turner's 'Annual Tour', Gainsborough's > 'Watering Place', a large Venice, by Turner and, of course, some plates of > less note. The plates for Rogers's poems were engraved before my time, but > not published till afterwards; these are probably the most exquisite gems > that ever were, or ever will be produced. I beg however to differ from > Ruskin in my estimate of them. I like Loch Lomond, and the old Ancestral > Hall better than the vignette, with the fountain, at the beginning of the > volume...........The Gainsborough was entirely the work of your father's own > hand; it was done from a smaller copy of the original in the National > Gallery. The pencil drawing was sent as usual to be transferred by the > printer through the rolling press on to the etching ground, but when it came > back the drawing was found to have shifted during the process, and the > transferred outlines were thick and blurred. I should have been appalled, > but your father made light of it, and etched away as if it had been all > right. \\"I need hardly say that it is as the interpreter of Turner your > father's fame very much rests, and that Turner himself preferred 'the Scotch > Quaker' to all other engravers. The skill with which he translated the high > aerial effects was beyond all rivalry.......... \\"In making the outline > drawings for transference to the plate, we were instructed to preserve every > minute touch, indeed, keeping the touch was a point much insisted on. I > remember an amusing instance of this. I was etching the Pass of > Killicrankie, a vignette for Scott's Works; cottages were in flames, and the > dead lying in the foreground; in the distance was a row of dark spots - the > subject suggested they might be a regiment of soldiers, at the same time > they looked very much like fir-trees. I asked your father's opinion, he > reply was 'Oh, just keep the touch, and they can be taken for either.' He > was not, however, so particular in the case of architecture; and when > Edinburgh, from St. Anthony's Chapel, was in hand, he sent me to the spot to > make sketches of the principal buildings in the distance. The High School in > Turner's drawing was little more than a white patch. Your father did the > foreground, and I believe, the sheep, but St. Anthony's Chapel, and the > various distant buildings were etched by me - the latter from the sketches I > had taken. For closeness of line and minute detail, it is the most laborious > plate I was ever engaged on, and will, I believe, bear looking at through a > magnifier. Of course, the beautiful effects depend entirely on the finish of > your father. I had only to do with the mechanical part - the body - the soul > is his. In the case of Turner's figures, perhaps keeping the touch was > carried too far. Nantfrangon, Carnarvonshire. Engraving by Miller c.1850 > \\"Your father usually etched the foreground of the plates his pupils worked > upon; and was fond of etching water, both rough and smooth, which was > remarkable for its liquid effect. \\"Turner's touched proofs were always an > object of interest in the workroom. I recollect on the margin of one of them > he had written. 'Mr Miller will please return all my touched proofs.' > Whether this was done I cannot say; but they are generally considered the > property of the engraver. They must be of considerable value.\\" Large single prints by Miller after Turner include The Grand Canal for Hodgson and Graves, 1837; Modern Italy for F G Moon, issued as the Presentation Plate for the National Art Union in 1843; and The Rhine, Osterprey and Feltzen for D T White in 1852. His last engraved work was a series of vignettes after Myles Birket Foster to illustrate two volumes of the poems of Thomas Hood, published by Moxon in 1871 and 1872.

The film was directed by George A. Romero and stars Timothy Hutton as Thad Beaumont and George Stark, Amy Madigan as Liz Beaumont, Michael Rooker as Sheriff Alan Pangborn, and Royal Dano in his final film. Plot An author of highbrow literary novels, Thad Beaumont (Timothy Hutton), is better known for the bestselling murder mystery suspense-thrillers he writes under the pen name \\"George Stark\\". Beaumont wishes to retire the Stark name and symbolically buries Stark in a mock grave. However, Stark has mysteriously become a physical entity (also portrayed by Hutton) and begins terrorizing Beaumont's family and friends after he emerges from the grave. Stark then kills local photographer Homer Gamache and steals his truck. He also murders Thad's editor, agent, and his agent's ex-wife, and kills a man named Fred Clawson, who was trying to blackmail Thad for \\"being a con artist that should not have written books under a false name\\". When the police suspect Thad of murdering Gamache, he tries to convince Sheriff Alan Pangborn of Castle Rock, Maine he had nothing to do with it. After putting an all- points bulletin on Clawson, who was accused of the death of Gamache, the New York police find him castrated and his throat slit. They find a message on the wall, written in Clawson's blood, \\"The sparrows are flying again.\\" Thad starts to think that he may have a psychic connection to the killer. While in his office, Thad begins to receive messages from Stark, and begins to worry about the next victim. He and his family start to receive threatening phone calls from Stark. Pangborn initially suspects the phone calls are a prank by Thad himself until Stark begins to describe how he is going to kill Thad's family, disturbing Pangborn. State Police find Homer Gamache's truck with Thad's fingerprints all over it. For some reason, Stark wants to live in the material world, after only appearing in a set of Thad's best selling books. Thad writes, but he is not alone in suspecting something strange: Sheriff Pangborn is equally suspicious and continues investigating. Thad begins to realize that Stark is, in fact, his parasitic twin brother who died at \\"childbirth.\\" His mother never told Thad about the twin, and he was completely unaware until a local doctor tells him that Stark was a fraternal twin that was living inside Thad's brain. (A scene in the film's start shows a developing fetus inside Beaumont's brain). Stark arrives, kills the doctor, and blames Thad for the crime. Thad's colleague Reggie realizes that Stark is an entity controlled by the books that Thad wrote and that Stark will do anything he can to stop Thad. Stark kidnaps Thad's wife Liz and his children, and makes a deal with Thad: finishing a book that depicts Stark living in the real world, or he will kill his family. While writing the book, Thad notices Stark is healing himself with his writings, as George started to deteriorate due to Thad not writing anymore books, causing Thad to absorb his sickness. Thad and Stark get into a fight, which ends with Thad stabbing Stark in the neck with a pencil. Sheriff Pangborn arrives and unties Liz, who says that Thad and Stark are upstairs. However, a huge flock of sparrows inexplicably comes and tears Stark apart, and take him \\"back to hell where he belongs\\".

Members of the faculty and student body served as extras in the film. The residence featured in the film is a home located on Maple Avenue in the Edgewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The film was Romero's second foray into filming with the support of a major film production company (his first being Monkey Shines), causing some problems for the notoriously low-budget director. The film was shot from October 1990 until March 1991. It was not released for two years because of Orion Pictures' bleak financial situation at the time. The film eventually saw release in April 1993, taking in just over $10 million domestically.The Dark Half (1993) Reception In its opening week The Dark Half ranked in the box office charts at number 6, gathering a total of $3,250,883 from 1,563 theatres.https://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1993&wknd;=17&p;=.htm Critics gave the film mixed reviews, though they praised Timothy Hutton's performance in the film as well as the screenplay. On Rotten Tomatoes, it currently holds a 58% from 33 reviews with an average score of 5.78/10. The critics consensus reads, ‚ÄùThe Dark Half is a highly serious psychological study that can be faulted for being more curious than actually scary.‚Äù Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, praising Hutton's against type performance as Stark that \\"definitively shed his nice-guy image\\". However, Ebert faulted The Dark Half for failing to \\"develop its preternatural opening theme\\" and never offering a satisfactory explanation for Stark's existence.Ebert, Roger, \\"The Dark Half,\\" rogerebert.com, 23 April 1993 Awards *Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films **Saturn Award Best Director - George A.

The two patrolman employed were invested with full police powers under the Ohio Revised Code 311.29(c)(d), 505.43.2, and were given authority to enforce Chautauqua rules and regulations. In the 1950s the police force was dissolved and police protection was then the responsibility of the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office. A special division for Lakeside was formed for the Sheriff's Deputies assigned to the community. This division was later called the Lakeside Association Police Department. The department was headed by a Chief Deputy, and staffed by two Sheriff's Deputies and two non-sworn personnel employed by the Association who were titled Lakeside Security Guards. Community Duties Lakeside Police were responsible for patrolling the Association streets and property bordering Marblehead and Danbury Township, Ottawa County, Ohio, and they were also called at times to assist local police departments in Marblehead Danbury Township. The non-sworn personnel or Lakeside Security Guards performed most of the community building checks, patrols, and other non-law enforcement duties for the Association. Also community parades were escorted by both Lakeside Security and Lakeside Police. In 1989 the department was the first in the area to use computers and the software DataManagerPC for police report writing. This gave the department a tech-edge till 1995. After changes in the department in 1998 the computer system was again reinstituted till 2000. Lakeside Police History and Its Presence Today The Lakeside Association Police Department was dissolved in 1994 due to personnel issues, along with the State of Ohio removing police powers and arrest authorities from \\"Chautauquas\\" throughout Ohio, citied in the Ohio Revised Code. The Ottawa County Sheriff's Office deputies that were assigned to the Lakeside Police Department after the change became \\"Lakeside Security Officers/Special Deputies\\". The Ottawa County Sheriff's Office continued to patrol the community but it was under contract by providing one deputy through 1995. After 1998, The Lakeside Association continued to provide their own protection by forming the Lakeside Security Department along with the Danbury Township Police, due to the association property being with the township jurisdiction, and the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office. The former Lakeside Police, radios, computers, and misc. equipment was soon utilized by the department. Early in 1998, the department (which was based on the outskirts of the grounds in the \\"municipal services building\\") had two patrol cars, and several officers patrolling, this was done by cruisers, foot, or on bicycle. Although most of the officers were civilians in stature having with no arrest power, the department hired several officers, having peace officer status, with arrest powers certification from the Ohio Peace Officer Training Commission (OPOTC). Some of the officers at the time were also cross trained as emergency medical technicians (EMT's) and/or firefighters, given greater safety coverage for the residents and visitors. This was the most and diverse staff ever employed at once in the history of the Department. As the economy changed so did the Lakeside Security Department and no longer holds the traditions of the past. The patrols cars have left in the years afterwards, thus shortly after so did the traditional uniform. Currently the department has downsized, the patrols are done primarily in golf carts, and a marked patrol pick-up with no overhead warning lights. The uniform has become polo shirts, and shorts (summer), and slacks (winter).

The film, which tells the story of Kermit the Frog's early life, is a prequel to The Muppet Movie (1979). Kermit's Swamp Years was released on VHS and DVD and on the Starz network on August 18, 2002. Although the film rights are still owned by Sony Pictures rather than The Walt Disney Company, Kermit's Swamp Years was filmed at the Disney-MGM Studios, which is now known as Disney's Hollywood Studios. Plot The movie opens in the swamp lands that Kermit the Frog calls home. After meeting his old friend Horace D'Fly again, he recaps an adventure from his childhood where he enjoyed a serene amphibian's life with his smooth and confident best friend, Croaker the Frog, and a nervous and cowardly friend of his, Goggles the Toad. Young Kermit wonders what lies beyond the swamp, but his companions do not think the same. The friends run into Dr. Hugo Krassman (John Hostetter) and his assistant Mary (Kelly Collins Lintz), intent on capturing frogs. Arnie the alligator saves them and warns them about the dangers lurking outside the swamp. The next day, they run into the bully Blotch, a huge bullfrog, who attacks Goggles. The fight spills onto a road, where the pair are taken by a pet store owner named Wilson (William Bookston), and Kermit and Croaker venture forth on a quest to save their friends. When Goggles and Blotch are taken into a pet store, Blotch's anger causes the pair to be put in a cage with Vicki the snake, who intends to eat Blotch. Goggles saves him by goading Vicki to attack him and then using his poison gland. Meanwhile, the other animals at the store manage to convince Goggles and Blotch in a lively musical number that being sold to someone as a pet isn't such a bad idea. After getting run over by Wilson's truck and having tire tracks on his chest, Croaker is no longer able to hop and starts to lose his bravery. Kermit and Croaker meet a stray dog named Pilgrim (voiced by Cree Summer), who saves them from Krassman and Mary, then decides to help them find their friends. Kermit is able to find Wilson's truck by using helium balloons, but discovers they are no longer in the vehicle. Kermit reconnects with Pilgrim and Croaker again, and together they find Wilson's Pet Store. After Kermit gives him a short pep talk, Croaker finally manages to hop again by hopping through the window and helps Kermit up the window, but they find out from Vicki that their friends have gone to George Washington High School. The next day, Kermit and Croaker intentionally get discovered by Wilson to get taken to the high school and escape upon arrival. They meet Pilgrim again, who followed them. While trying to find Goggles and Blotch, Pilgrim and Croaker get captured by Wilson. Kermit overhears Wilson heading to biology class, so he hitches a ride on a student's backpack. Krassman decides to dissect Goggles, but Blotch takes his place to return the favor for rescuing them from Vicki. Krassman discides to dissect Croaker instead, when Wilson brings him into the class. Mary refuses to show the class how the dissection is done, so she leaves the classroom. In a daring rescue, Kermit manages to free Croaker from the dissection table and fend off Dr. Krassman using some swashbuckling techniques he picked up earlier at a movie theater, but Krassman is able to defeat Kermit, Croaker, and Blotch. Goggles finds the knife that Kermit dropped, but after he picks it up, Krassman spots him. Despite the warnings that Kermit should never talk to humans, Kermit stops Krassman from dissecting Goggles by talking and asks him to please release the frogs. This action leads Krassman to reveal that as a child, he was about to dissect his first frog when the frog begged him to stop, but the frog refused to say anything to everyone else in Krassman's classroom, which caused him to be humiliated. With the truth revealed that frogs can talk, Krassman frees all the frogs, dismisses the class and enables Kermit and his friends to return home. After a ride back to the swamp's border in Wilson's truck, Wilson adopts Pilgrim and the four friends head back home. Back in the present, Kermit says that they are all still friends. He then enters the swamp to meet up with his three old friends, and Horace D'Fly is seen singing.

The Mutilated Heroine: A strange man approached a miller and offered him wealth in exchange for what was standing behind the mill. Thinking that it was just an apple tree, and unaware that the strange man was actually the devil, the miller agreed. He soon found out that it was actually his daughter standing behind the mill and that the man was the devil. When three years had passed, the devil reappeared to take the girl as he said he would, but the girl had kept herself sinless and her hands clean, and the devil was unable to take her. The devil threatened to take the miller instead if he did not chop off his daughter's hands. Out of fear, the miller and his daughter agreed to do so. However, she continued to weep onto the stumps where her hands once were, so they remained clean and the devil was still unable to take her. Marriage to the King: She decided to set out into the world to escape, despite her father's new wealth. She came upon a royal garden and saw fruit on the trees. After walking all day, she was hungry and wanted to eat the fruit, so she prayed that she be able to get into the garden. An angel appeared and helped her. The next day, the king noticed that pears were missing and his gardener told him that he had seen a spirit taking them. The king awaited her and approached her when she came back to the garden the next day. She told him that everyone had abandoned her and he said that he wouldn't abandon her. Soon after, he married her and made her the queen and gave her new hands made out of silver. A year later, she gave birth to a son; and the king's mother sent news of his birth to the king who had gone off to battle. The messenger made a stop along the way, and the devil changed the letter to say that the queen had given birth to a changeling. The king sent back that they should care for the child nonetheless, but the devil stole that letter too and reworded it once again. This time, making it say that they should kill the queen and the child and keep the queen's heart as proof. The Culminated Wife: The king's mother despaired. To aid the queen and her son, she killed a deer for its heart and told the queen to take her child into the world to hide. The queen went into the forest and prayed for help, and an angel appeared and brought her to a hut and nursed her son. She lived in this hut in the forest for seven years, and eventually her hands miraculously grew back. The Hands Restored: The king returned to his castle and discovered the letters had been tampered with, so he set out to find his wife and child. After seven years, he found the hut that the angel took the queen into. He was brought inside by an angel and laid down to sleep with a handkerchief to cover his face. His wife appeared and the handkerchief fell from his face. The child became angry because he had been told that God was man's one and only father. The king asked who they were, and the queen told him that they were his wife and son. He initially did not believe her and said that his wife had silver hands. She replied that God had given her real hands and retrieved her silver hands that had fallen off and showed the king. The king rejoiced at finding his wife. They both went back to their kingdom and lived happily ever after. Variants The Brothers Grimm altered the tale they had collected, incorporating a motif found in other fairy tales of a child unwittingly promised (a motif found in \\"Nix Nought Nothing\\", \\"The Nixie of the Mill-Pond\\", \\"The Grateful Prince\\", and \\"King Kojata\\"), but not in the original version of this one. Indeed, one study of German folk tales found that of 16 variants collected after the publication of Grimms' Fairy Tales, only one followed the Grimms in this opening.Linda Degh, \\"What Did the Grimm Brothers Give To and Take From the Folk?\\" p 76 James M. McGlathery, ed, The Brothers Grimm and Folktale, In earlier and starker versions of the tale found around the world, the maiden's dismemberment comes when she refuses the sexual advances of her father or her brother, as in the Xhosa version of the tale, \\"A Father Cuts Off His Daughter's Arms\\".Midori Snyder, \\"The Armless Maiden and The Hero's Journey\\" In Basile's Penta of the Chopped-off Hands, the heroine has her own hands cut off to repulse her brothers' advances.Jack Zipes, The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, p 512, Other variants of this tale include \\"The One-Handed Girl\\", \\"The Armless Maiden\\", and \\"Biancabella and the Snake,\\" all of which are Aarne-Thompson type 706. This is not the most common form of fairy tale to contain the father who attempts to marry his daughter. \\"Allerleirauh\\", \\"The King Who Wished to Marry His Daughter\\", and others of Aarne-Thompson type 510B are found more frequently.Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 64 However, this motif was taken up in chivalric romance exclusively in tales such as \\"The Girl Without Hands\\"; no romance includes the Cinderella-like ending of three balls that are the characteristic conclusion of the persecuted heroine. The oldest such retelling appears in \\"Vitae Duorum Offarum\\", naming the king Offa; the king himself appears to be historical, but the details of his kingdom are inaccurate.Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 65-6 Other romances that use the plotline of this fairy tale include \\"Emar√©\\", \\"Mai and Beaflor\\", and \\"La Belle Helene de Constantinople\\".Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 70-1 The mother falsely accused of giving birth to strange children is in common between tales of this type and that of Aarne-Thompson 707, where the woman has married the king because she has said she would give birth to marvelous children, as in \\"The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird\\", \\"Princess Belle-Etoile\\", \\"Ancilotto, King of Provino\\", \\"The Wicked Sisters\\", and \\"The Three Little Birds\\".Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p 121-2, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 A related theme appears in Aarne-Thompson type 710, where the heroine's children are stolen from her at birth, leading to the slander that she killed them, as in \\"Mary's Child\\" or \\"The Lassie and Her Godmother\\".Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p 122-3, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 In the second part of the tale, the Brothers Grimm also departed from the commonest folklore themes. Typically, the girl is the victim of her mother-in-law, as in \\"The Twelve Wild Ducks\\", \\"The Six Swans\\", Perrault's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", and \\"The Twelve Brothers\\".Maria Tatar, Off with Their Heads! p. 123 This motif, where the (male) villain stems from an earlier grudge, also appears in the French literary tale \\"Bearskin\\". Commentary Various attempts have been made to explain why her hands are the target of her father's -- or sometimes her brother's -- rage at being thwarted, but the motif, though widespread, has never been clear, and when motives are supplied, they vary greatly. In \\"Penta of the Chopped-off Hands\\", Basile went to great lengths to provide a motif for his heroine's actions: her brother, exclaiming over her beauty, dwells with particular detail on the loveliness of her hands.Maria Tatar, Off with Their Heads! p. 121-2 In the chivalric romance \\"La Manekine\\", the princess does it herself because by law the king can not marry any woman missing any part of her body.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England, New York Burt Franklin,1963 p 32-3 By losing her hands, the girl in this story becomes helpless and very much at the whim of anyone that can help her. In Grimms' fairy tales, male protagonists are more likely to become deformed or disabled because of an evil or supernatural force than women protagonists. However, women's deformity is more likely to leave her passive and helpless, whereas a male's deformity often makes him an outcast but does not cause him to lose his agency.Muse, Project, and Ann Schmiesing. Disability, Deformity, and Disease in the Grimms' Fairy Tales. N.p.: Wayne State UP, 2014. Print. This has to do with the fact that in 19th century literature, women were not given much of a platform to contribute. The girl's lack of hands is representative of the culture that this story originated in.Paradi≈æ, Valerie, (1995). Clever Maids: The Secret History of the Grimm Fairy Tales (New York: Basic Books) This story has maintained a similar appeal as stories such as Cinderella and Snow White, but without maintaining mainstream appeal. It has been adapted countless times in various different mediums over the years, but never on as large a scale as other Grimms' stories that grew to be popular. This can be attributed to the fact that the themes of abuse and resilience that are prevalent in this story were too inappropriate for it to become popular among young children in the same way that other stories have. However, the story is still told and is recognized as an example of oppression, abuse, and perseverance in folklore. Adaptations = Literature = * Many contemporary fiction writers and poets have found inspiration in this fairy tale. Examples include Loranne Brown's novel The Handless Maiden, Midori Snyder's short story \\"The Armless Maiden\\", and poems by Margaret Atwood (\\"Girl Without Hands\\"), Elline Lipkin (\\"Conversations With My Father\\"), Vicki Fever (\\"The Handless Maiden\\"), Nan Fry (\\"Pear\\"), Rigoberto Gonz√°lez (\\"The Girl With No Hands\\"). Andrea L. Peterson's No Rest for the Wicked has a character named Clare, the girl from this story. * Anne Sexton wrote an adaptation as a poem called \\"The Maiden without Hands\\" in her collection Transformations (1971), a book in which she re-envisions sixteen of the Grimm's Fairy tales.\\"Transformations by Anne Sexton\\" * Stephanie Oakes wrote a modern retelling called \\"The Sacred Lies of Minnow Bly\\", a Young Adult book about a 17-year-old girl with no hands, living in prison. * Terri Windling published an anthology of modern fairy tale retellings entitled \\"The Armless Maiden: And Other Tales of Childhood's Survivors\\" which retells fairy tales in the context of child abuse. = Video games = \\"The Girl Without Hands\\" was adapted in an episode of American McGee's Grimm where at the end the girl takes revenge on her father with the use of her husband's army. =Theatre= * In 2011, the story was also the basis for a production by Kneehigh Theatre called The Wild Bride. * The story was adapted into a play by director Miyagi Satoshi and performed in Japan from 2011 to 2012.Murai Mayako. ‚ÄúSh≈çjo to Akuma to F≈´shagoya (The Girl Without Hands) and Honmono No Ianse (The True Bride).‚Äù Marvels & Tales, vol. 27, no. 2, Nov. 2013, pp. 344‚Äì346.

It concerns Jerome, a composer, who develops a plan to persuade his estranged wife Corinna that his home life is sufficiently stable for her to allow their daughter to stay with him. The plan involves both an actress and a gynoid (the female equivalent of an android). Henceforward... was Ayckbourn's thirty-fourth full-length play. It was first performed at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough in 1987. It received its West End premiere at the Vaudeville Theatre on the Strand, London in October 1988 where Jerome was played by Ian McKellen, (who was knighted in 1990, becoming Sir Ian McKellen). Corinna was played by Jane Asher. This production won the 1989 Best Comedy category at the Evening Standard Awards for London theatre. Characters * Jerome, a composer * Corinna, his wife * Geain, their daughter **Aged 13 **Aged 9 (video only) * Lupus, his friend (video only) * NAN 300F, an android * Zoe, an actress * Mervyn, a civil servant * Mary Hope-Fitch, an escort (video only) * Rita, a gang leader (video only) NAN 300F is played in act 1 by the actress who plays Corinna in act 2, and in act 2 by the actress who plays Zoe in act 1. Plot details The play is in two acts, the first of which has two scenes. It is set in London, England, in the future but \\"sometime quite soon\\". It is a bleak future where law and order has broken down in at least some parts of the city, and social interaction is limited by the automation of many shops and services. Composer Jerome has been estranged from his wife Corinna (a bank manager) for four years. Their 13-year-old daughter, Geain (pronounced Jane) lives with her mother. Jerome has been unable to compose music since they left and is convinced he needs Geain back with him to be his inspiration. =Act 1= The action takes place in Jerome's very untidy and neglected flat. Before the play begins, Jerome has arranged a meeting with wife Corinna and Mervyn Bickerdyke from the Department of Child Wellbeing, to convince them that it will be appropriate for Geain to stay with him for long visits. Geain is also due to come to the meeting. To help to convince them, Jerome plans to hire an actress, Zoe Mill, from an escort agency, to pose as his fianc√©e. The first act takes place one week before the meeting as he interviews Zoe for the job. Before she arrives, Jerome activates his NAN 300F ‚Äì a female android (or gynoid) whom he calls Nan. He treats Nan, who was originally designed to look after children, almost like a pet. Much of the play's humour originates from her idiosyncrasies as she collides with the furniture, blurts out unexpected remarks, and performs her tasks incompetently ‚Äì such as serving a drink with the tumbler upside down. Zoe's arrival establishes the hostile nature of the neighbourhood, as she has been mugged by a local gang (the \\"Daughters of Darkness\\") ‚Äì led by Rita. Most of the first scene of Act 1 involves the explanation of Jerome's composing, his writer's block, his need for Geain's return, his plan to act out a stable home life with Zoe, and the breakdown in law and order. Jerome describes how he writes his music by sampling real life sounds and manipulating them. Several times he plays back dialogue which has taken place on stage or in rooms off-stage. He explains that he wants to write a piece which encapsulates the concept of love ‚Äì but he has been searching for four years for the right sound to sample. The action on stage is interrupted by several video sequences involving comings and goings at the front door, film of Geain when she was 9 years old, and video answerphone messages from Jerome's friend Lupus and from Mervyn. Rita, Lupus and the younger Geain only ever appear on video, as does Mary Hope-Fitch from the agency which supplied Zoe. Because of her dispute with the Daughters of Darkness Zoe is forced to stay the night and agrees to sleep with Jerome. Act 1 scene 2 begins the next morning with Jerome working on two short compositions using secretly sampled sounds of Zoe. The first, using her laugh, she finds entertaining although she suggests some changes. The second, using sounds of their love-making, horrify her and after arguing she exits in disgust, never to reappear. This leaves Jerome with nobody to act as though she is his fianc√©e at next week's meeting. As he experiments with using Nan to create new sounds, he suddenly has the idea of having Nan play the part instead of an actress. The act ends as he removes the back of her head in preparation for re-programming. =Act 2= Act 2 takes place on the day of the meeting with Corinna and Mervyn. The flat has been dramatically tidied and re-arranged. Jerome is rehearsing Nan in her role as the perfect female companion. He has re-programmed her to respond to the name Zoe, and has changed her appearance to match. In fact in this act Nan/Zoe is now played by the actress who played the real Zoe in Act 1. However she still has the same humorous flaws, movements and habits. She has also been programmed to respond to certain trigger words using phrases and actions which Jerome anticipates will be useful ‚Äì but comedy results from the unexpected use of the trigger words in normal conversation. When Corinna (wife) arrives with Mervyn it is clear that when we saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had modelled her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen at the door to the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine ‚Äì in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to the kitchen for a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to the bedroom to put her to bed. Corinna breaks down and admits that she is unable to cope with their rebellious daughter and agrees that Jerome can look after her ‚Äì especially as Nan/Zoe has had such an immediate impact. Eventually she confesses that she had hoped this meeting would lead to a reconciliation between her and Jerome. Jerome is delighted by this and tells Corinna that Nan/Zoe is only an actress. Corinna is hurt by the deception and calls Geain from the bedroom so that they can leave. Geain reveals that her discovery that Nan/Zoe is actually an android ‚Äì but she likes her and wants to stay with her. Under Mervyn's questioning Jerome explains that Nan/Zoe is a NAN 300F. Mervyn explains that the company which made them went out of business following a tragic incident with a baby. Jerome argues in defence of Nan/Zoe but Mervyn and Corinna try to separate her from Geain. Geain doesn't want to be separated. Nan/Zoe mistakes Mervyn for a child molester and knocks him unconscious for a while. When he recovers Mervyn, Corinna and Geain prepare to leave hurriedly as they have had a call to tell them that their car is under siege by the Daughters of Darkness. Corinna offers Jerome a final chance to leave all his equipment behind and come to live with her and Geain, because they still love him. As he rapidly packs a few items they exit for the car, but as Jerome is on the brink of leaving, he realises that Corinna's speech about loving him may be the solution to writing his musical piece about love. He quickly returns to the flat and replays parts of the speech, isolating and manipulating one phrase which is indeed \\"the sound\\" which he has been waiting four years to hear. He feeds the sound sample into his complex equipment, and for the last three minutes of the play we hear the final piece as he creates it. While this takes place, he remains oblivious to the video screen on which the audience sees Mervyn, Corinna and Geain hammering at the door in a vain attempt to persuade him to come with them. Eventually they give up. Whether or not they escape the Daughters of Darkness is not seen, but they are replaced at the door by Rita who attempts to break it down, and then smashes the camera. Jerome completes his composition and is briefly ecstatic, but the sound of violence outside brings him back to full awareness. He realises that to complete his music he has given up the chance of a reconciliation with his wife and child, and has put them in danger. He is distraught as the curtain closes. Staging considerations Henceforward... set (Midland Players 2006) There are several unusual aspects to this play which make it difficult to produce: The play is set in the near future but was written in 1987. The references to the technology of the future are sometimes accurate and sometimes not, but they are largely obsolete. A modern production therefore has to choose whether to perform the play as written, update the technology references (subject to permission) or to set the play in an \\"alternative\\" future where the author's predictions have all come true. There are more than 30 sound and video clips which must be recorded in advance and played on cue. Alternatively some can be live feeds from backstage, or recorded during the performance and replayed. The final musical piece should really contain sound samples from the actual actors in the production. This may require a composer familiar with sampling. The actresses who play Corinna and Zoe must be of a similar physical build as they both also play the NAN 300F.

The use of hypnosis to provide relief for some skin conditions is based on observations that the severity of the disease may correlate with emotional issues. In addition, hypnotherapy has been used to suggest improvement on dermatological symptoms, such as chronic psoriasis, eczema, ichthyosis, warts and alopecia areata. Philip D. Shenefelt, a research dermatologist at the University of South Florida School of Medicine, has identified two dozen dermatologic conditions that have shown response to hypnosis in the literature, with varying degrees of evidence. These include successful results in controlled trials on verruca vulgaris, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. A 2005 review in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings stated that, \\"A review of the use of hypnosis in dermatology supports its value for many skin conditions not believed to be under conscious control\\". The most comprehensively studied skin conditions in relation to hypnotherapy are psoriasis and warts. Hypnosis may have positive effects on dermatological conditions in both adults and children.

Its highest peak is named Shanzidou () and is above sea level. Etymology The Chinese name, Yulong Xueshan, translates directly as Jade Dragon Snow Mountain; it is sometimes translated as Mount Yulong or Yulong Snow Mountain. The mountain's Naxi name is Mount Satseto. Geography The Jade Dragon Snow Mountain massif forms the bulk of the larger Yulong Mountains, that stretch further north. The northwestern flank of the massif forms one side of the Tiger Leaping Gorge (Hutiao Xia, ËôéË∑≥Â≥°), which has a popular trekking route on the other side. In this gorge, the Jinsha (upper Yangtze) River descends dramatically between Jade Dragon and Haba Snow Mountain. The Yulong Mountains lie to the south of the Yun Range and are part of Southwest China's greater Hengduan Mountains. Settlements surrounding Jade Dragon Snow Mountain include Baisha Town to the south, Longpan Township to the west, Daju Township to the northeast, and Jade Water Village at the foot of the mountain to the east. Exploration history In 1938, an expedition led by the Australian lawyer, feminist, conservationist, and mountaineer, Marie Byles, failed to reach the summit due to bad weather. Bitterly disappointed by this failure, she became a follower of Buddhist thought as a consequence. Shanzidou has been climbed only once,Tamotsu Nakamura, \\"East of the Himalaya\\", American Alpine Journal, 2003, p. 146. on May 8, 1987, by an American expedition. The summit team comprised Phil Peralta-Ramos and Eric Perlman. They climbed snow gullies and limestone headwalls, and encountered high avalanche danger and sparse opportunities for protection. They rated the maximum technical difficulty of the rock at YDS 5.7. The Austro-American botanist and explorer Joseph Rock spent many years living in the vicinity of Mt Satseto, and wrote about the region and the Naxi people who occupy it. An interest in Rock later drew the travel writer Bruce Chatwin to the mountain, which he wrote about in an article that appeared in the New York TimesChatwin, Bruce. \\"In China, Rock's Kingdom\\", New York Times, March 16th 1986 and later, retitled, in his essay collection What Am I Doing Here?.Chatwin, Bruce (1989) \\"Rock's World\\", in What Am I Doing Here?, Vintage, p.206 Chatwin's article inspired many subsequent travellers, including Michael Palin,Palin, Michael (2005) \\"Himalaya - Day 82: Lugu Lake to Lijiang\\", Retrieved 2011-01-13 to visit the region. Tourism Public performance in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Open Air Theatre. The view of the massif from the gardens at the Black Dragon Pool (Heilong Tan) in Lijiang is noted as one of China's finest views. The mountain is part of Yulong Snow Mountain National Scenic Area and National Geological Park, an AAAAA-classified scenic area. The Park operates a tourist cable car that takes you to an observation platform at an elevation of and if you feel up to it you can climb a few hundred steps to one of the highest observation platforms in the world at an elevation of for close views of the snow peak.

The Valley Flyer cars, on train 70, the northbound San Diegan, are at right The Valley Flyer was a short-lived named passenger train of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The all-heavyweight, \\"semi-streamlined\\" train ran between Bakersfield and Oakland, California (through California's San Joaquin Valley, hence the name) during the 1939-1940 Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. Motive power was two Baldwin-built 1300 class 4-6-2 \\"Pacific\\" locomotives refurbished and decorated for the train. It was the Santa Fe's first attempt at streamlining older steam power. The locomotives had metal skirting along the sides, painted aluminum (as were the nose and smokestack) with red and yellow stripes, these being outlined by black pinstripes; the tenders were similarly decorated. A yellow \\"Circle and Cross\\" emblem backed by red \\"wings\\" was emblazoned across the front of the locomotive above the pilot deck, and on each side of the tender, which also featured a red \\"wing.\\" The air-conditioned rolling stock was painted aluminum with red and yellow stripes along their sills, bordered with black pinstripes (somewhat like Santa Fe's passenger diesel locomotives). Stripes on the combine unit split into two sets, with one set sweeping up to align with those on the locomotive tenders. Window shades were painted matte aluminum. The sides of the passenger cars bore \\"SANTA FE\\" in black, extra extended Railroad Roman letters. The design of the Valley Flyers drumhead was inspired by that of its counterpart, the Golden Gate. The first run was on June 11, 1939. The train left Bakersfield daily at 6:30 a.m. PST and arrived in Oakland at 12:35 p.m., then returned at 1:55 p.m., pulling into Bakersfield at 8:00 p.m. Beginning on October 27, 1941, the Flyer cars (save for the lounge car) were used to transport troops as a section of the San Diegan on the Santa Fe's \\"Surf Line\\" between Los Angeles and San Diego. In 1942 the trainset was discontinued and the passenger cars returned to pool service, repainted Coach Green. The 1337 class 4-6-2 pacifics #1369 and #1376 were de-streamlined and served the Santa Fe until the early 1950s with #1376 being scrapped in 1950 and #1369 heading off to the scrapyard in 1951.

The reaction couples organic halides or triflates with organozinc compounds, forming carbon-carbon bonds (c-c) in the process. A palladium (0) species is generally utilized as the metal catalyst, though nickel is sometimes used: :\\\\begin{matrix} {}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\color{Red}\\\\ce R}{-}{\\\\color{Blue}\\\\ce X} + {\\\\color{Green}\\\\ce R'}{-}\\\\ce{Zn}{\\\\color{Magenta}\\\\ce X'} \\\\ \\\\ce{->[\\\\ce{PdL}_n \\\\text{ or } \\\\ce{NiL}_n]} \\\\ {\\\\color{Red}\\\\ce R}{-}{\\\\color{Green}\\\\ce R'} \\\\end{matrix} :* The leaving group X is usually chloride, bromide, or iodide, but triflate and acetyloxy groups are feasible as well. X = Cl usually leads to slow reactions. :* The organic residue R = alkenyl, aryl, allyl, alkynyl or propargyl. :* The halide X' in the organozinc compound can be chloride, bromine or iodine and the organic residue R' is alkenyl, aryl, allyl, alkyl, benzyl, homoallyl, and homopropargyl. :* The metal M in the catalyst is nickel or palladium :* The ligand L in the catalyst can be triphenylphosphine, dppe, BINAP or chiraphos Palladium catalysts in general have higher chemical yields and higher functional group tolerance. The Negishi coupling finds common use in the field of total synthesis as a method for selectively forming c-c bonds between complex synthetic intermediates. The reaction allows for the coupling of sp3, sp2, and sp carbons, (see orbital hybridization) which make it somewhat unusual among the Palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. Organozincs are moisture and air sensitive, so the Negishi coupling must be performed in an oxygen and water free environment, a fact that has hindered its use relative to other cross-coupling reactions that require less robust conditions (i.e. Suzuki reaction). However, organozincs are more reactive than both organostannanes and organoborates which correlates to faster reaction times. The reaction is named after Ei-ichi Negishi who was a co-recipient of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery and development of this reaction. Negishi and coworkers originally investigated the cross-coupling of organoaluminum reagents in 1976 initially employing Ni and Pd as the transition metal catalysts, but noted that Ni resulted in the decay of stereospecifity whereas Pd did not. Transitioning from organoaluminum species to organozinc compounds Negishi and coworkers reported the use of Pd complexes in organozinc coupling reactions and carried out methods studies, eventually developing the reaction conditions into those commonly utilized today. Alongside Richard F. Heck and Akira Suzuki, El-ichi Negishi was a co- recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2010, for his work on \\"palladium- catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis\\". Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism is thought to proceed via a standard Pd catalyzed cross- coupling pathway, starting with a Pd(0) species, which is oxidized to Pd(II) in an oxidative addition step involving the organohalide species. This step proceeds with aryl, vinyl, alkynyl, and acyl halides, acetates, or triflates, with substrates following standard oxidative addition relative rates (I>OTf>Br>>Cl). 581x581px The actual mechanism of oxidative addition is unresolved, though there are two likely pathways. One pathway is thought to proceed via an SN2 like mechanism resulting in inverted stereochemistry. The other pathway proceeds via concerted addition and retains stereochemistry. centre Though the additions are cis- the Pd(II) complex rapidly isomerizes to the trans- complex. 291x291px Next, the transmetalation step occurs where the organozinc reagent exchanges its organic substituent with the halide in the Pd(II) complex, generating the trans- Pd(II) complex and a zinc halide salt. The organozinc substrate can be aryl, vinyl, allyl, benzyl, homoallyl, or homopropargyl. Transmetalation is usually rate limiting and a complete mechanistic understanding of this step has not yet been reached though several studies have shed light on this process. It was recently determined that alkylzinc species must go on to form a higher-order zincate species prior to transmetalation whereas arylzinc species do not. ZnXR and ZnR2 can both be used as reactive reagents, and Zn is known to prefer four coordinate complexes, which means solvent coordinated Zn complexes, such as ZnXR(solvent)2 cannot be ruled out a priori. Studies indicate competing equilibriums exist between cis- and trans- bis alkyl organopalladium complexes, but that the only productive intermediate is the cis complex. centre The last step in the catalytic pathway of the Negishi coupling is reductive elimination, which is thought to proceed via a three coordinate transition state, yielding the coupled organic product and regenerating the Pd(0) catalyst. For this step to occur, the aforementioned cis- alkyl organopalladium complex must be formed. Mechanism of reductive elimination Both organozinc halides and diorganozinc compounds can be used as starting materials. In one model system it was found that in the transmetalation step the former give the cis-adduct R-Pd-R' resulting in fast reductive elimination to product while the latter gives the trans-adduct which has to go through a slow trans-cis isomerization first. A common side reaction is homocoupling. In one Negishi model system the formation of homocoupling was found to be the result of a second transmetalation reaction between the diarylmetal intermediate and arylmetal halide: : Ar‚ÄìPd‚ÄìAr' + Ar'‚ÄìZn‚ÄìX ‚Üí Ar'‚ÄìPd‚ÄìAr' + Ar‚ÄìZn‚ÄìX : Ar'‚ÄìPd‚ÄìAr' ‚Üí Ar'‚ÄìAr' + Pd(0) (homocoupling) : Ar‚ÄìZn‚ÄìX + H2O ‚Üí Ar‚ÄìH + HO‚ÄìZn‚ÄìX (reaction accompanied by dehalogenation) Scope The Negishi coupling has been applied the following illustrative syntheses: *unsymmetrical 2,2'-bipyridines from 2-bromopyridine with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), *biphenyl from o-tolylzinc chloride and o-iodotoluene and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), *5,7-hexadecadiene from 1-decyne and (Z)-1-hexenyl iodide. Structure of hexaferrocenylbenzene, C6[(Œ∑5-C5H4)Fe(Œ∑5-C5H5)]6 Negishi coupling has been applied in the synthesis of hexaferrocenylbenzene: :Hexaferrocenylbenzene with hexaiodidobenzene, diferrocenylzinc and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) in tetrahydrofuran. The yield is only 4% signifying substantial crowding around the aryl core. In a novel modification palladium is first oxidized by the haloketone 2-chloro-2-phenylacetophenone 1 and the resulting palladium OPdCl complex then accepts both the organozinc compound 2 and the organotin compound 3 in a double transmetalation: :Double Transmetallation crosscoupling Recent conditions for the Negishi reaction have demonstrated extremely broad scope and tolerance of a broad range of functional groups and heteroaromatic nuclei and proceed at or near room temperature. =Industrial applications= The Negishi coupling is not employed as frequently in industrial applications as its cousins the Suzuki reaction and Heck reaction, mostly as a result of the water and air sensitivity of the required aryl or alkyl zinc reagents. In 2003 Novartis employed a Negishi coupling in the manufacture of PDE472, a phosphodiesterase type 4D inhibitor, which was being investigated as a drug lead for the treatment of asthma. The Negishi coupling was used as an alternative to the Suzuki reaction providing improved yields, 73% on a 4.5 kg scale, of the desired benzodioxazole synthetic intermediate. :centre =Applications in Total Synthesis= Where the Negishi coupling is rarely used in industrial chemistry, a result of the aforementioned water and oxygen sensitivity, it finds wide use in the field of natural products total synthesis. The increased reactivity relative to other cross-coupling reactions makes the Negishi coupling ideal for joining complex intermediates in the synthesis of natural products. Additionally, Zn is more environmentally friendly than other metals such as Sn used in the Stille coupling. Though the Negishi coupling historically has not been used as much as the Stille or Suzuki coupling, recent years have seen the Negishi coupling gain a foothold in the field of synthetic chemistry, so much so that it has become the cross- coupling method of choice for select synthetic tasks. When it comes to fragment-coupling processes the Negishi coupling is particularly useful, especially when compared to the aforementioned Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions. The major drawback of the Negishi coupling, aside from its water and oxygen sensitivity, is its relative lack of functional group tolerance when compared to other cross-coupling reactions. (‚àí)-stemoamide is a natural product found in the root extracts of ‚Äò‚ÄôStemona tuberosa‚Äô‚Äô. These extracts have been used Japanese and Chinese folk medicine to treat respiratory disorders, and (‚àí)-stemoamide is also an anthelminthic. Somfai and coworkers employed a Negishi coupling in their synthesis of (‚àí)-stemoamide. The reaction was implemented mid-synthesis, forming an sp3-sp2 c-c bond between Œ≤,Œ≥-unsaturated ester and an intermediate diene 4 with a 78% yield of product 5. Somfai completed the stereoselective total synthesis of (‚àí)-stemoamide in 12-steps with a 20% overall yield.centreKibayashi and coworkers utilized the Negishi coupling in the total synthesis of Pumiliotoxin B. Pumiliotoxin B is one of the major toxic alkaloids isolated from Dendrobates pumilio, a Panamanian poison frog. These toxic alkaloids display modulatory effects on voltage-dependent sodium channels, resulting in cardiotonic and myotonic activity. Kibayashi employed the Negishi coupling late stage in the synthesis of Pumiliotoxin B, coupling a homoallylic sp3 carbon on the zinc alkylidene indolizidine 6 with the (E)-vinyl iodide 7 with a 51% yield. The natural product was then obtained after deprotection. :centre Œ¥-trans-tocotrienoloic acid isolated from the plant, Chrysochlamys ulei, is a natural product shown to inhibit DNA polymerase Œ≤ (pol Œ≤), which functions to repair DNA via base excision. Inhibition of pol B in conjunction with other chemotherapy drugs may increase the cytotoxicity of these chemotherapeutics, leading to lower effective dosages. The Negishi coupling was implemented in the synthesis of Œ¥-trans-tocotrienoloic acid by Hecht and Maloney coupling the sp3 homopropargyl zinc reagent 8 with sp2 vinyl iodide 9. The reaction proceeded with quantitative yield, coupling fragments mid-synthesis en route to the stereoselectively synthesized natural product Œ¥-trans-tocotrienoloic acid. :Synthesis of Œ¥-trans-tocotrienoloic acid Preparation of Organozinc Precursors Alkylzinc reagents can be accessed from the corresponding alkyl bromides using iodine in dimethylacetamide (DMAC).

Biography With his lugubrious demeanour he was often cast as world-weary police officers or butlers, and indeed it is for the role of Chief Inspector Claud Eustace Teal in the 1960s series The Saint, opposite Roger Moore, that he is best remembered. Dean played Teal for almost the entire run of the series, except three instances in early episodes where other actors were used. It was on the third occasion, in an episode called Starring The Saint which featured Dean in another role, that the producers saw the ideal actor for the part. Dean proved the ideal foil for Moore's Simon Templar, invariably one step behind and allegedly hoping for the day when he could pin something on the Saint. Dean's character however seemed to have a respect for his adversary nonetheless. Dean reprised the role in all but name in Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (1968‚Äì69) in which he played Inspector Large, who had the same adversarial relationship with (the much less suave) Jeff Randall. Dean also appeared in one off roles in several other ITC series, including Jason King and The Persuaders!, he appeared as a butler in 3 episodes of the long-running LWT sitcom Doctor at Large and featured in three episodes of The Avengers. In 1964 he played estate agent Alfred Wormold in the long-running soap opera Coronation Street, selling No. 13 Coronation Street to Stan Ogden and his wife Hilda.

For his contribution as a children's writer he received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1968. Biography James Jacob Hinrich Kr√ºss was born as the son of the electrician Ludwig Kr√ºss and his wife Margaretha Kr√ºss (born Friedrichs) on Heligoland. In 1941, during World War II, the inhabitants of the island were evacuated to Arnstadt, Thuringia, later to Hertigswalde, near Sebnitz, Saxony. After finishing high school in 1943, he studied to become a teacher, first in Lunden until 1943, Schleswig-Holstein, then in Ratzeburg until 1944, then finally in Brunswick. In 1944, he volunteered into the air force and was stationed in √öst√≠ nad Labem, now Czech Republic at the end of World War II. From 1945 he lived with his parents in Cuxhaven. Career In 1946, he published his first book, Der goldene Faden and then visited the college of education in L√ºneburg, Lower Saxony. In 1948, he received his teaching license, but never worked as a teacher. In the same year, he moved to Reinbek, near Hamburg, and founded the magazine Helgoland, which was meant for inhabitants of the island, who had been expelled from it; it existed until 1956. In 1949, he moved to Lochham, near Munich, where he got to know Erich K√§stner, among others. From 1956, he wrote audio dramas for children and children's poems together with Peter Hacks. In 1956, Kr√ºss published the children's book The Lighthouse on Lobster Cliffs with the publishing house Friedrich Oetinger. He also travelled to Italy and Yugoslavia. The subsequently well-known picture book Henriette, whose eponymous protagonist is an anthropomorphized steam locomotive-hauled train, and which started a small series of similar, related picture books, was first published in 1958. After a reading of My Great Grandfather and I (which won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1960) in the Tagesschau in 1960, he suddenly became very famous. In the same year he bought a house with garden in Gilching, Bavaria. In 1962, his arguably most famous book Timm Thaler was published. It would later be adapted into a TV miniseries in 1979 directed by Sigi Rothemund, which was also known as The Boy Who Lost His Laugh in the United Kingdom. In 1965, he bought a house in Gran Canaria and settled there a year later. At the end of his life, Kr√ºss had heart problems and spent a lot of time in clinics. In 1968 Kr√ºss received the writing award in 1968 Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People, the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. He died in 1997 in Gran Canaria and was buried at sea on 27 September near Heligoland. Legacy Kr√ºss was first and foremost a storyteller, whose fantastic and whimsical tales are deeply rooted in folktale and oral storytelling tradition. Many of his books are actually collections of tales held together by a frame story. Such is the case with My Great Grandfather and I (1959), for which he received the German Prize for Children's and Youth Literature, with its sequel My Great Grandfather, the Heroes, and I (1967), and with The Lighthouse on the Lobster Cliffs,(1956). James Kr√ºss was the best known and most prolific children's author in what was for nearly all his writing life the Federal Republic of Germany. Inheriting a post-war literary desert, within which the Nazi Party had discouraged creative writing for children in favour of a hoped-for return to true Germanic folk poetry, Kr√ºss was a hugely important figure in the re-establishment of the freedom of imaginative story-telling. His first children's book, The Lighthouse on Lobster Island (1956), was based on his own experience of growing up in Heligoland, and was followed by My Great-Grandfather and I (1959), a continuation in the same genre.

In 1846, the young slave Hardin Smith, born in Virginia, was allowed by his master's wife to preach to a slave congregation at an evening service at the white Woodlawn Church.\\"Hardin Smith,\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, Rutledge Press It was located near Woodlawn Road. He was the first slave to preach to an area congregation.Norris, Sharon, Black America Series: Haywood County, Tennessee, Arcadia Publishing, 2000 Hardin Smith was of mixed race; his white father was his mother's master Abner Smith. Hardin, his mother and siblings were sold away from Virginia. In Tennessee, he was secretly taught by his master's wife and children to read and write through the Bible; it was against state law at the time. He in turn secretly taught many slaves to read and write. In 1866, after emancipation and the end of the Civil War, Hardin Smith and Martin Winfield were among three men in Haywood County selected by missionaries of the Baptist Home Mission Board for the first classes in ministry at the newly established Roger Williams College in Nashville.Norris (2000), Black America Series: Haywood County, Tennessee, Arcadia Publishing, p. 8 The Northern Baptists wanted to aid freedmen in the South and plant new churches. After his return to Nutbush, Smith, together with other freedmen, the Freedmen's Bureau, and a few whites, founded the Woodlawn Colored Baptist Church. (It is now known as Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church.) He was called as the pastor there and served for the next 56 years, to the end of his life. He consistently encouraged education among his congregation. In 1866 Smith and Winfield helped establish the Freedman School in the county seat of Brownsville. It later developed into twelve grades. Smith was a community leader, organizing five other black Baptist churches in Haywood and nearby Lauderdale counties. Winfield helped found the First Baptist Church in Brownsville and became its pastor. All emphasized education. These black Baptist churches soon withdrew from white supervision, as did most black Baptists in the South, establishing their own churches and associations.Brooks, Walter H. \\"The Evolution of the Negro Baptist Church.\\" Journal of Negro History (1922) 7#1 pp: 11-22. in JSTORAlbert J.

Smith also participated in founding Howe Institute of Technology (now merged into LeMoyne-Owen College), an historically black college in Memphis; and developing Roger Williams College from its beginnings in 1866. Before 1900, more students went to Roger Williams College from the Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church than from any other community in Tennessee. Graduates from Roger Williams helped lead other black schools and colleges; they became ministers, doctors, lawyers, and teachers. In 1996, Woodlawn Baptist Church and Cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its historical significance. Tina Turner Highway Woodlawn Baptist Church is located 3 mi (4.8 km) southeast of Nutbush, south of Tennessee State Route 19. A stretch of State Route 19 between Brownsville and Nutbush was named \\"Tina Turner Highway\\" in 2002 after singer Tina Turner (born Anna Mae Bullock), who was born and lived as a child in Nutbush. Woodlawn Baptist Church in Nutbush was a family church of Tina Turner. She attended and sang in the choir growing up. Her family members were church officials, musicians and singers; some are buried in this cemetery.

Paul was introduced to the show on May 23, 1978, and has been portrayed by Doug Davidson ever since.Davidson taped his first scenes on May 15, 1978; his first airdate was on May 23, 1978. Initially Paul was a \\"bad boy\\", who had a romance with Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott), giving her an STD. The relationship ultimately ended, but the two have remained friends since. After a year on the series, Bell gave the character a proper backstory, surname and family. This included his notoriously unstable sister Patty Williams (Stacey Haiduk). After a failed marriage to April Stevens (Cynthia Eilbacher)‚Äîwho gave birth to his daughter Heather Stevens (Jennifer Landon)‚Äîfocus turned towards Paul's career as a private investigator, as well as his relationship and eventual marriage to and later divorce from Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman). Paul's string of unsuccessful romances with women‚Äîincluding his ill-fated bride Cindy Lake (DeAnna Robbins), and Cassandra Rawlins (Nina Arvesen), the wife of one of his clients‚Äîcontinued. Over the years, Paul continued to become heavily involved in various storylines as a private investigator. The character's most prominent love story occurred when he married attorney Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell). The couple faced various challenges together, with their first marriage ending as a result of his affair with the psychotic Isabella Bra√±a (Eva Longoria). The affair produced Paul's son Ricky Williams (Pete Porte); Isabella was admitted to a mental institution and Ricky grew up away from his father. Years later, Paul established a relationship with his daughter Heather, who returned to Genoa City (now an adult) as a lawyer. After years away, Paul's adult son Ricky returned to town and it was revealed that he, like his mother, was mentally unstable. In a controversial storyline, Paul was forced to shoot and kill Ricky to prevent him from killing Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap). Paul has since assumed the role of police chief for the GCPD and remarried Christine. Davidson's performance of Paul has garnered him acclaim from both critics and audiences, and he has emerged as one of the soap opera genre's most popular actors. Davidson's high Q Score has allowed him to be recognized as daytime's most desirable performer; although TV Guide has labelled him \\"underrated\\". Similarly, Canyon News described his performance as \\"understated\\", yet \\"overpowering\\" and \\"strong\\". TVSource magazine stated that the actor has maintained \\"raw honesty and conviction\\" in his portrayal. The storyline in which Paul was forced to kill his son earned Davidson a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, having previously been nominated for this award twice. Additionally, Davidson has claimed three Soap Opera Digest Awards from six nominations. Currently, he is the longest-tenured actor present on The Young and the Restless. Casting Doug Davidson joined the cast of the show on May 15, 1978; the episode aired on May 23, 1978. Its creator, William J. Bell, discovered him during one of Bell's trips to Chicago, while Davidson was modelling for magazines. The actor learned that he had been cast as Paul when a costumer contacted him for measurements. Before joining the soap opera Davidson studied marine biology, abandoning his studies to pursue acting full-time. Former executive producer Wes Kenny had a profound impact on his career: \\"Wes taught me to listen, respond and to play the situation\\". In mid-1979 Davidson signed a five-year contract, and began receiving more airtime. In September 1994 he was hired to host The New Price Is Right, which taped down the hall from The Young and the Restless at CBS Television City. By May 2002, the actor had appeared in over 3,600 episodes of the daytime drama. Reflecting on the \\"unique demands\\" of the soap-opera genre, Davidson said: \\"You must see each day as fresh, but it's also dangerous to invest too much because you do have to come back tomorrow. It's not the Super Bowl every day.\\" In January 2018, Davidson was bumped to recurring status. Storylines The character Paul Williams was born in May 1960, the son of police detective Carl Williams (Brett Hadley) and Mary Williams (Carolyn Conwell). He has three siblings: Todd, Steven and Patty. Paul begins dating close friend, Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott), giving her a sexually transmitted disease. The romance ends when she takes up with Greg Foster (Wings Hauser); Paul begins dating April Stevens (Cynthia Eilbacher), who gives birth to his daughter Heather (Eden Riegel) despite his desire for her to terminate the pregnancy. He leaves town with Nikki to join a cult, the New World Commune. Paul's brother, Steven, helps to save them from the cult and rescues the former lovers. While Paul and Nikki are away, Greg dates April. However, April falls ill and Greg convinces Paul to marry her. The ill- conceived marriage ends in divorce; Paul focuses on his detective career, unsuccessfully trying to find his mentally unstable sister Patty (Stacy Haiduk). While Paul and business partner Andy Richards (Steven Ford) work undercover to infiltrate organized crime, he dates prostitute Cindy Lake. Cindy takes a bullet for Paul, dying in his arms. His mother opposes his relationship with Cindy, and also disapproves Paul's marriage to Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman). Their union suffers when she is stalked by Shawn Garrett (Grant Cramer), who convinces Paul that Shawn and Lauren had an affair. The marriage ends, although Paul comes to her rescue when Lauren is kidnapped and buried alive by Shawn. Pregnant, Lauren has a miscarriage. She and Paul reconcile, although when Lauren submits a nude photo of Paul for a magazine centerfold they break up permanently. Paul becomes involved with his friend George Rawlins' (Jonathon Farwell) wife Cassandra (Nina Arvesen), unaware of the marriage. Cassandra's announcement that she is filing for divorce causes George to have a heart attack, and he becomes terminally ill. He learns about the affair, planning to kill himself and frame Paul for his murder. Paul fakes his own suicide and goes into hiding; he, his father and Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) work to clear Paul's name. George's killer is Adrian, Cassandra's lover from Bermuda. She marries Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), who leaves her after learning that she drugged him. Cassandra tries to reconcile with Paul, but she dies in a car crash. After dating his secretary Lynne Bassett (Laura Bryan Birn), Paul falls in love with his partner Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell). After his mother declares his father Carl dead, Christine discovers that he is an amnesiac living in Norfolk. She brings Carl to town to see Paul, although he remembers little. Despite Mary wanting him back, Carl does not remember anything and returns to Norfolk. After Christine's marriage to Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) ends, Paul and Christine begin a relationship. April, married to Robert Lynch, returns to town with Paul's daughter Heather. Lynch abuses April, and she stabs him. She is arrested, and Christine is her legal representative. April is acquitted, and returns to New York with Heather. Christine still loves Danny; his mistress Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) faked her son Daniel Romalotti's (Michael Graziadei) paternity, and he is not Danny's biological child. However, Christine and Paul continue their wedding plans. A crazed Phyllis believes that Christine will try to reconcile with Danny. The night before the wedding Phyllis crashes her car into Christine and Paul, postponing the marriage. Christine and Danny briefly reconcile before she returns to Paul, whom she marries shortly thereafter. She begins a law practice with Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), who raped her years ago, which requires her to spend months out of town working on cases in Hong Kong and Australia. Paul begins an affair with a client, Isabella Bra√±a (Eva Longoria), who previously dated Michael. Christine finds out and divorces Paul after a six-year marriage. Isabella becomes pregnant; she does not tell Paul because of his feelings for Christine, telling Michael that he is the father. She and Michael begin a relationship, and reconciles with his ex-wife Lauren. When Paul learns about Isabella's baby he moves in with her, and they eventually marry despite Mary's opposition. She gives birth to their son, Ricky Williams (Peter Porte). However, when Christine and Michael become engaged Paul recognizes his feelings for her and wants to reconcile. He assaults her sexually, and she leaves town. Christine returns in disguise, and works with Mary to expose Isabella as manipulative and scheming. Christine and Michael's engagement ends when he tells her he set up Isabella and Paul so he could have Christine for himself, and she and Paul reconcile. An unstable Isabella tries to frame Christine for her own murder, and later tries to drown Christine in her bathtub. Paul rescues Christine, Isabella is institutionalized and Ricky is sent to live with her parents. Paul and Christine's relationship again ends. Paul closes his investigative company and begins a partnership with Christine and Paul, hiring fledgling PI J.T. Hellstrom (Thad Luckinbill) as an apprentice. He continues detective work, rescuing J.T. and Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) when they are kidnapped by the attempted murderers of Brad's family decades earlier (when he was known by his birth name, George Kaplan). Paul investigates Lauren's enemy Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown), who had plastic surgery to look like Phyllis (Lauren's best friend) and scheme her way into Lauren's life. Paul captures Sheila, locking her in a warehouse cage, and begins dating detective Maggie Sullivan (Tammy Lauren). Sheila escapes, shoots Maggie (leaving her locked in the cage with Paul) and goes on a rampage, kidnapping Lauren, Phyllis and their children until she is shot and killed by Lauren. Maggie agrees not to tell the authorities about Paul (and eventually Michael), keeping Sheila trapped. Paul's daughter Heather (Vail Bloom) returns to Genoa City as an assistant district attorney, and develops a relationship with her father. He reconciles with first love Nikki, and they become engaged. She then breaks up with Paul, unable to move past her feelings for ex-husband Victor. Paul investigates a businesswoman, Mary Jane Benson, only to discover that she is his unstable sister Patty. Patty goes on a crime spree, poisoning Nikki and Victor's granddaughter Summer Newman (Haley King), kidnapping Colleen Carlton (Tammin Sursok)‚Äîwho eventually drowns‚Äîand shooting Victor three times before escaping. Paul tracks down Nikki, and brings her back to town to help Victor recover. Patty is found and sent to a mental institution, where Paul visits her regularly. He begins dating Christine's former best friend, Nina Webster (Tricia Cast). A love triangle forms between Paul, Nina and Christine when the latter briefly returns to Genoa City, and Paul helps Nina track down her long-lost son Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson). Paul's son Ricky (now an adult) returns to Genoa City, working for attorney Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins). Paul attempts to bond with Ricky, but soon discovers that Ricky is psychotic like Isabella. Paul is forced to shoot and kill Ricky to keep him from killing Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap). Before dying, Ricky confesses that he murdered his ex-girlfriend Rachel when she dumped him. Paul surrenders to the police, and is shocked when no knife (with which Ricky threatened Eden) is found at the scene and Eden has no memory of the event. Christine returns to town, and with her and Heather's help Paul is acquitted. Months later he becomes the Genoa City police chief, remaining involved in a number of legal cases. Eleven years after their divorce, Christine and Paul remarry at their friend Katherine Chancellor's (Jeanne Cooper) funeral, with Paul following Katherine's advice in a letter he received during the ceremony. Character development =Portrayal= Global Regina describes Paul, a detective, as always doing \\"his best to see that justice is done\\". CBS created him as a \\"charismatic\\" private investigator who was compassionate and attractive. Canyon News described Paul as a \\"sexy private eye who many Genoa City citizens have called upon to save their lives and their companies\\". Bell had introduced Paul as a \\"bad boy\\" who would be a rival for Nikki Reed's (Melody Thomas Scott) affections (which he won), and \\"too green to know anything\\". Only after an estimated 450 episodes, according to The Age, was Paul given a surname, family and backstory. Davidson said: \\"Bill brought in my family and the show went to an hour and that was a huge transition for my character\\". In 1989, he described coping with the ever-changing storylines as \\"mental\\": \\"Just when you think you know everything ...you get fooled by complacency. I've been playing Paul Williams for a long time and I have to keep my performance fresh and new\\". In an interview with The Gadsden Times, the actor said he treats himself as an \\"open vessel\\" and has a \\"childlike frame of mind\\" when undertaking a variety of storylines. =Relationships= Lauralee Bell plays Christine Blair, one of Paul's main love interests. Paul has had several unsuccessful relationships, and has been described as \\"often luckless in love\\". His main love interest during the 1980s was Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman). Davidson described the relationship as Paul's \\"first non- drama fling\\" and said that Bell decided to pair the characters on the \\"spur of the moment\\", uncertain of the outcome. He enjoys the dynamics between Lauren and Paul: \\"I always am excited whenever I get to work with her. We‚Äôve played friends, husband and wife, enemies, you name it. She is a dynamic actress and a wonderful friend and person\\". The couple have faced a number of challenges, including Lauren's crazed stalker Shawn Garrett (Grant Cramer) and disapproval from Paul's mother, Mary Williams (Carolyn Conwell). Lauren and Paul divorced: Lynda Hirsch of the Sun Sentinel wrote, \\"The marriage didn't work out, since Lauren desperately wanted a career in music and Paul wanted her to be a stay- at-home wife and eventually a mom\\". Paul had a \\"strong interest\\" in Cindy Lake (DeAnna Robbins), a prostitute with whom he fell in love. Before their scheduled marriage, Cindy took a bullet for Paul and died. He later fell for a \\"mysterious\\" woman, Cassandra Rawlins (Nina Arvesen), the wife of Paul's client George Rawlins (Jonathan Farwell). George was shot through the heart and killed, and Paul was a suspect in his death; The actor credited the Cassandra-and-George storyline with significantly changing Paul's character, telling the Orlando Sentinel: \\"It was a tremendous story. Until then I was the younger leading man, and this was really a departure for me.\\" He previously described it as his \\"first adult storyline\\", in which Bell transformed Paul \\"from a juvenile lead into a lead male\\". The actor told BuddyTV it is his favorite storyline: \\"I usually claim that the most exciting story for me was Cassandra‚Äôs storyline, simply because it was the transition from Paul as a young man to an adult.\\" For years Paul has been romantically involved with Christine Blair, played by Lauralee Bell (daughter of the show's creator, William J. Bell). In 2013, the couple were married for a second time during the memorial service for their friend Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper). Davidson felt that the couple never fell out of love, although they were driven apart by characters such as Isabella Bra√±a (Eva Longoria) and Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc). The actor said, \\"The fact that they have such a strong foundation and relationship beyond husband and wife, is the reason it‚Äôs probably going to last forever.\\" As a teenager Paul dated Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott), and they remained friends for thirty years. In November 2008, Paul and Nikki slept together. Davidson described their reunion as \\"love in the purest sense\\": \\"They've been friends for 30 years and are supporting each other in the most intimate way possible. They do not judge the rightness or wrongness of their actions, nor do they want to tell anyone about it. They know their kids probably won't understand.\\" He also said, \\"It was the other end of the trail and I don‚Äôt think for Paul, at this juncture, was the love of Nikki‚Äôs life, nor was Nikki the love of Paul‚Äôs.\\" In 2010 the show explored a romance between Paul and Christine's best friend, Nina Webster (Tricia Cast). Cast has praised the couple's storyline for not being \\"overly dramatic\\" and more \\"normal\\": \\"Paul and Nina are less exciting‚Äîand I like that. There are no shenanigans ...it‚Äôs kind of like a real relationship.\\" However, it yielded to Paul and Christine's ongoing affinity. =Isabella and Ricky= Eva Longoria played Isabella Bra√±a, Paul's mentally unstable lover and (later) wife. In 2001 Paul cheated on his wife Christine with the mentally unstable Isabella Bra√±a (Eva Longoria), impregnating her. The writers had introduced Isabella as a love interest (and eventual spouse) for him when the pregnant Lauralee Bell was written out of the show. During her two years as a character Isabella developed an obsession with Paul, faked her death (framing Christine) and tried to kill Christine. She was committed to a mental institution, where she remains. Michael Logan of TV Guide called Isabella a \\"nutjob\\" who made Christine's life a \\"living hell\\", and the National Post called Isabella \\"evil\\". Of the show not reintroducing Paul and Isabella's son Ricky, Davidson said at the time: \\"It‚Äôs hard to bring something like that up without delving deeper. I always make the assumption that I am communicating with him offscreen.\\" In 2011 it was announced that Pete Porte would play Paul and Isabella's rapidly aged adult son, Ricky Williams. Ricky arrived in town as a legal intern working on Sharon Newman's court case. Michael Logan wrote: \\"But what's he really up to? To get this mystery moving, Y&R; needs to remind viewers of the emotional havoc caused by Ricky's mama\\". Ricky's appearance in Genoa City sparked uncertainty about his motives and personality. Lauralee Bell, who returned for this story arc, said: \\"That whole Isabella thing was a very scary time for Chris and Paul and now they wonder if there's something off about Ricky. At first, no one knew Isabella was crazy. He could be a whack job like his mother\\". Bell described Christine's seeing Ricky as a man as \\"really startling\\". Davidson said that Paul may have been guilty about Ricky's upbringing, since he was raised by his grandparents. Viewer suspicions were confirmed when Ricky turned out to be a psychotic like his mother, acting strangely and tormenting Paul. Davidson described the discovery that Paul had a \\"psycho son\\" as painful: \\"You feel it in your heart, and it‚Äôs supported by the things you discover with logic. It‚Äôs hard to ignore when people are disappearing or dropping dead\\". One night, Paul arrived at Ricky's place and found his son holding a knife to Eden Baldwin's (Jessica Heap) throat. Paul pulled out a gun, threatened to shoot Ricky and did so, killing his son. Moments before, Ricky had confessed his crimes to Paul (including murdering his former girlfriend). Jillian Bowe of Zap2it asked of the guilt-ridden Paul: \\"Will this lead him to the brink?\\" During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Davidson said that preparing for the scene where Paul kills his son made him nervous and the storyline was described as one of Paul's toughest yet. About what would happen to Paul after Ricky's death, Davidson felt that it would be \\"incredibly hard\\" for the character to come to terms with what happened: \\"It would be a dark place for the rest of Paul‚Äôs life when he thinks of Ricky. It‚Äôs like a war veteran. It‚Äôs like a part of your life that you have to deal with and go on.\\" Reception Davidson's portrayal of Paul has made him one of daytime television's most popular actors in the U.S. He has had a high Q Score, making him a desirable daytime-drama performer. The score is based on \\"talent, familiarity and likability\\". Michael Logan of TV Guide has called Davidson \\"one of daytime's best yet most underrated actors\\" for his 30-year portrayal of Paul. The Toronto Star has called him \\"one of soapdom's favorite pin-ups\\", with Lilana Novakovich calling the actor \\"one of daytime television's most popular stars\\". The authors of The Soap Opera Book: Who's Who in Daytime Drama (1992) have called Williams \\"one of daytime's leading stars\\". After ten years on the show he was described as a \\"veteran\\" by John Goudas of The Gadsden Times, who noted Davidson's \\"very large fan following\\". The Washington Times described Paul as a \\"hero\\" to the audience. Donna Gable of USA Today called him \\"daytime's consummate good guy\\". When Davidson celebrated thirty years on the show, \\"Melodie\\" wrote on Zap2it: \\"Paul's journey from teenage bad boy to resident hero has been an interesting one and I sure hope we see 30 more years from Doug\\". Paul's long-term romance with Lauren Fenmore was disliked by fans during the 1980s. John Goudas of the TimesDaily noted that viewers had wanted Paul to dump Lauren for three years, but by the early 1990s fans wanted the couple back together. Discussing a storyline in which a \\"loyal and protective\\" Paul dealt with his sister Patty's dementia, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News called Davidson's performance \\"strong\\" and \\"overpowering\\" yet \\"understated\\": \\"...each week for the past three decades we wonder how he does it so well\\". In a separate article, Garrett called Davidson \\"one of the most popular and beloved actors in television history\\". Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps praised the actor: \\"Doug is that dependable performer who can make us smile or break us down in tears.\\" TVSource said, \\"Through the years we've seen Paul at his best and at his worst, but the one constant has always been the raw honesty and conviction in Davidson‚Äôs portrayal\\". The storyline in which Peter Porte joined the show as Paul's psychotic son Ricky was praised. Adam Hughes of Yahoo! described the possibilities stemming from his return: \\"Ricky will undoubtedly open up many old wounds and many new story line possibilities. Will he angrily confront Paul? Will Isabella manage to return home, as well, to see her big boy?\\" After Paul was forced to shoot (and kill) Ricky, Michael Logan of TV Guide wrote that \\"the actor tackled his toughest story yet when his character unintentionally killed his own son and nearly went to the slammer. Davidson's performance was so beautiful and poignant it made our souls ache\\". Zap2it placed Davidson on a list of \\"Top 10 Male Entertainers\\" by the end of 2012: \\"For the better part of a decade, daytime's best male crier, Doug Davidson rode the bench on The Young and the Restless. This was strange, since his popular, P.I. character Paul Williams had previously and consistently driven story on the soap throughout the late 70s, 80s, 90s and early 00s\\". The website was pleased with Paul's new storylines, saying that the \\"harrowing image\\" before Paul shot and killed his son \\"will stay with us for a while\\". Dave Masko of the website Huliq called \\"turning the character of Paul from a mainstay on the series for 30 years, into someone who murders his own son\\" one of the stops pulled out by The Young and the Restless to boost \\"slipping\\" ratings. For his work on The Young and the Restless, Davidson has been awarded three Soap Opera Digest Awards and six nominations. He was nominated for Outstanding Younger Actor in 1986 before his nomination for Outstanding Hero two years later, an award he won in 1990 and 1991. In 1992 and 1997, Davidson won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor. The actor was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2003, 2010 and 2014 winning the award in 2013. Two years earlier in 2011, he was nominated in the Daytime Emmy Award category for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.

Delacorte Jr. with $10,000, two employees and one magazine title, I Confess, and soon began turning out dozens of pulp magazines, which included penny-a-word detective stories, articles about the movies, and romance books (or \\"smoochies\\" as they were known in the slang of the day). During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, Dell was one of the largest publishers of magazines, including pulp magazines. Their line of humor magazines included 1000 Jokes, launched in 1938. From 1929 to 1974, they published comics under the Dell Comics line, the bulk of which (1938‚Äì68) was done in partnership with Western Publishing. In 1943, Dell entered into paperback book publishing with Dell Paperbacks. They also used the book imprints of Dial Press, Delacorte Books, Delacorte Press, Yearling Books, and Laurel Leaf Library. Paperbacks Dell's earliest venture into paperback publishing began because of its close association with Western Publishing. William Lyles wrote, \\"Dell needed paper, which Western had in 1942, and because Western by this time needed printing work, which Dell could supply in the form of its new paperback line. So Dell Books was born, created by Delacorte of Dell and Lloyd E. Smith of Western.\\"Putting Dell on the Map, William H. Lyles, Greenwood Press, 1983, Dell began publishing paperbacks in 1942 at a time when mass-market paperbacks were a relatively new idea for the United States market‚Äîits principal competitor, Pocket Books, had only been publishing since 1939. An examination of paperback books available at this time shows no consensus on standardization of any feature; each early company was attempting to distinguish itself from its competitors. Lyles commented, \\"Dell achieved more variety than any of its early competitors. It did so, at first, with an instantly identifiable format of vibrant airbrushed covers for its predominantly genre fiction, varying 'eye-in-keyhole' logos, maps on the back covers, lists of the books' characters, and 'tantalizer-pages'. The design was merchandising genius; it successfully attracted buyers, it sold books.\\" The first four books did not feature maps on the back cover; this began with Dell #5, Four Frightened Women by George Harmon Coxe. (A later re- issue of Dell #4, The American Gun Mystery by Ellery Queen, added a map.) The map was meant as an aid to the reader, to show the location of the principal activity of the novel. Some were incredibly detailed; others somewhat stylized and abstract. The books were almost immediately known as \\"mapbacks\\", and that nomenclature has lasted among collectors to this day.Collectable Paperback Books, ed. Jeff Canja, Glenmoor Publishing, 2002, The maps were \\"delicate and detailed\\".Hancer's Price Guide to Paperback Books, Third Edition, ed. Kevin Hancer, Wallace-Homestead, 1990, The novels in the mapback series were primarily mysteries/detective fiction but ran the gamut from romances (Self- Made Woman by Faith Baldwin, #163) to science fiction (The First Men in the Moon by H.G. Wells, #201), war books (I Was A Nazi Flyer by Gottfried Leske, #21 and Eisenhower Was My Boss by Kay Summersby, #286), many Westerns (Gunsmoke and Trail Dust by Bliss Lomax, #271), joke books (Liberty Laughs, Cavanah & Weir, #38) and even crossword puzzles (Second Dell Book of Crossword Puzzles, ed. Kathleen Rafferty, #278, one of the rarest titles today). There were a few movie tie-in editions (The Harvey Girls by Samuel Hopkins Adams, #130, and Rope as by Alfred Hitchcock, #262) and the occasional attempt at more artistic non-genre fiction (To A God Unknown by John Steinbeck, #407). Novels which are today long forgotten, by largely unknown authors (Death Wears A White Gardenia, by Zelda Popkin, #13) are in the same series as valuable original paperback editions of famous authors (A Man Called Spade, by Dashiell Hammett, #90). \\"The back cover map was very popular with readers and remains popular with collectors... the Dell \\"mapbacks\\" are among the most well-known vintage paperbacks.\\" In the early 1950s, as series numbering reached the 400s, Dell began updating the appearance of its books. In 1951, the back cover maps began to be gradually replaced with conventional text and \\"blurb\\" covers. Some later, more stylized maps were the product of Milton Glaser and Push Pin Studios. These innovations were brought in by editor-in-chief Frank Taylor. He introduced classics in paperback form under the umbrella imprint \\"Laurel Editions\\" which included Henry James and a poetry series edited by the distinguished poet Richard Wilbur. Dell Ten Cent Books At about this time, Dell launched two short-lived experiments which are also considered very collectible, Dell First Editions and Dell Ten Cent Books. The Ten Cent Books, 36 in all, were thin, paperback-sized editions containing a single short story told in only 64 pages (advertised as \\"too short for popular reprint at a higher price\\"), such as Robert A. Heinlein's Universe (1951). Dell First Editions included novels by John D. MacDonald, Fredric Brown, Jim Thompson, Elmore Leonard and Charles Williams. Comic strip reprints In 1947, Dell published two unnumbered paperbacks based on newspaper comic strips, Blondie and Dagwood in Footlight Folly and Dick Tracy and the Woo Woo Sisters. Both are popular with collectors today. Dell was also the publisher between 1982 and 1987 of the series Twilight: Where Darkness Begins. Dell today Dell Publishing no longer exists as an independent entity. Dell was acquired by Doubleday in 1976. Doubleday was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1986, who formed Bantam Doubleday Dell as its US subsidiary. Bertelsmann acquired Random House in 1998 and renamed its US business after the acquisition.Random House Company History, from Fundinguniverse.com . Accessed April 13, 2008. After the merger, Bantam was merged with Dell Publishing. Bantam Dell became part of the Random House publishing group in 2008. Ballantine Books was merged with Bantam Dell in 2010. In 2013, Random House merged with Penguin to form Penguin Random House. Dell Magazines was sold in 1997, and it still exists as a major publisher of puzzle magazines, also publishing science fiction, mystery and horoscope magazines.

The expansion of cable television and pay-per-view, coupled with the efforts of promoters such as Vince McMahon, saw professional wrestling shift from a system controlled by numerous regional companies to one dominated by two nationwide companies: McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The decade also saw a considerable decline in the power of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), a cartel which had until then domineered the wrestling landscape, and in the efforts to sustain belief in the verisimilitude of wrestling.  History  In the early 1980s, professional wrestling in the U.S. consisted mainly of three competing organizations: the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in the Northeast, the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the Midwest, and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), which ran a territorial system around the country. = National Wrestling Alliance = Multiple NWA territories were very successful in the 1970s and continued that success in the early 1980s. TBS became a cable television superstation based on broadcasting Georgia Championship Wrestling with both Mr. Wrestling II and Tommy Rich being the top headliners in the territory. Ric Flair rose to prominence in Mid Atlantic Wrestling, while Dusty Rhodes was the fan favorite in Championship Wrestling from Florida. Mid South Wrestling had the first significant African American champion babyface Junkyard Dog. = American Wrestling Association = At the beginning of the 1980s, the AWA had the largest television business with distribution of their weekly broadcast in Chicago, Denver, Green Bay, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Omaha, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Winnipeg. The AWA expanded into the top-ten media market of the Bay Area after Roy Shire ran his last battle royale (the annual Royal Rumble continues this idea) at the Cow Palace on January 24, 1981, demonstrating that the AWA was positioned to prosper as other promotions failed. The AWA had the talent that would ultimately lead Vince McMahon Jr.'s WWE to pre-eminence in professional wrestling. Gene Okerlund and Bobby Heenan were AWA's major on-air talent. Hulk Hogan became the top babyface after Verne Gagne retired from full-time wrestling in 1981 and Nick Bockwinkel became the AWA World Heavyweight Champion. Hogan faced Bockwinkel on April 18, 1982, and on April 24, 1983, with both matches being decided with \\"Dusty finishes\\" where Hogan pinned Bockwinkel for a three count, but was then stripped of the title. Hogan said Gagne offered him the championship on the latter occasion in exchange for his merchandise rights and money from touring with other promotions which would show that Gagne understood wrestling was becoming a bigger business in the 1980s; however, Hogan refused. Gagne's failure to keep his fortunate position is a significant factor in the history of professional wrestling. = World Class Championship Wrestling = In 1982, Continental Productions, a subsidiary of Dallas independent station KXTX, began syndicating a one-hour show internationally from the Sportatorium in Dallas, Texas, of former NWA affiliate World Class Championship Wrestling run by Fritz Von Erich. Channel 11 had broadcast Von Erich's professional-wrestling television program as Saturday Night Wrestling for over a decade before Channel 39 began the second broadcast. The channel 39 broadcast was innovative because it was more like professional sports with host Bill Mercer, a former broadcaster for the Dallas Cowboys and Texas Rangers, mobile cameras at ringside with multiple shotgun microphones as used by Don King to capture and enhance the sound of impacts and crowd noise for boxing pay per views, and vignettes and interviews inspired by the Rocky movies to accentuate the heel or babyface of a wrestler outside of the ring. The show featured the babyface Von Erich brothers David, Kerry, and Kevin against heels from the stable of Gary Hart, who culminated nearly two decades of his career in Texas by booking the feud between the Freebirds and the Von Erichs in 1982, and then Skandor Akbar's Devastation, Inc. stable in 1983. The channel 39 syndicated show earned extremely high ratings - higher than Saturday Night Live and many wrestling promotions in the United States, including the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and the WWF.Mackinder, Mack (June 13, 2006). \\"Heroes of World Class DVD a definite treasure\\". CANOE ‚Äì SLAM! Sports. Retrieved April 12, 2015 The Von Erichs were the most recognizable babyfaces in professional wrestling throughout the United States in 1982 and 1983. The fall of the Von Erichs and death of nearly every wrestler associated with the promotion are attributed to abuse of drugs, primarily steroids, stimulants including cocaine, and pain-killing opiates. = The World Wrestling Federation expands = Vince McMahon, owner of then World Wrestling Federation, changed professional wrestling fundamentally in the 1980s In 1982, Vince McMahon purchased the business from his ailing father Vincent J. McMahon. On December 23, 1983, he signed AWA superstar Hulk Hogan to debut in 1984. To play Hogan's nemesis, he signed talents including World Championship Wrestling heel \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper and AWA manager Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan. McMahon stated in the documentary The UnReal Story of Professional Wrestling that he did not think his father would have ever sold him the company if he knew what he was planning to do. \\"He probably would have said, 'Vinny, what are you doing? You're gonna wind up at the bottom of a river',\\" he explained. At the end of 1983, two major developments increased competition to be the premier professional wrestling promotion. On November 24, 1983, Ric Flair defeated Harley Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the closed-circuit wrestling event Starrcade, which inaugurated Flair's golden era and was credited with showing that a major event could earn significant income across many locations. On December 23, 1983, WWF signed Hogan to return after appearing in Rocky III in 1982 and developing a babyface gimmick in the AWA. Fortune for the WWF came at the expense of WCCW and AWA. On January 23, 1984, Hogan defeated The Iron Sheik for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at Madison Square Garden. Shortly after the match, the WWF began promoting wrestling shows with Hogan in the main event in parts of the United States outside the Northeast, which changed a long-standing non-aggression pact between the WWF and other wrestling promotions. On February 10, David Von Erich died in Tokyo, Japan. Although there was a short-term boost culminating in Kerry Von Erich's victory over Ric Flair for the NWA World title in front of a packed Texas Stadium crowd on May 6, WCCW rapidly lost momentum as the death of Gino Hernandez and the suicide of Mike Von Erich placed a cloud over the promotion that became its legacy. The AWA signed a TV contract with ESPN, but the revenue was insignificant compared to the WWF's pay-per-view business, which was based on annual March/April events featuring Hogan in a landmark world-championship match each year from 1986 to 1991. With competition from cable superstations broadcasting WCCW, AWA and NWA, McMahon syndicated WWF television shows outside of the promotion's traditional Northeastern territory and began a home-video distribution label called Coliseum Video. McMahon would use the additional income generated by advertising, television deals, and video sales and rentals to further his bold ambition to tour nationally. However, such a venture required huge capital investment ‚Äî one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. McMahon did not meet immediate success. In May 1984, in a failed attempt to garner a greater appeal in the Southeast, McMahon bought a controlling interest in Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), an NWA member which held the lucrative Saturday time slot on Atlanta-based independent station WTBS‚Äîknown outside of Atlanta as \\"Superstation TBS.\\" On July 14, 1984 ‚Äî later dubbed \\"Black Saturday\\" ‚Äî WWF programming began airing in the TBS timeslot formerly occupied by GCW programming. The WWF programming was not successful and viewed as comical compared to the NWA. Due to low ratings and viewer protests, TBS began airing wrestling by Ole Anderson's promotion, as well as Bill Watts's Mid-South Wrestling, both of which garnered higher ratings than McMahon's WWF show. Later, McMahon sold the TBS timeslot to rival promoter Jim Crockett, Jr. for $1 million. In the WWE documentary The Rise and Fall of WCW, Crockett explained that his purchase of the timeslot basically paid for McMahon's first WrestleMania.The Rise and Fall of WCW DVD. By the end of 1984, the regional territory system of the NWA in Canada and the United States was clearly in jeopardy. In June 1984, Jack Tunney transferred his control in Maple Leaf Wrestling to the WWF. The AWA, WCCW and Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association formed Pro Wrestling USA in 1985 but the endeavor failed by the end of the year. Many fans, especially those in the Deep South, were angered by the collapse of their local wrestling promotions. Some of the more well-known promotions included Championship Wrestling from Florida and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling in Charlotte, North Carolina, were affected. These fans turned to Atlanta-based WCW broadcast on TBS. In most of these areas, WWF shows were not financially successful until 1997-98. = Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection = The WWF would go on to a period of unprecedented success in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s. The success was in part precipitated by the \\"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection,\\" a period of cooperation and cross-promotion between the WWF and elements of the music industry.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 166‚Äì167. The idea was formed by WWF manager Lou Albano, who met singer Cyndi Lauper on a trip to Puerto Rico. Lauper asked Albano to appear as her father in her video for the single \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" in 1983. McMahon later booked Lauper and Albano on a segment of Piper's Pit. During the segment, the Rock 'n' Wrestling storyline began when Lou called Lauper a \\"broad\\", while Lauper retaliated by hitting him with her purse.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 169‚Äì170. She then challenged Lou to a match between two female wrestlers of their choice. MTV broadcast the first live wrestling match on cable television as well as the first live women's professional wrestling match. Lauper chose Wendi Richter, while Albano chose The Fabulous Moolah. The match was scheduled for July 23, 1984, at The Brawl to End it All, broadcast live on MTV.Shields, Brian. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s, p. 87. During the match, Lauper interfered on Richter's behalf by hitting Moolah in the head with her purse, dubbed \\"The Loaded Purse of Doom\\". At the conclusion of the match, Richter defeated Moolah for the WWF Women's Championship, which the WWF had promoted as having been held by Moolah for the previous 28 years.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 171‚Äì173. The connection between Lauper and the WWF continued with the video for the song \\"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\\", \\"Time After Time,\\" and \\"She Bop,\\" all of which featured WWF wrestlers. Richter later had a match with Moolah's prot√©g√© Leilani Kai at The War to Settle the Score, with Lauper and Moolah in their respective corners.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 176‚Äì177. Kai won the title with the help of Moolah. Richter and Kai had a rematch at the inaugural WrestleMania, where Richter regained the title.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 184. On September 14, 1985, Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling, an animated television series starring the character of Hulk Hogan, premiered on CBS. The series ran until June 6, 1987, in the process expanding Hogan's young fanbase.Hulk Hogan's Rock 'N' Wrestling = The inaugural WrestleMania = In 1985, to counter the AWA's Super Sunday, the NWA's Starrcade and WCCW's Star Wars, the WWF created its own flagship show, WrestleMania I, held at Madison Square Garden and broadcast on 135 closed-circuit networks. The future of not just the WWF's national experiment but the whole professional wrestling industry came down to the success or failure of this pay-per-view. WrestleMania was an extravaganza marketed as \\"the Super Bowl of professional wrestling\\". The concept of a wrestling supercard was nothing new in North America; the NWA had been running Starrcade a few years prior to WrestleMania, and even the elder McMahon had marketed large Shea Stadium cards viewable in closed circuit locations. However, Wrestlemania I drew the interest of the mainstream media by including celebrities such as Mr. T and Cyndi Lauper to participate in the event. MTV's popularity and coverage of the women's wrestling feud generated a great deal of interest in WWF programming at this time. The show was a huge success. Hogan, who won in the main event, appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated which, after the swimsuit issue, was the magazine's best seller of 1985. Professional wrestling began to become mainstream, thanks, in large part, to the appeal of Hulkamania among children. Large television networks took wrestling into their weekly programming, including Saturday Night's Main Event, premiering on NBC in May 1985, as well as the syndicated weekly show WWF Championship Wrestling (which was also broadcast internationally). While Championship Wrestling was generally taped in Poughkeepsie, New York, Saturday Night's Main Event was taped in front of packed arenas around the country. WrestleMania's popularity and ratings appeal made professional wrestling a television mainstay. Professional wrestling, now synonymous with the WWF, began to throw more grandiose matches. In November 1985, a second pay-per-view \\"The Wrestling Classic\\" took place. The concept, a one-night tournament, was a huge success and would become a regular event, titled King of the Ring. = NWA competes with WWF = Jim Crockett, also envisioning a nationwide promotion, absorbed several other NWA members into a single entity known as Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). In 1986, he renamed JCP \\"NWA World Championship Wrestling\\". He would acquire several more promotions, including some non-NWA members, in the following year. By late 1987, Crockett's ownership of so many NWA affiliates, coupled with his continued presidency of the NWA, gave him considerable power. However, Crockett's spending had left JCP indebted, with the promotion facing a $5 million deficit. Crockett's attempt to generate revenue with the broadcast of the highly promoted Starrcade pay-per-view in late 1987 was thwarted by McMahon, who held his Survivor Series pay-per-view on the same day. The WWF threatened to cancel their contracts with cable companies that dared to carry Starrcade. As a result, only five cable companies opted to remain loyal to Crockett, which gave them only an $80,000 profit after expenses. A similar situation arose in January 1988, when Crockett's Bunkhouse Stampede pay-per-view was counter-programmed by the inaugural Royal Rumble, which aired for free on the USA Network. On November 21, 1988, Crockett was obliged to sell his promotion to Ted Turner. Under the ownership of Turner, the promotion was rechristened World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After years of financial turmoil and the constant changing of bookers, WCW would resume competition with McMahon's WWF when former AWA commentator Eric Bischoff was appointed as the promotion's Executive Vice President. = Hulk Hogan, Andr√© the Giant, Randy Savage, and Miss Elizabeth = Hulk Hogan WWF held its most successful event, WrestleMania III, in March 1987. It achieved the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America. The main event, during which Hogan scoop-slammed (later dubbed \\"the body slam heard around the world\\") and defeated Andr√© the Giant, helped the show go down in wrestling history as one of the greatest ever produced and made the WWF's popularity soar. In February 1988, Hogan and Andr√© faced each other in a special WrestleMania III rematch on the Friday night prime time spin-off of Saturday Night's Main Event, titled The Main Event I which saw Hogan lose to Andr√© by manipulation of the \\"Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase. After the match, Andr√© handed the title to DiBiase as promised, resulting in the title being vacated and setting the stage for a WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at WrestleMania IV. On a previous edition of the same show, \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage made his official transition from heel to babyface in his match against The Honky Tonk Man, with Miss Elizabeth bringing in Hogan to aid Savage against The Honky Tonk Man and The Hart Foundation. This eventually struck a friendship between Savage and Hogan. At WrestleMania IV, Savage won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament, with Miss Elizabeth and Hogan at his side. Months later, Hogan and Savage teamed up as The Mega Powers; and at the first ever SummerSlam, they faced off against DiBiase and Andr√©'s tag team known as The Mega Bucks. Though friends and tag partners, over the period of a year tensions began to build for various reasons, finally resulting in Savage striking Hogan in early 1989, turning Savage heel once again, and setting up a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania V, which saw Hogan after over a year once again hold the title. Savage and Hogan continued to feud until the February 1990 edition of The Main Event III, where Hogan successfully defended the title in a special WrestleMania V rematch. = End of an era = Andr√© the Giant Generally, WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990, is acknowledged as the end of the 1980s wrestling boom. The event saw one of the last WWF appearances of Andr√© the Giant (as a member of the Colossal Connection), who had become barely mobile in the ring due to real life health issues, and his parting with long-time manager Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan. In addition, Nikolai Volkoff (then part of The Bolsheviks) played his standard part as the evil Soviet Russian for one last time before turning babyface and embracing America, reflecting the end of the Cold War. The main event was a title-for-title match between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Ultimate Warrior. It not only pitted the WWF's two biggest faces against each other, but was intended as the \\"passing of the torch\\" from Hogan, the star of the 1980s, to Warrior, who was immensely popular and considered to be Hogan's successor. Hogan's clean pin fall loss signaled the end of an era. However, Hogan lingered on in the WWF for the next three years, winning the title for another three times. By the early 1990s, Hogan started appearing with much less frequency on WWF events, with Warrior taking the main-event spot through all of 1990 and 1991. In 1992, allegations of anabolic steroid abuse and sexual harassment were harming the WWF's family-friendly image. Around this time as well, Dr. George Zahorian, a member of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, was accused of selling anabolic steroids to many WWF wrestlers, including Hogan, who took a long hiatus from the WWF after WrestleMania VIII. Fans who were kids in the mid and late 1980s were teens by the 1990s, and many grew bored with the comic book style of wrestling of the 1980s, turning their attention away from their childhood favorites such as Hogan, Junkyard Dog, and \\"Superfly\\" Jimmy Snuka, in favor of newer and grittier wrestlers like The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Razor Ramon, Diesel, and Bret \\"Hitman\\" Hart; then in the Attitude Era in favor of Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, Mick Foley (whether competing as Cactus Jack, Dude Love, or Mankind), and The New Age Outlaws. Miss Elizabeth left the WWF in April 1992, and divorced Randy Savage that August. Hogan's return to the WWF in February 1993, episode of Monday Night Raw (which replaced another WWF program during the 1980s, Prime Time Wrestling) received a lackluster reaction from the crowds. Hulk Hogan left the WWF in the summer of 1993, and joined WCW the following spring. Randy Savage left the WWF for WCW in November 1994.

It was created from the merger of two older papers, the Commercial and the Dispatch, in the early 20th century. The first issue of the consolidated newspaper was published on March 12, 1922. The Dispatch is published six days a week (no edition is produced on Saturday) at the company's headquarters on a Goss Urbanite press. The paper is a longtime family-owned business and community mainstay; it has been owned by four generations of the Imes family. The current editor and publisher is Peter Imes. History =Consolidation= Vinton Birney Imes Sr. first went to work for Percy W. Maer at The Columbus Dispatch in 1910. Following Maer's death, Imes left The Columbus Dispatch and bought The Columbus Commercial. The following year Imes, local attorney John Frierson and local dentist Dr. D.D. Griffin formed a partnership and purchased The Columbus Commercial from Maer's widow. Imes merged the two papers in 1922. A subscription was $3 per year for home delivery and $2 for delivery by mail. The paper was a bi-weekly publication. =Post consolidation= In 1925 Imes moved the newspaper to its present location at 516 Main Street. The Commercial Dispatch became a daily paper in 1926. Upon Imes's death on June 18, 1947 at the age of 58, his son, Vinton Birney Imes Jr. took over as editor and publisher. Birney Imes Jr. carried on as editor and publisher for nearly 50 years. His son, Birney Imes III assumed the leadership of the Dispatch in 1996 after the retirement of his father. From 1956 to 2004, The Commercial Dispatch operated WCBI-TV, the CBS television affiliate for north Mississippi. On June 8, 2009 The Commercial Dispatch began publishing The Starkville Dispatch, a daily edition of The Commercial Dispatch that focuses on Starkville, Mississippi. Both papers share the bulk of their content, including all advertising, but the local news pages in The Starkville Dispatch tend to focus on Starkville-specific content. In January 2018, Peter Imes, the great-grandson of the first editor-publisher of The Commercial Dispatch, became the fourth man in the family to hold that title. Circulation Daily circulation is approximately 14,000. In addition to the daily newspaper, the Dispatch maintains an online presence and publishes the quarterly magazine Catfish Alley. The paper has no local competition in the daily market in Columbus, but does compete with a local weekly, the Columbus Packet, and two daily newspapers in its regional coverage area, the Starkville Daily News and the West Point Daily Times Leader. Subscriptions are currently about $12 per month. Rack papers sell for $0.75 Monday through Friday and $1.25 on Sunday.

After the death of the former General Secretary of the Party, Bento Gon√ßalves, in the Concentration camp of Tarrafal, in Portuguese Cape Verde, Milit√£o Ribeiro initiated, along with √Ålvaro Cunhal and J√∫lio Foga√ßa, a major reorganization of the Party, in the early 1940s. Such reorganization, based on the Leninist principles, transformed the Party in the major reference of the resistance against the regime. In 1949, Ribeiro was arrested by the political police, the PIDE, and imprisoned in the penitentiary of Lisbon. Ribeiro would die shortly after, victim of spanking and liver problems. Before dying, he managed to send a letter to some Party comrades, written with his own blood.
