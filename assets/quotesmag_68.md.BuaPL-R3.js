Robert Fowler, Canada's ambassador to the United Nations, headed the commission that compiled the report, which raised widespread international concern by highlighting the strong link between the illicit diamond trade and third world conflicts. UN sanctions Following the resumption of the Angolan civil war by UNITA, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1173 and Resolution 1176 in 1998, which sought to bring an end to the conflict by imposing sanctions against the UNITA movement, specifically targeting its ability to finance the war through the sale of blood diamonds. Sanctions-breaking diamond trade Despite the sanctions imposed against UNITA, the organisation was able to continue financing the conflict; the UN therefore passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 1237, which gave Robert Fowler's panel of experts a mandate to investigate how the sanctions were being circumvented. According to the Fowler Report, UNITA used a number of channels to sell or barter diamonds for cash or weapons. In one of the schemes that was identified, Joe de Deker, a former stockholder in De Beers, worked with the government of Zaire to supply military equipment to UNITA from 1993 to 1997. De Deker's brother, Ronnie, was an arms dealer who allegedly travelled with him from South Africa to Angola, directing weapons originating in Eastern Europe. In return, UNITA gave Ronnie bushels of diamonds worth US$6 million. De Deker sent the diamonds to De Beer's buying office in Antwerp, Belgium. De Beers openly acknowledges spending $500 million on legal and illegal Angolan diamonds in 1992 alone. The United Nations estimates Angolans made between three and four billion dollars through the diamond trade between 1992 and 1998. The UN also estimates that out of that sum, UNITA made at least $3.72 billion, or 93% of all diamond sales, despite international sanctions. =Support for UNITA= Togolese President Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma allowed UNITA to use Togo as a base of operations. He gave money to relatives of Jonas Savimbi and shipped arms to UNITA militants. The report condemned Burkinab√© President Blaise Compaor√© for sending fuel to UNITA and maintaining a stronger alliance with UNITA than all other African leaders. The Rwandan and Gabonese governments refueled UNITA airplanes and sent fuel to Angola. The governments of South Africa, Zambia, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Morocco and Belgium did not enforce the UN-travel ban on UNITA officials while France, Portugal, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States allowed UNITA to maintain offices in their respective countries. Impact The UN had no powers to enforce compliance with the sanctions, so the report instead set out to name and shame the countries, companies and individuals involved, and thereby led directly to the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295 and the subsequent establishment of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme Kimberly Process Authority Chairman Is Determined by Member voting (United Nations General Assembly Resolution 55/56).

Life  Juliusz Kazimierz Kaden-Bandrowski studied piano at conservatories in Lw√≥w, Krak√≥w and Leipzig. While studying at Brussels, he switched his interests to philosophy. During World War I, he served as aide to J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and as chronicler to the First Brigade of the Polish Legions. In 1907 he had begun working as a correspondent for the Polish press. After World War I, he associated himself with the Skamander group of Polish experimental poets founded in 1918, and in 1933 joined the Polish Academy of Literature.

Daily (February 8, 1902 ‚Äì December 5, 1987), better known as \\"Pappy\\" Daily, was an American country music record producer and entrepreneur who cofounded the Texas-based record label Starday Records. Daily worked with many of the well-known artists in country music during the 1950s and 1960s, especially George Jones, who looked upon him as a father figure and as a business advisor.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas (2003). All Music Guide to Country, 2nd edition, San Francisco, CA: Backbeat, . Other artists with whom Daily worked include Melba Montgomery (signed by Daily following recommendation by Jones), J. P. Richardson (the Big Bopper), and Roger Miller.  Early life  Daily was born in Yoakum, Texas at the beginning of the 20th century. His mother remarried soon after Daily's father died when Daily was a child and the family relocated to Houston. After his military service, Daily was involved in many different lines of business, including working on the railroads and the amusement-machine business. Later, he started his own venture distributing jukeboxes, and during this period, he discovered his appreciation of country records from listening to the early hits being played on his own machines. During World War II, he opened his first record outlet in Houston. He entered the country music scene in the early 1930s, although he had no previous professional background in music and was not an accomplished musician or singer himself. His business acumen and his ability to nourish talent in others were his strong points. Daily did not rise to prominence, though, until helping found Starday in 1953.  A career in the music business  Daily founded Starday Records with Jack Starnes and it grew to become one of the most successful independent labels from Texas in the 1950s. In the mid-1950s, when Starday signed up George Jones, Daily became a figure in country music. Together with Don Pierce (who replaced Starnes at Starday), Daily worked extensively with George Jones to further Jones' career until they came to the attention of Mercury Records, which wanted Jones and the Daily/Pierce partnership. Daily's agreement with Mercury allowed him to continue with his Starday venture and other independent labels, licensing any promising records back to Mercury for the larger label to market and distribute. As a record producer at Mercury, he worked on a succession of hits for Jones. Jones later asserted that the Nashville studio musicians and he did most of the actual production work on his recordings, and that Daily, with whom Jones eventually fell out, primarily made sure the session paperwork was in order. In 1961, Daily and Pierce ended their partnership and at the end of 1961, Daily left Starday and Mercury to go to United Artists, becoming their country and western director. Jones, who had followed his mentor to United Artists, had more big hits working with Daily, but Daily failed to progress anyone else's career to the same extent as he did with George Jones. Daily also founded the Musicor Records label in the 1960s with Art Talmadge, and George Jones was their biggest name. Daily also founded a label with the unusual one-letter name \\"D\\" Records focusing on Texas acts, but none of them matched his previous success. In 1965, he closed D Records and left United Artists to concentrate his efforts on Musicor, signing artists of the calibre of Gene Pitney. George Jones and Gene Pitney were by far the biggest names on the Musicor label, so by the time the 1970s arrived, with Pitney no longer making records and Jones moving on to Epic Records, Musicor was left without any names big enough to make the label viable. In 1967, on the recommendation of Kitty Wells and Roger Miller, Daily teamed young guitarist Zane Ashton (aka Bill Aken) with United Artist country singer Kathy Dee, who had just hit with \\"Don't Leave Me Lonely Too Long\\". Ashton was to produce Kathy's next three records. Elvis used to call Ashton \\"the Fixer\\" due to his ability to fix a mediocre sound track with his guitar work. The sound tracks the young guitarist produced for Progressive Sounds of America were four of the most innovative of the period. These productions, along with those done for Ray Price and Eddy Arnold, helped usher in the use of big string sections on country music records. Cliffie Stone of Capitol Records said, \\"The wall has been breached and soon violins in country music will be an everyday thing\\". Sadly, Kathy Dee had a stroke and never finished the recordings. By the mid-1970s, Daily had quit producing records to concentrate on his music-publishing company, with Musicor fading from the scene.

Cumpston, Shipping arrivals & departures Sydney, 1788-1825, Roebuck, Camberra, p.40. Thereafter she was employed in public service for the colonial government of New South Wales. She was described as a \\"long boat decked\\" in good repair and crewed by a master and three seamen who were to receive an extra ration from the stores. She was employed to bring grain to Sydney from different settlements and for various other purposes.Historical Records of Australia, Series I, Volume III, p. 700. Bee was under the command of Thomas Bryant when she sailed on 25 June 1806 from Sydney for the Hawkesbury River. On 28 June 1806 the ship ran into a storm that shifted her ballast and damaged her rigging and mast. All the food was washed overboard and the water barrel was smashed. On 29 June 1806 the storm abated and Bee joined with another small ship, Contest, on the way to Newcastle. While Contest managed to get into harbour, Bee was becalmed just outside. A strong current then took the ship southwards when her anchor dragged. Further squalls sprang up over the next couple of days and shredded what was left of Bee‚Ä≤s sails. The two men crewing the ship, Bryant and the ship's owner, Benjamin Crew, were exhausted, hungry, and thirsty as the current then took them northward. On 12 July 1806, Bryant killed the ship's cat and they drank its blood, and on 16 July 1806 Bryant died. On 18 July 1806, Crew was able to get the attention of a passing whaler, Brothers, which rescued him. Bee was left to drift and was never seen again.

Early life Terry Hollands was born in 1979 in Dartford, Kent having a birth weight of 12 lbs 14oz. He was a keen sportsman in his childhood and teens, playing Judo and Rugby Union. However, despite sport being a big part of his life, he did not start serious gym training until he was 22 in order to help his rugby, and he typically focused on endurance training. In 2004 he contracted a leg infection and on his return to the gym he focused on strongman training. His training schedule has been described as \\"ferociously unforgiving\\" and he has espoused the benefits of visualisation techniques saying \\"you can't get by without it.\\" In 2017 Terry began his weight loss transformation going from 203 kg at his heaviest to 165 kg. By January 2018 he was 147 kg and placed 3rd at Britains Strongest Man - the lightest he had ever been throughout his entire strongman career. He measured at 12% bodyfat on a DEXA scan in the USA in February 2018. He then took this even further by taking part in a bodybuilding competition in 2019 where he stepped on stage at 135 kg and 5% bodyfat. Strongman career Hollands career as a strongman began in 2005, coming second at the 2005 England's Strongest Man and first at the 2005 UK's Strongest Man contests. In 2006 he lost his UK title to Glenn Ross but turned his attention to the Britain's Strongest Man competition. In 2005 Hollands qualified for the 2005 World's Strongest Man competition, although he did not qualify for the finals. In 2007 he took the title of Britain's Strongest Man and went on to finish third at the 2007 World's Strongest Man, the first time a British competitor had achieved a top 3 place in over 10 years. The 2008 Britain's Strongest Man saw Hollands conceding his title to Jimmy Marku, coming second overall. However, in the 2008 World's Strongest Man contest he still made the final coming second in his qualifying heat. In the final he placed last out of the ten finalists. Hollands improved on this finish in the 2009 World's Strongest Man coming sixth overall. 2010 was a mixed year for Hollands. A series of strong performances and podium finishes in the Strongman Champions League, including a win in Ireland(tied w/Zydrunas Savickas), was derailed by serious injury, when he tore his biceps in the Europe's Strongest Man contest in June.Monday, 21 June 2010, Terry Hollands/Jimmy Marku: Torn Biceps Update by Randall J. Strossen, IronMind So strong had the early season been that Terry was still crowned the 2010 SCL overall champion on 18 December 2010. His return from the biceps injury was rapid and Hollands was able to compete at the 2010 World's Strongest Man contest where he made the final for the fifth consecutive year, and finished in 8th place. In 2011 he achieved a podium finish in the competition for the second time, placing 3rd, but in 2012 another biceps injury saw him withdraw from the final. Hollands is one of only five British men to have been on the podium at World's Strongest Man. In the 2014 edition, he became the only man to have qualified for the final in nine consecutive years. On 4 September 2015 he played rugby for England against the Rest of the World in a charity fundraising match. In October 2018, Hollands appeared in a series of YouTube videos with 4 Time WSM Brian Shaw where he and Shaw purchased food from Costco, cooked it, and engaged in conversation in Shaw's gym. In November 2019, Hollands won the 2019 World's Strongest Man Masters competition held at the Official Strongman Games in Daytona, Florida. =Strongman= done in official Strongman competition * Strongman Deadlift (with straps) - - (World's Strongest Man finals 2011) * Log lift - done in training * Deadlift (with straps) - * Log lift - * Front squat - * Bench press - Bodybuilding In 2019 Terry decided to decline his invite to the World's Strongest Man 2019 contest, and turn his focus on to bodybuilding. He competed in his first ever bodybuilding contest in August 2019 placing 1st in the Beginners category, 2nd in the Masters category and 2nd in the Open Super Heavyweight category. This qualified him for the 2brospro British Finals but he decided not to participate due to his upcoming wedding to his now wife Kate Errington (Hollands). Terry stepped on stage at 135 kg (297 lbs) at approximately 5-6% body fat - measured at 1 week out by a sports scientist using both callipers and bodpod technology at Canterbury University. Terry was coached by his wife and IFBB PRO Kate Errington. Three weeks later Terry couldn't resist jumping straight back in to a Strongman Competition, competing at the Giants Live World Tour Finals.

It is a sequel to Lake Placid (1999) and the second installment in the Lake Placid series. The film premiered on April 28, 2007 on the Sci-Fi Channel and was released direct to video on January 29, 2008.  Plot  The film begins with two researchers, Frank Mills and Tillman on a rubber tube raft until Tillman is dragged into the water and killed by a crocodile. In Aroostook County, Maine, Frank reports this to sheriff James Riley, showing him Tillman's severed body parts. James, Frank, and wildlife officer Emma Warner venture out onto the lake, where they find more of Tillman's remains. Meanwhile, three friends, Mike, Edie, and Sharon are killed by a crocodile while swimming in the lake. James, Emma and Frank stop at the house of Sadie Bickerman, an elderly hermit who has allegedly been feeding the crocodiles, to interrogate her about her missing sister Delores but she refuses to answer nor let them in the house. A poacher named Jack Struthers and his assistant Ahmad land their plane on the lake, hoping to kill the crocodiles after getting a tip from a local. The sheriff's son, Scott Riley wanders into the woods, and appears to be stalked by the incoming crocodile. It turns out to be Daisy, the pet dog of Kerri. Scott then meets Kerri and her boyfriend, Thad. Daisy barks at something moving in the lake but Kerri sees nothing. Sadie talks with a photographer at a boat dock before going back to her cabin, and the photographer is killed by a swarm of baby crocodiles while taking pictures. Riding the boat again James suddenly slows down, knocking Frank into the lake, but James and Emma bring him back on board to safety. When a crocodile appears James draws his gun, but the crocodile dives under to knock the three off the boat. The boat is demolished, and all three get to land unharmed. The three meet Struthers and Ahmad, who flew a plane to distract the crocodile. The next scene shows Rachel and Larry, along with Scott, Kerri, and Thad venturing in the woods to another part of the lake. With the Sheriff's team, Deputy Dale Davis comes in to unload the boat, while the crew sets up a tent for overnight camping. They see a wild boar trapped in a rope net and feed it to the crocodile. The crew neutralizes the crocodile with their guns and Dale ties the mouth with a rope, but the crocodile easily breaks free, severs Dale's arm and devours him. Frank dies from a fall and the others move on. Meanwhile, Rachel is killed by the crocodile who drags her into the lake, while Larry manages to escape. The other three of the younger group find eggs in the woods. Thad breaks some eggs and is killed by a crocodile. The Sheriff's group feed a boar carcass to one crocodile but a harpoon arrow accidentally damages Struthers' plane. James and Ahmad abandon the boat, and Struthers is thrown off the plane, but Ahmad neutralizes the crocodile. Thunderstorms strike the night, forcing the crew to their tents. Scott and Kerri are stranded in the woods until they find a horrified Larry. The Sheriff's crew is fast asleep in their tents until the crocodile attacks and kills Ahmad. The next morning, Scott, Kerri, and Larry climb a tree to avoid a crocodile but Larry falls from the tree and is killed. James finds the two surviving teenagers, and kills the crocodile with a grenade launcher. Sadie lets the teenagers inside her house for safety, until she tricks them into entering the lake and is then devoured by a crocodile herself. The police battles one crocodile, and Emma kills it by puncturing its mouth with a jackknife. Struthers hangs upside down on a tree and he is decapitated by the last crocodile. James kills it with multiple explosive substances that destroys the crocodile's nest. At the end, Scott and Kerri kiss while James and Emma leave the lake together. It is revealed that Emma took the crocodile's eggs from the nest earlier and sends them to the scientific lab.

History The first king of Seville was Abu al-Qasim (1023‚Äì1042). He was qadi of Seville and declared independence from the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba after its downfall in 1031, becoming Abbad I, King of Seville. The second king was his son Abbad II al-Mu'tadid (1042‚Äì1069), the last king Muhammad al-Mu'tamid (1069‚Äì1091). The kingdom started as a small, weakly-defended territory comprising parts of the modern Spanish provinces of Seville, Huelva, and C√°diz, but quickly emerged as the most powerful taifa (kingdom) of the time, after its rulers began pursuing a policy of expansion. After several military campaigns, the kingdom achieved dominance over all of western Andalusia and Murcia, gradually absorbing the taifas of Badajoz, Algeciras, Granada, M√°laga, M√©rtola (1044), Huelva (1051), Algarve (1051), Niebla (1053) Algeciras (1055), Silves (1063), Ronda (1065), Mor√≥n (1066), Carmona (1067), Arcos (1069), and even C√≥rdoba itself (1070, lost in 1075 to Toledo but regained in 1077). The kingdom reached its largest territorial extent in 1078 with the capture of Murcia by the poet Abu Bakr ibn Ammar. Nevertheless, the Abbad family was still subject to taxation by the King of Castile, of whom they were vassals. The drain of these taxes weakened the kingdom's power: al-Mu'tamid's decision to stop paying these taxes caused King Alfonso VI (who had already conquered Toledo in 1085) to besiege Seville. Al-Mu'tamid asked help from the Almoravids of Morocco against the Castilian king. The Moroccans established themselves at Algeciras, and after defeating the Christians occupied all the Islamic taifas, including, in 1091, Seville itself. After they ravaged the city, al-Mu'tamid ordered his sons to give up the royal fortress (early Alc√°zar of Seville) in order to save their lives. He was taken prisoner to Aghmat, in what is now Morocco, where he was executed in 1095. Besides the intrigues and the eagerness for conquests of the kings, many artists of the time moved to the court of Seville, as the Almer√≠a poet Ibn al-Abb√¢r, author of letters, and the poet Ab√ª '√Çmir ibn Maslama and Ab√ª'l-Wal√Æd al-Himyar√Æ, that made a compilation of the literary works of both ones. Al-Mu'tadid also was a remarkable poet, having been taught by Ibn Ammar. On the other hand, he had a very cruel personality. His son al-Mu'tamid was even more dedicated to poetry than his father. He was friend of the poet Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn al-\`Amm√¢r, who was famous at that moment after defeating the Castilian king Alfonso VI in a chess contest. Al-Mu'tamid's sons, al-Rashid and al-Radi, were also very interested in culture, but had no interest in politics, and after the death of the king al-Mu'tamid, the Taifa of Seville was ruled by the Almoravids. Al-Mu'tamid was lover of the future queen Itimad (Rumayqiyya). A brief tale on the queen Rumayqiyya appears on the book Libro de los ejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio (Book of the examples of Count Lucanor and Patronio), as the tale XXX, De lo que aconteci√≥ al rey Abenabed de Sevilla con su mujer, Ramaiqu√≠a (\\"What happened to the king Abenabed of Seville with her wife, Ramaiqu√≠a\\"). Symbols There are chronicles of that time that tells Almoravids fought under a white flag, while Andalusian soldiers as those of Sultan Al-Mu'tamid fought under different green flags with Islamic texts written on them. This is supposedly the origin of the current Andalusian flag, currently used as the autonomous region flag, called Arbonaida or Arbondaira.

Davies also wrote the Royal Air Force March Past, the official march of the Royal Air Force, in 1918.

During the 1930s RAF music became well established and in the lead up to World War II there was a large expansion of Music Services. Additional military bands were provided on a Command basis, with the RAF Symphony Orchestra and the famous 'Squadronaires' Dance Band being established. The Central Band included some of the country's finest musicians such as Dennis Brain, Norman Del Mar and Gareth Morris. By 1950, Wing Commander A E Sims, OBE, had brought his experience of conducting at the Royal Academy of Music in London and then at the Royal College of Music to Royal Air Force Music Services. In 1990 the RAF became the first Service to recruit women into mixed bands and today females are recruited on the same basis as their male colleagues. They form a significant proportion of the personnel with some bands being nearly half female. RAF musicians are also trained to provide medical support in times of war.

It is published every Wednesday and distributed around San Diego county, although with a focus on the city of San Diego itself, with a weekly circulation (as of January 2011) of 49,750.  History  Southland Publishing purchased SLAMM magazine, a music biweekly, from publisher Kevin Hellman in 2002. It planned to target young, educated readers in San Diego, an audience whose needs, Southland's owners felt, were not being met by the other two major publications in San Diego, the San Diego Union Tribune and the San Diego Reader. David Rolland, a journalist and editor with more than 10 years experience, was named editor of CityBeat, while Hellman, the former publisher of SLAMM, was named the entertainment/promotions manager of the new weekly. Hellman, who organizes the annual North Park Music Thing music festival and San Diego Music Awards, is the weekly's publisher. CityBeat continues to sponsor the San Diego Music Awards, which was initially organized by Hellman's SLAMM magazine. Rolland appeared on the Editor's Roundtable, a radio show on local public radio station, KPBS, from 2004. The addition of Rolland and other local editors to the show's guest list led Bob Kittle, then editor of the San Diego Union Tribune editorial page, and the editors of the San Diego Voice and Viewpoint and San Diego Metropolitan magazine, who until then had been the show's only panelists, to leave the show.KPBS Abrogated Its Duty to Maintain Objectivity and Balance In Its Local Public Affairs Television Programing by Cancelling The Full Focus ProgramRemebering Bob Kittle's Editor's Roundtable Tantrum Rolland left CityBeat in March 2015.https://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/mar/11/longtime-editor-leaves-san-diego- citybeat/https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Dave-Rolland-Leaving-San- Diego-City-Beat-291760541.html He was replaced by Ron Donoho, who was fired in November 2016 and replaced with Seth Combs- who was fired in August 2019.https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2016/11/29/san-diego-citybeat-fires- editor-amid-fiscal-fears/ In 2013 and 2014, Kelly Davis and Dave Maass co- authored a series of stories in CityBeat on dozens of deaths in San Diego county jails between 2007 and 2012 and citing its extremely high county-jail mortality rate.

In The Netherlands he was known as Hans Falck van Neurenberg. In the 1610s he lived and worked in Den Bosch and in 1619 he became a citizen of Leeuwarden, where he started a foundry. A lot of churches in Friesland and a few in Groningen bear his name on their bells. Around 1634/1635 he left Friesland for Russia. His foundry in Leeuwarden was taken over by Jacob Noteman. Bell made by Hans Falk yn the tower of the church in Surhuizum The name of Hans Falk, as a Moscow Cannon Yard craftsman, was first mentioned in historical documents in 1627. From then on and until the late 1650s, he was considered as the main cannon and bellmaker of Moscow. Falk was paid an official salary and given a \\"gift from the tsar\\" once a year. He was granted a workshop made of stone at the Moscow Cannon Yard, while other Russian foundrymen had to work in those made of wood. Hans Falk lived at the household of Knyaz Mikhail Kozlovsky on Rozhdestvenskaya Street. In April 1641, he filed a petition in the name of Mikhail Fyodorovich, asking the tsar to provide him with his own household, which would soon happen. A German scholar Adam Olearius, who travelled through Russia in the 1630s, mentions Hans Falk in his book Beschreibung der muscowitischen und persischen Reise, saying that he was a very experienced craftsman from Nuremberg and taught Russians how to cast cannons. Adam Olearius also says that Falk was able to make cannons that could discharge 26 pounds (11.8 kg) of iron with 25 pounds (11.3 kg) of gunpowder. According to Olearius, this is what made Hans Falk famous in Holland. In 1641, Mikhail Fyodorovich ordered Hans Falk to cast a 700-pood (11,500 kg) bell for the Dormition Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin, which would shatter 10 years later. In 1652, Falk took issuance with some of the Russian bellmakers (led by Danila Matveyev and Yemelyan Danilov) on recasting of this bell and lost the court battle. Hans Falk worked in Russia for more than 25 years. He rarely affixed signatures on his works; therefore, only a few bells can be attributed to Falk: *a bell for the Nativity Monastery in Vladimir (1632) *a bell for the Annunciation Cathedral in Kazan (1640; signed by Falk) *a bell for the Trinity Church in Nikitniki (1649; it is now a part of the State Historical Museum collection) *a bell for the belfry of the Savva Storozhevsky Monastery near Zvenigorod (1652) *a bell for the Transfiguration Cathedral in Yaroslavl (signed by Falk) *possibly, the 35-pood (570 kg) Rodionovsky bell on the Ivan the Great Bell Tower of the Moscow Kremlin, cast in 1647 It is also known that Hans Falk recast one of the bells for the Ivan the Great Bell Tower and cast the Yunak harquebus. It is not clear how Hans Falk's service at the Moscow Cannon Yard came to an end. He could have returned to his motherland, when his services were no longer needed, or he could have died of plague in the 1650s like many other Russian craftsmen. Nevertheless, his work had significant impact on the Russian founding art of the second half of the 17th century. Historical documents mention four of Falk's apprentices: Stepan Orefyev, Timofei Timofeyev Utinkov, Ivan Timofeyev Reztsov, and Ivan Ivanov. A certain succession of Falk's casting traditions can be traced in the works of Yemelyan Danilov, Alexander Grigoryev, and the Motorins.

Tributes * An Indian engineer-turned-businessman, Sadhan C. Dutt - much before Narayana Murthy and his ilk put their imprint in the American business scene, Dutt was running his business empire (DC-Kuljian Group) around the globe. Starting from a small consulting engineering firm in Calcutta, his interest now covers a large range of service economy. ‚Äì The Hindu Business Line. * Long before the information technology sector had become a major job provider in the state, an entrepreneur had hit upon the idea of making profitable use of the rich human resource pool of the state. And he was no fly by night operator but a US-returned engineer. After a stint in the Kuljian, Sadhan Dutta started his firm Development Consultants Limited (DCL) and never looked back. The skill of the engineers of his firm spread far and wide. In a nation where technology was yet to come into its own, DCL was courted by the government and industrialists to set up large industrial projects from scrap. As the decades rolled on, DCL spread its wings beyond Indian shores and became a key international player. Dutta continued to be at the helm of its affairs. Apart from his engineering skills, he was one of the few industrialists of the state whose firm‚Äôs policies and technology moved with the times. Never getting on the wrong side of the powers that be, Dutta‚Äôs firms prospered even as blue chip firms fell by the wayside.

The egg was made for Nicholas II of Russia, who presented it to his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna to celebrate the birth of their only son, the tsarevich Alexei. As a clock-egg, the Colonnade egg contained no surprise. Design The Colonnade egg is made of Bowenite, four-colour gold, silver-gilt, platinum, guilloch√© enamel and rose diamonds. It is one of only four Faberge Easter Eggs to include a clock in the design. The Colonnade Egg features a rotary clock made by the Swiss firm Henry Moser & Cie. The egg symbolizes a temple of love. A pair of platinum doves represent the love of Nicholas and Alexandra. Four silver-gilt cherubs sit around the base of the egg, each representing Nicholas and Alexandra's four daughters: Anastasia, Olga, Maria, and Tatiana. Alexei is represented by a silver-gilt cupid, which surmounts the egg. The cupid is now missing a silver-gilt staff or twig which was held in his right hand and was used to indicate the hour. History Purchased for 11,600 roubles the Colonnade Egg was presented to Alexandra at Eastertide 1910 to celebrate the 1904 birth of Alexei, the fifth child and only son of Nicholas and Alexandra. After giving birth to four daughters, the birth of their first and only son was significant because it ensured a direct heir to the throne, rather than succession passing to Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia, the younger brother of Nicholas II. Upon the abdication of Nicholas II and the imprisonment of the family in 1917, the Colonnade Egg was confiscated by the provisional government. It then appears on a 1922 list of confiscated treasures moved from the Anichkov Palace to the Sovnarkom, which was a state-run organization which collected and conserved treasures. In 1927 the Colonnade Egg was sold as one of nine eggs to Emanuel Snowman of London antique dealer Wartski. Two years later it was sold to Queen Mary of Teck and inherited by Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. It remains in the Royal Collection. From July to October 2011, the Colonnade Egg was featured in the Royal Faberg√© exhibition during the summer opening of Buckingham Palace. Other Faberg√© eggs in the Royal Collection include: * Twelve Panel, 1899, Alexander Kelch to his wife Barbara (Varvara) Kelch-Bazanova. * Basket of Wild Flowers, 1901, Gift of Nicholas II to Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. * Mosaic, 1914, gift of Nicholas II to Empress Alexandra Feodorovna.

The Assietta Division was reorganized 5 April 1939 as a binary Mountain division.http://www.regioesercito.it/reparti/fanteria/rediv26.htm The only difference between line infantry divisions and mountain infantry divisions was that the latter's artillery was carried by pack mules instead of the standard horse-drawn carriages. Italy's real mountain warfare divisions were the six alpine divisions manned by the \\"Alpini\\" mountain troops. Most men drafted in the Assietta Division came from Asti and surroundings. History=Second Italo-Abyssinian War= As the war become imminent, the 25th divisional artillery regiment was sent in September, 1935 to Libya, and transferred to Eritrea in March 1936, to fight within the newly formed Assietta Infantry Division II (126a) which was dissolved later in 1937. The Assietta division itself, receiving a 49th divisional artillery regiment instead of the missing 25th, landed in Massawa in January 1936. Soon it reached the Endaga Robo- Enticho-Dek‚ÄôemhƒÅre region. Then it moved its headquarters to Mek'ele, guarding a front from Doghea to Kwƒ´hƒÅ. The Assietta division participated in the Battle of Amba Aradam in February 1936, fighting mostly in defence. Some detachments of Assietta division were used to reinforce the left flank of the 27th Infantry Division Sila. On 2 March 1939, it blocked a retreat route of the Ethiopian army on the front from Yereserƒì to Edai. But the retreating Ethiopian army bypassed the Asietta division, breaking through Italian lines further to the east in their push to Amba Alagi. The Assietta division, now used as a rear areas guard force, followed in March‚ÄìApril 1936 first to Aderat and Amba Alagi and then to Atzalo and Aiba. After the conclusion of war, it was used in June 1936 for mopping-up south of Lake Ashenge. In July 1936 it was transferred to an unidentified location, \\"Seggi√π\\". The last duty assignment was in September 1936 to the city of Dessie. The orders to return to Italy were received 2 February 1937. =Second World War= Following return to Italy, the Assietta division was placed in Latina, Lazio in March 1937, where it received back the 25th artillery regiment. Several reorganizations and detachments followed, until 5 April 1939, when the form of the new Assietta division was settled. The newly reorganized division took part in the Italian invasion of France. It was then involved in the Invasion of Yugoslavia and soon after moved to Sicily. It was destroyed during the Allied landings. Italian invasion of France 10 June 1940, the Assietta division stayed on the border with France near mountain peaks Rochers Charniers, Grand Queyron, Mont Chaberton, the pass of Col de Montgen√®vre, and Thuras valley. The advance on French territory started on 18 June 1940, with the border post captured by surprise. By 20 June 1940, the division moved past mountain crests, completing capture of the Mount Chenaillet and mount Sommet des Anges fortified area by 22‚Äì23 June 1940, but further advance was stopped by the Franco-Italian Armistice 25 June 1940. Invasion of Yugoslavia At the start of April, 1941, the Assietta division was in the border town of Ajdov≈°ƒçina. On 6 April 1941, it moved to defensive positions at Javornik, Idrija. After the failure of the Yugoslavian army the division moved its headquarters to Delnice 20 April 1941, performing for a while mopping-up operations in the Gerovo-Karlovac-Lokve, Croatia region. As operations had been wrapping up, the division moved to Ilirska Bistrica on 6 May 1941 before departing for Italy 15 May 1941. Defence of Sicily The location of Assietta division changed during the first half of August 1941 to the western part of Sicily island as part of XII army corps. Initially, the headquarters were located in Caltanissetta, and the coastal defence sector stretched from Porto Empedocle to Licata. On 10 July 1943, the day of the Allied invasion of Sicily, the division was in the Santa Ninfa-Partanna area in the west of Sicily, but started marching to Licata immediately. By the time the division was able to make contact with the enemy, the rapid Allied advance resulted in battles in the Lercara Friddi area. Unable to cover the wide front against the numerous Allied troops, on 15 July 1943 the Assietta division had to split into three roadblock groups near Bisacquino, blocking routes from Agrigento to Palermo. Unfortunately, the rapid crumbling of Italian defences elsewhere meant that a defensive line to be abandoned on 16 July 1943. The division then fell back to the Cerda-Chiusa Sclafani line. Unlike other Italian units nearby, it maintained constant contact with the enemy, constantly setting up delaying battles. An attempt was made to make a stand 22 July 1943, but by the late evening 23 July 1943, the Allies had made a breakthrough, resulting in an Italian run to Santo Stefano di Camastra. On 29 July 1943, the division fought at the San Fratello-Troina line. The nearby Battle of Troina was over on 6 August 1943, and United States units turned their forces to the battered Assietta division again. The initial armor attack to San Fratello and mount Pizzo degli Angeli was repulsed, but on 7 August 1943, the Assietta had to fall back to Tortorici after the Allies made a landing at the division's rear in the Militello Rosmarino. By this time the division was severely crippled by heavy casualties and unfit for battle. The remains of it stayed in the Messina area 11‚Äì14 August 1943, before being evacuated to the mainland. Dissolution It was being rebuilt in the North of Italy in Asti when the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces was signed and surrendered to the Germans.

Waingawa railway station is a station on the Wairarapa Line in the Wairarapa district of New Zealand's North Island. It is located about south of the Waingawa River and is situated in a heavy industrial area. It served passenger trains until 1992 and now only handles freight (private sidings and special consignments).  History  The first use of the name Waingawa in relation to rail facilities in the Wairarapa was when from 1895 a siding about south of Kurupuni (Solway) became known as Waingawa. It was a private siding that had for a long time been known as Donald's Siding, and was used by the Wellington Meat Export Company to load livestock for transport to their abattoir at Ngahauranga. Between 1908 and 1912 the Wellington Farmers' Meat Company established their own private siding about south of Waingawa called Taratahi. In 1921 this became the location of a new station called Waingawa, complete with signalling apparatus, and the name Taratahi ceased to be used. Though a co-operative freezing works were established at Waingawa in 1897, the brisk traffic in livestock from Waingawa to Wellington continued, at least until the opening of the Waingawa Freezing Works. In 1966 a siding was laid from the Waingawa yard to the then-new Masterton sale yards. The sale yards are still extant today but their siding has long since been removed. Several industrial neighbours have come and gone in the vicinity of Waingawa station. In 1911, the Waingawa Freezing Works were opened by the Wellington Farmers' Meat Company and lasted until 9 November 1989 when, in the hands of AFFCO, the works were closed as part of an industry rationalisation. Japanese forestry products company Juken Nissho (now Juken New Zealand) opened a mill just north of the station in February 1992, which continues to transport goods by rail using its own private siding.  Today  Since the closure of the freezing works, forestry related businesses and trucking companies have largely supplanted the livestock trade at Waingawa, with the JNL mill now the largest rail customer on site. This may change in the future, as several projects are under consideration that may involve the use of rail for the transport of product out of the Wairarapa, including: * Wairarapa log freight rail project * Waingawa Industrial Park * Bulk milk transfer from Waingawa to Hawera via the Manawatu Gorge In February 2009 funding from the National Land Transport Programme for the log freight project was approved by the NZ Transport Agency. Log traffic started in March 2012 and typically moves around 300 tonnes of logs per day. The former Waingawa station building was rescued from demolition by the Wairarapa Railway Restoration Society in 1991 and relocated to the Carterton station precinct where it may be viewed by visitors to the museum there. The only sign at Waingawa that passenger trains used to stop there is the old station platform which can still be seen from Waingawa Road. There is little prospect of a passenger station being re-established here, as Waingawa is officially considered to be part of the \\"Solway/Masterton rail station catchment\\".

The Cotton Belt is a region of the Southern United States where cotton was the predominant cash crop from the late 18th century into the 20th century.Cotton Belt, The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. Before the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton production was limited to coastal plain areas of South Carolina and Georgia, and, on a smaller scale, along the lower Mississippi River. The cotton gin allowed profitable processing of short- staple cotton, which could be grown in the upland regions of the Deep South. After 1793 the Natchez District rapidly became the leading cotton-producing region in Mississippi. Natchez planters developed new cotton plant hybrids and a mechanized system that fueled the spread of the cotton plantation system throughout the Old Southeast. The demand by European Americans for land to develop for upland cotton drove the removal of Native American tribes from the Southeast after 1830. The central part of this area, extending into Texas, became known as the Black Belt for the fertility of the soil and later the high proportion of slave population. By the middle of the 19th century, the Cotton Belt extended from Maryland to East Texas. The most intensive cotton production occurred in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, together with parts of Florida, Louisiana and Texas. High productivity depended on the plantation system and slavery combined with fertile soils and a favorable climate.Cotton Belt, Research Machines plc 2004 After the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, many freedman families worked as sharecroppers rather than hire out as laborers; this generally replaced slavery as the primary source of agricultural labor. Cotton production in the region declined in the 20th century due to soil depletion, invasion by the boll weevil, development of alternative markets, and social changes in the region as urban, industrial areas developed. Cotton is still grown in parts of the region, but agricultural land in the region is now used primarily for commodity crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans, and livestock; and commercial timber production.

He used his spare time to train on the velodrome in Cologne,Cycling Weekly, UK 11 January 1992, p26 in secret because his father disapproved.Ronny de Schepper, 29-01-2007, Albert Richter (1912-1940), De Kampioen DieDe Hitlergroet Weigerde He rode his first races, on the road and on the track, at 16. His father found out when Albert broke his collar bone. His rides, however, attracted the attention of Ernst Berliner, a former cycling champion who ran a furniture business in the city and who had become a reputed cycling coach. Berliner was Jewish and had had his business ransacked several times by Brown Shirts.Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Cyclisme, Nathan, France, p425 In 1932, after winning the Grand Prix de Paris, Richter hoped to be picked for the Olympic Games in Los Angeles. But he was disappointed. The German federation could not afford his fare. Professional career Richter went to Rome and won the world sprint amateur championship on September 3. He was greeted enthusiastically in Cologne. He turned professional and Berliner sent him to Paris, the centre of European track cycling. Agn√®s Granjon said in her short biography: > There were races all through the year on the four v√©lodromes in Paris. > Richter quickly learned French in particular by watching films, and adapted > quickly to his new life. After uncertain beginnings, the young German > triumphed at the V√©lodrome d'hiver by winning a competition for foreign > sprinters.

Adopted in a few months by the Parisian public, Albert Richter became > very popular in France and gathered a new nickname: the German eight- > cylinder.A reference to powerful car engines of the time Richter lived in Paris and spent more time abroad than in Germany. He was open about his opposition to the rise of Hitler and his National Socialism. Sepp Dinkelkamp, a Swiss sprinter, said: > \\"I say with confidence that Albert was an anti-Nazi. If he had followed the > Nazis, it would certainly have been a lot easier for him, and to his > advantage. But Albert chose another way.\\" Richter became part of a travelling circus of sprinters that included Jef Scherens and Louis G√©rardin. Richter refused to wear a German jersey with a swastika when he raced, preferring the older style with the traditional German eagle. He was on the podium of every championship he rode from 1933 to 1939 (e.g., UCI Track Cycling World Championships ‚Äì Men's Sprint), although never with the gold medal. Scherens won the world championship every year from 1932 to 1937. Richter came third in 1933 behind him and Lucien Michard. In the two following years Scherens, Richter and G√©rardin finished in that order. In 1936, Richter and G√©rardin changed places. In 1937 and 1938 he again came in third. Flight from Germany Two riders whom Richter consistently beat ‚Äì Werner Miethe and Peter Steffes ‚Äì were to play a role in his death. Lon Pullen said: > Miethe was already engaged in espionage work on behalf of the Reich, and he > and Steffes were also later involved in marketing valuables taken from > French Jews who had become victims of the Nazi pogrom. In September 1937, > Richter's manager, Berliner, threatened by Steffes with exposure to the > Gestapo for alleged smuggling of marks outside Germany, fled with his family > to Holland... Even Richter could see that his survival would only be > possible if he left the country.Cycling Weekly, UK 11 January 1992, p27 For a while, he stayed. He occasionally gave Nazi salutes but he refused to spy during his foreign journeys. He won the bronze medal in the 1939 world championship ‚Äì the races were not completed because news came partway that Germany had invaded Poland ‚Äì and then decided to avoid being called into the army, particularly because it would mean shooting at the French. Instead, he would escape to Switzerland once he had ridden the Berlin Grand Prix in the Deutschlandhalle on 9 December. Richter had many friends in Switzerland, the family of cyclists called Suter (see Heiri Suter), and a family that owned a hotel in Engelberg. He called Berliner, who urged him not to return to Germany. He also told Berliner that a Jewish business man from Cologne named Schweizer, who had already left Germany, had asked him to smuggle money for him when he went. Against Berliner's advice, he went to Berlin and won the grand prix, his last victory. Death Albert Richter's tomb On 31 December 1939, he boarded the train to Switzerland. It crossed into Switzerland at Weil am Rhein. The station straddled the border and it was there that the German steam engine would be replaced by a Swiss electric locomotive. German exit controls and Swiss entry controls could be carried out at the same place. To catch smugglers on the border meant their guilt was clear. Two Dutch sprinters, Cor Wals and Kees Pellenaars, later the Netherlands' Tour de France manager, had been on the train since Amsterdam. They told the Belgian newspaper Het Volk that German soldiers walked through the snow on the station platform and went straight to Richter's compartment. The door opened and Richter fell unconscious from the train. The Germans pulled his bike from the baggage van ‚Äì not bothering with his suitcase ‚Äì and cut open the tyres. Inside were 12,700 marks. Richter, still unconscious, was pulled along the platform, the Dutchmen said, his legs trailing behind him. Outside the station, witnesses said, Richter was loaded on a truck and taken to L√∂rrach, site of a \\"correction\\" camp.Cycling Weekly, UK 11 January 1992, p28 Richter had been a popular champion. He had been seen being dragged from the train. The Germans insisted he had died skiing. But Richter was still in Germany. The next claim was that he had been beaten to death by rival smugglers. And then that he had hanged himself in his cell in shame. One version is that he was given the choice between suicide and a firing squad, that he shot himself with a revolver and that the Germans then said he had died on the eastern front. When one of his brothers tried to see him on 2 January, he was shown Richter's corpse in the hospital morgue or, according to some reports, slumped in a cell. It was bloody and his suit full of holes. Berliner tried to learn the truth after the war but was unsuccessful. His death has not been formally registered. The German cycling federation said: \\"His name has been effaced from our ranks, from our memories, for ever.\\" How did the Gestapo know? It will never be known how the Gestapo knew not only that Richter planned to smuggle money but when he would do it and where he would hide it. Wals and Pellenaers said the agents were not interested in anything but the bike's tyres. Speculation is that they were told by Steffes or Miethe. Miethe was a professional informer. Their link was through the German federation; their link to Richter was through his manager, Berliner. Berliner had smuggled money and Miethe and Steffes had found out. The French historian, Pierre Chany, says it was Richter who did the smuggling. Miethe or Steffes went to see Berliner and that was why Berliner and his family fled to the Netherlands. Berliner and Richter had stayed in touch. Miethe and Steffes knew that. Richter appeared to have trusted Steffes and may even have told him about the money. Lon Pullen said: > The German television film [see below] included an interview with Peter > Steffes and his wife, then in their 80s. Steffes' manner before the cameras > left no doubt in the minds of viewers that his conscience was not clear on > the matter... The most currently accepted theory is that Victor Brack, > acting upon information from Miethe or Steffes, had given the order for the > apprehension and execution of Germany's greatest track rider. > This theory was confirmed by a German named Huertgen, living in Argentina, > to Karl Altenburger, the German industrialist whose name became known in > post-war Britain through his gears and brakes.

The Omugabe was incorporated into the colonial framework of Ankole. Kahaya had lost his relevance and he knew it.

The British treated him as a little child, and in less than a few decades he was relegated from a divine ruler to an administrative clerk.

The top flag is the Flag of Norway; the bottom is marked \\"Fram\\". Photograph by Olav Bjaaland. The first expedition to reach the geographic South Pole was led by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. He and four others arrived at the pole on 14 December 1911, five weeks ahead of a British party led by Robert Falcon Scott as part of the Terra Nova Expedition. Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base, and later heard that Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey. Amundsen's initial plans had focused on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole by means of an extended drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole; uncertain of the extent to which the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June 1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira. Amundsen made his Antarctic base, which he named \\"Framheim\\", in the Bay of Whales on the Great Ice Barrier. After months of preparation, depot-laying and a false start that ended in near-disaster, he and his party set out for the pole in October 1911. In the course of their journey they discovered the Axel Heiberg Glacier, which provided their route to the polar plateau and ultimately to the South Pole. The party's mastery of the use of skis and their expertise with sled dogs ensured rapid and relatively trouble- free travel. Other achievements of the expedition included the first exploration of King Edward VII Land and an extensive oceanographic cruise. The expedition's success was widely applauded, though the story of Scott's heroic failure overshadowed its achievement in the United Kingdom. Amundsen's decision to keep his true plans secret until the last moment was criticised by some. Recent polar historians have more fully recognised the skill and courage of Amundsen's party; the permanent scientific base at the pole bears his name, together with that of Scott. Background Gj√∏a, the small sloop in which Amundsen and his crew conquered the Northwest Passage, 1903‚Äì06 Amundsen was born in Fredrikstad around 80 km from Christiania (now Oslo), Norway, in 1872, the son of a ship-owner. In 1893, he abandoned his medical studies at Christiania University and signed up as a seaman aboard the sealer Magdalena for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a second mate; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's Hardangervidda plateau. In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as mate, aboard Belgica under Adrien de Gerlache. Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by pack ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, and was held fast for almost a year. The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and scurvy among the crew. Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the experience as an education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing and diet. Belgicas voyage marked the beginning of what became known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, and was rapidly followed by expeditions from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and France. However, on his return to Norway in 1899, Amundsen turned his attention northwards. Confident in his abilities to lead an expedition, he planned a traversal of the Northwest Passage, the then-uncharted sea route from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the labyrinth of north Canadian islands. Having earned his master's ticket, Amundsen acquired a small sloop, Gj√∏a, which he adapted for Arctic travel. He secured the patronage of King Oscar of Sweden and Norway, the support of Nansen, and sufficient financial backing to set out in June 1903 with a crew of six. The voyage lasted until 1906 and was wholly successful; the Northwest Passage, which defeated mariners for centuries, was finally conquered. At the age of 34 Amundsen became a national hero, in the first rank of polar explorers. In November 1906 the American Robert Peary returned from his latest unsuccessful quest for the North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87¬∞ 6‚Ä≤‚Äîa record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July 1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen saw no reason to concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition‚Äîalthough his preferred goal remained the North Pole. Preparation=Nansen and Fram= Fridtjof Nansen, whose Arctic drift of 1893‚Äì96 inspired Amundsen In 1893 Nansen had driven his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the northern Siberian coast and allowed it to drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful.See for a summary account of Nansen's Fram expedition. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well to the east of Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole. Amundsen consulted Nansen, who insisted that Fram was the only vessel fit for such an undertaking. Fram had been designed and built in 1891‚Äì93 by Colin Archer, Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect, in accordance with Nansen's exacting specifications, as a vessel that would withstand prolonged exposure to the harshest of Arctic conditions. The ship's most distinctive feature was its rounded hull which, according to Nansen, enabled the vessel to \\"slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice\\". For extra strength the hull was sheathed in South American greenheart, the hardest timber available, and crossbeams and braces were fitted throughout its length. The ship's wide beam of in relation to its overall length of gave it a markedly stubby appearance. This shape improved its strength in the ice but affected its performance in the open sea, where it moved sluggishly and was inclined to roll most uncomfortably. However, its looks, speed, and sailing qualities were secondary to the provision of a secure and warm shelter for the crew during a voyage that might extend over several years. Fram had emerged virtually unscathed from Nansen's expedition after nearly three years in the polar ice. On its return it had been refitted, before spending four years under the command of Otto Sverdrup, charting and exploring of uninhabited territory in the northern Canadian islands. After Sverdrup's voyage ended in 1902 Fram was laid up in Christiania. Although the ship was technically the property of the state, it was tacitly acknowledged that Nansen had first call on it. After his return from the Arctic in 1896 he had aspired to take Fram on an expedition to Antarctica, but by 1907 such hopes had faded. Late in September of that year, Amundsen was summoned to Nansen's home and told he could have the ship. =Initial steps= Amundsen made his plans public on 10 November 1908, at a meeting of the Norwegian Geographical Society. He would take Fram round Cape Horn to the Pacific Ocean; after provisioning in San Francisco the ship would continue northwards, through the Bering Strait to Point Barrow. From here he would set a course directly into the ice to begin a drift that would extend over four or five years. Science would be as important as geographical exploration; continuous observations would, Amundsen hoped, help to explain a number of unresolved problems. The plan was received enthusiastically, and the next day King Haakon opened a subscription list with a gift of 20,000 kroner. On 6 February 1909 the Norwegian Parliament approved a grant of 75,000 kroner to refit the ship. The general fundraising and business management of the expedition was placed in the hands of Amundsen's brother Leon so that the explorer could concentrate on the more practical aspects of organisation. In March 1909 it was announced that Shackleton had reached a southern latitude of 88¬∞ 23‚Ä≤‚Äî from the South Pole‚Äîbefore turning back; thus, as Amundsen observed, in the south \\"a little corner remained\\". He was unreserved in his praise for Shackleton's achievement, writing that Shackleton was the south's equivalent of Nansen in the north. Following this near miss, Scott immediately confirmed his intention to lead an expedition (what became the Terra Nova Expedition) that would encompass the \\"little corner\\" and claim the prize for the British Empire. =Personnel= Roald Amundsen, the expedition's leader Amundsen chose three naval lieutenants as his expedition's officers: Thorvald Nilsen, a navigator who would be second- in-command; Hjalmar Fredrik Gjertsen, and Kristian Prestrud. Gjertsen, despite lacking a medical background, was made expedition doctor, and was sent on a \\"lightning course\\" in surgery and dentistry. A naval gunner, Oscar Wisting, was accepted on Prestrud's recommendation because he could turn his hand to most tasks. Although he had little previous experience of sledge dogs, Amundsen wrote that Wisting developed \\"a way of his own\\" with them, and became a useful amateur veterinarian. An early choice for the party was Olav Bjaaland, a champion skier who was a skilled carpenter and ski-maker. Bjaaland was from Morgedal in the Telemark province of Norway, a region renowned for the prowess of its skiers and as the home of the pioneer of modern techniques, Sondre Norheim. Amundsen shared Nansen's belief that skis and sledge dogs provided by far the most efficient method of Arctic transport, and was determined to recruit the most skilful dog drivers. Helmer Hanssen, who had proved his worth on the Gj√∏a expedition, agreed to travel with Amundsen again. He was joined later by Sverre Hassel, an expert on dogs, and veteran of Sverdrup's 1898‚Äì1902 Fram voyage, who intended only to travel with Amundsen as far as San Francisco. The carpenter J√∏rgen Stubberud built a portable building to serve as base for the expedition, which could be dismantled and prepared for shipment with the Fram. Stubberud asked Amundsen for permission to join the expedition, which was granted. Mindful of the value of a competent cook, Amundsen secured the services of Adolf Lindstr√∏m, another Sverdrup veteran who had been cook aboard Gj√∏a. From his experiences on board Belgica and Gj√∏a, Amundsen had learned the importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel he felt he had the core of his expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance to show that he was still a capable worker in the field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck. =Change of plan= In September 1909 newspapers carried reports that Cook and Peary had each reached the North Pole, Cook in April 1908 and Peary a year later. Asked to comment, Amundsen avoided an outright endorsement of either explorer, but surmised that \\"probably something will be left to be done\\". While he avoided the controversy over the rival claims, he saw immediately that his own plans would be seriously affected. Without the allure of capturing the pole, he would struggle to maintain public interest or funding. \\"If the expedition was to be saved ... there was nothing left for me but to try and solve the last great problem‚Äîthe South Pole\\". Thus Amundsen decided to go south; the Arctic drift could wait \\"for a year or two\\" until the South Pole had been conquered. Amundsen did not publicise his change of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's public and private funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was no guarantee that the backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte- face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call. The privately revised expedition schedule required Fram to leave Norway in August 1910 and sail to Madeira in the Atlantic, its only port of call. From there the ship would proceed directly to the Ross Sea in Antarctica, heading for the Bay of Whales, an inlet on the Ross Ice Shelf (then known as the \\"Great Ice Barrier\\") where Amundsen intended to make his base camp. The Bay of Whales was the southernmost point in the Ross Sea to which a ship could penetrate, closer to the Pole than Scott's intended base at McMurdo Sound. In 1907‚Äì09 Shackleton had considered the ice in the Bay of Whales to be unstable, but from his studies of Shackleton's records Amundsen decided that the Barrier here was grounded on shoals or skerries, and would support a safe and secure base. After landing the shore party, Fram was to carry out oceanographic work in the Atlantic before picking up the shore party early in the following year. =Transport, equipment and supplies= Olav Bjaaland dressed for winter travel: \\"Not an outfit that cut a dash by its appearance, but it was warm and strong\\" Amundsen did not understand the apparent aversion of British explorers to dogs: \\"Can it be that the dog has not understood its master? Or is it the master who has not understood the dog?\\" he later wrote. Following his decision to go south he ordered 100 North Greenland sledge dogs‚Äîthe best and strongest available. The party's ski boots, specially designed by Amundsen, were the product of two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after the style of the Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents‚Äî\\"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used\\"‚Äîhad built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space. From his experiences on Belgica, Amundsen was aware of the dangers of scurvy. Although the true cause of the disease, vitamin C deficiency, was not understood at the time, it was generally known that the disease could be countered by eating fresh meat. To neutralise the danger, Amundsen planned to supplement sledging rations with regular helpings of seal meat. He also ordered a special kind of pemmican which included vegetables and oatmeal: \\"a more stimulating, nourishing and appetising food it would be impossible to find\\". The expedition was well supplied with wines and spirits, for use as medicine and on festive or social occasions. Mindful of the loss of morale on Belgica, Amundsen provided for leisure time with a library of around 3,000 books, a gramophone, a large quantity of records and a range of musical instruments. =Departure= Fram under sail In the months before departure, funds for the expedition became harder to acquire. Because of limited public interest, newspaper deals were cancelled and parliament refused a request for a further 25,000 kroner. Amundsen mortgaged his house to keep the expedition afloat; heavily in debt, he was now wholly dependent on the expedition's success to avoid personal financial ruin. After a month's trial cruise in the northern Atlantic, Fram sailed to Kristiansand in late July 1910 to take the dogs on board and to make final preparations for departure.Roald Amundsen's Dog Farm While at Kristiansand, Amundsen received an offer of help from Peter \\"Don Pedro\\" Christophersen, a Norwegian expatriate whose brother was Norway's Minister in Buenos Aires. Christophersen would provide fuel and other provisions to Fram at either Montevideo or Buenos Aires, an offer which Amundsen gratefully accepted. Just before Fram sailed on 9 August, Amundsen revealed the expedition's true destination to the two junior officers, Prestrud and Gjertsen. On the four-week voyage to Funchal in Madeira, a mood of uncertainty developed among the crew, who could not make sense of some of the preparations and whose questions were met with evasive answers from their officers. This, says Amundsen's biographer Roland Huntford, was \\"enough to generate suspicion and low spirits\\". Fram reached Funchal on 6 September. Three days later Amundsen informed the crew of the revised plan. He told them he intended to make \\"a detour\\" to the South Pole on the way to the North Pole, which was still his ultimate destination, but would have to wait for a while. After Amundsen outlined his new proposals, each man was asked whether he was willing to go on, and all responded positively. Amundsen wrote a lengthy letter of explanation to Nansen, stressing how the North Pole claims of Cook and Peary had dealt a \\"death blow\\" to his original plans. He felt he had been forced into this action by necessity, asked for forgiveness and expressed the hope that his achievements would ultimately atone for any offence.From text of Amundsen's letter, quoted in . Before leaving Funchal on 9 September Amundsen sent a cable to Scott, to inform him of the change of plan. Scott's ship Terra Nova had left Cardiff amid much publicity on 15 June, and was due to arrive in Australia early in October. It was to Melbourne that Amundsen sent his telegram, containing the bare information that he was proceeding southwards. No indication was given of the Norwegian's plans or his destination in Antarctica; Scott wrote to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) secretary, John Scott Keltie: \\"We shall know in due course I suppose\\". News of Amundsen's revised plans reached Norway early in October and provoked a generally hostile response. Although Nansen gave his blessing and warm approval, Amundsen's actions were with few exceptions condemned by press and public, and funding dried up almost completely. Reactions in Britain were predictably adverse; an initial disbelief expressed by Keltie soon turned to anger and scorn. \\"I have sent full details of Amundsen's underhand conduct to Scott ... If I was Scott I would not let them land\\", wrote Sir Clements Markham, the influential former RGS president. Unaware of the world's reactions, Fram sailed south for four months. The first icebergs were sighted on New Year's Day 1911; the Barrier itself came into view on 11 January, and on 14 January Fram was in the Bay of Whales. First season, 1910‚Äì11=Framheim= The base at Framheim, February 1911 After Fram was anchored to ice in an inlet in the south-eastern corner of the Bay, Amundsen selected a site for the expedition's main hut, from the ship. Six teams of dogs were used to move supplies to the site, as work on erecting the hut began. Bjaaland and Stubberud laid the foundations deep into the ice, levelling the sloping ground. Because the prevailing winds came from the east, the hut was erected on an east-west axis, with the door facing west; in this way the wind caught only the shorter eastern wall. The roof was in place by 21 January, and six days later the hut was complete. By then a large supply of meat‚Äîincluding 200 seals‚Äîhad been brought to the base, for use by the shore party and to be laid in depots before the journey to the pole. The base was dubbed Framheim, \\"the home of Fram\\". Early on the morning of 3 February, Terra Nova arrived unexpectedly in the Bay of Whales. She had sailed from New Zealand on 29 November 1910 and had arrived in McMurdo Sound early in January. After landing Scott and his main party there, Terra Nova had taken a party of six men, led by Victor Campbell, eastward to King Edward VII Land. This group intended to explore this then-unknown territory, but had been prevented by sea ice from approaching the shore. The ship was sailing westward along the Barrier edge in search of a possible landing place when it encountered Fram. Scott had previously speculated that Amundsen might make his base in the Weddell Sea area, on the opposite side of the continent; this proof that the Norwegians would be starting the race for the pole with a 60 nautical mile advantage was an alarming prospect for the British. The two groups behaved civilly towards each other; Campbell and his officers Harry Pennell and George Murray Levick breakfasted aboard Fram, and reciprocated with lunch on the Terra Nova. Amundsen was relieved to learn that Terra Nova had no wireless radio, since that might have imperilled his strategy to be first with the news of a polar victory. He was worried, however, by a remark of Campbell's that implied that Scott's motorised sledges were working well. Nevertheless, he offered the British party a site alongside Framheim as a base for the exploration of King Edward VII Land. Campbell turned the offer down, and sailed for McMurdo Sound to inform Scott of Amundsen's whereabouts. =Depot journeys= One of the men with a dog team and sledge on the Barrier in early 1911 In early February Amundsen began organising the depot-laying journeys across the Barrier, in preparation for the following summer's assault on the pole. Supply depots laid in advance at regular intervals on the projected route would limit the amount of food and fuel that the South Pole party would have to carry. The depot journeys would be the first true tests of equipment, dogs and men. For the first journey, to begin on 10 February, Amundsen chose Prestrud, Helmer Hanssen and Johansen to accompany him; 18 dogs would pull three sledges. Before leaving, Amundsen left instructions with Nilsen regarding Fram. The ship was to sail to Buenos Aires for reprovisioning, before undertaking a programme of oceanographic work in the Southern Ocean and then returning to the Barrier as early as possible in 1912. When the four men began their journey south, their only knowledge of the Barrier was from books previous explorers had published, and they anticipated difficult travelling conditions. They were surprised to find the Barrier surface was much like that of a conventional glacier; they covered on the first day. Amundsen noted how well his dogs were performing in these conditions, and wondered at the English aversion to the use of dogs on the Barrier. The party reached 80¬∞ S on 14 February, and after laying the depot turned for home, reaching Framheim on 16 February. The second depot-laying party left Framheim on 22 February, with eight men, seven sledges and forty- two dogs. Conditions on the Barrier had deteriorated sharply; average temperatures had dropped by 9 ¬∞C (16 ¬∞F), and rough snow had drifted across the previously smooth ice surface. In temperatures sometimes as low as , on 3 March the party reached 81¬∞ S, where they established a second depot. Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Prestrud, Johansen and Wisting then continued with the strongest dogs, hoping to reach 83¬∞ S, but in difficult conditions they halted at 82¬∞ S on 8 March. Amundsen could see that the dogs were exhausted; the party turned for home, and with light sledges travelled swiftly to reach Framheim on 22 March. Amundsen wanted more supplies taken south before the impending polar night made travel impossible, and on 31 March a party of seven men led by Johansen left Framheim for the 80¬∞ S depot with six slaughtered seals‚Äî of meat. The party returned on 11 April‚Äîthree days later than expected‚Äîafter they strayed into a field of crevasses. Overall, the depot- laying journeys established three depots containing of supplies, which included of seal meat and of paraffin oil. Amundsen learned much from the journeys, especially on the second, when the dogs struggled with sledges that were too heavy. He decided to increase the number of dogs for the polar journey, if necessary at the expense of the number of men. The journeys revealed some disunity among the men, particularly between Johansen and Amundsen. During the second depot journey, Johansen openly complained about the unsatisfactory nature of the equipment; Amundsen believed that his authority had been challenged. =Winter= Sverre Hassel in the oil store at Framheim during the winter of 1911 The sun set over Framheim on 21 April, not to reappear for four months. Amundsen was mindful of the boredom and loss of morale that had blighted the Belgica expedition's winter in the ice, and although there was no possibility of sledging he ensured that the shore party kept busy. One urgent task was to improve the sledges, which had not worked well during the depot journeys. In addition to those chosen specifically for the expedition, Amundsen had brought along several sledges from Sverdrup's 1898‚Äì1902 Fram expedition, which he now thought would be better suited to the task ahead. Bjaaland reduced the weight of these older sledges by almost a third by planing down the timber, and also constructed three sledges of his own from some spare hickory wood. The adapted sledges were to be used to cross the Barrier, while Bjaaland's new set would be used in the final stages of the journey, across the polar plateau itself. Johansen prepared the sledging rations (42,000 biscuits, 1,320 tins of pemmican and about of chocolate), while other men worked on improving the boots, cooking equipment, goggles, skis and tents. To combat the dangers of scurvy, twice a day the men ate seal meat that had been collected and frozen in quantities before the onset of winter. The cook, Lindstr√∏m, supplemented the vitamin C intake with bottled cloudberries and blueberries, and provided wholemeal bread made with fresh yeast, rich in B vitamins. While Amundsen was confident in his men and equipment, he was, Hassel recorded, tormented by thoughts of Scott's motor sledges and the fear that these would carry the British party to success. With this in mind Amundsen planned to begin the polar journey as soon as the sun rose in late August, though Johansen warned that it would be too cold on the Barrier so early in the season. Amundsen overruled him, and at sunrise on 24 August seven sledges were made ready. Johansen's concerns seemed justified, as harsh conditions for the next two weeks‚Äîtemperatures as low as ‚Äîprevented the men from leaving. On 8 September 1911, when the temperature rose to , Amundsen decided he could wait no longer, and the party of eight set off; Lindstr√∏m remained alone at Framheim. Second season, 1911‚Äì12 Amundsen's route to the pole, Oct‚ÄìDec 1911. The depots marked at 80, 81 and 82¬∞ were laid in the first season, Feb‚ÄìMarch 1911. Shackleton's 1908‚Äì09 route, as followed by Scott, is to the right. =False start= The party made good initial progress, travelling around each day. The dogs ran so hard that several from the strongest teams were detached from the traces and secured onto the sledges to act as ballast. In their wolf-skin and reindeer-skin clothing the men could cope with the freezing temperatures while they kept moving, but when they stopped they suffered, and barely slept at night. The dogs' paws became frostbitten. On 12 September, with temperatures down to , the party halted after only and built igloos for shelter. Amundsen now recognised that they had started the march too early in the season, and decided they should return to Framheim. He would not risk the lives of men and dogs for reasons of stubbornness. Johansen, in his diary, wrote of the foolishness of starting prematurely on such a long and historic journey, and of the dangers of an obsession with beating the English. On 14 September, on their way back to Framheim, they left most of their equipment at the 80¬∞ S depot, to lighten the sledges. Next day, in freezing temperatures with a strong headwind, several dogs froze to death while others, too weak to continue, were placed upon the sledges. On 16 September, from Framheim, Amundsen ordered his men to push for home as quickly as possible. Not having a sledge of his own, he leapt onto Wisting's, and with Helmer Hanssen and his team raced away, leaving the rest behind. The three arrived back at Framheim after nine hours, followed by Stubberud and Bjaaland two hours later and Hassel shortly after. Johansen and Prestrud were still out on the ice, without food or fuel; Prestrud's dogs had failed, and his heels were badly frostbitten. They reached Framheim after midnight, more than seventeen hours after they had turned for home. Next day, Amundsen asked Johansen why he and Prestrud had been so late. Johansen answered angrily that he felt they had been abandoned, and castigated the leader for leaving his men behind. Amundsen would later inform Nansen that Johansen had been \\"violently insubordinate\\"; as a result, he was excluded from the polar party, which Amundsen now reduced to five. Johansen was placed under the command of Prestrud, much his junior as an explorer, in a party that would explore King Edward VII Land. Stubberud was persuaded to join them, leaving Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Bjaaland, Hassel and Wisting as the revised South Pole party. =South Pole journey=Barrier and mountains Men and dogs at the 85¬∞ South depot, on the way to the pole, 15 November 1911 Despite his excitement to start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15 October, but was held up by the weather for a few more days. On 19 October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had discovered the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it. Despite this near mishap they were covering more than a day, and reached their 82¬∞ S depot on 5 November. They marked their route by a line of cairns, built of snow blocks, at three-mile intervals. On 17 November they reached the edge of the Barrier and faced the Transantarctic Mountains. Unlike Scott, who would be following the Beardmore Glacier route pioneered by Shackleton, Amundsen had to find his own route through the mountains. After probing the foothills for several days and climbing to around , the party found what appeared to be a clear route, a steep glacier long leading upwards to the plateau. Amundsen named this the Axel Heiberg Glacier, after one of his chief financial backers. It was a harder ascent than the team had anticipated, made much longer by the need to take detours, and by the deep, soft snow. After three days of difficult climbing the party reached the glacier summit. Amundsen was full of praise for his dogs, and scorned the idea that they could not work in such conditions; on 21 November the party travelled 17 miles and climbed . March to the pole Upon reaching at the summit of the glacier, at 85¬∞ 36‚Ä≤ S, Amundsen prepared for the final stage of the journey. Of the 45 dogs who had made the ascent (7 had perished during the Barrier stage), only 18 would go forward; the remainder were to be killed for food. Each of the sledge-drivers killed dogs from his own team, skinned them, and divided the meat between dogs and men. \\"We called the place the Butchers' Shop\\", Amundsen recalled. \\"[T]here was depression and sadness in the air; we had grown so fond of our dogs\\". Regrets did not prevent the team from enjoying the plentiful food; Wisting proved particularly skilful in his preparation and presentation of the meat. The party loaded up three sledges with supplies for a march of up to 60 days, leaving the remaining provisions and dog carcasses in a depot. Bad weather prevented their departure until 25 November, when they set off cautiously over the unknown ground in persistent fog. They were travelling over an icy surface broken by frequent crevasses, which together with the poor visibility slowed their progress. Amundsen called this area the \\"Devil's Glacier\\". On 4 December they came to an area where the crevasses were concealed under layers of snow and ice with a space between, which gave what Amundsen called an \\"unpleasantly hollow\\" sound as the party passed over it. He christened this area \\"The Devil's Ballroom.\\" When later that day they emerged on to more solid ground, they had reached 87¬∞ S. On 8 December the Norwegians passed Shackleton's Farthest South record of 88¬∞ 23‚Ä≤. As they neared the pole, they looked for any break in the landscape that might indicate another expedition had got there ahead of them. While camped on 12 December they were momentarily alarmed by a black object that appeared on the horizon, but this proved to be their own dogs' droppings off in the distance, magnified by mirage. Next day they camped at 89¬∞ 45‚Ä≤ S, from the pole. On the following day, 14 December 1911, with the concurrence of his comrades Amundsen travelled in front of the sledges, and at around 3 pm the party reached the vicinity of the South Pole. They planted the Norwegian flag and named the polar plateau \\"King Haakon VII's Plateau\\". Amundsen later reflected on the irony of his achievement: \\"Never has a man achieved a goal so diametrically opposed to his wishes. The area around the North Pole‚Äîdevil take it‚Äîhad fascinated me since childhood, and now here I was at the South Pole. Could anything be more crazy?\\" For the next three days the men worked to fix the exact position of the pole; after the conflicting and disputed claims of Cook and Peary in the north, Amundsen wanted to leave unmistakable markers for Scott. After taking several sextant readings at different times of day, Bjaaland, Wisting and Hassel skied out in different directions to \\"box\\" the pole; Amundsen reasoned that between them they would bracket the exact point. Finally the party pitched a tent, which they called Polheim, as near as possible to the actual pole as they could calculate by their observations. In the tent Amundsen left equipment for Scott, and a letter addressed to King Haakon which he requested Scott to deliver. Return to Framheim On 18 December, the party began the journey back to Framheim. Amundsen was determined to return to civilisation before Scott, and be first with the news. Nevertheless, he limited their daily distances to , to preserve the strength of dogs and men. In the 24-hour daylight the party travelled during the notional night, to keep the sun at their backs and thus reduce the danger of snow-blindness. Guided by the snow cairns built on their outward journey, they reached the Butchers' Shop on 4 January 1912, and began the descent to the Barrier. The men on skis \\"went whizzing down\\", but for the sledge drivers‚ÄîHelmer Hanssen and Wisting‚Äîthe descent was precarious; the sledges were hard to manoeuvre, and brakes were added to the runners to enable rapid stops when crevasses were encountered. On 7 January, the party reached the first of their depots on the Barrier. Amundsen now felt their pace could be increased, and the men adopted a routine of travelling , stopping for six hours, then resuming the march. Under this regime they covered around a day, and on 25 January, at 4 am, they reached Framheim. Of the 52 dogs that had started in October, 11 had survived, pulling 2 sledges. The journey to the pole and back had taken 99 days‚Äî10 fewer than scheduled‚Äîand they had covered about . Informing the world On his return to Framheim, Amundsen lost no time in winding up the expedition. After a farewell dinner in the hut, the party loaded the surviving dogs and the more valuable equipment aboard Fram, which departed the Bay of Whales late on 30 January 1912. The destination was Hobart in Tasmania. During the five-week voyage Amundsen prepared his telegrams and drafted the first report that he would give to the press. On 7 March, Fram reached Hobart, where Amundsen quickly learned there was as yet no news from Scott. He immediately sent telegrams to his brother Leon, to Nansen and to King Haakon, briefly informing them of his success. The next day he cabled the first full account of the story to London's Daily Chronicle, to which he had sold exclusive rights. Fram remained in Hobart for two weeks; while there she was joined by Douglas Mawson's ship Aurora, which was in service with the Australasian Antarctic Expedition. Amundsen presented them with a gift of his 11 surviving dogs. =Other expedition achievements= The Japanese Antarctic Expedition's ship Kainan Maru in the Bay of Whales, January 1912 Eastern party On 8 November 1911, Prestrud, Stubberud and Johansen had departed for King Edward VII Land. The search for the point at which the solid ice of the Barrier became ice-covered land proved difficult. On 1 December the party had their first sighting of what was indubitably dry land, a nunatak which had been recorded by Scott during the Discovery expedition in 1902. After reaching this point they collected geological specimens and samples of mosses, and briefly explored their surroundings before returning to Framheim on 16 December. They were the first men to set foot on King Edward VII Land. Fram and Kainan Maru After leaving the Bay of Whales on 15 February 1911, Fram sailed for Buenos Aires where she arrived on 17 April. Here, Nilsen learned that the expedition's funds were exhausted; a sum supposedly set aside for the ship's needs had not materialised. Fortunately, Amundsen's friend Don Pedro Christopherson was at hand to fulfil his earlier promises to provide supplies and fuel. Fram departed in June for an oceanographic cruise between South America and Africa, which occupied the next three months. The ship returned to Buenos Aires in September for final refitting and re-provisioning, before sailing south on 5 October. Strong winds and stormy seas prolonged the voyage, but the ship arrived at the Bay of Whales on 9 January 1912. On 17 January the men in Framheim were surprised by the appearance of a second ship; it was the Kainan Maru, carrying the Japanese Antarctic Expedition led by Nobu Shirase. Communication between the two expeditions was limited by language difficulties, though the Norwegians gathered that the Japanese were heading for King Edward VII Land. Kainan Maru departed the next day, and on 26 January she landed a party on King Edward VII Land. This was the first landing on this shore from the sea; attempts by Discovery (1902), Nimrod (1908) and Terra Nova (1911) had all failed. Aftermath=Contemporary reactions= Clements Markham, the distinguished British geographer, was a harsh critic of Amundsen's change of plan and expressed private doubts about his success. In Hobart, Amundsen received congratulatory telegrams from, among others, former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and King George V of the United Kingdom. The king expressed particular pleasure that Amundsen's first port of call on his return had been on soil of the British Empire. In Norway, which only six years earlier had become an independent country after 500 years of Danish and Swedish supremacy, the news was proclaimed in banner headlines, and the national flag was flown throughout the country. All the expedition's participants received the Norwegian South Pole medal (Sydpolsmedaljen), established by King Haakon to commemorate the expedition. However, Amundsen's biographer Roland Huntford refers to \\"the chill underneath the cheers\\"; there remained a residue of unease over Amundsen's tactics. One Norwegian newspaper expressed relief that Amundsen had found a new route, and had not intruded on Scott's path from McMurdo Sound. In Britain, press reaction to Amundsen's victory was restrained but generally positive. Apart from the enthusiastic reports in the Daily Chronicle and the Illustrated London News‚Äîwhich each had a financial stake in Amundsen's success‚Äîthe Manchester Guardian remarked that any cause for reproach was wiped out by the Norwegians' courage and determination. Readers of Young England were exhorted not to grudge \\"the brave Norseman\\" the honour he had earned, and The Boy's Own Paper suggested that every British boy should read Amundsen's expedition account. The Times correspondent offered a mild rebuke to Amundsen for his failure to inform Scott until it was too late for the latter to respond, \\"all the more unnecessary, for no one would have welcomed co-operation in the work of South Polar exploration more than Captain Scott ... Still, no one who knows Captain Amundsen can have any doubt of his integrity, and since he states he has reached the Pole we are bound to believe him\\". Senior figures at the RGS expressed more hostile sentiments, at least privately. To them, Amundsen's feat was the result of \\"a dirty trick\\". Markham hinted that Amundsen's claim might be fraudulent: \\"We must wait for the truth until the return of the Terra Nova\\". When later in 1912 Amundsen addressed the RGS he felt slighted after Lord Curzon, the Society's president, jocularly called for \\"three cheers for the dogs\\". Shackleton did not join in denigrating Amundsen's victory, and called him \\"perhaps the greatest polar explorer of today\\". Before she heard the news of her husband's death, Kathleen Scott conceded that Amundsen's journey \\"was a very fine feat ... in spite of one's irritation one has to admire it\\". =Scott tragedy= Map showing the polar journeys of the Scott's Terra Nova expedition (green) and Amundsen's expedition (red) to reach the South Pole Amundsen left Hobart to undertake a lecture tour of Australia and New Zealand. He then went to Buenos Aires where he finished writing his expedition account. Back in Norway he supervised the publication of the book, then visited Britain before embarking on a long lecture tour of the United States. In February 1913, while in Madison, Wisconsin, he received the news that Scott and four comrades had reached the pole on 17 January 1912, but had all perished by 29 March, during their return journey. The bodies of Scott, Wilson and Bowers had been discovered in November 1912, after the end of the Antarctic winter. In his initial response, Amundsen called the news \\"Horrible, horrible\\". His more formal tribute followed: \\"Captain Scott left a record, for honesty, for sincerity, for bravery, for everything that makes a man\\". According to Huntford, the news of Scott's death meant that \\"Amundsen the victor was eclipsed ... by Scott the martyr\\". In the United Kingdom a myth quickly developed in which Scott was portrayed as one who had behaved nobly and played the game fairly. He had been defeated because, by contrast, Amundsen was a mere glory-seeker who had concealed his true intentions, had used dogs rather than relying on honest man-hauling and had slaughtered these same dogs for food. Furthermore, he was considered a \\"professional\\" which, in the mindset of upper-class Britain of that time, diminished anything he might have accomplished. This narrative was heavily reinforced with the publication of Scott's journals and his \\"Message to the Public\\". Huntford points out that \\"[Scott's] literary talent was his trump. It was as if he had reached out from his buried tent and taken revenge.\\" Even so, among explorers Amundsen's name continued to be respected. In his account of the Terra Nova expedition written a few years later, Scott's comrade Apsley Cherry-Garrard wrote that the primary reason for Amundsen's success was \\"the very remarkable qualities of the man\\", specifically his courage in choosing to discover a new route rather than follow the known path. =Historical perspective= Remains of Amundsen's last ship, Maud, in Cambridge Bay The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 delayed the start of Amundsen's northern polar drift‚Äîto which the South Pole expedition had been intended as a preliminary‚Äîuntil July 1918\\\\. He then set off in a specially-constructed vessel, Maud, which remained in Arctic waters for the next seven years. The ship did not drift over the North Pole, although in the course of the expedition it became the second ship to traverse the North-East Passage. Amundsen left the expedition in 1923; the remaining years of his life were largely devoted to polar exploration by air. On 12 May 1926, aboard the airship Norge with Lincoln Ellsworth and Umberto Nobile, Amundsen flew over the North Pole. He and Wisting, also on the airship, were the first men to see both poles. In 1928, while attempting to rescue a later Nobile expedition, Amundsen disappeared with his aircraft in the seas between Norway and Spitsbergen. The four men who had stood at the pole with Amundsen were all asked to accompany their leader on the Maud drift. Bjaaland and Hassel declined; neither participated in any further polar ventures. Helmer Hanssen and Wisting both joined Maud; the latter took over the leadership when Amundsen left the expedition. In 1936 Wisting captained Fram on the ship's final voyage to Oslo, where it became a museum. Johansen, who had been unable to settle back into normal life on his return from Antarctica, became withdrawn and uncommunicative. He refused to discuss his experiences or his dispute with Amundsen, and retreated into a life of depression and poverty. On 4 January 1913 he shot himself in his Oslo lodgings. The Scott myth lasted until the final quarter of the 20th century, when it was replaced by one that characterised him as a \\"heroic bungler\\" whose failure was largely the result of his own mistakes. This portrayal, the cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski asserts, is as fallacious as the earlier one in which he was considered beyond criticism. In the early 21st century, writers have suggested more reasoned explanations for the Scott tragedy than his incompetence, and his reputation has to some extent been rescued. The renewed spotlight on Scott has also highlighted Amundsen's achievements: Barczewski writes that \\"Amundsen and his men reached the pole due to a combination of superb planning, long experience with sledge-dogs and skis and impressive physical stamina\\". In her account of Scott's expedition, Diana Preston is equally specific in identifying the basis of Amundsen's success. He was focused on the single goal of reaching the pole, whereas Scott had to reconcile the competing claims of geographical exploration and scientific knowledge. \\"A practical and experienced professional, [Amundsen] planned carefully and applied all the lessons he had learned in the Arctic ... [H]e relied exclusively on the well- tried means of transport and unsentimentally exploited their food potential. He was similarly efficient and unsentimental in his management of his men\\". The United States' scientific base at the South Pole, founded in 1957, is named the Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station, to honour the memories of both polar pioneers. =Modern research= In a paper published 100 years after the Amundsen expedition, researchers claimed that the tent and flags are buried under of ice and about a minute of latitude north of the South Pole, or about one nautical mile.

At the time of her sinking, the Igara was the largest ever single marine insurance loss in maritime history. Valued at over US$25 million, she was loaded with 127,718 tonnes of Brazilian Iron Ore. The Igara was an Italian ore/oil steamship of . It was on voyage from Vitoria to Muroran when after passing through the Sunda Strait, she struck an uncharted rock in the South China Sea about from Horsburgh Lighthouse, off Mendarik Island, on 11 March 1973. However, she did not sink immediately but continued her voyage until her bow settled submerged and resting on the sea bottom in approx 40 metres of water about from Singapore. She settled with her entire stern section sticking out of the water. The following day 27 of the 38-man crew abandoned ship, being picked up in their lifeboats by passing vessels. The master and 10 crew stayed on board until 19 March, when she began to break across hold no. 1. Salvors used explosives to cut through the ship at hold no. 1, and the entire rear section of the ship was towed to Japan, where a new forward section was attached and she was renamed the Eraclide.  Subsequent salvage  ICRL (International Cargo Recoveries Limited), a BVI-based salvage management company, recognized the value of remaining iron ore cargo, contacted the insurers and acquired the legal rights to the ore and the salvage rights to the hull. In 2005‚Äì06 ICRL contracted Deep Water Recoveries (S) Pte Ltd (‚ÄúDWR‚Äù) to recover the ore. DWR recovered all the ore accessible to big grabs (60,000 mt), and the operation grossed US$2.5 million.  Recreational dive site Diver on the wreck of the Igara. The ship now lies in around 40 m of water rising to 16 m at the top of the wreck. Despite only half the wreck remaining, this is a huge wreck with vast open cargo holds. The site is prone to very strong currents and occasional bad visibility. It is commonly frequented by Singapore-based liveaboards which stop for a dive or two on the way back to Singapore after a weekend diving in the South China Sea. The wreck was nicknamed the 'turtle wreck' by divers due to a resident turtle although more recent reports suggest the turtle is no longer present. Three resident nurse sharks are sometimes spotted in the storage rooms in the stern. As of 2010, divers reported seeing a large nurse shark inside the rope room at the bow on nearly every dive. The wreck is overgrown with soft corals, sponges and hydroids. Divers frequently see schools of barracudas, snappers, fusiliers, angelfish, groupers, and batfish. Divers have also reported seeing a large and aggressive grouper.

He traveled the world as a professional magician under the name Dante the Magician. Biography He was born on October 3, 1883 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Jansen came to St. Paul, Minnesota at the age of six with his family. The family's surname was Jensen At the age of 16 Jansen made his stage debut under Charles Wagner. He then set off on a world tour for 5 years as The Great Jansen. In 1922, magician Howard Thurston, realizing Jansen's talent and possible competition to him, engaged Jansen to star in the #2 Thurston show. Thurston gave Jansen the stage name of Dante. The name came from the original Dante, Oscar Eliason (1869‚Äì1899), who had been killed in a tragic hunting accident in Australia years earlier. In 1925, Dante the Magician Inc. came into being with Thurston as co-owner. The 2nd unit Thurston show was built and co-produced by Jansen. Dante was known throughout the world under the name Dante the Magician, working in vaudeville, burlesque, legitimate theatre, films, and in later years, television. Dante and his troupe, consisting of between 25 and 40 performers, made several global trips and appeared in many U.S. theaters. His stage trademark was to utter three nonsense words, \\"Sim Sala Bim\\" (taken from the lyrics of a Danish children's song), during his performances to acknowledge applause. He can be seen using these words in the Swedish 1931 feature Dantes mysterier (Dante's Mysteries) and in the 1942 Laurel and Hardy comedy A-Haunting We Will Go. He also appeared as himself in the 1950 film Bunco Squad, and played a character role in Jean Renoir's The Golden Coach (1952). In 1940 he produced and starred the Broadway revue Sim Sala Bim on the Morosco Theatre. With television, the public stayed home more often, and the world of variety theatre suffered drastically. As a result, Dante retired to Southern California in the late 1940s. He died at his ranch in Northridge, California, of a heart attack, at the age of 71. He was alone at the time of his death. Legacy With Dante's death, what historically has been known as the \\"Golden Age of Magic\\" came to an end. Gone were the variety theaters of the world, and with it were the large traveling magic productions that had thrilled and mystified millions for generations. In prior decades, the magical lineage created by the American public had elevated magicians Alexander Herrmann, Harry Kellar, Thurston and Dante to the position of the #1 magician in the country. Shortly before Dante's death, he approached a young magician, Lee Grabel, to be his successor in the lineage of great magicians. Plans were underway at the time of Dante's death. However, because Dante died before making a public announcement, some magical historians believe the lineage ended with Dante. This magician has since chosen a Las Vegas headliner magician, Lance Burton to be his successor, therefore carrying on the tradition of the magical lineage to another generation. Despite this, its authenticity is still questioned by some. In 1991, magic historian Phil Temple published the definitive biography of Dante the Magician, Dante - The Devil Himself, based largely on Dante's personal records, and Temple's friendship with surviving family members who had toured with the show decades earlier. Years later, a memoir about life on the road with the Dante show was written by Marion Trikosko, who spent two years with Dante as an assistant. His book, Trouping with Dante, was published in 2006.

With the development and modernization of the economy within the globalization process, corporate crime, financial crime, and corruption are heavily punished and increasingly important issues.People & Power, Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera (March 2008) = Theft = Pickpockets and purse snatchers are present in crowded popular tourist sites, restaurants, or on public transportation in the largest cities, in particular within Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas. While thieves may operate anywhere, the largest number of reports of theft received by the authorities usually are from the heavily populated areas and major tourist destinations.US Department of State, TRAVEL.STATE.GOV - Portugal , US Department of State  By location  Portugal's largest metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto are the main sources of both petty crime and violent crime. *Greater Lisbon: Theft is widespread in tourist destinations in the Greater Lisbon area such as the towns of Sintra, Cascais, and Mafra. Casal Ventoso, a neighborhood of Lisbon where drug traffickers and drug users used to gather, was demolished in response to its increasingly unsavory reputation. Amadora the municipality where Buraca and the feared Cova da Moura neighborhood is located, a stopping point of many of the displaced people of the former Casal Ventoso, and Marvila, a parish in eastern Lisbon municipality, as well as some areas of the municipalities of Odivelas, Loures and Vila Franca de Xira around the Portuguese capital, have a higher incidence of crime. Automobile break-ins sometimes occur in parking areas at tourist attractions and near restaurants. There are reports of organized crime and gangs. *Greater Porto: There have been reports of theft and violent crime in the area. Some places such as train stations, the Ribeira neighborhood in Porto, as well as some areas of Gondomar and Valongo municipalities have been especially problematic. There are reports of organized crime and gangs. *Algarve: There are few reports of organized crime or gangs, however, as a major centre of international tourism and located in a corner of Europe close to the North of Africa, the region has been noted by the growing number of cases related with drug trafficking. Pickpockets and other petty criminals exist in moderate numbers (e.g. in Faro). A wave of violent crime targeting wealthy foreign expatriates and tourists residing in the region, was noted since the late 2000s economic crisis, the decreasing economic opportunities for African, East European and South American immigrants and a rise in the number of unemployed Portuguese. *Azores (archipelago): Pickpocketing and purse snatching are not common occurrences in the Azores. There are no reports of organized crime or gangs. *Madeira (archipelago): Pickpocketing, while infrequent, may occur in some areas of Funchal, such as at Pico do Arieiro, Mercado dos Lavradores, Zona Velha (near cable car), Pico do Arieiro, Old Town, Santa Catarina Park. Other cities where some violent crime can happen are Aveiro, Braga and Coimbra. Regions such as Set√∫bal, Alentejo and Ribatejo are the safest zones next to Lisbon with a really low crime compared to the Capital.  Crime dynamics  The crime rate rose in the 1990s, bringing it to an all-time high during much of this period. It still is low compared to other developed countries and has decreased in the 2000s. Violent crime rose during the same period and reached record highs. \\"Portugal surge em terceiro lugar no ranking dos pa√≠ses da Uni√£o Europeia (UE) onde mais aumentou o n√∫mero de crimes violentos e de roubos na d√©cada de 1995 a 2005.\\", Lic√≠nio Lima, Crescem o roubo e crime violento , Di√°rio de Not√≠cias (27 November 2007)Distribui√ß√£o da evolu√ß√£o global - Todos os Departamentos , Pol√≠cia de Seguran√ßa P√∫blica\\"The greatest rises were in France, Greece and Portugal (16%),...\\", International Review of Crime Statistics, International Review of Crime Statistics Portugal's security and peace indicators compare very favourably to other countries.

The national telephone emergency number is 112, which is used in the entire European Union. The law enforcement system assists the victim to find appropriate medical care, contact family members or friends and explain how further legal procedures could be used. Although the investigation and prosecution of the crime is the responsibility of local authorities which include main police forces such as the Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria (criminal investigation police), the Pol√≠cia de Seguran√ßa P√∫blica (regular urban police), and the Guarda Nacional Republicana (gendarmerie), officers can help the victim to understand the criminal justice process and to find an attorney if needed. Portugal has a crime victim's assistance program, administered through an organization known by its acronym, \\"APAV\\" (Associa√ß√£o Portuguesa de Apoio √† V√≠tima).  Tolerance of drugs  Portugal has arguably the most liberal laws concerning possession of illicit drugs in the Western world. In 2001 Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including, but not limited to, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and LSD. Although, while drug consumption isn't a crime, it is considered an illness and the people who have drugs are, in most cases, forced to have a therapy. While possession is not a crime, trafficking and possession of more than \\"10 days worth of personal use\\" are still punishable by jail time and fines.

History In the area surrounding the centre of Istia there have been found some ruins of ancient habitations dating back to the Etruscan era in the area of Poggio Cavallo. It was inhabited also during the Roman era, as testified by some construction materials reused in later periods to build the walls of Istia. In that period there was also a series of roads which crossed the area allowing communication with the Prile Lake and with the hinterland. However the centre of Istia arose as a settlement fortified along the Valley of Ombrone and from 862 was owned by the bishops of Roselle, which had feudal rights with the title of counts and so here they established a residence. Later it passed to the family of the Aldobrandeschi, becoming in 1226 a free Comune with the acceptance of the relative statute. In 1274 it was assigned to the County of Santa Fiora at the moment of the division of the goods and the territories controlled by the Aldobrandeschi family. In the Medieval period the centre became also home to a residence of bishops, after the passage of the diocese from Roselle to Grosseto. In the course of the 14th century it passed under the control of Siena, enduring a very serious demographic decline between 1331 and 1353, also because of the diffusion of the Yersinia pestis which occurred right at the end of that period. In the 15th century Istia had become a feud of the Piccolomini family, even though it continued to maintain the status of free Comune and having a high degree of autonomy within the Republic of Siena. After the final political fall of Siena, Istia become part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Consequently, there was another demographic fall which stopped only during the course of the 18th century, after the beginning of some restorations done by will of the Lorena. During the Second World War, the 22 March 1944 the massacre of Maiano Lavacchio perpetrated into the nearby countryside; the abridgement process was held at the school of Istia purposely emptied. Main sights The town walls, nearly completely destroyed in 1137 by Henry X, Duke of Bavaria, were rebuilt only under the Sieneses. Some ruins of the Portaccia and the Porta Grossetana, which backs to the Palzzo della Giustizia dating to the 1400, are conserved. The residence of the bishop-counts, the Palazzo di San Salvatore, was afterwards transformed into a fortification by the Sieneses. In the town there are also two churches, one within the walls and the other on the outside of the walls in front of the Porta Grossetana. =Military architecture= *Walls of Istia d'Ombrone, fortified walls of the town. *Porta Grossetana, one of the two original doors along the ancient walls, made in medieval times, almost certainly around the 12th century . *Cassero Senese, also known as Episcopal Palace, was built in the first half of the 13th century, as a place of temporary residence for bishops of the Diocese of Grosseto.

It was formerly a municipality in its own right, but was incorporated into Z√ºrich in 1934. History Bond of the Politischen Gemeinde Altstetten, issued 20. March 1910 Aerial view (1965) Altstetten is first mentioned in 1249, at which time a distinction was made between in Altstettin superiori and in villa Altstetin Inferiori. Excavations have found remains probably from the late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC), together with those of a Roman villa. In 1847, the Swiss Northern Railway opened Switzerland's first domestic railway line between Z√ºrich and Baden. The line passed through Altstetten, and a station was provided. Over time, the line became the principal rail route between Z√ºrich and northern and western Switzerland. In 1864, a second line, to Zug via Affoltern am Albis, made a junction with the first just west of Altstetten railway station. In 1907, the Swiss Federal Railway, who had taken over both lines, opened a workshop in Altstetten. In 1900, the Limmattal-Strassenbahn opened an interurban electric tramway through Altstetten, connecting with Z√ºrich's city trams at Letzigraben, which then formed the boundary between Z√ºrich and Altstetten. Beyond Altstetten, the tramway continued to Schlieren, Dietikon and Weiningen. In 1931, the line was taken over by the St√§dtische Strassenbahn Z√ºrich, operators of Z√ºrich's city trams, by which time the line had been cut back to Schlieren. In the late 1950s the line was further cut back to Farbhof in the western of Altstetten, and it now forms part of city tram route 2. The former municipality of Altstetten was incorporated into the city of Z√ºrich in 1934. The neighbouring municipality of Albisrieden was incorporated at the same time, and together they form district 9 of the city. In 1967 Ernst Sieber became the parish priest of Z√ºrich-Altstetten where he worked until his retirement as pastor in 1992.  Transportation  Alstetten station at sundown Altstetten railway station is a nodal point where the Z√ºrich S-Bahn, Z√ºrich trams, Z√ºrich trolleybuses and Z√ºrich buses all connect. The station is served by S-Bahn lines S5, S11, S12, S14, S19 and S42, providing frequent services to Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof with a ride time only a few minutes. Tram route 4 serves a terminus on the northern side of the station, whilst trolleybus route 31 passes the south side of the station. Bus routes 78, 80, 89 and 95 also serve the south side of the station, whilst routes 304, 307 and 308 terminate at the north side. Some south of the station, tram route 2 operates through the main Badenerstrasse street, connecting with bus routes 35, 78 and 80 at Lindenplatz stop. About to the west of Lindenplatz, tram route 2 terminates at Farbhof, where it connects with trolleybus 31 and buses 35, 78 and 303. Future plans involve the construction of the Limmattalbahn, a new metre gauge light rail line that will link Altstetten station with communities further west in the valley of the Limmat, along a route similar to that of the long abandoned Limmattal-Strassenbahn. It is planned that the line will be partially opened by 2020 and will connect to the city tram system at Altstetten station, with the possibility of extending city tram service over the Limmattalbahn as far as Schlieren.

The terminal Ga‚ÄîH bond length is 152 pm, the Ga‚ÄîH bridging is 171 pm and the Ga‚ÄîH‚ÄîGa angle is 98¬∞. The Ga‚ÄîGa distance is 258 pm. The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution of digallane in toluene shows two peaks attributable to terminal and bridging hydrogen atoms. In the solid state, digallane appears to adopt a polymeric or oligomeric structure. The vibrational spectrum is consistent with tetramer (i.e. (GaH3)4). The vibrational data indicate the presence of terminal hydride ligands. In contrast, the hydrogen atoms are all bridging in Œ±-alane, a high- melting, relatively stable polymeric form of aluminium hydride wherein the aluminium centers are 6-coordinated.

Chawton House, just outside the village of that name, used to be the home of the writer's brother, Edward Austen Knight. It remained a private family home into the late twentieth century. At the turn of the millennium it was purchased by a charitable trust, extensively restored, and re-opened as a research centre. The Centre, which runs study programmes in association with the nearby University of Southampton, incorporates a significant library, a collection of over 9000 books and related manuscripts. The house is now open to visitors, as well as library readers, for tours and during public events.http://www.chawtonhouse.org  The house  It is set in of Hampshire countryside, and is used for conferences, filming and more recently as a venue for weddings. The present Chawton House was built in 1580, principally by John Knight. Based on a manor house owned by the Knight family since 1551, it was subsequently extended and altered about 1655 and again in the 18th and 19th centuries. The house is built of flint with stone dressings and a tiled roof. The 17th-century south front has two storeys with an attic and three gables. John Knight served as MP for Lymington from 1593 to 1597 and High Sheriff of Hampshire for 1609‚Äì10. The house passed down in the family until the male line failed with the death of Sir Richard Knight, after which it was devised to a relative by marriage, Richard Martin, who thereupon changed his name to Knight. It then passed to Thomas Brodnax, a relative, who did the same. His son, Thomas Knight, died childless and bequeathed the house to his distant relative Edward Austen, the elder brother of Jane Austen, who also added Knight to his name. It then descended in that last Knight family until inherited in poor condition by Richard Knight in 1987, who sold it in 1992.

These texts explore broad-ranging themes as satire, slavery, marriage, witchcraft and piracy. In bringing these little- known novels to a wider audience, it is hoped to stimulate interest in these works amongst a new generation of readers. The texts are completely unedited, and have been copied from the originals as accurately as possible. Even printer errors have been retained. This is an ongoing project with more novels and texts being made available online.  The gardens  The gardens are open to the public, with access to a tearoom. The restoration programme for the gardens was extensive, and focused in particular on the restoration of the walled garden. Edward Knight had the idea to build a new walled garden during Jane Austen's lifetime. In 1813, she wrote to her brother Frank, \\"He [Knight] talks of making a new Garden; the present is a bad one & ill situated, near Mr Papillon's; ‚Äî he means to have the new, at the top of the Lawn behind his own house.\\" Knight's original walls are mostly still intact, but the glasshouses and potting sheds, had to be rebuilt. The gardens have been restored using Edward Austen Knight's original planting scheme. The central space is used for the production of vegetables, soft fruits, herbs and flowers. Chawton House is registered with the Soil Association, and is now certified as an organic producer. Everything grown in the walled garden is for use by the Library, with any surplus being sold locally in aid of the charity. The park and gardens of Chawton House are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.  The Jane Austen connection  Chawton house is situated about 400m away from the cottage where Austen lived for the last eight years of her life. This now houses the Jane Austen's House Museum, which is a large 17th- century house in the centre of the village of Chawton, owned by the Jane Austen Memorial Trust since 1947 Jane Austen's House Museum and preserved in her memory. The two houses, Chawton House and Jane Austen's House, are entirely separately run charities. Austen is known to have been a frequent visitor to what she knew as the 'Great House', and she references it a number of times in her letters. Edward Austen also loaned it to his brother, Francis Austen. Edward Austen himself resided at Godmersham Park, but his son, Edward Knight II, moved to Chawton House following his marriage, and sold Godmersham Park following his father's death.

Thus, functional imaging obtained by PET, which depicts the spatial distribution of metabolic or biochemical activity in the body can be more precisely aligned or correlated with anatomic imaging obtained by CT scanning. Two- and three-dimensional image reconstruction may be rendered as a function of a common software and control system. PET-CT has revolutionized medical diagnosis in many fields, by adding precision of anatomic localization to functional imaging, which was previously lacking from pure PET imaging. For example, many diagnostic imaging procedures in oncology, surgical planning, radiation therapy and cancer staging have been changing rapidly under the influence of PET-CT availability, and centers have been gradually abandoning conventional PET devices and substituting them by PET-CTs. Although the combined/hybrid device is considerably more expensive, it has the advantage of providing both functions as stand-alone examinations, being, in fact, two devices in one. The only other obstacle to the wider use of PET-CT is the difficulty and cost of producing and transporting the radiopharmaceuticals used for PET imaging, which are usually extremely short-lived (for instance, the half life of radioactive Fluorine-18 (18F) used to trace glucose metabolism (using fluorodeoxyglucose, FDG) is only two hours. Its production requires a very expensive cyclotron as well as a production line for the radiopharmaceuticals. PET-MRI, like PET-CT, combines modalities to produce co- registered images. History pelvis with metastases of a previous, surgically removed colon carcinoma in a 69-yrs old woman. Siemens Biograph PET-CT scanner PET-CT systems were initially proposed by David Townsend (at the University of Geneva at the time) and Ronald Nutt (at CPS Innovations in Knoxville, TN) with help from colleagues. The first PET-CT prototype for clinical evaluation was funded by the NCI and installed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in 1998. The first commercial system reached the market by 2001, and by 2004, over 400 systems had been installed worldwide.Kalender, Willi. Computed Tomography. Publicis. 2011. pp.79 Procedure for FDG imaging An example of how PET-CT works in the work-up of FDG metabolic mapping follows: :::::::::::* Before the exam, the patient fasts for at least 6 hours.NHS Choices: PET scan. Retrieved 11 November 2016. :::::::::::* On the day of the exam, the patient rests lying for a minimum of 15 min, in order to quiet down muscular activity, which might be interpreted as abnormal metabolism. * An intravenous bolus injection of a dose of recently produced 2-FDG or 3-FDG is made, usually by a vein in one of the arms. Dosage ranges from per kilogram of body weight. * After one or two hours, the patient is placed into the PET-CT device, usually lying in a supine position with the arms resting at the sides, or brought together above the head, depending on the main region of interest (ROI). * An automatic bed moves head first into the gantry, first obtaining a topogram, also called a scout view or surview, which is a kind of whole body flat sagittal section, obtained with the X-ray tube fixed into the upper position. * The operator uses the PET-CT computer console to identify the patient and examination, delimit the caudal and rostral limits of the body scan onto the scout view, selects the scanning parameters and starts the image acquisition period, which follows without human intervention. * The patient is automatically moved head first into the CT gantry, and the x-ray tomogram is acquired. * Now the patient is automatically moved through the PET gantry, which is mounted in parallel with the CT gantry, and the PET slices are acquired. * The patient may now leave the device, and the PET-CT software starts reconstructing and aligning the PET and CT images. A whole body scan, which usually is made from mid-thighs to the top of the head, takes from 5 minutes to 40 minutes depending on the acquisition protocol and technology of the equipment used. FDG imaging protocols acquires slices with a thickness of 2 to 3 mm. Hypermetabolic lesions are shown as false color-coded pixels or voxels onto the gray-value coded CT images. Standardized Uptake Values are calculated by the software for each hypermetabolic region detected in the image. It provides a quantification of size of the lesion, since functional imaging does not provide a precise anatomical estimate of its extent. The CT can be used for that, when the lesion is also visualized in its images (this is not always the case when hypermetabolic lesions are not accompanied by anatomical changes). FDG doses in quantities sufficient to carry out 4-5 examinations are delivered daily, twice or more per day, by the provider to the diagnostic imaging center. For uses in image-guided radiation therapy of cancer, special fiducial markers are placed in the patient's body before acquiring the PET-CT images. The slices thus acquired may be transferred digitally to a linear accelerator which is used to perform precise bombardment of the target areas using high energy photons (radiosurgery).

He was born in England, the son of John Smith, a former captain in the British Army, and Mary Wilkinson. In 1776, he was commissioned Cornet in the 1st Regiment of Horse. In 1779, he became Lieutenant in the 22nd Light Dragoons and served in the Thirteen Colonies, later becoming Captain. In 1795 he exchanged into the 32nd Light Dragoons and in 1796 into the 21st Light Dragoons and then served as a Major in Tarleton's Light Dragoons. In 1798 he was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army. He was named the lieutenant governor for Prince Edward Island in 1812, replacing Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres. He attempted to reorganize the island's militia to prepare for a possible attack from the United States but encountered resistance from the legislative assembly. Smith also dismissed a number of appointed officials who he believed were conspiring against him including James Bardin Palmer, William Johnston and John Frederick Holland and attempted to govern without convening the island's assembly. He also appointed his relatives to several public offices. Smith attempted to deal with the ongoing issue of land ownership on the island by initiating escheat proceedings against several property owners which remained largely vacant and also by attempting to collect quitrents which he believed would encourage land owners to make more productive use of their properties. His son-in-law John Edward Carmichael, by attempting to collect unpaid quitrents, triggered a series of meetings calling for Smith's recall as governor. In 1824, a review of Smith's activities by the Colonial Office found evidence of misconduct. Lord Bathurst asked Smith to resign and he was replaced by John Ready. With the aid of his brother, Sir William Sidney Smith, he was able to secure a pension in 1829, which he continued to collect until his death at Dawlish in England in 1855.

Licensed to Yakima, Washington, United States, the station serves the Yakima area. The station is currently owned by Northwest Communities Education Center, and has a studio in Granger, Washington.  History of Spanish- language radio  Latinos yearned for media representation and they sought out a radio license from the Federal Government in the early 1920s, however many popular show times were given to American/English radio stations. Most Latino/Spanish radio stations had to opt for purchasing less desirable show time hours such as early in the morning or very late into the evening. Many of the people working towards creating a better and stronger Spanish radio station did so because they wanted to rebuild a patriotic citizenry, that promoted literacy and sobriety that focused more on the folkloric and nationalist elements, for Mexicans not only in the United States but also in Mexico. Pedro J. Gonzalez along with his group Los Madrugadores (The Early Risers) were listened to by many agricultural workers, their music was an inspiration to many however they were also a direct opposing force towards the U.S. government and their efforts to deport Mexicans during the Great Depression. Pedro and his group helped pioneer the road for media representation of Latinos and they were a building block that allowed Spanish- language radio broker Raoul Cortez to be granted, in 1946, the first U.S. radio station to be licensed to a Latino. History Radio KDNA is the nation's first full-time Spanish-language non-commercial radio station, and the first Spanish-language public radio station in Washington state. Known as \\"la voz del campesino\\" (the voice of the farm worker) Radio KDNA is the first radio station in Eastern Washington to produce programming to the Spanish- speaking population of Eastern Washington. KDNA was founded on December 19, 1979 by Ricardo Garc√≠a, Julio Cesar Guerrero, Rosa Ramon and Daniel Robleski in Granger, Washington. Garc√≠a met Robleski in Bellingham, Washington, and decided to unite Robleski and Guerrero and create the first radio station to broadcast all in Spanish in Washington State. They wanted to find a way to unite farm workers from different communities. Conversations about an all- Spanish radio broadcast for farmworkers started as early as 1974 when directors of social programs in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington meet but nothing concrete was done until Garc√≠a met Guerrero and Robleski. During the first stages of KDNA, it was just a small entertainment program in Lynden, Washington, which was directed by Guerrero and Robleski. Some time later, they met Radio KRAB in Seattle and began to transmit their program through Radio KRAB's frequency, but this frequency was only received by receivers built for the special frequency. After this step, Garc√≠a, Guerrero, and Robleski agreed to rent 20 radios for this frequency in order to create a company but this plan failed as there was no money to continue with this plan. This small program also prompted the creation of a news program that was also produced by Guerrero and Robleski and Estela del Villar, the first announcer of the program, broadcast popular music continuously for 12 hours a day, seven days a week. With the help of Ernie Nash, a retired lawyer for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) helped the small program acquire a license with the FCC to be established in Yakima Valley in Washington State. When this was accomplished, Rosa Ram√≥n was hired with Guerrero and Robleski still producing. Ram√≥n then became the only female co-founder of KDNA (she served as station manager from 1979 to 1984). After all this, a search for an acronym was done and KDNA was formed. When pronounced, KDNA sounded like \\"cadena\\" (the word for \\"chain\\" in Spanish, it was labeled Radio Cadena. Along with a new acronym, KDNA, the small program also received a new slogan: \\"Radio Cadena, La Voz de Campesino\\" (\\"Radio Cadena, the Voice of the Farmworker\\"). Hence, on December 19, 1979 the first transmission was made and thus the station that we know as Radio KDNA was founded. Radio Cadena's \\"mission was to motivate, animate, mobilize, organize the community towards the road of progress,... promoting... respect for [the] elderly, the value of education and the civic participation of everyone. The best variety of music [was] listened to in Radio KDNA.\\"  Social justice activism  C√©sar Ch√°vez visited KDNA-FM, a public Spanish-language radio station located in the state of Washington's Yakima Valley, an area known mostly for its apple harvest. Impressed by the radio station's operation and control by local farmworkers, he invited the producer who trained the employees and formatted the majority of their shows‚Äî Julio Guerrero‚Äî to start one on behalf of the UFW. Particularly wowed by KDNA's immigrant-based shows, Ch√°vez marveled at the station's commitment to a decidedly rural and farmworker listenership. According to KDNA station manager Ricardo Garc√≠a, Ch√°vez not only publicly applauded the small Yakima station but his visit inspired the UFW to craft their own community-based radio stations along California's agricultural heartlands. Rosa Ramon, one of the founders and also the station's first manager wanted Radio KDNA wanted serve other ethnic populations in the Yakima area. An advisory board of representatives from the different ethnic groups was formed.  Response to INS raids  The people that work at Radio KDNA were involved with warnings about Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) raids in the community. When they learned that INS would be in the Yakima Valley, the staff created a subtle yet extremely effective way of alerting the farm workers and their families about the incoming raids. The staff, to warn the workers, would play a song about La migra, focused primarily in the area that was said to be soon raided. The town's folk understood the hidden message and did what they could to avoid INS. Yakima valley had become home to a massive community of migrant farm worker, fourth in the US, with some 60,000 Spanish speakers that made up about 30 percent of the population, specifically during harvest season.  Former usage  KDNA had been the call-letters of a listener-supported station in St. Louis, Missouri at 102.5 MHz from 1968 to 1973. That frequency in that locale is now occupied by CBS-owned KEZK, while the programming descendant of the earlier KDNA is KDHX at 88.1 MHz.

Atkinson in 1911 Edward Leicester Atkinson, (23 November 1881 ‚Äì 20 February 1929) was a Royal Navy surgeon and Antarctic explorer who was a member of the scientific staff of Captain Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, 1910‚Äì13. He was in command of the expedition's base at Cape Evans for much of 1912, and led the party which found the tent containing the bodies of Scott, \\"Birdie\\" Bowers and Edward Wilson. Atkinson was subsequently associated with two controversies: that relating to Scott's orders concerning the use of dogs, and that relating to the possible incidence of scurvy in the polar party. He is commemorated by the Atkinson Cliffs on the northern coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica, at . Background Atkinson was born on 23 November 1881 on Saint Vincent in the Windward Islands, where he spent much of his childhood. He was educated at the Forest School, Snaresbrook, and received his medical training at St Thomas's Hospital, London, where he became the hospital's light heavyweight boxing champion. He qualified in 1906 and two years later joined the Naval Medical Service as a surgeon, based at the Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar, in Gosport, Hampshire. He was primarily a researcher, and had published a paper on gonorrhoeal rheumatismWheeler, p. 138 when he was appointed physician and parasitologist to the Terra Nova expedition. On the Terra Nova Expedition=The Southern Journey= The Terra Nova departed from Cardiff on 15 June, 1910. Atkinson was, for the most part, a trusted member of the expedition. According to Harry Pennell, a fellow member of the Terra Nova Expedition, he considered Atkinson as \\"an out and out gentleman with the quiet self-assurance that makes a man without making him offensive\\". However, Pennell also privately observed that Atkinson could also \\"take a dislike to someone on very short acquaintance on very insufficient grounds.\\" The Terra Nova departed from New Zealand on 29 November 1910 and would arrive in the territory of Ross Island in January 1911. Atkinson spent the winter at Cape Evans base camp mainly doing scientific work. Eleven days before Scott's teams set off towards the pole, Scott gave the dog driver Meares the following written orders at Cape Evans dated 20 October 1911 to secure Scott's speedy return from the pole using dogs: The march south began on 1 November 1911, and Atkinson departed south with Scott's team, first as a pony leader and later as a man-hauler. The dogs with their dog-driver Meares turned back to base before the ascent of the Beardmore Glacier. By this time, it was becoming likely that Meares would leave the expedition, and Scott reminded Atkinson of the orders concerning the dogs: \\"with the depot (of dog food) that has been laid at One Ton, come as far as you can\\". Atkinson and others accompanied Scott during the ascent of the Beardmore Glacier. On 22 December, at the glacier summit, lat. 85deg7'S, Atkinson returned to base with the First Support Party,Cherry- Garrard, Wright and Keohane reaching Cape Evans on 29 January 1912 after a generally straightforward journey.SLE Vol 1 Appendix, p. 28 ‚Äì Atkinson's report =In charge at Cape Evans= Edward Atkinson in 1911 On his return to Cape Evans, Atkinson took command.Atkinson was the senior (in fact the only) Naval officer present, since Scott and Lt Evans were southbound and Campbell was away with the Northern party He learned that the chief dog driver, Cecil Meares, had resigned from the expedition,There are differing accounts as to why Meares resigned. Huntford (p. 435) claims a row with Scott: Fiennes (p. 340) says Meares had to return to England to deal with his late father's affairs was waiting for the ship to take him home and was \\"not available\\" for Barrier work. In any case, neither Meares nor anyone else replenished the dog food in the depots. At the beginning of February, the Terra Nova arrived, and Atkinson directed Polar team members to unload supplies, mules and fresh dogs from the Terra Nova, rather than set off with the dogs to meet Scott. In his book The Worst Journey in the World (1922), Cherry-Garrard called this decision a \\"mistake\\". In his 1948 \\"Postscript\\" to this book, published in the edition of 1951, Cherry-Gerrard elaborated: \\"In October [1911] Scott issued certain orders: those for the dogs are dated October 20. In these original orders for the dog teams under Meares [...] The third journey was to start about the first week of February [1912]\\" (p. 583). Then, on page 588, Cherry- Garrard writes: \\"We reached Cape Evans on January 28. In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February\\". On 13 February, finally Atkinson arrived at Hut Point with the dog assistant, the Bulgarian Dimitri Gerov and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were delayed by bad weather at Hut Point when, on 19 February, Tom Crean arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt Edward Evans was lying seriously ill in a tent some 35 miles to the south, and in urgent need of rescue.Evans, Lashly and Crean had formed the final Support Party which had left Scott on 3 January. Lashly had stayed on the Barrier to nurse Evans while Crean walked to Hut Point. Both were awarded Albert (lifesaving) medals Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority and, during a break in the weather, set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved and the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.E Evans: South with Scott p245 Collins 1953 Atkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson however was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected Apsley Cherry-Garrard. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to 'use his judgement' as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov decided to feed the dog food generously to the dogs, and after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party. On 17 March, Cherry-Garrard notes in his diary that the base camp members were \\"anxious\\" about the Polar party's welfare, and on 26 March Atkinson set out with Patrick Keohane (and without the dogs) on a further attempt to pick up Scott's team. They were able to proceed only to Corner Camp before the weather defeated them on 30 March. At that point, Atkinson recorded, \\"I was morally certain that the polar party had perished\\".Atkinson in SLE Vol II p. 309 Before the full onset of winter Atkinson led yet another journey, this time an attempted rescue of the Northern party, which was known to have been set ashore in the region of Evans Coves, some 200 miles north of Cape Evans.This party had originally planned to explore eastward but had changed direction after encountering Amundsen in the Bay of Whales (SLE Vol II p. 85). It returned to Cape Evans and departed with the ship for the North on 9 February 1911 The rescue party set out from Hut Point on 17 April, but they were not able to travel beyond Butter Point at the mouth of the Ferrar Glacier.Atkinson's report in SLE Vol II pp. 310‚Äì16 The subsequent winter at Cape Evans was a difficult and tense time for the depleted expedition crew, but Atkinson maintained a programme of scientific and leisure activities, and managed to hold morale. As winter ended they faced a dilemma: should they first seek to establish the fate of the polar party, or try again to rescue the Northern party? They chose the former course.Apparently this decision was almost unanimous, with one abstention. Wheeler, p. 141, says the abstainer was Lashly, while Solomon, p. 258, suggests it was Cherry-Garrard. =Scott's tent found= On 29 October 1912 Atkinson led a party, with dogs and mulesNine mules, a gift from the Indian Government, had been landed from the Terra Nova during its March 1912 interim visit, together with snowshoes and blinkers which, according to Atkinson (SLE Vol II p. 321) rendered them much more efficient than the previous year's ponies. Wheeler, however (p. 143), says the mules were not a success to begin the search for traces of the polar party. On 12 November, 11 miles to the south of One Ton Depot, the tent containing the bodies of Scott, Wilson and Bowers was discovered. Atkinson found Scott's diary and learned the story of the disaster; he then read to the assembled men the relevant sections including those recording the deaths of PO Evans and Captain Oates. A further march south, in search of Oates's body, found only his sleeping bag. On their return to Hut Point on 25 November the search party learned of the safe return of the Northern Party, at which point Victor Campbell, as senior officer, assumed the leadership. Controversy: Orders concerning dogs While in command of the base during the critical Feb‚ÄìMarch 1912 period, Atkinson had to execute Scott's instructions about how the dogs were to be employed after their return from the Barrier stage of the polar journey. However, Scott's orders concerning exactly how the dogs be used did vary, or at least appear to be unclear. In orders to George Simpson and Meares immediately before his departure south, Scott ordered that after their return from accompanying the polar journey the dogs make a second journey over the barrier \\"to transport to One Ton Camp 5 \\"XS\\"XS = \\"Extra Summit\\". One XS ration was a week's supply of food for four men rations, or at all hazards 3,....and as much dog food as they can carry\\",Seaver, p. 30 (I have italicised words relating to the laying of the dog food depot) this to be done by 12 January 1912. He also instructed Meares to take the dogs on a third journey over the barrier in early February. It is his orders concerning this journey that appear to be confused: it was initially planned merely to hasten the return of the polar party (in order to give them a chance of catching the ship), and not as a relief mission. However, the instructions Scott gave to Atkinson when the latter turned for home at the top of the Beardmore glacier, were for the dogs to \\"come as far as they can.\\" Unfortunately, Scott did not clarify his purpose (nor was he asked to ‚Äì this was a Naval expedition), but perhaps at that stage he was anticipating that the dogs might be needed to see him home. Meares' resignation from the expedition and unavailability for further work on the barrier resulted in plans being changed, and Scott complicated the situation by taking the dogs much further on the polar journey than had been originally planned, so that they were not back at base until 5 January: the dogs' second barrier journey was never made, and although the minimum 3 XS rations were duly depoted (by a man-hauling party comprising Day, Hooper, Clissold and Nelson), the dog food never was. This may have been due to an oversight, a misunderstanding, a lack of communication, disobedience, or so as not to exhaust the men: the supplies were intended to be transported by dogs (see below). The significance of this omission was only apparent laterWheeler, p. 161, and Cherry-Garrard's suspicions of a cover-up ‚Äì it meant that any future movement of the dogs south of One Ton, for rescue purposes or otherwise, would be problematic. While the omission of two XS rations was less significant than that of the dog food (in the end it was of no significance at all: the polar party never reached One Ton) it did change the purpose of the final journey, in that it was now required to transport these rations, rather than simply aid the party's return. Once Atkinson was aware that Meares would not make the \`third' journey he, at first, planned to take the dogs himself, and had already reached Hut Point with Dimitri on 13 February where he was beset by bad weather. However, the arrival on 19 February of Crean, with the news that Lashly was lying with the stricken Lt. Evans at Corner Camp, meant further changes of plans.E Evans South With Scott p245 Collins London 1953The dogs were first used to effect Evans and Lashly's rescue, meaning it was the 26th before they set out for One Ton. Atkinson also decided his first priority, as a doctor, was to tend to the desperately ill Evans, and so (having been summoned along with Wright from Cape Evans with a message sent via Crean), Cherry-Garrard led the mission. Resourceful and competent as he was, the short-sighted Cherry-Garrard was neither as senior within the expedition as Atkinson, nor experienced with dogs as Meares although Atkinson and Cherry- Garrard had become the expedition's next most capable dog drivers under Meares' instruction.E Evans South With Scott p75 Collind London 1953(he was also significantly more tired than Meares, having manhauled a sledge to the top of the Beardmore glacier and back, and then helped unload the Terra Nova across 20 miles of sea ice between the ship and the mainland; whereas Meares had only travelled as far as the foot of the glacier, driving a dog-team the whole way). Fiennes arguesFiennes p. 275 that Scott was simply \\"showing flexibility\\" in changing his plans. But a growing concern that he might need the assistance of the dogs is perhaps evident in Scott's \\"come as far as you can\\" order to Atkinson on 22 December ‚Äì see Southern Journey section above. After dispatching Cherry-Garrard and the dogs to One Ton on 26 February, Atkinson, who was by now aware that there was no dog food at One Ton,SLE Vol II p. 298 ‚Äì when he found this out, and from whom, is not known wrote: \\"It cannot be too firmly emphasised that the dog teams were meant merely to hasten the return of the Southern Party and by no means as a relief expedition\\".SLE Vol II pp. 300‚Äì01 According to Cherry-Garrard,Fiennes, p. 358 Atkinson had instructed him to \\"use his judgement\\" in the event of his not meeting Scott at One Ton. His choices were to wait, or to proceed further south, he had six days' dog food in reserve, enough to reach the next depot but no more, without killing dogs for dog meat ‚Äì he had no other option in the absence of the dog food depot. He was unable to proceed due to bad weather and his concern was that he would be likely to pass Scott's party between depots.E Evans South with Scott p245-246 Collins London 1953 Had Scott's team continued on schedule, they would have arrived at the next depot (Mount Hooper) the same day that Cherry-Garrard reached One Ton i.e. 4 March and there was a genuine risk that they would miss each other on the march. If he had not delayed he would have unknowingly reached the next depot two days before Scott but would not have been able to wait before returning to base. Cherry-Garrard invoked instructions, whether from Atkinson or ultimately from Scott is contradictory in his book, which were \\"never changed\\",George Seaver, 1965 foreword to Cherry-Garrard's Worst Journey: Scott had left instructions, never changed....etc p. 32 in Penguin Travel Library edition were that the dogs were to be saved for scientific journeys in the following year and were \\"not to be risked\\" during the summer and autumn of 1911 ‚Äì 12. Apparently mindful of the \\"not to be risked\\" dictum (and faced with bad weather, eyesight problems, illness and lack of navigating skills) he chose to wait. This decision was commended as correct by Atkinson,SLE Vol II p. 306 (and, in light of the poor health in which both men and dogs were on their return, it seems it would have been irresponsible to have done otherwise) but would later cause Cherry- Garrard much distress. FiennesFiennes pp. 360‚Äì62 asks if some blame might be due to Atkinson (or Meares, or Cherry-Garrard, or Scott himself), but does not come to a definite conclusion. He questions why Meares, who had returned to base on 5 January and must have known that the dog food depot had not been laid, was allowed by Atkinson to wait apparently unoccupied at Cape Evans until catching the ship on 5 March,Fiennes p. 360 and Charles Wright was certain that Meares should have been sent to One Ton and not Cherry-Garrard. In later years Atkinson claimed that Meares had \\"disobeyed orders\\" (whose?) in not laying the dog food depot, but this could not be backed up in writing.Wheeler, p. 202 One should remember, however, that none of the events that changed the ways in which the dogs were deployed and the details of the supplies that were taken to One Ton (the dogs late return from their first journey, Meares' resignation, and the ill-health of Evans) were caused by Atkinson. Furthermore, one should remember the dates: Atkinson did not return himself from the south until 29 January, so had no part in the reasoning to deposit only the minimum 3 XS rations and no dog food at One Ton in early January and no knowledge of it until it was too late; he was unaware of Scott's decision to take five men to the pole (and the subsequent recalculation of rations) until Crean arrived at Hut Point on the 19 February; he had no significant cause for concern for the polar party until Cherry- Garrard and Dimitri's return on 16 March, and even less when they departed on 26 February (his last opportunity to issue instructions to the inexperienced Cherry-Garrard). Perhaps most significantly, it was not until the dogs' return 16 March that he had any reason at all to assume overall command of the expedition: until it was apparent that the polar party would not return, he had simply been the senior (healthy) officer present. One must infer that he did not fully accept this position in his own mind until he and Keohane left Corner Camp on 30 March, when he wrote that he was 'morally certain' of their deaths: he must have held some hope until at least 26 March, otherwise why risk his own, and Keohane's, safety by venturing on to the barrier so late in the season? Since the expedition was run on naval terms, Atkinson may have felt he had no authority to do anything other than carry out Scott's original orders, nor to order Meares to accompany Dimitri and the dogs to One Ton. Fiennes concludes: \\"There are many individuals involved with what Scott termed a 'miserable jumble', and all have produced their own versions of what prompted their action or inaction at the time. Scott did not apportion human blame, nor did he accept it.\\" Controversy: Scurvy Atkinson was the only medically qualified officer to see the bodies of Scott, Wilson and Bowers. The extent of any detailed examination he made is not known, and no medical report on the causes of death was ever published. However, he reportedly told Cherry- Garrard emphatically that there was no evidence of scurvy in the bodies.Solomon p. 279 The truth of this statement has been queried by Scott's detractors, on grounds which are largely circumstantial. Scurvy had affected previous Antarctic expeditions, including Scott's with the Discovery, and dietary provision had not improved much meantime. The progressive weakening of the polar party on the return, and of Edgar Evans in particular, sounded like scurvy symptoms. And of course Atkinson's denials may have been intended to preserve the reputation of the expedition ‚Äì scurvy carried with it a sort of stigma.Fiennes p. 372 The growth in scientific understanding of the nature and causes of scurvy in the years after 1912 may have helped fuel the assumption that Scott and his companions had been affected by it. Even Raymond Priestley of the expedition's scientific staff, who had at one time denied the incidence of scurvy was, fifty years later, beginning to think differently.Solomon, p. 280 However, despite the lack of understanding of the causes of the disease that existed in 1912,For example, during the 1911 winter Atkinson had given a lecture on scurvy, reported by Cherry-Garrard, p. 262, in which he \\"inclined to Almroth Wright's theory that scurvy is due to acid intoxication of the blood caused by bacteria\\" the symptoms were well-known, and Solomon and Fiennes both point out that it is unthinkable that so scrupulous a scientific observer and physician as Edward Wilson would have made no mention at all of any sign of scurvy in the polar party, had it existed, in his journals and various letters.Huntford, however, says (p. 499) that Wilson was not a practising doctor and \\"showed no signs of being able to diagnose the complicated progress of scurvy, except in the final stages\\" 1914‚Äì18 War On his return to England Atkinson worked briefly at the London School of Tropical Medicine on parasitic research, before departing on a medical expedition to China, to investigate a parasitic flatworm that was causing schistosomiasis among British seamen. After the outbreak of World War I Atkinson returned to England and reported for active service. Before he left England for his deployment, he married Jessica Hamilton on 12 August 1915, at a registry office located in Essex. He was sent to Gallipoli to investigate fly-borne diseases, and contracted pleurisy which left him hospitalised. He spent some time recovering from the illness at a hospital in Malta and kept in touch with Cherry-Garrard during his convalescence. In 1916 he served on the Western Front and fought at the Somme, receiving the Distinguished Service Order. After service in North Russia,Damien Wright. Shackleton's men in the Arctic: polar explorers and Arctic warfare in North Russia 1918-19. Orders & Medals Research Society Journal, September 2017, page 198. on 16 September 1918, Surgeon Lieutenant-Commander Atkinson received horrific injuries from an explosion aboard HMS Glatton in Dover Harbour. Although rendered unconscious by the first explosion and burned and blinded, he was able to rescue several men before escaping, and was awarded the Albert Medal. It was also during the war that Atkinson was approached to be a part of the relief expedition to look for Ernest Shackleton and his crew on the Endurance, which was stranded somewhere in the Weddell Sea. Atkinson was initially reluctant to assist in the effort because of his commitment to the war effort, but upon news of the safe return of Shackleton and his crew back to civilization, he was able to carry on with his wartime duties.. Later life After the war Atkinson was seconded to the Royal Hellenic Navy to undergo a British naval training mission. He also continued to receive treatments and surgeries for the burns and other wounds he suffered aboard the HMS Glatton explosion in 1918. It was around this time that he would begin to gather up materials on his war-time findings, as well as his Terra Nova Expedition reports. He would later reveal to Cherry-Garrard the results of research he had conducted on the nutritional value of Scott's party's Barrier and Plateau rations. He found that the Barrier rations were generating only 51% of the calories required to support a typical Barrier workload, the corresponding Plateau figure being 57%.Cherry- Garrard, p. 618 These figures provided a substantial explanation (starvation) for the physical failure of the polar party. Thereafter Atkinson continued with his naval career. In 1928 his wife died and he suffered a nervous breakdown. He recovered, however, and within a few months had married again, been promoted Surgeon-Captain and retired from the Royal Navy. On board ship in the Mediterranean on 20 February 1929, on his way back to England, Atkinson died suddenly, at the age of 47, and was buried at sea. Eight years later Cherry-Garrard wrote an extra preface to the 1937 edition of The Worst Journey, as a tribute to Atkinson. \\"His voice has been with me often since those days ‚Äì that gruffish deep affectionate monosyllabic way he used to talk to you ... he could not help the tenderness poking through. I am glad to have this opportunity to witness something of what we owe him.\\"Quoted from Wheeler, p. 239 Notes and referencesSources *Cherry-Garrard, Apsley (1983) The Worst Journey in the World Penguin Travel Library Edition. *Fiennes, Ranulph (2003) Captain Scott Hodder and Stoughton. *Huntford, Roland (1985) The Last Place on Earth Pan Books *Scott's Last Expedition, Vols.

It was notable for being one of the largest menswear retailers in the country until 2016. It had stores nationwide, mainly in larger towns and cities. Around the time of its closure, it had 100+ stores across the United Kingdom. The business traded under both The Officers Club and Blue Inc names. In February 2019, it was brought out of administration by Rerun Limited, reopened 18 stores and are currently reopening more stores around the UK. History Blue Inc has its origin in a company founded by Abraham Levy which began trading as A. Levy & Sons, a hat shop in Stratford, east London. The company traded via a number of brands, chiefly as Mr Byrite, a chain of discount stores selling menswear. The company expanded rapidly in the 1980s, and was then run by the three children of Barry Levy ‚Äì Jonathan, Robert and Daniel (the last later became known as the chairman of Tottenham Hotspur).Property Week Blue Inc as a brand first appeared in 1997, aimed at younger men who desire an alternative and low- priced image combined with an eye-catching street look. It had a flagship store on London's Oxford Street, while the main UK chain is based in principally-located town and city centres, and major shopping centres. Traditionally a menswear retailer, Blue Inc now also offers womenswear, boyswear and girlswear ranges within selected stores. In 2006 Marlow Retail Ltd purchased the business. In 2009 the company launched its transactional e-commerce website. In March 2011, Blue Inc expanded with the purchase of 47 stores from collapsed rival The Officers Club, retaining them under the Officers Club brand name. In 2012 the business went on to purchase 20 stores from the administrators of the boyswear and menswear retailer D2, expanding the Blue Inc business to over 200 stores across the country. All D2 stores were rebranded Blue Inc later that year. In 2013 following the failure of the Republic fashion chain, five stores were acquired from landlords and this was used as a catalyst to increase Blue Inc's womenswear offering, which for a time, had used the Pink Inc name. =Administration= In January 2016 Blue Inc called in the administrators on behalf of A.Levy and Sons (their then parent company) who owned the store leases for Blue Inc and Officers Club. Immediately afterwards, a store closure process ensued resulting in a number of closures across both trading brand names, many however remain open. Products Blue Inc offered fashionable men's, women's, boy's and girl's clothing; from formal products and suits, to casualwear at competitively low prices from multiple brands. It sold its own products under the Blue Inc, Officers Club or Twisted Soul brand names but also stocked other brands such as Adidas, Mossimo and Polo Ralph Lauren.

The abbey was the first producer of B√©n√©dictine, a herbal liqueur, based on brandy.Liqueurs, M. Luisa Gonzalez- Sanjose, The Oxford Handbook of Food Fermentations, ed. Charles W. Bamforth, Robert E. Ward, (Oxford University Press, 2014), 331. First foundation It was founded in 658 by Waningus, a Merovingian count, for nuns. Another convent he founded in 660, near the site of the Precious Relic, was destroyed by the Vikings in 842. Around the Ducal palace, the foundations of two chapels have been found. Second foundation After more Viking raids, Richard I of Normandy rebuilt the church. It was Richard II who invited Guillaume de Volpiano (Guglielmo da Volpiano) in 1001 to rekindle the life of the abbey, under Benedictine rules.R. Allen Brown, The Normans and the Norman Conquest, (The Boydell Press, 1994), 21-22. These two Norman rulers, who were originally buried outside,Emma Mason, Westminster Abbey and Its People, C.1050-c.1216, (The Boydell Press, 1996), 14. were later interred in 1162 by Henry II of England within the southern transept of the gothic abbey church.Lindy Grant, Architecture and Society in Normandy 1120-1270, (Yale University Press, 2005), 76. Their remains were moved several times and reburied in several places, finally being placed in lead boxes and reburied again in the southern transept in 1956. In February 2016, French, Danish and Norwegian researchers opened the lead boxes in order to conduct DNA analysis of the remains. Radiocarbon dating of the remains showed that neither skeleton could be that of Richard I or Richard II. One skeleton dated from the third century BCE, the other from the eighth century AD, both long before the lifetimes of Richard I and Richard II. Guillaume de Volpiano is buried in one of the northern chapels. Mid-eleventh century The abbey at F√©camp was critical in the Norman conquest of England. Edward the Confessor granted the royal minster church in Steyning to the abbey, in gratitude to his Norman protectors during his exile. With its large, wealthy manor lands and thriving port, this grant was to take effect after the death of Aelfwine, Bishop of Winchester, who had charge of Steyning. The bishop died in 1047 and ecclesiastical jurisdiction then passed directly to Pope Clement II. In the same way, F√©camp Abbey itself answered to no Norman bishop, only to the Pope. The gift was later confirmed by William the Conqueror. The chancel of the church at F√©camp Abbey. A nearby port with land around Rye, Winchelsea and Hastings had already been given to the same Abbey by King Cnut, to honour a promise made by his wife Emma of Normandy's first husband King Aethelred. The monks had hardly had time to settle in when in 1052 Godwin, Earl of Wessex expelled them from Steyning and seized it for himself. His son Harold decided to keep it upon his accession, rather than restore it to them. This made commercial and strategic sense (Harold did not want a Norman toehold at a potential invasion port), but William responded by swearing on a knife before setting out for England to recover it for the monks. This gained him a ship from the abbey and, upon his victory at Hastings, he made good his promise and returned Steyning to the abbey, with whom it remained until the 15th century. The charter acquitted the grantees of all earthly service and subjection to barons, princes, and others, and gave them all royal liberties, custom, and justice over all matters arising in their land; and threatened any who should infringe these liberties with an amercement of ¬£100 in gold. They moved the remains of the local saint, Cuthman of Steyning, to the mother abbey at Fecamp. The abbey also provided William with Remigius de F√©camp, the first Bishop of Lincoln. Church architecture The Abbey church of the Holy Trinity was built between 1175 and 1220 using the cream-coloured stone of Caen. Under the Plantagenets, the scriptorium at F√©camp produced numerous illuminated manuscripts.

Content B.U.G. Mafia released the track Pana cand moartea ne va desparti ('Till Death Do Us Part), a collaboration with young and upcoming rapper Puya as an unofficial single. A soulful ode, the song still remains one of the best known in Romanian hip hop, being remade for the Via≈£a noastrƒÉ (Vol.1) (Our Life Vol.1) anniversary album with the vocals being recorded by Tataee. It depicted the story of two brothers, Alex and Tony, who grew up in the projects having to face everyday life in the ghetto and starting to live on the streets when their parents died. The twist at the end of the song is when the two brothers face each other in a shoot out, one being a top policeman and the other a head of organized crime. They both died in the shoot out, the story being one of the most emotional in the group's work.

It was built on a hill of 450 m above sea level, in the hinterland of Apollonia, about 30 km from the eastern coast of the Adriatic. It is located in today Krotin√´, Berat County, Albania.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; . The settlement was fortified in the 4th century B.C. The town experienced its climax in the Hellenistic period between the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C., during a phase marked by intense urban planning, including the construction of a new city wall and the building of a theater. Manufacturing and materials seem to witness an intense exchange with nearby Apollonia. Name The place name Dimallum belongs to the southeast Dalmatian onomastic area of Illyrian. It is a compound of di + mal. The root mal ‚Äì is reflected in many ancient Balkan (Illyrian or Thracian) toponyms such as Malontum, Maloventum, Malontina, Dacia Maluensis etc. The Illyrian toponym Dimallum is related to Albanian di-male, meaning \\"two mountains\\", with the Proto-Albanian form reconstructed as mol-no.  History  At Dimale an Illyrian pre-urban and proto-urban settlement of the 5th-4th centuries BC is confirmed by pottery found in the site. However physical architectural remains of this period have not been preserved. The Illyrian settlement seems to have included initially only a small inhabited area on the hill, which was fortified in the 4th century B.C., representing one of the proto-urban centres that were established in the hinterland of southern Illyria (today Albania), especially during the developed Iron Age. These proto-urban centres were fortified sites different to the small unwalled villages known as komai. The processes of the development of these proto-urban settlements are unclear to scholars, who also have not yet completely understood the role of these sites, whether they were hilltop shelters, towns or meeting centres of regional trading. The development and prosperity of the town occurred in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. During this period a new wall was built replacing the first fortification. The new wall comprised the whole hill of Dimale. The town made available sufficient financial resources to undertake a social and religious construction program. Several stoas, a temple, and a theater were built, showing a significant influence of the Ancient Greek culture on the local Illyrian inhabitants. According to N.G.L. Hammond, Dimale was possibly founded by King Pyrrhus of Epirus, or by settlers from the nearby Greek colony of Apollonia. Chiara Lasagni claims that Hammond's hypothesis is to be considered completely outdated. According to M. B. Hatzopoulos, the non-Greek name of the city, the lack of any Greek founding legends associated with it and the mixed (colonial Greek, Greek from Epirus, non-Greek) onomastics of its inhabitants, suggest that Dimale had not a Greek character from the beginning, being originally a settlement of the Illyrian Parthini, which was Hellenized under the influence of the Epirote state and Apollonia. Although, the city is frequently linked with the Parthini in various ancient sources, it was never explicitly stated to be a city of that tribe. =Roman period= Dimale appears in ancient sources of the Roman period that describes the wars involving the Roman Republic. During the Second Illyrian War in 219 BC, Demetrius of Pharos, after expelling all his opponents from Dimale, fortified the city against an imminent Roman attack and left to defend Pharos. In spite of the fortress of Dimale being considered impregnable, the Romans, under the command of L. Aemilius Paullus, captured the city in a seven-day siege with local Illyrian help. After Demetrius' complete defeat at Roman hands and ultimate flight to Macedonia, Dimale entered into a friendly relationship (amicitia) with Rome. During the First Macedonian war, in 213 or 212 BC, Philip V of Macedon managed to take control of the city but, after an unsuccessful Roman assault led by P. Sempronius Tuditanus in 205 B.C., the city was given up by Philip V in the peace treaty between Rome and Macedon in Phoenice the same year. Findings and organization The identification of the site with the ancient city became possible thanks to the discovery of ancient tiles stamped with the Greek word DIMALLITAN written in Northwestern or Doric Greek dialect (ŒîŒôŒúŒëŒõŒõŒôŒ§ŒëŒù \\"of the Dimallians\\"). Epigraphy in Dimale mentions a number of Greek offices such as prytanis, grammateus and phylarchos as well as a single dedication to Phoebus. The city hosted a number of monuments, typical of the ancient Greek architectural style, such as a stoa.

It flows through the wetlands to the north of the Polden Hills and ultimately joins the River Brue.  Route  From Doulting, the Sheppey flows south west to Charlton, where parts of its course have been culverted. The river has been diverted underground for much, though not all, of its passage through Shepton Mallet. It reappears at Darshill and then flows south west through Croscombe to Dinder where it flows through the grounds of Dinder House which was built in 1801 and under a bridge which pre-dates the house. It then continues west past Dulcote, Woodford and Coxley. At Coxley it is joined by the Keward Brook which carries the water from the springs in Wells which fill the moat of the Bishop's Palace. River Sheppey at Darshill From Coxley, the river flows north through Hay Moor and North Moor, west through Ash Moor, then sharply south through Frogmore and west through Godney. At Lower Godney (where this is a public house named after the river), it is channelled through the James Wear River and the Decoy Rhine to Westhay Level, where it joins Whites River and then the River Brue near Westhay.  Ecology  The water quality is generally good; however, there have been some discharges from sewage treatment works in the area that can contribute to nutrient levels in rivers. Signs of nutrient enrichment are noticeable at times of low flow and the ecology of the Sheppey is adversely affected in its upper reaches.  History  It would appear that the Sheppey was only so called in the late 19th century. Prior to then, if it was called anything, it was probably Doulting Water or the River Brae. The Sheppey has been used in the past to power local industry, for example corn and textile mills in the Shepton Mallet area. There may have been more than thirty mills powered by the river and its tributaries in the area of Shepton Mallet, Bowlish and Darshill, although fewer than this number of sites have been positively identified.

Having a double status, collegial and parochial, it forms part of the Catholic diocese of Poitiers. The west front adorned with statuary is recognised as a masterpiece of Romanesque religious art. The walls inside the church are painted. The √âglise Notre-Dame la Grande, from the south-west Bell tower Columns in the nave West front of √âglise Notre-Dame la Grande Detail of the frieze showing (left to right) Adam, Eve and Nebuchadnezzar II Detail of the frieze Statue of Our Lady holding the keys of the town History and architecture Notre Dame la Grande, Poitiers, France, 1903. Exterior. The district was already populated in Roman times. The ancient vestiges of a brick and rectangular stone construction can be located near the gutter on the northern wall of the current church. The church is mentioned in the 10th century, under the name of \\"Sancta Maria Maior\\", referring to the Romanesque church of the same name. Its position next to the Palace of the Counts of Poitou-Dukes of Aquitaine (current law courts of Poitiers), is certainly significant as from the political point of view, the bishops of Poitiers were barons of Poitou. The whole of the building was rebuilt in the second half of the 11th century, in the period of High Romanesque, and inaugurated in 1086 by the future Pope Urban II. The plan of the church is composed of a central nave with aisles according to a frequent plan in Romanesque architecture of Poitou. The interior has the effect of a \\"church agora\\" on just one plane. The barrel vault has a slightly flattened silhouette, whereas the aisles are covered with a groined vault. Outside, the aisles were covered with a terrace punt, the roof being reserved for the nave: thus there was the effect of a basilica on two levels. This silhouette disappeared with the Gothic remodelling. A deambulatory with radiating chapels developed around the church which preserved a part of its murals. A crypt of the 11th century, dug a posteriori under the choir, also preserves frescos of the time. The plan does not have transepts, for good reasons: buildings were in the north, and the principal street passes to the south. The Romanesque gate is preserved in part to the south. Cut down by this stage, one found there before the Revolution, an equestrian statue representing Constantine. This statue was the counterpart of another, older statue destroyed by the Huguenots in 1562. It is not known if the identity of the first rider had been the same. Behind this statue, on the ground, a small vault dedicated to Saint Katherine was referred to during the Middle Ages. The bell-tower dates from the 11th century. In the beginning it was much more obvious: the first level is concealed today by the roofs. Located at the site of the crossing, it presents a square base, then over it a circular level of a roof decorated with tiles. This type of roof, frequent in the south-west, was often copied by the architects of the 19th century, in particular Paul Abadie in Angoul√™me, P√©rigueux and Bordeaux. During the second quarter of the 12th century, the old bell-tower-porch which was on the frontage was removed and the church was increased by two spans towards the west. In the south, the turret of a staircase marks the site of this enlargement. It is at that time that the celebrated frontage-screen was built. In the north, there was a cloister in the 12th century. It was removed in 1857 for the construction of the metal markets. There remains the door (walled up). Three arches supported by columns duplicated with capitals with foliage were re-installed in the court of the university opposite, as was a pillar on the corner. Private vaults were added to the Romanesque structure during the 15th and 16th centuries. Of Flamboyant Gothic style, they belonged to the middle- class families of the city, who had been merchants since the end of the Middle Ages. The largest was built in the south by Yvon the Insane, Grand Seneschal of Poitou in the 15th century. His tomb was placed there before the Revolution. Interior decoration The Romanesque frescoes do not survive apart from those in the apse vault above the choir and in the crypt. Above the choir one can see an uncommon portrayal of the apocalypse: the Virgin and Child are shown in a mandorla, Christ is in majesty on the vault, between a circle and a square, then the Lamb of God is shown in a circle. All around, under the arches are the Twelve Apostles seated, as on the facade. Historians of art think that this painting served as a model for the sculptures on the facade, the attitudes and the composition being identical. In the angles, angels accompany souls to paradise. In the crypt, the frescoes show anonymous saints. The whole ensemble was restored by Joly-Leterme in 1851. He had the columns and the vaults repainted with \\"Romano-byzantine\\" motifs, departing from a principle current among the restorers of the 19th century, that of the influence of the Crusades on Romanesque art. Fantastical and rather heavy, these paintings have been criticised since then. The writer Joris-Karl Huysmans called them \\"tattoos\\". The carvings of the capitals are sober, using stylised foliage called \\"feuilles grasses\\" (thick leaves). Only one capital is historiated: situated in the deambulatory on the south side, it shows the Ascension with Christ standing in a mandorla. The capitals in the choir are inspired by the Corinthian capitals of antiquity. The name \\"Robertus\\" appears but the reason for this is unknown. Crosses formy are carved here and there on the columns, in the #combles# and on the bell tower. In the chapel of St Anne, called the Madman's Chapel, are found a Deposition in the Tomb carved in stone and coloured. Dating from the beginning of the 16th century it comes from the former abbey of the Trinity. Furniture The church was refurnished after the Revolution. Thus, one finds there a Baroque pulpit carved from wood in the 17th century, coming from the convent, two bronze lecterns of the 16th century. The statue of Our Lady of the Keys dated from the end of the 16th or beginning of the 17th century. The tradition says that it is a copy of the miraculous statue, destroyed by the Huguenots in 1562. Its hieratic, foreign style in the taste of the end of the 16th century, recalls the Romanesque period. The whole of the stained glass dates from the 19th and 20th centuries. The choir organ is end of the 19th century, whereas the large organ is from 1996. The sculpture of the West Front Adam, Eve and Nebuchadnezzar II: above the door, a panel of high reliefs can be seen: this illustrates passages from the Bible. The selected scenes, taken from both Testaments, tell the Annunciation and the Incarnation of God on earth in the person of Jesus Christ to save humanity. From left to right may be seen the original sin, Nabuchodonosor King of Babylon, the prophets Daniel, Moses, Isaiah and Jeremiah. They are followed by the Annunciation, the Tree of Jesse and King David. This first half of the panel, portraying those who foresee the arrival of a Saviour in the Old Testament, the Annunciation and the ancestors of the Virgin, evokes the relationship which exists between the Old Testament and the New in the Christian Church. On the other side of the entrance, may be seen the Visitation, between the towns of Nazareth and Jerusalem. The town of Nazareth represents also the Synagogue, that of Jerusalem the Church: these are represented like medieval cities. The passing from the Jewish law to the new Christian law is portrayed in these 12th century carvings. This scene is followed by the Nativity of Jesus and the Bath of the Child (drawn from apocryphal books). The Bath of the Child includes the eucharistic cup, thus foreseeing the events of Christ's Passion. St. Joseph, is perplexed by what he has experienced. Below Joseph, two men are represented fighting (according to a recent study (cf bibliography) this is Jacob wrestling with the Angel). Just above, the arcades hold statues of the twelve apostles and two bishops. According to local tradition the bishops are St Hilary of Poitiers and St Martin of Tours. The historians of art prefer not see the figures as portraits but as representations of bishops as heirs to the apostles, therefore represented on the same level. The attitudes are different: on the right, a bishop points out the episcopal capacity of the bishops of Poitiers, barons of Poitou. On the left, the bishop carries the papal attributes of the 12th century (the bishop of Rome, evoking the papal power in the period of the Gregorian reform). Finally the Second Advent is represented above: Christ is shown standing upright in a mandorla, surrounded by Cherubim and the Sun and the Moon. One distinguishes work from at least two different workshops of sculpture: one with a taste for movement and folds in clothing, visible in the Annunciation for example, and the other with a more static style, in flat tints (cf. the Visitation). The sculptures had been carried out before the stonework of the front was assembled, as is shown by scrollwork which is incomplete and a few sculptures which are obviously not part of the original design. Traces of polychromy and painted inscriptions were placed on front and on the figures. They are most easily seen on the scene of the Annunciation. In 1562, at the time of the sack of Poitiers, the Huguenots broke the heads of the figures which they regarded as heretics. In the 17th century, the acts of merchant salters whose workshops stood against the front, caused some deterioration of the calcareous stone by the effects of salt. An extensive restoration campaign began in 1992: the stones were cleaned in the laboratory and were reinstalled. The inauguration of the restored frontage took place in 1995. It was for this occasion that the artists of Skertz√≤ created a spectacle of multi-coloured lighting (polychromies). Every evening during the summer, at nightfall, the West Front of the Church of Notre-Dame-la-Grande is illuminated by a whole palette of colours, a reminder of its past and the mediaeval tradition of painting churches. http://www.visit-poitou-charentes.com/Agenda- evenements/Polychromies-de-Notre-dame-la-grande2 The legend of the miracle of the keys In the year 1202, the English besieged the city of Poitiers. The mayor's clerk promised to deliver the city to them, on Easter Day, by providing them with the keys to the city in exchange for a large sum of money. In the night, the clerk went to the room of the mayor to steal the keys, but they had disappeared. To his dismay, the mayor also realized that the keys had disappeared and he was alarmed because he realized that treason had been committed. He thus held back his soldiers and went to the church of Notre Dame-la-Grande to request a miracle. There he discovered the statue of the Virgin Mary holding the keys. However, during the night, under the ramparts, frightened by the appearances of the Virgin, Saint Hilary and Saint Radegunda, the English killed each other and fled. This event is represented, in the church, in a stained glass window of the 19th century and on a table of the 17th century. The church of St-Hilaire-la-Grande of Poitiers preserves three stone statues (the Virgin with the Child, Saint Hilary and Saint Radegunda) which formerly decorated the gate of the moat, the place of the miracle. The legend is not credible from a historical point of view since, in 1202, Poitou formed part of the English duchy of Aquitaine, under the reigns of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The oldest account of the legend can be found in Jean Bouchet's Annals of Aquitaine. The legend became very popular, especially after the arrival of the admiral Gaspard II of Coligny in 1569. Until 1887 the citizens of Poitiers celebrated this divine protection by a solemn procession through the city. In the 19th century a statue of the Virgin Mary, with the keys, was set up in the middle of the church.

It is a proposed alternative to double-entry bookkeeping, the method currently favored by the worldwide financial accounting system. In regular double-entry bookkeeping, changes in balances, such as earning revenues and collecting cash, are recorded. These events are recorded with two entries, usually a debit and a credit, assigned on a given date. In momentum accounting, changes in balances are the recognized events.  Example  An acceleration in revenue earning, such as a $1,000 per period increase of revenues from $10,000 per month to $11,000 per month, is a recordable event that would require three entries to implement.

National Academy Press. which consists of curricular and non-curricular learning experiences for pupils and students outside the school environment. Goals The point of out-of-school learning is to overcome learning disabilities, development of talents, strengthen communities and increase interest in education by creating extra learning opportunities in the real world. In a studyUCLA CRESST, The Long-Term Effects of After-School Programming on Educational Adjustment and Juvenile Crime:A Study of the LA‚Äôs BEST After-School Program performed by the UCLA National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) it was proven that out- of-school learning increases the interest in education and school itself. Implementation Out-of-school learning is typically not coordinated by the school itself. Out-of-school experiences are organized with community partners such as museums, sport facilities, charity initiatives, and more. Out-of- school experiences can range from service learning to summer school and expeditions or more commonly occur in day to day experiences at after-school with creative ventures such as arts courses and even sports. Some other examples of out-of-school learning are: * homework and homework clubs * study clubs ‚Äì extending curriculum * mentoring ‚Äì by other pupils and by adults, including parents * learning about learning * community service and citizenship * residential activities ‚Äì study weeks or weekends Results It has been found in researchThe Wallace Foundation by the Wallace Foundation that out-of-school learning can be a great opportunity to discover and develop talents. Especially if a professional organization develops a learning environment that guides groups of pupils/students in their co-operation in creating a professional and publicly visible product, presentation or performance. Companies, cultural institutions and non governmental organizations can offer valuable out-of-school learning experiences. Organizations will see results accordingly to the quality of the experience, whether they aim to promote active and healthy lifestyles, increase community involvement and visitors/members, to an interest in a company's corporate responsibility projects and employment opportunities.

At the time of their arrival, the area was inhabited by the Hackensack and Raritan groups of Lenape. Toponymy Placenaming by Dutch explorers and settlers during the era often referred to a location in reference to other places, its shape, its topography, and other geographic qualities. Today Newark Bay is connected to Upper New York Bay by the Kill Van Kull and to Raritan Bay by the Arthur Kill. The names of the channels reflect the period of Dutch colonialization. The area around the bay and the rivers that feed it was called Achter Kol. (achter meaning behind and col, meaning a mountain pass) which translates as behind or beyond the ridge and refers to Bergen Hill. The emergence of the Hudson Palisades begins on Bergen Neck, the peninsula between the bay and the Hudson River. Kille in Dutch means stream or channel. During the British colonial era the bay was known as Cull bay. Kill van Kull literally translates as channel from the ridge. Arthur Kill is an anglicisation of achter kill meaning back channel, which would speak to its location behind Staten Island. Early settlement thumb Achter Kol was nearby the patroonship called Pavonia, patented in 1630, and reverted to the Dutch West India Company in 1636. Homesteads of Pavonia where clustered at Communipaw and Harsimus on the North River (Hudson River). David Pietersen de Vries (c. 1593-c.1655), a Dutch sea captain, explorer, and trader, who had established settlements at the Zwaanendael Colony, Staten Island, and nearby Vriessendael, as was an early European proprietor of the area. In his \\"Korte Historiael Ende Journaels Aenteyckeninge\\" (Short Historical Notes and Journal Notes of Various Voyages), published in 1655, de Vries described a Lenape hunt in the valley of the Achinigeu-hach (or Ackingsah-sack) in which one hundred or more men stood in a line many paces from each other, beating thigh bones on their palms to drive animals to the river, where they could be killed easily. Other methods of hunting included lassoing and drowning deer, as well as forming a circle around prey and setting the brush on fire. In 1642, Myndert Myndertsen received a patroonship for much the land north of the Newark Bay. An absentee landlord, Myndertsen hired a superintendent Johannes Winckelman to construct a farmhouse (a combined dwelling and barn), completed the same year. The homestead was at present day Bogota near the Hackensack tribe's encampment at Tantanqua, today's Overpeck Creek. Originally spared in the reprisals for the attacks at Pavonia and Corlear's Hook that began Kieft's War in 1643, the residents were ordered back to the relative safety of Fort Amsterdam and replaced by a regiment of soldiers with cannons. Perceived as an act of war by the Hackensack it was later plundered and destroyed. The Achter Col Colony was not replaced. http://www.BogotaOnLine The area was later settled and become known as the English Neighborhood. After some time, relations with Hackensack Lenape improved. Oratam, the sachem, or sagamore, of the Hackensack engaged peacefully and shrewdly with representatives of the Dutch West India Company. Both parties were helped considerably by Sarah Kiersted, who had mastered the Algonquian language and acted as translator and scribe. For her help Oratam, in 1666, gave her a large tract of (2260 acres) at Achinigeu-hach (or \\"Ackingsah-sack\\") between the Hackensack River and Overpeck Creek in gratitude for her work as emissary and interpreter. In late 1654 a series of grants were made for land \\"achter Kol\\",History of new Netherland, E.B. Callaghan (c)1855 which became the small communities of Pamrapo and Minkakwa. Eventually, Oratam, deeded the land to the Dutch in 1665.

Its administrative headquarters at the garrisoned village at today's Bergen Square were later established in 1660. When area was taken by the English it kept its Dutch name and in 1675, the East Jersey Legislature officially established the first four counties of present-day New Jersey, (Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, and Monmouth).

Biography Arthur Rosson was born on 24 August 1886 in London, England. He was the first child born of a jockey horse trainer, Arthur Richard Rosson, and a French woman, Hellen Rochefort Rosson. Rosson came from a film-making family. His brother, Harold Rosson, was an Academy Award-nominated cinematographer and several other family members were involved in the early film industry. He was also the brother of silent film actress Helene Rosson and actor and director Richard Rosson. Rosson graduated from Rogers High School in Newport, Rhode Island in 1902. Rosson was a stock-exchange clerk, who wanted to make a career for himself in film. He married Louise (Lucille) Irana Niedermeyer on 2 June 1912. At the time of their marriage, Louise was three months pregnant. After their first child was born, they moved to California. The couple later divorced.

Rosson again handles the duties of director for Dwan's film A Splendid Hazard that was produced in 1920. Rosson later went to Britain to direct Ebb Tide and Women Who Pay in 1932. The films were produced by Paramount-British productions. Shortly after, in 1934 he directed Forbidden Territory He also worked as the second unit director of all of Cecil B. DeMille's films beginning in the 1930s. He died in 1960 and is buried in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery with other members of his family.

Founded in 1931, the AANS was originally known as the Harvey Cushing Society, named for the brain surgery pioneer Harvey Cushing. The creation of the society was spurred initially by R. Glen Spurling and William P. Van Wagenen who, with Cushing, acknowledged the need for a venue in which younger neurosurgeons could exchange ideas on the specialty. Membership to the Society of Neurological Surgeons, the specialty's key organization during this period, was closed to younger men at this time. Spurling and Van Wagenen enlisted the help of Temple Fay and R. Eustace Semmes in the creation of the group, and on May 6, 1932, the Harvey Cushing Society held its first meeting in Boston. Twenty-three people attended, many of whom were Cushing's colleagues and neurosurgical trainees. Other charter members of the society were Gilbert Anderson, Paul C. Bucy, W. Edward Chamberlain, Leo M. Davidoff, Louise Eisenhardt, Edgar Fincher, John F. Fulton, W. James Gardner, William J. German, Franc D. Ingraham, Franklin Jelsma, Edgar Kahn, Roland Klemme, James G.

An editorial board had been established in 1943, and Louise Eisenhardt was named editor-in-chief. * 1967 ‚Äì At its annual meeting in San Francisco, the Harvey Cushing Society changes its name to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). The group also revamps its membership requirements, now noting that only board-certified neurosurgeons could be considered for active membership. Associate memberships are available for those in related neurological disciplines. This same year, the William P. Van Wagenen Fellowship is established to provide educational funding to medical students. * 1969 ‚Äì The association observes the 100-year anniversary of Harvey Cushing's birth by holding its annual meeting in his birthplace of Cleveland and issuing a commemorative stamp via the United States Postal Service. * 1976 ‚Äì A headquarters office is established in downtown Chicago. The office moves to Park Ridge, Illinois in 1984, and subsequently to its current location in Rolling Meadows, Illinois in 2000. * 1988 ‚Äì The United States Postal Service issues an official Harvey Cushing stamp on June 17 as part of its \\"Great Americans\\" 45-cent stamp collection.  Membership  The AANS is composed of board-certified neurosurgeons from around the world as well as medical students, neurosurgical support staff, and physicians in associated fields of practice.  Legislative advocacy Throughout its history, the AANS has taken stances on a number of key legislative issues affecting neurosurgical professionals and their patients. Efforts include patient safety and quality improvement, tort reform, and issues relating to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. In addition to a professional staff office in Washington, D.C., the AANS maintains a member-driven Washington Committee to advocate for a number of causes. Washington staff maintains the Neurosurgery Blog which highlights the latest legislative activities affecting health care and the neurosurgical specialty.  Publications  Since 1944, the AANS has published the Journal of Neurosurgery. In addition, the quarterly AANS Neurosurgeon focuses on \\"issues related to legislation, workforce and practice management.\\" Each issue is centered on different themes, and past themes include humanitarian neurosurgery, neurosurgeons as patients, stereotactic radiosurgery, and neurovascular neurosurgery.  Patient information and public outreach On its website, the AANS presents information relevant to patients regarding a number of neurosurgical ailments and treatments. In addition to its efforts during National Neurosurgery Awareness Week (which is held in conjunction with the AANS Annual Scientific Meeting and heightens public awareness on topics such as stroke), the AANS also spearheads Neurosurgery Outreach Month every August, touting the importance of concussion and head-injury prevention at the start of a new school year and season for student athletes.  Education  The AANS offers its members a number of educational opportunities, mostly through courses held around the country at various times of the year. Topics include practice management, oral board preparation, maintenance of certification, and resident education. Course offerings also extend to mid- level practitioners such as nurses and physician assistants.  Annual meeting  The AANS has held an Annual Scientific Meeting every year since its 1932 inception, except for 1945 when that year's gathering was cancelled due to World War II. Programming includes presentations of neurological studies, seminars, and workshops for practitioners at all levels, and keynote speeches. Past speakers include H. Ross Perot (1987), Colin Powell (1995), George H.W. Bush (1999), Tom Brokaw (2001), Benazir Bhutto (2002), Henry Kissinger (2003), Ken Burns (2004), Walter Isaacson (2013), and Chesley Sullenberger (2013).  Neurosurgical Research and Education Foundation  Established by the AANS in 1981, the Neurosurgery Research and Education Foundation provides funding for training in the neurosciences and support for career neurosurgeons. Through grants and awards, it supports residents and young neurosurgical faculty in conducting basic science, patient-oriented, clinical and outcomes research, as well as outcomes studies that protect and support neurosurgical procedures for all practicing neurosurgeons. It also funds North American and international fellowships in all neurosurgical subspecialties.  Neuropoint Alliance  As an effort led by the AANS with cooperation of other organized neurological associations, the Neuropoint Alliance was founded in 2008 to collect, analyze, and report clinical data from neurosurgical practices. Services include clinical trial management, study design, and survey facilitation. Its first nationwide effort was the National Neurosurgery Quality and Outcomes Database.

In the account of Hellanicus, Xenopatra was additionally counted as one of the children of Hellen and Orseis and thus, technically the sister of Dorus.Hellanicus in scholia on Plato, Symposium, 208 (p. 376) According to Clement, he was the son of Protogenia and Zeus and thus brother of Aethlius.Clement of Alexandria.

Centuries later, the figure of Dorus was invoked by Diodorus Siculus in the common way to explain the presence in Crete during the historical period of Dorian cities of mixed population: > The third peopleAfter Eteocretans and Pelasgians. to cross over to the > island, we are told, were Dorians, under the leadership of Tectamus the son > of Dorus; and the account states that the larger number of these Dorians was > gathered from the regions about Olympus, but that a part of them consisted > of Achaeans from Laconia, since Dorus had fixed the base of his expedition > in the region about Cape Malea.

The event was the culmination of a major raid led by the Seljuq prince Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine-ruled Armenia. A combination of factors meant that the regular Byzantine forces were at a considerable numerical disadvantage against the Turks: the local thematic armies had been disbanded, while many of the professional troops had been diverted to the Balkans to face the revolt of Leo Tornikios. As a result, the Byzantine commanders, Aaron and Katakalon Kekaumenos, disagreed on how best to confront the invasion. Kekaumenos favoured an immediate and pre-emptive strike, while Aaron favoured a more cautious strategy until the arrival of reinforcements. Emperor Constantine IX chose the latter option and ordered his forces to adopt a passive stance, while requesting aid from the Georgian ruler Liparit IV. This allowed the Turks to ravage at will, notably leading to the sack and destruction of the great commercial centre of Artze. After the Georgians arrived, the combined Byzantine‚ÄìGeorgian force gave battle at Kapetron (modern Hasankale). In a fierce nocturnal battle, the Christian allies managed to repel the Turks, and Aaron and Kekaumenos, in command of the two flanks, pursued the Turks until the next morning. In the centre, however, Inal managed to capture Liparit, a fact of which the two Byzantine commanders were not informed until after they had given thanks to God for their victory. Inal was able to return unmolested to the Seljuq capital at Rayy, carrying enormous plunder. The two sides exchanged embassies, leading to the release of Liparit and the start of diplomatic relations between the Byzantine and Seljuq courts. Emperor Constantine IX took steps to strengthen his eastern frontier, but due to internal infighting the Turkish invasions did not recommence until 1054. The Turks experienced increasing success, aided by the renewed diversion of Byzantine troops to the Balkans to fight the Pechenegs, disputes between the various ethnic groups of the eastern Byzantine provinces, and the decline of the Byzantine army.  Background  After the conquest of territories in present-day Iran by the Seljuq Empire, a large number of Oghuz Turks arrived on the Byzantine borderlands of Armenia in the late 1040s. Eager for plunder and distinction in the path of jihad, they began raiding the Byzantine provinces in Armenia. At the same time, the eastern defences of the Byzantine Empire had been weakened by Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (), who allowed the thematic troops (provincial levies) of Iberia and Mesopotamia to relinquish their military obligations in favour of tax payments. The Seljuq expansion westward was a confused affair, as it was accompanied by a mass migration of Turkish tribes. These tribes were only nominally subjects of the Seljuq rulers, and their relations were dominated by a complex dynamic: while the Seljuqs aimed at establishing a state with an orderly administration, the tribes were more interested in plunder and new pasture lands, and launched raids independently of the Seljuq court. The latter tolerated this phenomenon, as it helped to defuse tensions in the Seljuq heartlands. A first large-scale raid against the eastern Byzantine province of Vaspurakan may have been undertaken around 1045 by Qutalmish, a cousin of the Seljuq ruler Tughril Beg. Qutalmish defeated and captured the local Byzantine commander, Stephen Leichoudes. Another large-scale invasion, under Tughril's nephew, Hasan the Deaf, was launched soon after from Tabriz into Georgia. Returning via Vaspurakan, Hasan's army was ambushed and destroyed east of Lake Van by the local Byzantine commanders, the katepano of Vaspurakan, Aaron, and the katepano of Ani and Iberia, Katakalon Kekaumenos. This first raid is variously dated either to 1045/46 or 1048. An even larger invasion followed, under Ibrahim Inal, the half-brother of Tughril Beg. The Byzantine sources regard this as a retaliation for Hasan's defeat, but as Anthony Kaldellis points out, there were other factors at play as well: Ibn al-Athir reports that Ibrahim had at this time received a large number of recent Oghuz arrivals from Transoxiana, and that, unable to provide for them, sent them to raid the Byzantine provinces of Armenia, promising that he would soon follow with his own troops. The events of this campaign are well attested through the histories of the Armenian historians Aristakes Lastivertsi and Matthew of Edessa, and the Byzantine official John Skylitzes. Ibrahim's invasion is usually dated by modern sources to 1048 although some date it to 1049.  Seljuq invasion and Byzantine reaction  Emperor Constantine IX, mosaic from the Hagia Sophia Skylitzes reports, with obvious exaggeration, that the invaders numbered 100,000 men, or five times as many as Hasan's force. He also adds the detail that alongside the Turks, the Seljuq army also counted many \\"Dilimnites\\" (Daylamites) and \\"Kabeiroi\\" (probably Khurasani Iranians). Indeed, Skylitzes mentions that Ibrahim had two lieutenants, one \\"Chorosantes\\" (possibly a corruption of Khurasani), who likely commanded the Khurasani contingent, and \\"Aspan Salarios\\", clearly a hellenisation of the Persian military rank ispahsalar. Like the previous raid, the Seljuq force most likely set out from Tabriz and, following the course of the Araxes River, entered Vasurakan. Ibn al-Athir reports that raiding detachments reached as far as Trebizond in Chaldia and the Akampsis river in the north, and the districts of Taron and Chorzianene in the south, but this probably refers to the Oghuz raiders Ibrahim had sent out, rather than the main part of his army. Ibrahim's main army raided the district of Basean, and the area between Theodosiopolis, Artze, and the district of Mananalis. On the Byzantine side, Skylitzes records a difference of opinion as to how to counter the Seljuq invasion: Kekaumenos‚Äîwho was probably one of the historian's main sources and is generally lionised by Skylitzes‚Äîreportedly argued that they should confront them as soon as possible, while they were still weary from their march and the Byzantines were in high spirits after their recent victory. Aaron, on the other hand, argued in favour of a defensive strategy against such a large army, recommending withdrawing behind their fortifications and conserving their forces until Emperor Constantine IX sent clear instructions. It is clear that the Byzantines were considerably outnumbered, likely as an effect not only of the reduction of the eastern provincial troops under Constantine IX, but also due to the diversion of much of the tagmatic troops (standing, professional forces) to deal with a revolt of the western armies under Leo Tornikios in 1047. As a result, Aaron's view prevailed; messages were sent to Constantinople to inform the Emperor, and in the meantime the Byzantine troops made camp on the plain of Outrou in Basean, while the civilian population was ordered to find refuge in the local fortresses. Indeed, Emperor Constantine IX quickly sent orders that they should avoid action until the arrival of reinforcements, namely the Georgians of Liparit IV, Duke of Kldekari, to whom the Emperor wrote requesting his aid. = Sack of Artze = The Byzantine army's inactivity had tragic consequences, as the Seljuqs were able to move about freely, and attack the fortress of Artze, a wealthy market town which attracted merchants from Syria and Armenia. The inhabitants resisted successfully for a while, as the Seljuqs could not overcome the barricades they had hastily erected; but Kekaumenos' urgings to go to the town's aid were rebuffed, according to Skylitzes, by his fellow generals on account of the Emperor's order. Finally, the Seljuqs dropped flammable material and torches into the town, so that the defenders, caught between a raging fire and the Turkish archers, broke and fled. The town was captured and plundered, and its inhabitants massacred; Skylitzes writes that \\"around 150,000 souls reportedly perished\\" by sword or by fire, although this number is clearly exaggerated. Battle Battle between Byzantines and Muslims in Armenia in the mid-11th century, miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes manuscript Once Liparit IV arrived with his army, the combined Byzantine‚ÄìGeorgian army moved from Ourtrou to the plain before the fortress of Kapetron (modern Hasankale). Ibn al-Athir claims that the Byzantine‚ÄìGeorgian troops numbered 50,000 men, while Aristakes Lastivertsi raises the number to 60,000. Just as with the Turkish army, both figures are clearly exaggerated. Again, according to Skylitzes, Kekaumenos' advice to attack the isolated Turkish detachments as they arrived was not heeded, because it was a Saturday (18 September) and Liparit considered it an unlucky day and refused to fight. This gave time for the Turks to bring up their entire army and form battle lines, before advancing on the Byzantine‚ÄìGeorgian army, which now was forced \\"to prepare to give battle, willy-nilly\\". Kekaumenos commanded the right wing, faced on the Turkish side by Ibrahim himself. Liparit held the centre, faced by Aspan Salarios, while the Byzantine left was commanded by Aaron, who was faced by Chorosantes. The battle began late in the evening, and lasted through the night. Aaron and Kekaumenos, in command of their respective flanks, each defeated the Turks and pursued them \\"till cock's crow\\", killing the Turkish commander Chorosantes in the process. In the centre, however, Ibrahim managed to capture Liparit, who was thrown off his horse when it was wounded. This was not known to the two Byzantine commanders, who thought the Georgian prince was pursuing the enemy as they were; they were not informed of the true events until after they had stopped their pursuit to give thanks to God for their victory. Matthew of Edessa, whose narrative is heavily anti-Byzantine, claims that Liparit was betrayed by the Byzantine commanders, while Aristakes claims that the rivalry between the Byzantine commanders led Aaron to abandon his position mid-battle, leading to Liparit's capture. Skylitzes' account, however, being far more detailed, is considered more reliable by modern scholars. While Ibrahim managed to escape with his men and captives to the fortress of Kastrokome (Okomi), some 40 km east of Theodosiopolis, the Byzantine commanders held a council of war and decided to divide their forces and return to their respective bases: Aaron with his men returned to Vaspurakan, and Kekaumenos with his forces to Ani. The overall result of the battle was thus mixed: while the Byzantines prevailed against their Turkish counterparts, the capture of Liparit and the successful escape of Ibrahim led many of the medieval sources to consider it a Byzantine defeat.  Aftermath  Political map of the Caucasus region According to Skylitzes, Ibrahim returned to Rayy in only five days, presenting himself before his brother. Ibn al-Athir reports‚Äîwith obvious exaggeration for propaganda purposes‚Äîthat Ibrahim brought back 100,000 captives and a vast booty, including large numbers of horses, flocks, and goods, as well as 8,000 coats of mail, loaded on the backs of ten thousand camels. The devastation left behind by the Seljuq raid was so fearful that the Byzantine magnate Eustathios Boilas described, in 1051/52, those lands as \\"foul and unmanageable... inhabited by snakes, scorpions, and wild beasts\\". The Muslim sources on the other hand, follow the conventions of jihad narratives in stressing the success of the campaign in reaching deep into Byzantine territory‚Äîallegedly only 15 days' march from Constantinople‚Äîand the amount of plunder and captives seized. These successes were widely publicized to serve political aims: taking up the mantle of jihad against the age-old enemy of Islam legitimized the upstart Seljuqs and bolstered their claims to be the pre-eminent power in the Muslim world, particularly in their chosen role as champions of Sunni orthodoxy against the Shi'a Fatimid Caliphate. Emperor Constantine IX lamented Liparit's capture, and tried to secure his release, offering a rich ransom. The Seljuq ruler set Liparit free and gave him the ransom, after extracting a pledge from him not to fight against the Turks again. Tughril‚Äîperhaps swayed by his brother's claims that the campaign had been an unalloyed success‚Äîalso sent a sharif to Constantinople to demand tribute of Constantine IX, but the envoy was sent back empty-handed. Constantine IX did, however, agree to allow Tughril to sponsor the restoration of the mosque of the Byzantine capital, and to have the names of the Abbasid caliph al-Qa'im and of Tughril himself commemorated in the Friday prayer instead of the Fatimid caliph's. Expecting an imminent resumption of Seljuq raids, the Emperor sent agents to fortify his eastern border, but Tughril was occupied for a time with the revolt of Ibrahim, instigated, according to Skylitzes, by the Seljuq ruler's jealousy of the achievements of his brother. This is likely also the moment when the Byzantines launched an offensive, under the rhaiktor Nikephoros, against their old adversary, Abu'l-Aswar Shavur ibn Fadl, the Shaddadid emir of Dvin. Nevertheless, the Byzantine defences in the east were weakened again as troops were transferred to the Balkans to face the invasions of the Pechenegs, which began at that time. The Seljuq raids recommenced on a large scale in 1054, with Tughril himself leading them: the cities of Paipert and Perkri were sacked, and Manzikert was besieged. The Turkish incursions continued, with increasing success, as the native Byzantine troops were run down by neglect from the central government, increasingly replaced by unreliable mercenaries, and misguided policies exacerbated the rivalries and disputes between Byzantine Greeks, Armenians, and Syriacs in the Empire's eastern provinces. As the balance of power turned, the Seljuqs began capturing major urban centres in Armenia, notably Ani. This set the stage for the calamitous Battle of Manzikert in 1071, which opened the way for the Turkish invasion and conquest of Asia Minor in the following decade.

T2 Laboratories Inc. was a facility that specialized in the design and manufacture of specialty chemicals primarily for gasoline additives. The explosion's force was equivalent to detonating 1,400 lbs of TNT and it spread debris up to a mile from the plant. Following the explosion, every HAZMAT unit in Jacksonville and over 100 firefighters fought the ensuing blaze, which a spokesman termed a \\"hellish inferno\\". The blast killed Robert Scott Gallagher; Charles Budds Bolchoz, 48; Karey Renard Henry, 35; and Parrish Lamar Ashley, 36. At the time of his death, Gallagher was Marketing Director for T2 Labs. The company laid off its workers and shut down in the following months. Fourteen people were hospitalized for chemical exposure or their injuries after the blast. In September 2009, a report was released by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board as to the cause of the accident.http://www.csb.gov/UserFiles/file/T2%20Final%20Report.pdf The explosion occurred in a 2500-gallon batch reactor during production of methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT). The reactor cooling system, which lacked backups, failed; this led to a thermal runaway. Pressures rapidly reached 400 PSI, bursting the rupture disc, but it was too late. Nearby witnesses described a jet engine like sound as high pressure gases vented from the reactor. At the same time pressure increased in the reactor, temperatures also increased in the reactor until the MMT reached its decomposition temperature. The pressure and temperature continued to increase until the reactor violently ruptured and the MMT exploded, destroying the reactor. Damage from the explosion was severe enough that 4 buildings in the immediate vicinity of the plant were condemned .

B√©nard specialized in experimental fluid dynamics, and the use of optical methods to study it. He was a faculty member at the universities at Lyon, Bordeaux, and finally the Sorbonne in Paris.See Wesfried (2006). B√©nard defended his PhD thesis at the Coll√®ge de France on March 15, 1901 entitled \\"Les Tourbillons cellulaires dans une nappe liquide propageant de la chaleur par convection en r√©gime permanent\\". B√©nard was elected President of the French Society of Physics (SFP) in 1929, following the presidency of Louis Lumi√®re.Bulletin des S√©ances de la Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Physique vols. 255-271. He was succeeded as President the next year by his friend and former teacher, Jean Perrin. In 1929 B√©nard received the Bordin Prize for his work on vortices from the French Academy of Sciences.Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des S√©ances de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences, vol. 189, p. 1161 (1929). After his death in 1939, his widow received the Poncelet Prize on his behalf, also from the French Academy of Sciences.Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des S√©ances de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences, vol. 209, p. 918 (1939). A research center of the ERCOFTAC in Lyon is named after him.http://www.lmfa.ec-lyon.fr/Henri.Benard Life and career=Early and student years= Henri B√©nard was the only son of a small investor, Felix A. B√©nard (1851‚Äì1884), and his wife H√©l√®ne M. Mangeant (1837‚Äì1901).Wesfreid (2006, p. 9); C. Charle and E. Telkes (1989). Les Professeurs de la Facult√© des Sciences de Paris: Dictionnaire Biographique 1901‚Äì1939 (INEP √âditions du CNRS), pp. 33‚Äì34. He attended elementary school in Lisieux and Caen and high school at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. In 1894, B√©nard was one of 17 students selected from 307 candidates to attend the √âcole normale sup√©rieure (ENS) in the sciences section. His classmates there included Henri Lebesgue and Paul Langevin,Wesfried (2006). and one of his teachers was Jean Perrin.Bull. Soc. Franc. Phys., vol. 271, pp. 5S‚Äì6S. B√©nard received his teaching degree in physics in 1897, and then began working as an assistant to √âleuth√®re Mascart and Marcel Brillouin at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris. At this time, B√©nard joined the French Society of Physics (SFP).Chevenard (1939). B√©nard's initial scientific efforts related to the optical rotation of sugars, resulting in papers co-authored with MascartE. Mascart and H. B√©nard (1899). Sur le pouvoir rotatoire du sucre. Ann. Chim. Phys., series 7, vol. 17, pp. 125‚Äì144. and ENS chemistry student L.-J. Simon.L.-J. Simon and H. B√©nard (1901). Sur les ph√©nylhydrazones du d glucose et leur multirotation. Compt. Rend. Acad. Sci. vol. 132, pp. 564‚Äì566. The first of these was an experimental measurement of the angle of rotation of polarized light by pure sugar in solution, to determine its concentration for use in saccharimetry, undertaken at the request of the Commission on Sugars and Alcohols, of the Ministry of Finances. B√©nard's results were adopted as the legal values in France by the Ministry of Finances.H. B√©nard (1926). Notice sur les Titres et Travaux Scientifiques de M. Henri B√©nard (Gauthier- Villars, Paris), Sec. 1. Meanwhile, Marcel Brillouin was teaching a course on the viscosity of liquids and gases, and asked B√©nard to repeat Poiseuille's experiments on water flow rates in capillary tubes.H. B√©nard (1926). Notice sur les Titres et Travaux Scientifiques de M. Henri B√©nard (Gauthier-Villars, Paris), Sec. 2. However, Brillouin also wanted experiments done with mercury instead of water. B√©nard's results (undertaken in the first 6 months of 1899) were summarized in 1907 in Brillouin's textbook based on the course.M. Brillouin (1907). Le√ßons sur la Viscosit√© des Liquides et des Gaz (Gauthier- Villars, Paris), vol. 1, pp. 152‚Äì154. Brillouin also supervised the translation into French of Boltzmann's textbook on kinetic theory of gases, by B√©nard and Alexandre Gallotti.L. Boltzmann (1905). Le√ßons sur la Th√©orie des Gaz (Vol. 2, Gauthier-Villars, Paris), translated by A. Gallotti and H. B√©nard, with an introduction and notes by M. Brillouin. The subject of B√©nard's dissertation was cellular thermal convection, inspired by accidental observations made by Adrien Guebhard of convection in a bath of abandoned film developer. Working in Mascart's lab, B√©nard carried out the first controlled, systematic scientific experiments on convection in a shallow layer of fluid heated from below.E.L. Koschmieder, 1993: B√©nard Cells and Taylor Vortices (Cambridge University Press). He found that the convective motions organized themselves in semi-regular, semi-permanent cellular patterns. Upflows occurred in the centers of the cells and downflows occurred at their peripheries. There was also a slight depression of the upper free surface of the fluid at each cell center, leading B√©nard to speculate about the role of surface tension. He also measured the aspect ratio of the cells and discovered that there was a critical temperature below which no convection occurs. Unfortunately, he attributed this to the solidification of the fluid he was using (spermaceti, a whale oil that is solid at room temperature). Ironically, B√©nard would much later become a skeptic about the very concept of the critical temperature difference, although he discovered it.E. L. Koschmieder, 1993: B√©nard Cells and Taylor Vortices (Cambridge University Press).H. B√©nard, 1931: Discussion of A. R.

In Proceedings of the Third International Congress for Applied Mechanics (1930), Vol. 1. Stockholm: Ab. Sveriges Litografiska Tryckerier, p. 120. In 1900‚Äì1901, B√©nard presented the results of this work (and the associated optical methods) in four different journals, the Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des S√©ances de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences,H.

He also presented his findings to at least two scientific meetings,H. B√©nard, 1900. Comptes-Rendus de l'Association Fran√ßaise pour l'Avancement des Sciences, Congr√®s de Paris (1900), pp. 446‚Äì467; H. B√©nard, 1900. S√©ances de la Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Physique, ann√©e 1900, pp. 202‚Äì213. as well as in the first thesis of his dissertation. (The second part of his thesis dealt with optical rotation in sugars.) This work laid the foundation for the study of Rayleigh‚ÄìB√©nard convection, the buoyancy-driven flow of fluid confined between horizontal conducting surfaces, with the higher temperature at the bottom; and B√©nard‚ÄìMarangoni convection, the surface- tension-driven flow of a fluid with an upper free surface and a heated, conducting surface at the bottom. These problems have continued to occupy scientists beginning with Lord Rayleigh and continuing into the 21st century. B√©nard spent two months as a high-school teacher in Cherbourg (Oct.-Nov. 1900) before acquiring a pension from the Thiers Foundation (Nov. 1900‚ÄìApril 1902). He defended his dissertation on March 15, 1901, at the age of 26, and was awarded the Docteur √®s Sciences physiques, mention tr√®s honorable. His dissertation committee consisted of Gabriel Lippmann, Edmond Bouty, and √âmile Duclaux. In September 1901, B√©nard attended the conference of the British Association at Glasgow, where he observed a number of notable British physicists, such as Lord Kelvin, Silvanus P. Thompson, Andrew Gray, and Joseph Larmor.H. B√©nard, 1900: Controverse sur la question des effets magn√©tiques de la convection √©lectrique au congr√®s de l'Association Britannique, a Glasgow. J. Phys., series 3, vol. 10, pp. 517‚Äì519. Unfortunately, an \\"excess of modesty\\" (B√©nard's own wordsB√©nard (1926), p. 30.) prevented him from showing the results of his work to Lord Kelvin in Glasgow, as well as at the earlier Paris conference.H. B√©nard, 1900. Comptes-Rendus de l'Association Fran√ßaise pour l'Avancement des Sciences, Congr√®s de Paris (1900), pp. 446‚Äì467. Kelvin's late brother, James Thomson, had studied thermal convection qualitatively prior to B√©nard's work. On December 23, 1901, B√©nard married Cl√©mentine Olga Malh√®vre, a few months after his mother's death; they had no children.Wesfried (2006), p. 13. =Lyon= B√©nard was appointed a senior lecturer at the university at Lyon (1902), in charge of introductory courses.Wesfried (2006), p. 13. Despite his teaching load, in 1904 he began experimental studies of vortex shedding behind an obstacle; the work was carried out in a cellar.Schereschewsky (1976). In 1906 he began using a cinema camera to record these phenomena. Initial publications of this work occurred in 1908,H. B√©nard, 1908. Compt. Rend. vol. 147, pp. 839‚Äì842, 970‚Äì972. but the films would not be fully utilized until the 1920s. Nonetheless, Benard's experimental work in Lyon was the beginning of his contribution to the study of what we now call the K√°rm√°n vortex street. =Bordeaux= In 1910, B√©nard moved to Bordeaux, where he was now a professor and chair of general physics. One of his colleagues there was Pierre Duhem.Wesfreid (2006), p. 13. B√©nard continued to study vortex shedding, analyzing the Lyon films to measure the wavelength and frequency of vortex shedding as other parameters are varied, such as the flow speed and the geometry of the obstacle. He also made films of thermal convection. Also in 1910, B√©nard began collaborating with Camille Dauz√®re (1869‚Äì1944), who became a key collaborator in B√©nard's fluid dynamics research. Dauz√®re studied the problems of thermal convection and solidification, prompting B√©nard himself to revisit the topicH. B√©nard, 1911. Ann. Chim. Phys., series 8, vol. 24, pp. 563‚Äì566. and even speculate, based on Dauz√®re's work, that the lunar craters may have been formed by thermal convection and solidification.H. B√©nard, 1913. Compt. Rend., vol. 156, pp. 882‚Äì884. Henri Deslandres had also noticed the analogy with lunar craters, as well as pointing out (correctly, as it turns out) a further analogy with solar granulation.H. Deslandres, 1912. Compt. Rend., vol. 154, pp. 976‚Äì977. In 1913‚Äì1914, B√©nard and Dauz√®re made a series of eight films, on convection and solidification in an evaporating fluid, which were produced with the aid of a large firm, the Gaumont studio.H. B√©nard and C. Dauz√®re, 1914: Notice sur une s√©rie de films obtenus dans les laboratoires Gaumont, juillet‚Äìoctobre 1913. Soci√©t√© des √âtablissements Gaumont. Also in these years, the two scientists received subsidies from the Bonaparte Fund, administered by the French Academy of Science, for their research.Compt. Rend., vol. 157, pp. 250, 1311‚Äì1312 (1913); vol. 159, p. 941 (1914). Dauz√®re completed his Ph.D. in 1919 in Paris, after spending a year doing solidification experiments under Charles Fabre in Toulouse.Wesfreid (2006), p. 19. Dauz√®re then became director of the Pic du Midi observatory in 1920 until his retirement in 1937.E. Davoust, 1997: A hundred years of science at the Pic du Midi observatory. https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9707201v1 In 1919, B√©nard was elected to the Council of the University of Bordeaux,C. Charle and E. Telkes (1989). Les Professeurs de la Facult√© des Sciences de Paris: Dictionnaire Biographique 1901‚Äì1939 (INEP √âditions du CNRS), pp. 33‚Äì34. and he began publishing the results of his wartime work (see next section). =World War I= The First World War provided a change of emphasis for B√©nard's research. He was placed in charge of a study of the question of transporting frozen meat in refrigerated wagons (1914‚Äì1916), and subsequently joined the Commission Sup√©rieure des Inventions de Guerre in Paris, and the Physics Section of the Direction des Inventions (both appointments between 1917‚Äì1919).H. B√©nard (1926). Notice sur les Titres et Travaux Scientifiques de M. Henri B√©nard (Gauthier-Villars, Paris), p. 4. He later became the Chief of the Physics Section. His conclusions from the frozen meat project were adopted, and around a million tons of frozen meat were transported in refrigerated wagons, during a four-year period, to various French army fronts.H. B√©nard (1926). Notice sur les Titres et Travaux Scientifiques de M. Henri B√©nard (Gauthier-Villars, Paris), sec. 5. B√©nard was assisted in this work by an ENS student, Pierre- Michel Duffieux, who later (during World War II) founded the field of Fourier optics. B√©nard's own war work on optics involved various systems of lenses, with applications to wide-angle photography; the use of polarized light for the improvement of the visibility of distant objects; and the conditions of the visibility of submarine wakes.H. B√©nard, 1921. Le Bulletin Officiel de la Direction des Recherches Scientiques et Industrielles et des Subventions pour Recherches et Inventions, no. 4, pp. 229‚Äì248, and no. 21, pp. 426‚Äì429.H. B√©nard, 1922: Improvement of visibility of distant objects. Nature, vol. 109, pp. 412‚Äì413. Applications included optical devices for military use, such as for detecting submarine and ship wakes. In 1916, B√©nard met the meteorologist Paul Idrac in Paris. Idrac would later publish experimental observations of convection rolls (consistent with the predictions of Lord Rayleigh).P. Idrac (1920). Compt. Rend. vol. 171, pp. 42‚Äì44; P. Idrac (1921). Etudes exp√©rimentales sur le vol a voile (Th√®se de doctorat, Paris). During the war, B√©nard held the rank of Sergeant of territorial infantry, attached to the Supply Corps.H. B√©nard (1926). Notice sur les Titres et Travaux Scientifiques de M. Henri B√©nard (Gauthier-Villars, Paris), p. 4. He was awarded the Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur (military title) on 14 July 1919 and a similar award (but with civil title) on 10 November 1920. Unfortunately the second award, honoring his invention of polarized binoculars adopted by the French Navy, was annulled due to 'double employment' the next month. =Paris= In 1922, B√©nard moved to the University of Paris, Sorbonne, as senior lecturer in physics. In 1926 he became a full professor, and was teaching introductory physics. Wesfried (2006), p. 14. In the 1920s he continued his work with the vortex streets, determining an experimental law for the frequency in terms of the velocity of the flow, the viscosity of the fluid, and the size of the obstacle; he claimed that his law contradicted the theoretical results of von K√°rm√°n.H. B√©nard (1926). Compt. Rend. vol. 182, pp. 1375‚Äì1377, 1523‚Äì1525; vol. 183, pp. 20‚Äì22, 184‚Äì186, 379.H. B√©nard (1927).

Rend. vol. 187, pp. 1028‚Äì1030, 1123‚Äì1125, 1300. In this period, a priority dispute over the discovery of vortex shedding erupted between B√©nard and von K√°rm√°n, detailed at length by Wesfreid.Wesfreid (2006), pp. 23‚Äì27. Meanwhile, B√©nard again revisited his work on thermal convection, claiming agreement between his results and the theory of Lord Rayleigh.H. B√©nard (1927). Compt. Rend. vol. 185, pp. 1109‚Äì1111, 1332, 1257‚Äì1259. B√©nard led conferences in 1927‚Äì1928 at the Sorbonne regarding alternating eddies and cellular eddies.Schereschewsky (1976). In 1928 B√©nard was elected President of the French Society of Physics (SFP), and in that position interacted with a number of important contemporaries such as Louis de Broglie, Paul Langevin, Dimitri Riabouchinsky, and Pierre Weiss.Bull. SFP, vols. 255‚Äì271. Benard had been an SFP member since 1897. One of B√©nard's principal concerns at the SFP was to increase the membership of the society, in particular among engineers and technicians.

In 1929, the French Aeronautics Ministry established an Institute of Fluid Mechanics at the Sorbonne (headed by Henri Villat), and appointed B√©nard to be the director of its Fluid Mechanics Laboratory and to the Chair of Experimental Fluid Mechanics.Schereschewsky (1976). He gave the inaugural address for the laboratory in November.H. B√©nard (1929). La m√©canique exp√©rimentale des fluides. Revue Scientifique, vol. 67, pp. 737‚Äì747. In December, B√©nard received the Bordin Prize from the French Academy of Science, in honor of his work on eddies.Compt. Rend., vol. 189, pp. 1161 (1929). The list of the prize committee members makes interesting reading: Appell, Painlev√©, Lecornu, Hadamard, Goursat, Lebesgue, and Picard. In 1935, B√©nard was appointed head of the section on atmospheric convection of the Commission on Atmospheric Turbulence, organized by the French Air Ministry, and headed by Phillipe Wehrl√©.Schereschewsky (1976); Duson Avsec (1939). Thermoconvective eddies in air; application to meteorology. Scientific and Technical Publications of the Air Ministry, Works of the Institute of Fluid Mechanics of the Faculty of Sciences at Paris, no. 155. Meanwhile, he had already been joined by a number of students: Duson Avsec, Michel Luntz, C. Woronetz, H. Journaud, Victor Volkovisky, Paul Schwarz, V. Romanovsky, and G. Sartory among others.Schereschewsky (1976); Wesfried (2006). These students studied thermal convection in various regimes, including electroconvection, surface tension- driven convection, etc. B√©nard himself returned to the question of convection on the solar photosphere (solar granulation) in 1935.H. B√©nard (1935). Compt. Rend. vol. 201, 1328‚Äì1330. In 1937, B√©nard was placed in charge of teaching at the √âcole Sup√©rieure de l'A√©ronautique.Schereschewsky (1976).

It had a population of 215 according to the 2011 census. In the 1870s Hulland was described as: :\\"Hulland, a village and two townships in Ashborne parish, and a chapelry partly also in Wirksworth parish, Derby. The village stands on an eminence, 5 miles E by N of Ashborne r. station; and has pleasant environs\\" Hulland should be distinguished from Hulland Ward, an adjacent village and civil parish immediately to its east. Population The population of Hulland has not changed much over the years, in 1881 the population was 202 and in 2011 the population was recorded at 215. The biggest change in population was between 1951 and 1961. Between these years the population dropped by 25. In 2011 The mean age of people in Hulland was 41.2 years of age and the median was 45 years of age. 28.8 percent of the population was aged 45 to 59 in 2011 This is much higher than the Derbyshire district average (23.2 percent), the east midlands average (20 percent)and the national average (19.4 percent). Also in 2011 15.8 percent was aged 30 to 44. Population of Hulland History Hulland parish was a sub parish of the Ashbourne registration district until 1901. Hulland was also an ancient township in Ashbourne parish however became a separate, modern civil parish in December 1886. Church The church which is shared by Hulland and Hulland Ward is an Anglican Christ church. The church was built in 1838 and seats up to 273 people. The church was in the rural deanery of Ashbourne. The churchyard contains one commonwealth war grave from World War One and one common wealth war grave from World War Two. Industry In 1881 the majority of males in Hullund worked in agriculture (35) and one woman worked in agriculture. This was very common for most places in the UK in this era. The 2001 census showed 83 people aged 16‚Äì74 were employed, this number rose to 105 in the 2011 census data. In 2011 the census recorded six males from the ages of 16‚Äì74 working in agriculture and four women aged 16‚Äì74 working in agriculture. the 2011 census also showed 18 people 17.1% of the population work in manufacturing the number of people who worked in manufacturing in 2001 was also 18. This shows how Hulland much like many other places in the UK had a shift from agriculture to manufacturing when it comes to most worked jobs. Housing In 1891 there were 50 houses in Hulland, between 1881 and 1931 the lowest recorded number of houses was 48 in the years 1891, 1921 and 1931 and the highest number of houses recorded was 52 in 1901. In the year 1951 there were 57 houses in Hulland and in 1961 there were 59. This was the start of growth as in 2001 the number of houses in Hulland rose to 69, and in 2011 there was 80 houses in Hulland.

The mission of the SFWMD is to manage and protect water resources by balancing and improving water quality, flood control, natural systems and water supply, covering 16 counties in Central and Southern Florida. It is the largest water management district in the state, managing water needs for 7.7 million residents. A key initiative is the restoration of America's Everglades ‚Äì the largest environmental restoration project in the nation's history. The District is also working to improve the Kissimmee River and its floodplain, Lake Okeechobee and South Florida's coastal estuaries. The Governing Board consists of Daniel O‚ÄôKeefe, Chair; Kevin Powers, Vice Chair; Rick Barber, Sandy Batchelor, Mitch Hutchcraft, James Moran, Juan Portuondo, Timothy Sargent and Glenn Waldman. History In 1947, after years of drought, the state was deluged by rainfall averaging 100 inches along the lower east coast, almost twice the norm. Much of the ground was saturated when two hurricanes hit the state late in the year, and flooding throughout the region was devastating. Florida asked the federal government for a master plan to tame nature's excesses. In 1948, the U.S. Congress adopted legislation creating the Central and Southern Florida (C&SF;) Project, the largest civil works project in the country. Construction began the next year and continued over 20 years as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the massive flood control plumbing system stretching from just south of Orlando to Florida Bay. In 1949, the Florida Legislature created the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District, the predecessor to the South Florida Water Management District, to manage the C&SF; Project. In 1972, with the Florida Water Resources Act (Chapter 373), the state created five water management districts, with expanded responsibilities for regional water resource management and environmental protection. In 1976, voters approved a constitutional amendment giving the districts the authority to levy property taxes to help fund these activities. All five of the state's water management districts' boundaries are determined by watersheds and other natural, hydrologic and geographic features. Today, the South Florida Water Management District is the oldest and largest of the state's five water management districts. A book detailing the first forty years of the South Florida Water Management District titled \\"Into the Fifth Decade\\" was written by Thomas E. Huser.http://sofia.usgs.gov/publications/historical/fcd5decades/fcd5decades.pdf In the year 2000, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan began to undo some ecosystem damage caused by the C&SF; Project. Local Sponsor The SFWMD is the designated local sponsor for the Central and Southern Flood Control Project (C&SF; Project) ‚Äîknown as the Flood Control Act of 1948‚Äîpursuant to ¬ß 373.103(2), Florida Statutes. Operations The regional water management system ‚Äì with nearly 2,000 miles of canals and more than 2,800 miles of levees/berms, 69 pump stations, 645 water control structures and more than 700 culverts ‚Äì helps to protect regional water supplies and provide flood control. Weather extremes dramatically affect South Florida's water supply and flood protection actions. In response, the District actively operates and maintains the water management system, promotes water conservation and works with communities to develop alternative water supplies. The management is currently working to restore water flow to the Everglades. Programs The South Florida Water Management District manages many programs, including the controversial Water Farming program, which results in minimal returns for taxpayers and would be much cheaper on state owned land.

It is distinct from Hulland, the next village and civil parish immediately to its west. Originally, the village consisted of a few dwellings on the coaching road into the Duffield Frith, with the road being gated. This was known as Ward Gate and over the years, due to its proximity to Hulland Village was known as Hulland Wardgate. Sometime in the 17th century, the gate part was dropped, and the hamlet grew into the village now known as Hulland Ward. In the Domesday Survey Hulland Village is listed as Hoilant in the care of Geoffrey d'Alselin. It was part of the lands bestowed upon Henry de Ferrers after the Norman Conquest, and also became part of Duffield Frith, with two enclosed royal parks - Mansell Park and Ravensdale Park.

The professional chemist designation is commonly abbreviated to PChem when added as a suffix after a person's name. The term professional chemist and the actual practice of professional chemistry is legally defined and protected by the government.Professional Chemists Act In some jurisdictions only registered or licensed professional chemists or chartered chemists are permitted to use the title, or to practice professional chemistry. The earmark that distinguishes a licensed/registered professional chemist is the authority to sign and seal or \\"stamp\\" chemistry documents (reports, drawings and calculations) for a study, estimate, design or analysis, thus taking legal responsibility for it. Registration and regulation Each province has specific procedures and requirements for license or registration. Each license is valid only in the province from which it was granted. Many professional chemists maintain licenses in several provinces for this reason. The licensing procedure varies, but the general process is:Ordre des Chimistes du Qu√©bec ‚Äì Adh√©sion * Graduate with a degree from an accredited university program in chemistry * Accumulate a certain amount of experience as a Chemist in Training; this can range from two to five years depending on the province The chemist title The title chemist is legally protected in some provinces, meaning that is it unlawful to use it to offer chemistry services to the public unless permission is specifically granted by that province through a professional chemist license. With legal documentation, this is commonly referred to as the Right to Title. A licensed professional has the option of wearing a Chemists' Ring. Unlicensed practice Since the regulation of the practice of chemistryOrdre des Chimistes du Qu√©bec ‚Äì Ordre is performed by the individual provinces in Canada, areas of chemistry which are an exception to mandatory regulatory requirements are: * A professor teaching chemistry in an accredited program * Military personnel currently actively licensed with the Canadian government Chemists are not registered in a specific discipline but are prohibited by the code of ethics ACPA Ethics & Bylaws from practicing beyond their training and experience. Breaches of the code are often sufficient grounds for enforcement, which may include the suspension or loss of license, as well as financial penalties and now, through recent changes to Canadian law, could also result in jail time should negligence be shown to have played a part in any incident in which there is loss of human life. Some examples of a professional chemist would be an oilfield chemist, drilling fluids chemist, environmental chemist, biochemist, or pharmacist.

As well the best known and more obscure Beat novelists and poets this has included artists, musicians filmmakers and publishers. The content largely consists of articles, memoirs, interviews and reviews. Beat Scene was founded in 1988 by editor and publisher Kevin Ring in Coventry, England. His personal fascination for the Beat Generation, in particular Jack Kerouac, was sparked in 1971, but he was frustrated that information about Beat writers and their books was hard to come by in the UK at that time. Ring and Beat Scene are acknowledged sources in James Campbell's book, This Is the Beat Generation: New York‚ÄìSan Francisco- Paris. (2001). Early issues The first Beat Scene and subsequent four issues were thin A5 booklets. Initially, there were only 200 copies produced and hand assembled on Ring's kitchen table. As well as the principal Beat writers: Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, the magazine has featured Lord Buckley, James Jones, Chet Baker, Richard Brautigan, Lew Welch, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Lenny Bruce, Michael McClure, Ken Kesey, Jack Hirschman, Raymond Carver, Robert Frank, Gregory Corso, Diane Di Prima, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Philip Whalen, Jack Micheline, Carolyn Cassady (who was the first of the magazine‚Äôs interview subjects) and many others. The poet and Kerouac biographer Tom Clark has contributed to the magazine but was also interviewed by Ring.Tom Clark Charles Bukowski was frequently mentioned in the early issues and when issue 9 was in preparation Ring received an unsolicited letter from the Los Angeles based poet and novelist along with a parcel of previously unpublished poems. These were offered for publication at the magazine‚Äôs usual rate, which at the time amounted to a few complimentary copies. Over the years Bukowski continued to contribute poems to the magazine and issue 12 included a flexi-disc of him reading. Bukowski was interviewed by Ring for Beat Scene and its sister magazine, Transit. After Bukowski died in 1994 Ring compiled a memorial issue. There was another special issue in 2004, to mark the tenth anniversary of Bukowski's death. More recently there has been an expanded THE BEATS IN BRITAIN issue of the magazine. Contributors Beat Scene's many regular contributors have included, Jim Burns, Colin Cooper, Brian Dalton, Anne Waldman, David Meltzer, Jack Foley, David Holzer, Jed Birmingham. In December 2006, a special, unnumbered issue was devoted to a new edition of Iain Sinclair's Kodak Mantra Diaries, which included new material and recently discovered period photos.Guardian Alongside the magazine, Ring operates The Beat Scene Press , which specialises in publishing classic Beat interviews or new, longer articles on Beat culture. This includes a series of limited edition chapbooks, usually signed and numbered. Amongst those in the series there has been texts by or about Dan Fante, Snyder, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Bukowski, Clark, Tom Clark, Iain Sinclair, Alan Moore, Joyce Johnson, Gregory Corso, Kerouac, John Clellon Holmes, Lew Welch, Philip Whalen, Philip Lamantia, Peter Coyote, Michael McClure and Richard Brautigan. The number 60 issue was a Jack Kerouac special and there has been a special 'Beats in England' issue. & a William Burroughs special in more recent times. Beat Scene has an occasional companion magazine Transit with contributions from Michael McClure, David Meltzer, Diane di Prima, Joanne Kyger, Janine Pommy Vega, Barry Gifford, Jack Hirschman, Ruth Weiss, Tom Clark.

Klein Rutgers engineer Lisa Klein honored by New York Academy of Sciences  Research  Klein's research focuses on the area of sol-gel science, a low- temperature process for making ceramic coatings. Her most important contribution to science has been the development of electrochromic window coatings that can be lightened or darkened through the use of a dimmer attached to a battery. This window coating is unique because it is manually controlled and can reflect the heat away, while still transmitting light in the summer or permit the solar heat in winter. This new development is more efficient than blinds, curtains, or tinted windows and can save on heating and cooling costs in the home or office.

He is well known for his publications on various subjects such as football, cinema, and non-fiction based on history and social studies.  Early life  His appearances on TV commentating football have been critical to his success and public fame in Iran. He is married to Mehrzad Dolati, and has a daughter, named Ghazaleh Sadr. Sadr's parents are Zahra Karimi and Gholamhossein Sadr. He has two brothers and two sisters. Mashid Sadr lives in London, Shahin Sadr lives in Vancouver, Amir Hossein Sadr lives in Amsterdam, and Mehrnaz Sadr lives in California. Sadr currently lives in Orange County, California near his sister, working on a new book concentrating on his immigration and life, as well as a new translation.  Education  Business Administration in Economics - Tehran University 1980 Master of Business in Urban Planning - Tehran University 1987 Doctorate of Urban Planning - Leeds University 2000 Career Hamid Reza Sadr movie reviews are published in many Iranian journals since 1981 including Zan-e Rooz, Soroush, Film Magazine, Film International, and Haft or Seven magazine. He has explained his critical approach to films as \\"relative, not unconditional\\"; he analysis a film for what he feels will be its likely audience, yet he usually approaches movies emotionally, with a strongly touching writing style. He was especially cruel to some films that had been roasted by many critics, such as Bahram Beizai and Masoud Kimiai films. The originality of his opinions, as well as the vigorous way in which he spoken them, won his eager supporters as well as angry critics. He translated 'From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies\\", the influential book by Molly Haskell which published in Zan-e Rooz magazine. He has written a book on politics and Iranian cinema, called Iranian Cinema: A Political History. The comprehensive analysis provided in this book gives refreshing, up-to-date introduction to those interested in Iranian cinema and its socio-political dimensions and history, observing recurrent themes and genres as well as giving lights to lesser-known thematic concerns and figures. Sadr, while acknowledging the lack of imaginative expression in mainstream Iranian cinema: the weak scripts, the poor performances, the repetitive and conservative nature and content and poor performances, argues for and analysis the political contexts and its constant shifts embedded within the apparently least noteworthy of Iranian films. Sadr was known for his monthly column called \\"Shadow of Imagination\\" {ÿ≥ÿß€åŸá ÿÆ€åÿßŸÑ} appearing in Film Magazine and his reports on international film festival particularly on London Film Festival. He interviewed many famous actors, directors and film critics including: Anthony Hopkins, Peter O'Toole, Mike Leigh, Jim Jarmusch, Carlos Saura, Andrei Konchalovsky, Peter Wollen, Laura Mulvey, Jeffrey Noel Smith, John Gillett, Sohrab Shahid-Sales and Farokh Ghafari. He is a co-producer of Looking for Scheherazade movie, a documentary directed by Safi Yazdanian in 2003. He is a football lover and has written several features on sociology, politics and football. His book Once Upon a Time Football is about politics and football but it also tells the story of the Sadr's relationship with football and sometimes relates them to his own personal life. It has been years now that he appears on the Iranian national television to talk about football matches and thus has become famous among people. =Books= *Comedy Cinema (Tehran, 1987,Film Publication) * Iranian Cinema: A Political History (Tehran, 2001, Ney Publications) *Against the Wind: Politics of Iranian Cinema (Tehran, 2002, Zarrin Publications) *Iranian Cinema: A Political History (London, 2006, I.B.

She is an acclaimed novelist and a founding figure in the field of Postcolonial Studies, internationally recognised for her research in colonial and postcolonial literature and theory. Her main areas of interest include the literature of empire and resistance to empire; sub-Saharan African and South Asian literatures; modernism; migration and diaspora; feminism, masculinity, and identity; nationalism; terrorism; J.M. Coetzee, Katherine Mansfield, and Nelson Mandela; and life writing. With her fiction, Boehmer has established an international reputation as a commentator on the aftereffects of colonial history, in particular in post-apartheid South Africa and postcolonial Britain. Biography Elleke Boehmer was born to Dutch parents in Durban, South Africa, in what she has called the \\"balmy interstitial zone\\" where the littoral cultures of the Indian Ocean meet in an African city.Eve Rosenhaft and Robbie Aitken (eds), Africa in Europe: Studies in Transnational Practice in the Long Twentieth Century. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press (2013), p. 260. She studied towards a degree in English and Modern languages in the Eastern Cape, followed by an incomplete year of studying medicine. In this period, she became profoundly influenced by the Black Consciousness thought of the activist doctor Steve Biko. After a year and a half of teaching English in Mamelodi township, outside Tshwane (formerly Pretoria) in what is now Gauteng, she won a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford. She completed an MPhil degree in English Literature 1900 to the present, followed by a doctoral thesis on gendered constructions of the nation in post- independence West and East African literature, both at St. John's College. In 1990, she published her first novel, the bildungsroman Screens Against the Sky. She taught at St John's College and then at the Universities of Exeter, Leeds, and Nottingham Trent before her appointment as Hildred Carlile Professor of Literature in English at Royal Holloway, University of London. Since 2007, she has held the Professorship of World Literature in English at the University of Oxford. Boehmer has been a Fellow of the English Academy since 2005. In 2019 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and in the same year a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.\\"RSL Elects 45 new Fellows and Honorary Fellows\\", The Royal Society of Literature, 25 June 2019. Boehmer is married, and has two sons. Postcolonial criticism and theory Boehmer's work has been seen as foundational to the field of Postcolonial Studies. In her first book, Colonial and Postcolonial Literature: Migrant Metaphors (1995, 2nd edn 2005), Boehmer provides a radically historicising survey of global anglophone literary production from the 1830s, the period of the so-called second empire, to the present, and critically examines key arguments, terms, and problems in anti-colonial thought and postcolonial theory. Her central argument is that rather than simply being a reflection of social and political reality, literature is actively engaged in processes of colonisation, decolonisation, and post-independence national identity formation, all, in many respects, ‚Äútextual undertaking[s]\\".Elleke Boehmer, Colonial and Postcolonial Literature: Migrant Metaphors. Oxford: Oxford University Press (2005), p. 5. After tracing the textual construction of empire through a series of close literary readings of popular genres (such as the missionary and explorer travelogue, the adventure romance, the imperial Gothic tale, and the Victorian ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù novel) and writers (including Joseph Conrad, Rudyard Kipling, Olive Schreiner, D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, and T. S. Eliot), she then explores how writers like Chinua Achebe, Wilson Harris, Jamaica Kincaid, Ben Okri, and Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o have navigated the dialectic of colonial history and post-independence nationalism through their attention to questions of lost cultural heritage, fragmented memory, hybridity, and language. She closes by turning to contemporary women's, indigenous, and migrant postcolonial literatures, and makes the crucial argument that, despite criticisms of such writing for being oriented towards Western markets, \\"the audacious crossing of different perspectives in post-imperial writing can work as an anti-colonial strategy\\".Boehmer, Colonial and Postcolonial Literature (2005), p. 236. Thus articulating a middle-ground between \\"cosmopolitan\\" and \\"local\\" or \\"context-based\\" approaches in Postcolonial Studies, Colonial and Postcolonial Literature suggests a fruitful new direction in the field while offering a now canonical overview of its literatures, theories, and histories. In her second book, Empire, the National and the Postcolonial, 1890‚Äì1920: Resistance in Interaction (2002), Boehmer builds on the historicising and textual approach developed in her first. There, she narrows down her historical focus to 1890‚Äì1920, and explores the \\"interdiscursive\\" and \\"intertextual\\" links between various anti-colonial, nationalist, and modernist groups of the period.Elleke Boehmer, Empire, the National and the Postcolonial, 1890‚Äì1920: Resistance in Interaction. Oxford: Oxford University Press (2002), p. 3. Her individual case studies include Irish support for the Boers in South Africa, the partnership of the Irishwoman Sister Nivedita and the Bengali spiritual guru Aurobindo Ghose, Sol Plaatje's conflicted South African nationalism, and the cross-border, cosmopolitan involvements of W. B. Yeats, Rabindranath Tagore, and Leonard Woolf. Thus aiming to swivel the conventional postcolonial axis of coloniser and colonised \\"laterally\\" by examining \\"the 'contact zone' of cultural and political exchange [‚Ä¶] between peripheries\\", this book has contributed substantially to the \\"swiveling\\" of Postcolonial Studies towards its current emphasis on \\"minor transnationalism\\" (Shu-mei Shih, Francoise Lionnet), \\"peripheral modernities\\" (Neil Lazarus), and other related areas.Boehmer, Empire, the National and the Postcolonial (2002), pp. 1, 2. The postcolonial critic Stephen Slemon has hailed the book as \\"a brilliant analysis of lateral cross-culturalism in the moment of high modernism\\", adding that the book \\"changes our understanding of imperial dialectics\\" and that \\"The map of postcolonial resistance theory will have to be redrawn\\".Boehmer, Empire, the National and the Postcolonial, back cover. Stories of Women: Gender and Narrative in the Postcolonial Nation (2005), Boehmer‚Äôs third monograph, seeks to intervene in current postcolonial discourses that treat gender as ‚Äúsubsidiary to the category of race‚Äù.Elleke Boehmer, Stories of Women: Gender and Narrative in the Postcolonial Nation. Manchester: Manchester University Press (2005), p. 7. Boehmer contends that gendered, especially patriarchal, forms have been habitually invoked ‚Äúto imagine postcolonial nations into being‚Äù, and that ‚Äúconstructions of the nation in fiction and other discourses are differentially marked by masculine and feminine systems of value‚Äù.Boehmer, Stories of Women (2005), p. 4. Focusing on Africa and South Asia, and critically engaging with theorists such as Benedict Anderson, Fredric Jameson, Partha Chatterjee, and Frantz Fanon, she traces such gendered constructions and deconstructions in a range of texts by, among others, Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, Chinua Achebe, Ben Okri, Arundhati Roy, Manju Kapur, and Tsitsi Dangarembga. Stories of Women definitively positions the question of gender and its literary embodiments as central to that of postcolonial national identity. Nelson Mandela: A Very Short Introduction (2008), is a study in political leadership and charisma that pointedly raises the question of why Mandela‚Äôs story should remain so important to us today. Beyond merely providing a short biography of the South African icon, this Introduction outlines his multiple national and international resonances as ‚Äúa universal symbol of social justice [‚Ä¶], an exemplary figure connoting non- racialism and democracy, [and] a moral giant\\".Elleke Boehmer, Nelson Mandela: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford: Oxford University Press (2008), p. 1. Through the figure of Mandela, Boehmer thus draws out a profoundly humanist, ethical vision of a global justice-to-come. Indian Arrivals, 1870-1915: Networks of British Empire (2015) explores the lives of Indian writers, politicians, reformers, evangelists, students and seamen travelling to Britain, in the period between the opening of the Suez Canal and the First World War. It was awarded the European Society for the Study of Literature Prize for Best Book on Literatures in the English Language in 2016.See http://essenglish.org/book-awards-2016/. Unlike previous studies, Indian Arrivals focusses especially on the journey (that rite of passage wherein \\"eastern identity crystallizes yet is in part left behind\\"); on the shaping influence of Indian migrants on late Victorian cultural life; and on the tentative, asymmetric nature of the British-Indian encounter which, in spite of preconception and misunderstanding, reaches haphazardly towards a state of dialogue. Figures discussed in the book include the lawyer, Cornelia Sorabji, as well as reformers and politicians like B.M. Malabari and Dadabhai Naoroji. But the negotiation of identity through poetry, as performed by Toru Nutt, Sarojini Naidu, Manmohan Ghose, and Rabindranath Tagore is given particular attention. While preparing the manuscript, Boehmer served as Co-Investigator on a four-year research and public education project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, titled ‚ÄúSouth Asians Making Britain‚Äù. Postcolonial Poetics: 21st-Century Critical Readings (2018) is about contemporary reading practices, and how they shape our understanding of, relationship to, and place in the world. Drawing on a range of postcolonial literatures from southern Africa, West Africa, and Black and Asian Britain, and featuring close readings of novels, poems, essays, and memoirs / autobiographies by prominent contemporary writers, it presents reading as an imaginative, engaged act of border-crossing and empathic identification. Postcolonial literatures, Boehmer argues, are particularly suited to evoking such a response due to their characteristic interest in margins, intersections, subversions, and crossings. In so doing, they not only prompt new consideration of, but also actively draw readers into issues such as resistance, reconciliation, survival after terror, and migration, some of the most urgent of our time. In addition to her monographs, Boehmer has edited or co-edited several notable volumes of postcolonial literature and criticism. Empire Writing: An Anthology of Colonial Literature 1870‚Äì1918 (1998) features a wide-ranging selection of fiction, poetry, travel writing, memoirs, and essays by British, native, and settler writers during the period of high empire. The British best-seller Scouting for Boys (2004) by Robert Baden- Powell, the blueprint for the Boy Scout movement, includes an influential critical introduction by Boehmer as well as her in-depth contextualising notes. Max Hastings hailed the edition as a \\"gripping read\\". J.M. Coetzee in Theory and Context (2009), edited with Robert Eaglestone and Katy Iddiols, comprises critical essays on the 2003 South African Nobel Laureate by a range of leading scholars and novelists. Terror and the Postcolonial (2010), edited with Stephen Morton, seeks, through its array of critical essays, to bring the phenomenon of terrorism into the purview of Postcolonial Studies by assessing literary and cultural representations from the colonial period to the present. The Postcolonial Low Countries: Literature, Colonialism, and Multiculturalism (2012), edited with Sarah de Mul, does the same for Dutch and Belgian post/colonial history and literature, and opens up the new field of neerlandophone Postcolonial Studies. Planned Violence: Post/Colonial Urban Infrastructure, Literature and Culture (2018), edited with Dominic Davies, brings the insights of social geographers and cultural historians into a critical dialogue with literary narratives of urban culture and theories of literary cultural production, and explores new ways of conceptualizing the relationship between urban planning, its often violent effects, and literature. Taken as an interrelated whole, Boehmer‚Äôs research has not only helped shape the fields of global imperial history and Postcolonial Studies, but has also opened up crucial new directions for the future of both. Fiction Boehmer has identified with the term ‚Äúwriter-critic‚Äù, a phrase originally intended by J. M. Coetzee to marry with equal emphasis his two reciprocal and commutual vocations. Fiction and criticism have occupied her in tandem since 1990, when she entered her first tenured academic post at Leeds University two months after publishing her debut novel. Screens Against the Sky is a bildungsroman that registers the scrutiny of nation, and of self, performed by the generation of writers born in the aftermath of the Sharpeville Massacre (1960) and raised in the time of the Soweto Riots (1976), with Black Consciousness thought ascendant.Dorothy Driver, \\"Southern Africa\\", in Claire Buck (ed.), The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature. London: Bloomsbury (1992), p. 196. The epigraphs to the novel are, significantly, from Doris Lessing and Steve Biko. It is the story of a young woman who constructs her social identity through story, diary, and recalcitrance. Like the protagonist of Nadine Gordimer's Burger's Daughter (1979), she also aims to uphold her political commitments while seeking personal fulfilment as a medical volunteer. Among its many reviews, Screens Against the Sky has been described as \\"An astonishing debut [‚Ä¶] swift, deft [‚Ä¶] expertly told\\" (The Sunday Times), \\"A brilliant handling of an obsessional mother-daughter relationship\\" (The Financial Times), and \\"A beautifully authentic insight into a society turned in on itself in the face of black deprivation\\" (Wendy Woods). The novel was shortlisted for the David Higham Prize in 1991. The politics of gender and race also concern Boehmer's second novel, An Immaculate Figure (1993). The model heroine Rosandra White, the immaculate white figure of the title, is viewed and used as a blank slate upon which a series of male admirers, an 'uncle', an international arms trader, and a revolutionary, seek to inscribe their interests and desires. As with Screens Against the Sky, An Immaculate Figure was well received by critics and audiences, being described as \\"a very clever book indeed\\" (The Guardian) and a novel of \\"remarkable restraint and subtlety\\" (West Africa). Bloodlines (1997), Boehmer's third novel, opens a dialogue between contemporary South Africa and an episode in its colonial history, to explore the theme of truth and reconciliation. The novel follows a journalist Andrea Hardy whose partner dies in a Durban bomb blast, interleaving her bereft search for truth with an epistolary story drawn from involvement of Irish nationalists on the Afrikaner side at the siege of Ladysmith (1899‚Äì1900). Her investigation leads her first to the bomber's mother and then into his family's \\"Coloured\\" ancestry‚Äîa genealogy on which, however, the two women retain separate narratorial perspectives.Sue Kossew, Writing Woman, Writing Place: Contemporary Australian and South African Fiction. London: Routledge (2004), p. 138. The novel, described by J. M. Coetzee as ‚Äúan engrossing and intriguingly told chapter in anti-imperial history‚Äù, was supported by an Arts Council Writer‚Äôs Award, and was shortlisted for the Sanlam Prize. People of mixed racial heritage are defined in Bloodlines in terms of their interrogatory relationship to the past. They ‚Äúknow history isn‚Äôt straight‚Äù, a meandering motif which is reprised archaeologically in the riverine locale of Boehmer‚Äôs fourth novel.Elleke Boehmer, Bloodlines. Cape Town: David Philip (2000), p. 103. Nile Baby (2008) is a story of migrancy grounded within a carefully drawn English suburban pastoral, where the unearthing of a Nubian skeleton in a Roman grave testifies to the ancient but unacknowledged legacy of Africans in Europe.Justine McConnell, ‚ÄòCrossing Borders: Bernardine Evaristo‚Äôs The Emperor‚Äôs Babe‚Äô, Callaloo: A Journal of African Diaspora Arts and Letters 39.1 (Winter 2016), 104. The narrative revolves around two children who ‚Äúliberate‚Äù a century-old foetus preserved in the specimen collection of their school laboratory. Sensing that they have stirred a ghost, they embark on \\"a strange and often unsettling odyssey across England\\" (Times Literary Supplement) in search of its rightful resting-place. During their journey they are helped by a series of adults who each (although its true origin is never confirmed) identify the baby as African, and who invest its fate with their own stories. Boehmer has described the novel as a dialogue not only with two of the writers most important to her, Joseph Conrad and Chinua Achebe, but also with the women who gave interviews to her on miscarriage.Rosenhaft and Aitken (eds), Africa in Europe, p. 249. The novel, extensively and positively reviewed, has been taught in English schools. Boehmer‚Äôs characteristic fluency in interweaving the personal with the political also undergirds her fifth and most recent novel, The Shouting in the Dark (2015), which won the Olive Schreiner Prize in 2019 and was long-listed for the Sunday Times Barry Ronge prize. Like Screens Against the Sky and Bloodlines, the novel traces a young woman‚Äôs trajectory of redemptive self-discovery against the violence of both the family and the nation. Set in and near Durban during the 1970s, the narrative revolves around the protagonist‚Äôs relationships with her abusive father and her neurotic, ineffectual mother. The title derives from a crucial, early scene in which the former is glimpsed shouting obscenities into the night sky: In Braemar, once night falls, strange wild cries leap from the father‚Äôs mouth. Swaddled in a scarf of Rothman‚Äôs Plain smoke, he sits on the verandah as if keeping watch, a tumbler of brown liquid on the rattan table beside him. The words he once spoke to the starry sky in his ordinary voice, back on the porch in Durban, now come out as shouts, raw noises that tear at his smoker‚Äôs lungs. ‚ÄòIdioot,‚Äô he shouts, ‚ÄòKlootzak! Keep on, now, keep on!‚Äô The mother leaves him to it. After dinner she goes straight to their bedroom, tugs the door closed behind her with a click.Elleke Boehmer, The Shouting in the Dark. Dingwall, Inverness: Sandstone Press (2015), p. 12. As she matures into a young woman, Ella must navigate both physical violence and the weight of wartime memory, Dutch heritage, European colonial history, and the racial ideology it carries in order to forge her own independent identity and subjectivity. Reminiscent of the story of John in Coetzee's Boyhood, Ella's story is of resilience in the face of oppression, one that charts the growth of a creative, political, and profoundly human consciousness. Coetzee himself has described The Shouting in the Dark as a ‚Äústory, as disturbing as it is enthralling, of a girl's struggle to emerge from under the dead weight of her father's oppression while at the same time searching for a secure footing in the moral chaos of South Africa of the apartheid era‚Äù. As Ashley Davis concludes in her review for The Scotsman, The Shouting in the Dark is a ‚Äúdense, disturbing but ultimately optimistic book‚Äù.Ashley Davis, ‚ÄúThe Shouting in the Dark, Elleke Boehmer‚Äù, The Scotsman (29 October 2015). http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/book- review-the-shouting-in-the-dark-elleke-boehmer-1-3842136#ixzz3orhppUb4 A new, Australian edition of the novel was brought out by UWA Publishing in February 2019. Summarizing the significance of her literary output, the noted postcolonial critic Simon Gikandi has argued that Boehmer's novels are often about heroines trapped in their privileged worlds and closed off from the larger political world around them. These novels are driven by a powerful rhetoric of failure and their characters struggle with the limits set by a world they find difficult to name or transcend, yet one that they cannot identify with. In her novels, as in her academic work in postcolonial literature, Boehmer constantly works to overcome the culture of guilt that has been associated with liberal white South African writers and to think through the possibility of making black consciousness itself a part of white writing. While her novels are often about the enclosures of a privileged white culture, their characters strive to define themselves against the political movements associated with Steve Biko and the black consciousness movement of the 1970s.Simon Gikandi, \\"Boehmer, Elleke\\", in Simon Gikandi (ed.), The Routledge Encyclopedia of African Literature. London: Routledge (2003), p. 72. In 2010, Boehmer published a collection of short stories, Sharmilla, and Other Portraits. A second collection entitled To the Volcano, and other stories is forthcoming in 2019. 'Supermarket Love', which appears in the second volume, was commended for the Australian Book Review's Elizabeth Jolley Short Story Prize.

The disjunction is between appearance and the reality behind the appearance \\"making itself perceptually manifest to someone.\\" Veridical perceptions and hallucinations are not members of a common class of mental states or events. According to this theory, the only thing common to veridical perceptions and hallucinations is that in both cases, the subject cannot tell, via introspection, whether he is having a veridical perception or not. Disjunctivists claim this because they hold that in veridical perception, a subject's experience actually presents the external, mind-independent object of that perception. Further, they claim that in a hallucination there is no external object to be related to, nor are there sense-data to be a part of the perception. Thus, disjunctivism is a form of naive realism (also commonly known as direct realism). Disjunctivism was first introduced to the contemporary literature by Michael Hinton, and has been most prominently associated with John McDowell.J. M. Hinton, Experiences: An Inquiry Into Some Ambiguities, (1973).J. McDowell, \\"Criteria, Defeasibility and Knowledge\\", Proceedings of the British Academy 68 (1982), pp. 455-479. It has also been defended at length by Duncan Pritchard. Disjunctivists often hold that an important virtue of their view is that it captures the common sense idea that perception involves a relation to objects in the world.M.G.F Martin, \\"On Being Alienated\\" in T.

It would have established compulsory guidelines for any government policy in Fiji over the coming years. The People's Charter was due to be completed and come into force prior to the scheduled 2014 general election. A draft version of the Charter was released to the public in early August 2008. Input from the public was to be received in August and September. Council member Filimoni Kau stated that objections would be considered, but that the Charter would go ahead in any case. Context The People's Charter was the brainchild of interim Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, head of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, who overthrew the elected Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase in December 2006. Bainimarama alleged that Qarase was corrupt and racist, and declared that a People's Charter was necessary in order to prevent corruption and racism within future elected governments. Content and aims of the Charter=Stated objective= In April 2007, a draft version of the Charter was published.\\"Building a Better Fiji for All through a People's Charter for Change and Progress\\" , Fiji government website, April 2007 The draft, intended as a general presentation of the future Charter's aims, began with a statement that \\"Fiji‚Äôs politics and overall governance have been dominated by and deeply mired in divisive, race-based politics, policies, and institutions\\". Consequently, the text authors state, \\"Fiji needs to become a more progressive and a truly democratic nation; a country in which its leaders, at all levels, emphasize national unity, racial harmony and the social and economic advancement of all communities regardless of race or ethnic origin.\\" The overall objective of the Charter is defined as follows: :To rebuild Fiji into a non-racial, culturally-vibrant and united, well-governed, truly democratic nation that seeks progress, and prosperity through merit-based equality of opportunity, and peace. Much emphasis is laid on the necessity to prioritise national unity over the politics of separate ethnic communities. In August 2008, shortly before the Charter was due to be released to the public, it was announced that it recommended a change in the name of Fiji's citizens. If the proposal were adopted, all citizens of Fiji, whatever their ethnicity, would be called \\"Fijians\\". At present, the word \\"Fijian\\" does not denote a nationality, and refers exclusively to indigenous Fijians. Citizens of Fiji are referred to as \\"Fiji Islanders\\". The proposal would change the English name of indigenous Fijians from \\"Fijians\\" to itaukei, the Fijian word for indigenous Fijians.\\"Charter proposes common Fijian name\\", August 4, 2008 Archbishop Petero Mataca summed up the Charter by saying it would \\"reinforce the quality and sustainability of democracy in Fiji\\" and \\"provide a clearer vision of the principles and values we want to live by\\".\\"'Charter will not replace Fiji Constitution'\\" , FijiLive, January 16, 2008 =Short-term consequences= Commodore Bainimarama said that the People's Charter would prevent any candidate for the 2009 general election from campaigning on racist and divisive policies. Such candidates would be barred from taking part in the election. :\\"That will be taken care of by the charter so if anybody with Qarase-like policies comes in, the charter will automatically remove them.\\" Fiji's coup leader 'to bar PM from poll', Sydney Morning Herald, 18 October 2007. Asked by a journalist whether Qarase would be allowed to take part in the election, Bainimarama said he would: \\"That is also in the commitment we had yesterday and that was [sic] always been there\\".see reference note 2 In May 2008, Bainimarama added that the military would enforce future governments' compliance with the provisions of the Charter.\\"Agree With Charter Or No Elections\\", FijiVillage, May 22, 2008 =Methodology= The Charter was prepared by a National Council for Building a Better Fiji (NCBBF), supposed to be \\"broadly representative of Fiji society (including leaders and representatives from the civil society including NGOs, the private sector, religious and community organisations, employers/workers and youth organisations, and the political parties)\\". The NCBBF held its first meeting on January 16, 2008.

The monitoring group was chaired by Sela Molisa, a member of the Parliament of Vanuatu. Reverend Amy Chambers is also a member of the monitoring group.\\"Vanuatu MP to monitor charter\\" , Fiji Times, June 12, 2008 The NCBBF itself is composed of three task teams, one (co-chaired by Ratu Josefa Serulagilagi and Attorney General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum) tasked with focusing on good governance, another (co-chaired by Ratu Josateki Nawalowalo and Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry) on economic growth, and the third (co-chaired by Loraini Tevi and Health Minister Dr. Jiko Luveni) on \\"social cultural identity and nation building.\\"\\"Flawed democracy\\" , Fiji Labour Party website, July 23, 2008 On June 24, 2008, the NCBBF made several recommendations, all of them in line with Bainimarama's original aims. These included: * abolishing communal electoral rolls, and replacing them with proportional representation * abolishing compulsory voting * reducing the voting age to 18 * new anti- discrimination laws.\\"Fourth NCBBF communique\\" , Fiji government press release, June 24, 2008 The NCBBF advocated implementing electoral reforms before holding any election. A representative of the Council stated: \\"The NCBBF is of the firm view that change is long overdue and that Fiji urgently needs a new electoral system based on equal suffrage - that is one person, one vote, equal value.\\"\\"No Fiji vote 'before electoral reform'\\", AAP, June 24, 2008 On August 5, 2008, the NCBBF announced that it had endorsed a draft Charter document, which was to be released shortly thereafter. Fijilive reported that the NCBBF planned to \\"gauge the views of the people on the draft Charter via a public awareness campaign over the next six weeks\\". Meetings would be held in public venues, the Charter would be advertised in the media, and there would be \\"consultations by public relations teams at grassroots level in all the villages and settlements throughout the country\\".\\"NCBBF endorses draft Peoples‚Äô Charter\\" , Fijilive, August 5, 2008 Implementation It was unclear how the People's Charter would be officially implemented. The interim government announced that the public would be consulted, but no official reference to a referendum was made. Legally, if the Charter was deemed to alter the Constitution, it could only be adopted by a two-thirds majority of elected members of Parliament, which was not in session, having been dismissed after the coup.\\"Charter will end ethnic dominance\\", Sydney Morning Herald, August 7, 2008 Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who opposed the Charter, however, stated that a referendum would constitute legal validation.\\"Qarase: Let people decide\\", Fiji Times, August 8, 2008 In the end, the abrogation of the Constitution in 2009 made the question redundant, and much of the essence of the People's Charter was included in the new constitution promulgated by the interim government in 2013. =Content= The People's Charter was released to the public on August 6, 2008. Among its key proposals were the following:\\"People‚Äôs Charter Insight\\", Fiji Daily Post, August 7, 2008 * addressing the root causes of coups through political, social and economic reform; * toughening the sanctions against coups; * building \\"conflict resolution mechanisms for groups and individuals affected by coups\\"; * empowering courts to penalise or dissolve political parties which \\"engage in activities that breach important values of the constitution\\"; * establishing \\"civic programmes to raise public awareness about the injustice and illegality coups and issues of democracy and good governance\\"; * ensuring a separation between Church and State; * enhancing and facilitating \\"public participation in all aspects of governments\\"; * enacting a Code of Conduct for government leaders; * reforming land legislation to facilitate general access to land use, while maintaining and enhancing indigenous landowners‚Äô rights; * officialising the military's role in overseeing the governing of the country; * introducing a one-man, one-vote electoral system, to replace the communal electoral rosters. In addition, specific proposals aimed at promoting national unity and reducing inter-ethnic divisiveness:\\"Charter proposes common name\\" , Fiji Times, August 7, 2008 * changing the official demonym of Fiji's inhabitants from \\"Fiji Islander\\" to \\"Fijian\\", a term currently applied only to indigenous Fijians; * promoting interfaith dialogue; * teaching both the Fijian language and Hindi in schools, so as to promote multiculturalism; * instituting a national anthem in the country's three main languages: Fijian, Hindi and English. Criticism and support=Prior to publication= The proposed Charter received strong support from the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Fiji, Archbishop Petero Mataca, who became co-chair (with Commodore Bainimarama) of the National Council for Building a Better Fiji. However, others were more cautious, noncommittal or openly critical. Fiji Women's Crisis Centre coordinator Shamima Ali declined to comment. Fiji's Citizens Constitutional Forum continued to oppose the military coup, calling it unjustifiable, but in response to the proposed Charter, said there is \\"a serious need to re-look at problems to find solutions to move the country forward\\".\\"Launch of the National Council for Building a Better Fiji\\" , Citizens Constitutional Forum, October 10, 2007 The National Federation Party and the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua Party both opposed the idea of a People's Charter implemented by an unelected government.\\"People's Charter for Change and Progress launched\\", Losalini Dulakiverata, 11 October 2007 Fiji‚Äôs Methodist Church, to which a majority of indigenous Fijians belong, also opposed the Charter, stating that it had been instructed by God to do so. The Fiji Labour Party supported it.\\"Labour supports reforms to the electoral system\\" , Labour Party website, July 23, 2008 The Fiji Council of Churches offered cautious support, urging people not to oppose it outright, and suggesting that it provided \\"a window of opportunity for the nation to move forward\\". Samisoni Pareti of the magazine Islands Business expressed doubt as to whether elections could be held as promised in early 2009 if the interim government insisted on having the People's Charter in place before the election. In Pereti's view, the Charter would not be completed in time, and Bainimarama might have to choose between postponing the election (and thus sparking the ire of the international community) or abandoning his People's Charter.\\"Polls to be Deferred? Either that or the People's Charter an exercise in futility\\" , Samisoni Pareti, Islands Business Pareti's prediction turned out to be accurate: the election was postponed.\\"No Elections in Fiji in 2009 says Bainimarama\\" , Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, July 18, 2008 By contrast, New Zealander human rights activist Thakur Ranjit Singh expressed public support for the People's Charter, stating that fresh elections alone would not address the \\"fundamental problems in Fiji\\", such as \\"the agenda of the nationalists who want Fiji for Fijians and Fiji as a Christian state\\" or a \\"culture of corruption, nepotism and cronyism\\"; the People's Charter must therefore, in Singh's view, be implemented before any election takes place. The responses of Indo-Fijian cultural and religious organisations were mixed. The Hindu organisations Arya Pratinidhi Sabha and Sanatan Dharam Pratinidhi Sabha supported the process and agreed to take part in the NCBBF. By contrast, Sangam, an organisation representing South Indians, refused to do so, as did the Fiji Muslim League, describing itself as non-political. On an individual basis, prominent Indo-Fijians such as Shamima Ali, Brij Lal, Imrana Jalal, Wadan Narsey and Richard Naidu refused to support the Charter.\\"One hand clapping: Reflections on the first anniversary of Fiji‚Äôs 2006 coup\\", Brij V. Lal, in Jon Fraenkel, Stewart Firth and Brij V. Lal (eds.), The 2006 Military Takeover in Fiji: A Coup to End All Coups?, April 2009, In March 2008, an editorial in the Fiji Daily Post commented that \\"a one-sided ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Charter‚Äô for Fiji may not have the ameliorative effect its enforcers hope for.

Lal, in Jon Fraenkel, Stewart Firth and Brij V. Lal (eds.), The 2006 Military Takeover in Fiji: A Coup to End All Coups?, op.cit. The Pacific Islands Forum supported the proposed Charter.\\"Forum recognizes People‚Äôs Charter: Fiji‚Äôs PM\\" , Radio Fiji, 20 October 2007 In April 2008, a Fiji Times opinion poll found that public opinion was evenly split, with 46.2% disagreeing with the idea of the Charter, and 45.8% supporting it.\\"Majority say no to Charter, but 'ayes' close behind\\", Fiji Times, April 15, 2008 The poll was taken in the context of a public debate over the Charter, during which it was supported by Joseva Serulagilagi (Chairman of the Tailevu Provincial Council), Lorine Tevi (President of the Fiji Council of Social Services), and Pundit Kamlesh Arya (President of the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of Fiji), and opposed by Wadan Narsey (Professor of Economics at the University of the South Pacific), Richard Naidu (Senior Partner at the Munro Leys law firm) and Tupou Draunidalo (Former Vice- President of the Fiji Law Society).\\"The People's Charter for Change, Peace & Prosperity is good for Fiji - Media Council Forum Debate\\" , Fiji Times =After publication= The People's Charter was released to the public on August 6, 2008. Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase was critical of its content. He dismissed as \\"unreasonable\\" its proposal to dissolve political parties which \\"engage in activities that breach important values of the Constitution\\". Qarase also opposed the proposed change in the country's demonym, which would enable all citizens of Fiji to refer to themselves as \\"Fijians\\": \\"That term [Fijian] is embedded into the indigenous population. It is a very sensitive issue and it will be opposed very strongly.\\"\\"Charter won't end coups: Ousted PM\\" , FijiLive, August 7, 2008 Qarase stated that the Charter made a number of good suggestions, but that it would, on the whole, increase inter-ethnic tensions. He stated that \\"[s]ome of the key proposals in the charter, if implemented without the approval of an elected parliament, would be contrary to the provisions of the 1997 Constitution.\\"\\"People's Charter 'will divide Fiji'\\", Fiji Daily Post, August 8, 2008 He called upon the Charter to be voted on by an elected Parliament, and, alternately, suggested a referendum to decide the issue. He added: :\\"The composition of the NCBBF is not representative of the people. It is biased in favour of the Labour party, the New Alliance Party, the interim Government and coup supporters. The intention of the interim Government to implement proposed electoral changes before the elections would be illegal and in contravention of the 1997 Constitution. [...] The intention of the IG to make the charter binding on future elected governments without the authority of Parliament would be illegal and contrary to democratic principles.\\" Ousted Opposition leader Mick Beddoes also expressed his opposition to the Charter. The Fiji Labour Party, whose leader Mahendra Chaudhry is a member of the interim government, officially supported the Charter. Academic Brij Lal, one of the authors of the Constitution, described the Charter as \\"too prescriptive\\", commenting that it appeared to aim at creating an unfeasible utopia. He added: \\"I think that for the charter and some of the recommendations to have credibility, they have to be endorsed through parliament.\\" The Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma confirmed its opposition to the Charter, both because it originated from a government that came to power by force (despite influential leaders of the Church having openly supported the coups of 1987 and 2000\\"Tribal chiefs critical of coup\\", Sydney Morning Herald, December 7, 2006), and because the Church deemed it to be \\"an illegal, dangerous document that, if followed, will have a negative impact on the lives of Fiji citizens\\".\\"Fiji church maintains stance against People's Charter\\", August 27, 2008 Following a Church conference, Church general secretary Reverend Tuikilakila Waqairatu told the media: :\\"While the charter proposes some noble principles, the Conference is of the view that the interim government and the National Council for Building a Better Fiji do not have any moral or legal authority to impose it on the people. [...] [A]ny attempt to impose and legitimise the charter outside the Constitution and by an authority which does not have the people's mandate is morally unacceptable. It defies God's authority because it lacks any legal basis and it limits the free choice of the people to act according to their conscience.\\"\\"Charter unlawful: Church\\", Fiji Times, August 27, 2008 The National Federation Party called upon citizens to boycott the charter consultation process, claiming that the Charter would disadvantage Indo-Fijians. Referring to the proposed abolition of the communal voting system, to be replaced by a \\"one man, one vote\\" electoral process, party secretary Pramod Rae stated: :‚ÄúWe‚Äôre alarmed at the proposal to disenfranchise [sic] large sections of the Indo-Fijian community, which will really be left without representation in parliament. Currently our community is guaranteed 19 seats in parliament. This charter proposal proposes to remove those.‚Äù Ousted Vice-President and lawyer Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi sought to take a balanced and cautionary view: :\\"There is a critical need for dialogue and engagement in fora in which the interim government and its political opponents can participate without preconditions. The National Council for Building a Better Fiji (NCBBF) can continue to develop the principles for a charter for good government. But there has to be another means for finding common ground. The onus is upon the regime, as the party holding the reins of power, to engage. Without this, the country will continue to drift, as divided and fractured as ever, with a charter and a new electoral system being imposed, and the constitution abrogated to allow the implementation of both. The implications, both internally and internationally, hardly bear thinking about. The tragedy is that many beneficial features in both the proposed charter and the electoral system would be discounted because of the manner of their implementation. :The NCBBF must proceed with haste on the drafting of the charter. Given the determination of the commander and the military to implement what emerges from the consultations, so be it. [...] Let us see what emerges. The debate will centre on how the principles to be enshrined in the document are to be incorporated in the constitution. If the interim government wishes to force it and a new electoral system upon us, they have the backing of the military to silence dissent. But a new dispensation pushed on the people of this country will not be sustainable. In the long term, the will of the people will prevail.\\"\\"Creating a stable Fiji\\", Joni Madraiwiwi, in Jon Fraenkel, Stewart Firth and Brij V. Lal (eds.), The 2006 Military Takeover in Fiji: A Coup to End All Coups?, April 2009, Jone Dakuvula, of the Citizens' Constitutional Forum, commented favourably on the Charter: :\\"The ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Charter‚Äô is an attempt to build a stronger liberal and secular republican democratic framework in a multi-ethnic state that continues to be dominated by an ethno-Fijian nationalism. [...] The hardline pursuit of ethno-nationalist policies during the five years that the SDL and Conservative Alliance‚ÄìMatanitu Vanua (CAMV) were in power sharpened conflicts within the indigenous Fijian community [...]. The draft People‚Äôs Charter is an attempt to further reform our liberal/republican state so that the exclusivist tendency of indigenous ethno-nationalism is moderated and reoriented towards a broader concept of a multicultural, multi-ethnic nation state that stresses the civic principles of the nation as the regulator of political discourse and other interactions, thus contributing to the stability needed for overall national development. [...] While, in the last 18 months, the opposition to the interim government has not presented a coherent alternative for the way forward to the people of Fiji, there has at least been a concession that the draft People‚Äôs Charter advances ‚Äònoble principles‚Äô they cannot disagree with. They only disagree with the fact that the draft People‚Äôs Charter has been initiated by a regime they regard as illegal and illegitimate. They have yet to answer the realistic question: Where do we go from here?\\"\\"Ethno-Nationalism and the People‚Äôs Charter\\", Jone Dakuvula, in Jon Fraenkel, Stewart Firth and Brij V. Lal (eds.), The 2006 Military Takeover in Fiji: A Coup to End All Coups?, op.cit. Bainimarama attacked some of his critics, labelling their objections self- serving: :\\"They are trying to hang on to the last straw as we make in-roads in giving a real voice and say to ordinary people in the country. [...] Naturally, there are some power hungry ethno nationalist SDL Leaders and followers, supported by the leadership of the Methodist Church and some chiefs who would not want ordinary people to be empowered in terms of decision making and aspiring for better things in life. They want to continue to remain in power and in the process ensure that the common people remain disenfranchised.\\"\\"Be part of charter awareness, public urged\\", Fiji Times, August 29, 2008 In October 2008, the Fijian Teachers Association objected to a proposal for the Charter to be presented to children at school, describing the idea as \\"propaganda\\".\\"Fiji educators object to teaching People's Charter\\", Australia Broadcasting Corporation, October 16, 2008 Basis for new Constitution In July 2009, Bainimarama announced that his government would introduce a new Constitution by 2013, and that the Constitution would \\"derive its impetus from the recommendations under the Charter\\".\\"Work on Fiji's Constitution to start in 3 years\\" , Fiji Times, July 1, 2009\\"PM Bainimarama - A Strategic Framework for Change\\" , Fiji government website, July 1, 2009 See also * 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat * 2014 Fijian general election ReferencesExternal links * Draft version of the People's Charter (Fiji government website) * Government portal: links to Fiji government documents relating to the Charter * \\"Building a Better Fiji for All through a People's Charter for Change and Progress\\", Fiji government website, April 2007 * \\"Latest development on People's Charter for Change and Progress\\", Fiji government website, 10 September 2007 * \\"Fiji‚Äôs President launches People Charter for Change and Progress\\", Radio New Zealand International, 10 October 2007 * Fiji Times coverage of news related to the Charter * \\"Rumblings of a revolution\\", Hamish McDonald, Sydney Morning Herald, 27 October 2007.

Her research challenges stereotypes that feminists are \\"unattractive, man-haters\\".Study: Feminists are better mates - chicagotribune.com =Implicit Gender Stereotypes= One of Rudman's primary interests is in exploring implicit ways of assessing attitudes, stereotypes, self-concept and identity. Rudman's 2001 paper with Anthony Greenwald and Debbie McGhee used the Implicit-association test to investigate implicit self- concept and evaluative implicit gender stereotypes. This paper discussed several experiments exploring these gender stereotypes, and exploring possible reasons for the stereotypes. Experiment 1 looked at sex differences in gender stereotypes (e.g., men are associated with power and women are associated with warmth). For this experiment, the IAT was used to look at how much male vs female names were associated with power, and how much male vs female names were associated with warmth. The results of this experiment showed an unexpected result that only males associated men with power, and only women associated females with warmth. Experiment 2 showed dramatically reduced sex differences in gender-power judgments when measures were redesigned to avoid implying that power was positive. To do this, Rudman and her colleagues manipulated the valence (positive, negative, or neutral) of words related to power (like strong, solid, and steel) and weak (like weak, thin, and twig), and again used the IAT to measure associations between these words and males and females. As the meaning of these words changed from negative, to neutral, to positive, the difference between male-power associations and female-power associations lessened, showing that the valence of the word made a difference in gender associations. The results of this study showed a stereotype of males being strong from men and women when the valence of the words (strong vs weak etc.) was removed. The results of Experiment 3 and 4 suggest that the sex differences in Experiment 2 were due to the tendency to associated the self with desirable traits. These experiments showed correlations between linking the \\"self\\" to favorable traits, and linking their gender to the favorable traits as well. Despite the unexpected sex differences in evaluative gender stereotypes found in the first study, Rudman published their results which resulted in the Balanced Identity Theory which helps explain the surprising results by theorizing that balance-congruity serves to create links between existing identity associations. For instance, ‚ÄúMe‚Äù is associated with ‚Äúgood‚Äù as well as ‚Äúfemale.‚Äù Since both ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale‚Äù and linked to ‚ÄúMe‚Äù, they will develop a link such that ‚Äúfemale‚Äù is associated more strongly to be ‚Äúgood.‚Äù In the context of Rudman‚Äôs study, women are more likely to associate strength with female since they are female and likely see themselves as strong, so the association between strength and female is stronger. In this way, perceptions and prejudices are biased towards positive conceptions of ourselves. However, this can also promote dissociations for imbalances in self-identity. For instance, stereotypes such as ‚Äúmale-math‚Äù, with their gender identity (‚Äúme-female‚Äù), can lead to dissociations (me ‚â† math) as studied by Nosek, Banaji, and Greenwald (2002).

Known as \\"PBA's Original Showman\\", Salvino won 17 PBA Tour titles ‚Äì- among them the 1962 PBA National Championship where he defeated fellow bowling legend Don Carter in the finals. He also won two PBA Senior Tour titles, including the 1984 Senior National Championship. The right-handed bowler was among the eight original inductees to the PBA Hall of Fame in 1975, and is also a member of the USBC Hall of Fame (inducted 1979), the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame (inducted 1985), the Illinois Sports Hall of Fame, and the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame.  Early life  Carmen Salvino was born in Chicago, Illinois on November 23, 1933 and lived on the city's west side until the age of 5. In order to make a better living during the Great Depression, Salvino's father moved the entire family to Florida where he worked as a vegetable farmer in a job created by President Roosevelt's New Deal Works Progress Administration (WPA) program. During his childhood years, Salvino learned his strong work ethic from helping his father manually plow vegetable fields for long, strenuous work days. Despite the hard work, his family was still very poor. For an entire year, he didn't own a pair of shoes, and for two straight years, he owned only one pair of overalls. After living in Florida for 5 years, the family moved back to Chicago's west side and the young Salvino found work shining shoes on Madison Street. In 1945, at the age of 11, Salvino was introduced to bowling when he was walking down a street in his west-side neighborhood and noticed a bowling pin laying on the ground outside the Amalgamated Center located at 333 S. Ashland. The building was home to Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America labor union and it housed a private 6-lane bowling alley reserved for workers in the garment industry. Peaking his interest, Salvino walked inside the building and talked to a man who oversaw the bowling lanes. In a stroke of luck, he offered the young Salvino a job making three dollars a night as a pin-boy. He then began to practice. The first ball Salvino ever threw was a strike, and it was there, at the Amalgamated Center, that a legend was born. Salvino attended Crane Tech High School on Chicago's west side. At the age of 16, Salvino was averaging 203 (a very high average for the time), and at 17, he joined his high school's first bowling team and averaged 211. According to Salvino, he was the first person to letter in the sport of bowling which at the time was governed by the then American Junior Bowling Congress. Also, while still in high school, he competed in a national tournament called the Dom DeVito Classic where he beat out 6,000 bowlers for the first place prize of $3,000. He then became the youngest bowler ever to compete in The Chicago Classic League, a renowned area competition, and earned the nickname \\"Chicago's Boy Wonder\\". In order to intimidate his opponents, Salvino would wear bib overalls with the statement, \\"I'm great and I'm gonna be the best bowler alive\\" written on the back. According to him, \\"The way to show 'em is to beat 'em, stomp on 'em and let 'em know how good I am. I was hated by the players and the public. After a while I didn't care. I was getting bigger and meaner all the time.\\"  Professional and PBA Career  Carmen Salvino in the 1950s during his early professional career. Carmen Salvino, along with 32 others, was a founding member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA). However, before the PBA's founding in 1958, Salvino began his professional bowling career when in 1953 he won the National Match Game Doubles with his partner Joe Wilman. According to Salvino, ‚ÄúThe National Doubles title really kicked off my career nationally, by the time I was 21, I had won the Chicago Match Game tournament, had an ABC Tournament team title and was Chicago Bowler of the Year, so I was getting a reputation as a pretty good bowler by that time.‚Äù In 1954, Salvino won his first ABC (American Bowling Congress) title; a team event with the renowned squad Tri-Par Radio. Soon after the win, Salvino became a household name when he regularly appeared on televised bowling events, most notably the show \\"Bowling Stars\\". It was on Bowling Stars that he scored 846, which at the time was the highest three-game series ever broadcast on television. In the 1960s, Salvino's career took off. He won 10 PBA titles in that decade, with the first coming in the 1961 Empire State Open in Albany, N.Y. His first and only major came in the 1962 PBA National Championship. Despite all his victories, Salvino listed a loss to his good friend Dick Weber in the finals of the 1988 PBA Showboat Senior Invitational among his most memorable tournaments. Although both Salvino and Weber were original PBA members when the organization was founded, the two had never met in a televised match until this 1988 tour stop. Due to the matches being completed ahead of schedule that day, Salvino and Weber were interviewed at the end of the broadcast and spent several minutes recalling memories of bowling's heyday.\\"The sounds and the furious...\\", article by Carmen Salvino and Dick Denny, Bowling Digest, June, 2003. Salvino has made a number of memorable marks on the sport of bowling throughout his seven decades (1950s-2015): champion, Hall-of-Famer, showman, entertainer, bowling ball scientist in the areas of physics and chemistry, bowling ambassador, as well as bowling health enthusiast. He also served the PBA in various capacities, including executive board and tournament committee positions, plus one term as PBA president (1985‚Äì86). Nicknamed \\"The Professor\\", Salvino claimed in the 1970s to have based his bowling style on a mathematical equation, which he never revealed. The equation covered the bowling stance and ball delivery that stressed accuracy.http://www.sj-r.com/sports/x6415431/Former-Boy-Wonder-Salvino-as- colorful-as-ever Salvino was ranked #17 on the PBA's 2008 list of \\"50 Greatest Players of the last 50 years.\\" The 1999 Bowlers Journal ranking of 20th Century bowlers rated him #34.  Antics On and Off the Lanes  Carmen Salvino is known for his trademark showmanship and colorful behavior on and off the lanes. In 2019, he both bowled in and provided live commentary on the PBA Tournament of Champions.  Later life  Carmen Salvino in 2012 As of 2015, Salvino, along his wife of 60 years, has resided in Schaumburg, IL (USA) for the past 20 years and has remained active in various capacities in the PBA. In a 2013 interview, Salvino stated he has rolled 105 perfect 300 games and practices up to 20 games a session. He credits his in-depth study of physics, good health, and longevity as the primary reasons for his success in the sport. Salvino received a commissioner's exemption to bowl in the Go Bowling! PBA 60th Anniversary Classic, held Feb. 13-18, 2018 in Indianapolis. This made him the oldest player (age 84) to ever participate in a standard PBA Tour event. Though he did not make it out of the qualifying round, Salvino rolled the honorary first ball for the televised finals and got a strike.

She served on the city council of Hampton, Virginia for more than two decades, and became the city's first female mayor, serving from 1963-71 and 1974-78.Virginia General Assembly memorial, House Joint Resolution No. 243 (2002), available at https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi- bin/legp604.exe?021+ful+HJ243ER+pdfThe Virginian-Pilot, Death notices for Sunday, July 22, 2001. Personal life Ann Hitch was born in Portsmouth, Virginia to Edward Ashby Hitch and Marietta Cato Hitch (who was a teacher and principal in Portsmouth). Educated in the local public schools, she graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School, and then the Norfolk Division of The College of William and Mary (now Old Dominion University), and The College of William and Mary. In 1944, she married U.S. Navy engineer (and later NASA aeronautical engineer) Edwin Carroll Kilgore. The couple moved to Hampton, Virginia in 1946 where he worked at the Langley Research Center. They had two children‚ÄîAshby Caroline Kilgore and Elizabeth Kilgore Byrd (husband, Richard Kenneth Byrd) and one grandson, Richard Kilgore Byrd‚Äîbefore her death ended their 57 year marriage. Dr. Ashby Kilgore serves currently as the Superintendent of Newport News Public Schools in nearby Newport News. Career After graduating with a degree in education, Ann Hitch (later Kilgore) became an English teacher in Norfolk County, Virginia. She taught first in her Portsmouth hometown at Alexander Park High School, and later at Hampton High School in Hampton after it was built in 1956. She was also active in the local community, and became president of the Hampton Junior Women's Club from 1955 to 1957. This was during Virginia's Massive Resistance crisis following the United States Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education. Early in the crisis, some African American citizens of Norfolk City sued the public school system to obtain access to the whites-only secondary schools, and in 1956 the Byrd Organization threatened to close all Virginia public schools to prevent court- ordered desegregation (contrary to the wishes of many Norfolk City and County citizens). In 1958, Ann Kilgore ran for one of three open seats on Hampton's City Council, and won. She continued to win re-election until retiring in 1980. In 1963, fellow Councillors elected Ann Kilgore as Hampton's Mayor. She led the city as its mayor from 1963 to 1971 and again from 1974 to 1978. She considered successfully integrating Hampton's schools and businesses without litigation as her greatest accomplishment. Also during her tenure as mayor, the City of Hampton built the Hampton Coliseum, City Hall and police station, and donated land for Thomas Nelson Community College. She also fostered the local tourist industry and improved interracial relations generally as the city tripled in size from fewer than 30,000 citizens to more than 100,000 people. Death and legacy Ann Kilgore died at Riverside Regional Medical Center in Newport News, Virginia on July 20, 2001, survived by her husband, daughters and grandchild. She is buried at Parklawn Memorial Park in Hampton.

It is typically classified as a dialect of Shughni, but is quite distinct. Within Bartangi, there are two (sub)dialects, Basid and Sipandzh, which are named after the villages in which they are spoken. It is not written. As of 1990, there are between 2,500 and 3,000 speakers of Bartangi. While the population continues to grow, civil war and Russian efforts to assimilate the Bartangi or move them to cities have caused the language to dwindle. In addition, the popularity of Tajik and Russian as the languages of education and modernization have contributed to the decline of Bartangi. Bartangi is most similar to Rushani and Orosori, two neighboring Sughni dialects. Features that distinguish them include the form of the second person, a tu tense in Bartangi, and the Bartangi plural suffix -en. Discovery and decline The language was unknown to Europe until the early twentieth century, when French linguist Robert Gauthiot published his findings on the area in his 1916 essay Notes sur le yazgoulami, dialecte iranien des confins du Pamir. After the discovery of the Bartangi people, there was an increase in interest in the Shughni provinces, but due to the difficult landscape, very few explorers visited the area, and publications on the language dropped off, though in 1924 a Bartangi lullaby was printed. The next major European involvement in the area was by the Russians, who over the course of the nineteenth century had conquered parts of Tajikistan until its formal declaration as the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in 1929. Despite Tajikistan declaring independence in 1991, permanent Russian influence in language, culture, and politics have led to the loss of several Pamir languages. Tajik, an Iranian language which is the national language of Tajikistan, serves as a common language through all Tajik provinces. In addition, with a 96% literacy rate throughout the province, even the isolated region of Bartang is well-versed in the national languages of Tajik, Uzbek, and Russian. Russian is currently the language of education and the intelligentsia in Tajikistan, and the influence of these larger languages are required for communication between speakers of the various Pamir languages. War has also contributed to substantial decline of the Shughni languages, and Bartangi is no exception. World War II, conflicts between Shughni villages, and the civil war which ravished the province from 1992 to 1997, all contributed to the diminishing status of the language. In addition to wiping out portions of the population, the war forced many of the Pamir inhabitants out of their native lands and into cities, where their languages are of little use. The 1950s also saw massive resettlement of Bartang people, though the population has been increasing since 1959. ReferencesFurther reading *Zarubin, I.I.. Bartangskie i rushanskie teksty i slovar.

Early years The ship was constructed as a single-deck motor vessel named FV Fanejord, built from pine and oak for the Norwegian herring fishing trade. While being a motorised vessel, her masts and booms normally used for cargo handling were capable of being rigged for sailing in an emergency. She was purchased by the American explorer and aviator, Lincoln Ellsworth, for his 1933 Antarctic expedition, refitted and sheathed with oak and armour plate, and renamed Wyatt Earp after the marshal of Dodge City and Tombstone, Arizona. Wyatt Earp was used on four of Ellsworth's Antarctic expeditions between 1933 and 1939, primarily as a base ship for his aircraft. Mount Wyatt Earp, discovered on Ellesworth's trans-Antarctic flight of Nov. 23, 1935 in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, is named for the ship. Navy service In February 1939, Wyatt Earp she was purchased from Ellsworth by the Government of Australia and handed over to the RAN, which intended to use the ship as a Fleet Auxiliary (Ammunition and Store Carrier). In September 1939, it was decided to rename her Boomerang, but the name was already in use by another Australian vessel. Instead, the ship was commissioned on 25 October 1939 as Wongala, an Australian Aborigine word meaning boomerang. Wongala made one trip as a Royal Australian Fleet Auxiliary, leaving Sydney on 14 November 1939 bound for Darwin with a cargo of stores. On return to Sydney in January 1940, she was laid up pending future employment, but was reactivated and moved to Port Adelaide in South Australia, where she served with the Examination Service until late 1943. From November 1943 to March 1944, Wongala served as Guard Ship at Whyalla, South Australia, whilst also patrolling off Port Pirie and Wallaroo. In late March 1944, Wongala arrived at Port Adelaide to await disposal, and was paid off on 19 July 1944. =Cadet service= Before her disposal, the Minister for the Navy received a request in March 1945 from the South Australian Branch of the Boy Scouts Association, that the ship be made available for Sea Cadet training. =Antarctic service with the Navy= Preparations for sailing for Antarctica from Williamstown, Victoria, 19 December 1947 In February 1947, the Scouts Association was notified by the Department of the Navy that the Federal Government was considering renewing Antarctic exploration. The Association was requested to return the vessel, which was inspected to determine her suitability for conversion to an Antarctic exploration vessel. The conversion was approved, and in June 1947, prior to her impending voyage to the Antarctic, it was decided to recommission the ship under the name she had used during her previous visits to the Antarctic with explorer Lincoln Ellsworth. The ship was recommissioned on 17 November 1947 at Port Adelaide as HMAS Wyatt Earp. Following a visit by Antarctic explorer Sir Douglas Mawson, Wyatt Earp sailed for Williamstown, Victoria in early December for preparation and loading. After loading, including an OS2U Kingfisher amphibian of the Royal Australian Air Force, Wyatt Earp left from Nelson Pier, Williamstown on 19 December 1947 and proceeded to Hobart. Gales caused some problems en route. After several days in Hobart, the ship left for the Antarctic on 26 December 1947, but storm damage caused her to return to Melbourne for repairs, leaving again on 8 February 1948. The weather was intense, particularly beyond 65 degrees South, and a landing at Adelie Land was impossible. She turned towards Macquarie Island and there met discharging a team of scientists. Wyatt Earp returned to Melbourne, and her voyaging for Navy ended. Later years Wyatt Earp was sold to a commercial operator in late 1951 and was renamed Wongala. A later change of ownership had her called Natone, and under this name she plied the east Australian coast until wrecked in a storm near Double Island Point, Queensland, on the night of 23‚Äì24 January 1959.

She was the first woman to receive a Master of Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the first woman to receive a Master's degree in architecture anywhere in the United States. She was the eighth woman to be admitted to the American Institute of Architects. Biography Ryan was born on November 4, 1873, in Waltham, Massachusetts, one of five children of Albert Morse Ryan and Carrie S. Jameson. Albert Morse Ryan was a Waltham city employee and historian who also ran a milk business.Mannon, Melissa, \\"Waltham\\" (1998), pages 74 & 109 She graduated from the Waltham High School. During her Waltham High School years, Ryan was first attracted to the study of architectural design. =Studies at Massachusetts Normal Art School= In 1892 Ida A. Ryan began attending classes at Massachusetts Normal Art School (now Massachusetts College of Art and Design), which was founded in 1873 with the intention to support the Massachusetts Drawing Act of 1870 by providing drawing teachers for the public schools as well as training professional artists, designers, and architects. In 1894 she received her diploma in Elementary Drawing and Constructive Art and Design (which encompasses Descriptive Geometry, Machine Drawing- Construction and Architectural Design).Massachusetts Normal Art School Circular and Catalogue, 1894-1895. =Architecture Studies at MIT= Ida A. Ryan entered architecture studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which offered the first collegiate architectural studies program in the United States. There she studied with the noted architecture professor Constant-D√©sir√© Despradelle. In 1905, Ryan received the Rotch Prize of two hundred dollars for the regular student making the best record during their four years of studies.\\"Against all Odds: MIT's Pioneering Women of Landscape Architecture\\". by Eran Ben-Joseph, Holly D. Ben-Joseph, Anne C. Dodge, November 2006 At the end of her term at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ryan's junior design received the first of the first four prizes. Thereafter, she was invited to compete with only senior and fifth class men in the Junior Beaux Arts contest, in which she won second prize for a grand plan, elevation, and section of a public market.Women as Architects, by Joseph Dana Miller, in Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, June 1900, Vol. L‚Äî NO. 2, Whole NO. 294. Page 200. A photograph of Ida Annah Ryan accompanies the article. In 1904, Ryan showed a project for \\"A Proposed City Hall\\" at the Boston Architectural Club's annual exhibition.Catalogue, Boston Architectural Club Exhibition from May 2nd to 14th, by Boston Architectural Club In 1905, Ryan drafted a plan for a New England model town for her final master's degree project.Layout for a Model New England Town, by Ida Annah Ryan In 1907, Ryan showed five examples of her work at the Boston Architectural Club Exhibition: Camp at Litchfield, NH, Cottage Made From a Stable, Sewage Pump House at Crescent Park, Cottage at Violet Hill, Waltham, and Inexpensive Two-Family House at Waltham Highlands.Year Book, by Boston Architectural Club The two- family house is a large Spanish Revival stucco structure with double height bay windows, hip roof, overhanging eaves and a double height triple-arched entry porch that is a precursor of Ryan's work at 1114 Massachusetts Avenue, St. Cloud Florida; located at 228-240 Hammond Street the double-house is still in good condition more than a hundred years later. Ryan became the first woman to earn a master of science degree from MIT and also the first woman in the United States to receive a master's degree in architecture. In 1907, Ryan was awarded a traveling scholarship of $1200, the highest prize that the Architectural Department could confer on one of its graduates. This enabled her to spend a year in Europe engaged in the study of architecture. Ryan spent the greater part of the time in Spain and Italy, making her headquarters in Naples.\\"The Tech\\" (MIT), Boston MA, October 7, 1907 While at MIT Ryan was a member of Cleophan a club for women students that also included Matilda A. Fraser and Harriet F. Locke (see below).Technique, Volume 12, by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, p. 106 =Architectural Practice in Waltham, Massachusetts= Ryan launched the first women's architectural practice in the United States in Waltham, showing a particular concern for the design of modest housing. In 1909,The American Architect from the Colonial Era to the Present, by Cecil D. Elliott, p. 139 Ryan added fellow MIT graduate and women's rights activist Florence Luscomb to her practice, making this one of the first all-women's architectural practices in the United States.Political Woman: Florence Luscomb and the Legacy of Radical Reform by Sharon Hartman Strom, page 67 In February 1913, Miss Ryan was appointed the superintendent of buildings and grounds and buildings inspector for the city of Waltham, by Mayor Duane.\\"The Tech\\" (MIT), Boston MA, February 12, 1913 Typical of her work during this time is the house that Ryan designed for her nephew as a wedding present in 1914, located at 19 Boynton Street, Waltham.\\"Waltham\\", by Melissa Mannon, page 104 The -storey smooth stucco residence turns its gable-end to the street. A small, 1-storey covered porch at the entrance is distinguished by an arched roof reminiscent of the work of George Washington Maher in the Chicago suburbs. Windows are placed singly, in pairs, or, as in the gable, in threes, while sill heights vary according to the interior needs. Ryan would continue the use of many of these distinctive elements in her work in Florida. During her Waltham practice, Ryan also designed the spacious, well-appointed home of industrialist B. C. Ames (1917).Leadership by Design: Creating an Architecture of Trust, by Richard N. Swett, page 217 Many of the most attractive Waltham homes of that era were said to have been designed by Ryan.Technology Review, Volume 21, by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Association of Class Secretaries, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Alumni Association, MIT Alumni/ae Association, p. 537 Also of note is the apartment building at 19 Hammond Street, Waltham; a Ryan remodeling of a barn once owned by David Smith. Her address was, for a time, at this building.Waltham, by Melissa Mannon, page 55 While associated with fellow MIT graduate Harriet F. Locke (1870‚Äì1919),Technology Architectural Record, Volumes 1-2, by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Architecture, p. 32 Ryan was responsible for the design of Memorial Hospital, Nashua, New Hampshire, circa 1915, a 3-story stuccoed symmetrical building with recessed porches, of a simplified Grecian design, closely anticipating the Amherst Apartments in Orlando. The intertwined \\"cross and x\\" used for the porch railings would appear later in the Veteran's Memorial Library windows and ventilation grills. The hospital featured a roof parapet that prefigures Ryan and Roberts' work in Florida, as well. Ryan was active in the women's suffrage movement, a member of the Waltham Equal Suffrage League and the Political Equality Association of Massachusetts. Her recreational activities included camping and traveling.Woman's Who's Who of America: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 1, by John William Leonard, p. 709 When the United States entered World War I, Ryan gave her services without charge in designing and decorating the Army and Navy Canteen on Boston Common.Technology Review, Volume 21, by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Association of Class Secretaries, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Alumni Association, p. 537 Ryan offered her services to the government in Washington, D.C., and was the first woman employed in the War Department (in the gun carriage section). Ryan began an association with the Central Florida area while still in practice in Massachusetts, designing there the Unity Chapel of Orlando (built in 1913, remodeled by Ryan and Roberts circa 1920). Throughout this time, Ryan's many attempts to join the Massachusetts chapter of the American Institute of Architects were rebuffed solely because she was a woman. =Architectural Practice in Central Florida= As a result of this and of the building slump caused by the First World War, Ida A. Ryan moved to Central Florida and began an architecture practice based in Orlando, Florida. She became Orlando's first female architect. In 1918‚Äì1919, Frederick H. Trimble employed Ryan as designing architect in his firm.American Women: The Official Who's Who Among the Women of the Nation, Volume 1, edited by Durward Howes, p. 482 She was finally admitted to AIA in 1921, only the eighth woman nationwide. Soon thereafter Ryan was joined by Isabel Roberts (1871‚Äì1955) who had been a designer-draftsman in the Oak Park Studio of Frank Lloyd Wright and the co- owner, with her mother Mary, of the Isabel Roberts House. Ida Annah Ryan and Isabel Roberts formed an architectural practice, \\"Ryan and Roberts\\" which was among no more than twelve firms active in Orlando in the 1920s. Their business is listed under the heading \\"Architects\\" as \\"Ryan and Roberts\\" in the 1926 and in the 1927 Orlando City Directories, at 240 S. Orange St. and the Kenilworth Terrace address. One of only 10 architectural firms listed in 1926, the others include Frank L. Bodine, Fred E. Field, David Hyer, Murry S. King, George E. Krug, Howard M. Reynolds, Frederick H. Trimble and Percy P. Turner. And one of 12 firms so listed in Orlando in 1927, which included Maurice E. Kressly.Orlando City Directories, 1926‚Äì1931 Each of these architects is notable and together these firms were supportive colleagues in promoting excellence in the built environment, as one can learn by reading the links to each. Among the works of \\"Ryan and Roberts\\" are:Photos of their work may be seen at: https://www.flickr.com/photos/11072784@N06/ Veterans Memorial Library * Veterans Memorial Library - 1012 Massachusetts Ave., St. Cloud, Florida. Isabel Roberts' brother-in-law, John B. Somerville, served on the building committee, a connection which resulted in Ryan and Roberts obtaining this commission. In 1922, an outline of what was desired was laid before architects Miss Ida Annah Ryan and Miss Isabel Roberts of Orlando. The plans submitted by these ladies were subsequently accepted. The architects insisted on a motto. Carlyle's, \\"The true university is a collection of books,\\" was chosen. The building, although described as of Grecian style is in fact reminiscent of the designs of many of the Prairie School small bank buildings of the upper Midwest by Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright and others, notably Wright's First National Bank of Dwight, Illinois, and the Madison State Bank Building, Madison, Minnesota, by Purcell & Elmslie, (1913, demolished 1968). The library is constructed of hollow tile with stained stucco exterior and still in use today. * Amherst Apartments - 325 West Colonial Drive, Orlando, Florida. The Amherst Apartments were, for many years, Orlando's most prestigious apartment address. Designed by Ida A. Ryan and Isabel Roberts in the Prairie Style and built in 1921‚Äì1922, this orange-yellow brick building featured forty-seven apartments situated on Lake Concord. The building was demolished in 1986. * Unity Chapel, Orlando (remodeled by Ryan and Roberts circa 1920; demolished in the 1960s). For many years, this charming building, in a stuccoed English vernacular style, was the worship home of First Unitarian Church of Orlando, near Lake Eola. Ida Annah Ryan was a member of this congregation. Some scholars have had a hard time identifying this building, which Isabel listed on her AIA application. It is not to be confused with Frank Lloyd Wright's famous Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois. * Tourist Club House - 700 Indiana Ave., St. Cloud, Florida. This club house for the Tourist Club of St. Cloud was opened in the city park on December 3, 1923. Designed by Ida Annah Ryan and Isabel Roberts, it shows the influence of the Prairie School with which Roberts was associated, as a rectangular structure with a barrel-roofed auditorium. Frank Lloyd Wright's Oak Park Studio developed this style with open, airy plans, low-pitched hip or gable roofs, horizontal brick walls, exposed rafter ends, broad overhanging eaves and grouped wood windows. The building was demolished circa 2004. * The Ryan/Roberts Home and Studio ‚Äì 834 Kenilworth Terrace, Orlando, Florida. Ryan and Roberts designed this Mediterranean Revival‚Äìstyle home and studio for their own use in 1920‚Äì24. The stucco structure with gable roof is in a simplified Mediterranean revival style. The details of the design include asymmetrical window placements, decorative attic vents, side yard orientation and gently scalloped buttresses. It is a very well maintained private residence today. * The Chapel at the Fisk Funeral Home, 1107‚Äì1111 Massachusetts Avenue, St. Cloud.Information courtesy of Anita Parks; Volunteer Curator; St. Cloud Heritage Museum * The Pennsylvania Hotel Building, 10th Street between Pennsylvania Ave. and Florida Avenue, St. Cloud, Florida. The building now houses the St. Cloud Twin Theatres. * The Peoples Bank Building, southeast corner of 10th Street and New York Avenue, St. Cloud, Florida. The bank failed in the late Twenties; the main floor of the building is now used as a cafe and barber shop. * Ross E. Jeffries Elementary School, 1200 Vermont Avenue, St. Cloud, Florida, circa 1926; Though positive documentation has been lost to time, records show that the designers of the Mediterranean Revival style school's original building may have been Ryan & Roberts. The building is distinguished by an arched porch in the offset tower main entry and a low profile accentuated by a curved parapet-roofed bay. The facade consists chiefly of large tri-part Chicago style windows, with small end windows as accents.Facts Are Elusive As School Marks 75th Anniversary, by Barbara J.

Fraser Residence, Orlando, Florida (private). A spacious, elegant Mediterranean Revival stucco mansion situated on one of Orlando's secluded lakes, the Fraser Residence is well-maintained and remains in private hands. Ryan and Roberts' freedom with window shapes and placement is particularly evident in this house, as is their use of round-headed French doors and similar windows, without any 45 degree angle dividers and with the two half circle segments on each side. It was a popular device with the firm and might be thought of as one of their \\"trademarks\\". This home served as Orlando Opera Guild's 1988 Designers' Show House. In 2008-2009, the City of Orlando attempted to purchase the house in order to demolish it for green space around Florida Hospital. Four homes were bought and destroyed, including the oldest house in the area, a two storey structure with half-basement built in 1915. However, due to the impending recession, the offer for the Fraser residence was withdrawn.. Ida A. Ryan worked with builder Samuel (Sam) Stoltz who created fantasy architecture with original murals in storybook settings in Orlando, Mount Plymouth, and Windermere, Florida. Ryan lived in Orlando until her death on February 17, 1950 after an illness of several years, during which she was cared for by Isabel Roberts. According to her wishes, Ryan was buried in her hometown of Waltham, Massachusetts.Dalles, John, \\"The Pathbreaking Legacy of Ryan and Roberts\\", in \\"Reflections\\", the journal of the Historical Society of Central Florida, Summer 2009; pages 8 and 9.

Orchids in this genus have a fleshy, underground rhizome and a fleshy, hollow flowering stem with small, pale coloured, drooping, short-lived flowers with narrow sepals and petals. They are native to a region extending from tropical Africa to Europe, temperate and tropical Asia, Australia and some Pacific Islands. Description Orchids in the genus Epipogium are leafless, terrestrial, mycotrophic herbs. They have a fleshy underground rhizome and the flowering stem is the only part above ground level. The flowering stem is pale-coloured, hollow, fleshy and bears a few to many drooping flowers and papery bracts. The flowers are yellowish white with violet or reddish brown markings and are short-lived. The sepals and petals are narrow and similar in size and shape to each other. The labellum is relatively broad and dished with a prominent spur at its base. Taxonomy and naming The genus Epipogium was first formally described in 1792 by Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen after an unpublished description by Johann Georg Gmelin and the description was published in Borkhausen's book Tentamen dispositionis Plantarum Germaniae seminiferarum. The name Epipogium is derived from the Ancient Greek epi (·ºêœÄŒØ) meaning \\"upon\\" or \\"on\\" and p≈çg≈çn (œÄœéŒ≥œâŒΩ) meaning \\"beard\\",Backer, C.A. (1936).

He played college football at Texas Christian University (TCU) and had a short stint with the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) in 1957. Curtis spent most of his coaching career, which spanned from 1958 to 1988, at the high school level in the state of Texas. At the college level, he served as last head football coach at the University of Texas at Arlington, from 1984 to 1985, before the Texas‚ÄìArlington Mavericks football program was disbanded. Football career Growing up in Gainesville, Texas as son of a minister, Curtis played quarterback at Gainesville High School in the late 1940s and early 1950s. During his senior year Curtis' father moved to Taylor but allowed him to remain at Gainesville in a garage apartment in order to keep his eligibility. Despite All-State honors, college recruiters ignored him, except for Texas Christian's Abe Martin. At TCU, Curtis led the Horned Frogs to the 1955 Southwest Conference championship. In the 1957 Cotton Bowl, Curtis threw two touchdown passes and ran for another TD to lead the Horned Frogs to a 28‚Äì27 win over Syracuse and standout running back Jim Brown. Garnering All-Southwest Conference honors in 1955 and 1956, Curtis was selected 85th overall by the defending champions, the New York Giants, in the 1957 NFL Draft. As back-up quarterback for Charley Conerly Curtis did not see any action during the 1957 NFL season, yet as an aspiring coach it worked to his advantage. Both Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry were assistants on the Giants staff, and their system, he soon realized, far surpassed anything he had seen in four years at TCU. Coaching career After one season with the Giants, Curtis returned to Texas in order to pursue a coaching career. He began at Holliday, where he led the 1958 Eagles to an 8‚Äì2 record and barely missed the playoffs. The following year Curtis moved to 2A Jacksboro, where he turned around a program in the dumps for 10 straight years and culminating in the state title in 1962. The Tigers outscored their opponents 602‚Äì43 that year. Curtis soon moved on, as he succeeded Homer Johnson as head coach at 4A Garland. Guiding the Owls to back-to-back state titles in 1963 and '64, Curtis became the first coach in Texas high school football to win consecutive titles at different schools in different classifications, going 26‚Äì1‚Äì1 during that stretch. He also joined, at that time, Waco's Paul Tyson, Amarillo's Blair Cherry and Abilene's Chuck Moser as the only coaches to win three straight state crowns. Curtis seriously considered the head coaching job at Odessa Permian, which just became vacant as Jim Cashion resigned, but eventually accepted an assistant coaching position on Hayden Fry's staff at SMU. In 1968, he returned to the high school level, taking over at Grand Prairie. In 1979 Curtis briefly returned to Jacksboro, before taking over head coaching duties at Cleburne High School in 1981. In 1982, he guided the Yellow Jackets to the state semifinals, but lost 7‚Äì3 to Don Denbow's Corsicana squad. Cleburne's 1983 team carried an unbeaten 13‚Äì0 record in the quarterfinal round, only to lose 13‚Äì3 to Lubbock Estacado. Curtis also coached in the Oil Bowl in 1983. In 1984 Curtis finally got his first head coaching job at the collegiate level, taking over as 13th head football coach at the University of Texas at Arlington. His career coaching record for the Mavericks was 11‚Äì10‚Äì1. This ranks him sixth at UT Arlington in total wins and eighth at UT Arlington in winning percentage. UT-Arlington discontinued its football program after the conclusion of the 1985 season. After one year out of coaching, Curtis returned to the high school level, becoming head coach at 3A Aledo. He guided the Bearcats to a 6‚Äì5 and 8‚Äì3 record in 1987 and 1988, respectively, before he retired. Death Curtis died on May 9, 2016, following a lengthy undisclosed illness. He was 80.

Andr√°ssy University Budapest was founded in 2001 and is the only completely German-language university outside the German-speaking countries. As a European university in Hungary, it is supported by five partner states (Austria, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria, Germany, Hungary) and also by Switzerland and the autonomous region of Trentino-South Tirol. History Gyula Andr√°ssy (portrait by Gyula Bencz√∫r, 1884)The idea to found AUB goes back to the ‚ÄúUlm Declaration‚Äù of 22 February 2001. The prime ministers of Hungary, the Republic of Austria, the State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and the Free State of Bavaria came to an agreement during a summit meeting in Ulm to support a German-language university in Budapest which Hungary had been planning, and to take active part in its implementation. Thus the cornerstone for a multinational community project was laid. The then-planned expansion of the European Union was the tone-setting impulse; a contribution to the integration process of the Central European area into the European Union was made which continues to this day. Founded in the same year by Hungary, the ‚ÄúPublic Foundation for the German Language University in Budapest‚Äù served as agent. In June 2001, AUB received state recognition by the Hungarian Parliament. Just one year thereafter, the ‚ÄúAndr√°ssy Gyula German-Language University in Budapest‚Äù (Andr√°ssy University Budapest ‚Äì AUB) initiated its teaching programme. With the name ‚ÄúAndr√°ssy Gyula German-Language University in Budapest‚Äú, the founders placed the institution and its future role in the historic traditional lineage of Central Europe. Its namesake, Count Gyula Andr√°ssy (1823-1890), was an active participant of the revolution of 1848/49, from 1867 to 1871 Hungarian prime minister and finally, until his resignation in 1879, foreign minister of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. He was an involved proponent of the Austro- Hungarian Compromise, which was bound into the foundation of the Dual Monarchy. He was committed to the promotion of understanding among the nations, and through his extraordinary endeavours for the close cooperation of the Central European states, he went down in history as one of the most prominent diplomats of the 19th century. AUB was the first university outside of Germany to be accredited according to German rules and criteria. With its quality assurance system certified by the evalag evaluation agency from Baden- W√ºrttemberg, the university guarantees the best study and teaching conditions. It was the fifth in Hungary to be accepted into the excellence program of Hungarian colleges, thus earning the title ‚ÄúUniversity of National Excellence‚Äù.Main building Studies Master Degree Programmes (German- language): * International Relations ‚Äì European Studies * International Economy and Business * Management and Leadership * LL.M.

We address these questions using interdisciplinary approaches from social science (anthropology, economics, linguistics, philosophy and psychology), biological science (behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, physiology), engineering science (biomedical and electrical engineering, computer science), and medical science (neurology, psychiatry and medical imaging). The research mission of the CMB includes investigation of a variety of fundamental issues aimed at answering the fundamental question: How does the mind arise from the biology of the brain? Scientists in the CMB study language, memory, attention, cognitive control, emotion, multi-sensory integration, music cognition, social cognition, and visual cognition from cognitive neuroscience and developmental perspectives in healthy infants, children, and adults, and in special patient populations. We are also a leader in the emerging field of translational cognitive neuroscience, which endeavors to translate basic science findings about the operation of healthy minds and brains into clinical research on mind-brain disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.

Breviarium patriarchinum secundum usum Ecclesiae Comensis (Comi 1523). It was only in 1598 that Pope Clement VIII substituted the Roman rite. In the tenth century the Bishops of Como were also its temporal lords. From the election of Bishop Raimundus in 1061, the episcopal elections were carried out by the Canons of the Cathedral Chapter and the Abbots of S. Carpoforo, S. Abondio, and S. Giuliano. =Cathedral and Chapter= The Cathedral of S. Maria AssuntaDiocesi di Como, Basilica Cattedrale di S. Maria Assunta; retrieved: 06-09-2018. was begun in 1396, and was completed only in 1595; later the cupola and some small chapels were added (1730‚Äì44).

In 1695, the Chapter of the cathedral was composed of three dignities (the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, and the Provost) and twenty Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 166 note 1. In 1764, there were three dignities and seventeen Canons.Ughelli, V, p. 257. Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica VI, p. 175 note 1. In 1846 there were twenty members of the Chapter, headed by the Archpriest, the Theologos, and the Penitentiary. The Chapter of the Cathedral currently (2018) consists of ten Canons, headed by the Archpriest.Diocesi di Como, Capitolo della Cattedrale; retrieved: 06-09-2018.

E. van Vogt, originally published in the December 1942 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. It is developed from a much shorter 1941 story, \\"The Seesaw\\". It was, in turn, used as the basis for a portion of the 1951 fix-up novel The Weapon Shops of Isher. It was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories published before the creation of the Nebula Awards. As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929‚Äì1964. The Seesaw A shop selling \\"The Finest Energy Weapons in the Known Universe\\" mysteriously appears in Middle City in June 1947. A reporter, Chris McAllister, enters the shop and suddenly finds himself 7,000 years in the future. The shop's owner and daughter conclude that this was caused by a weapon being turned on the shop by their enemies, the House of Isher. The owner calls several of his friends to the shop and hatches a plan to counteract the weapon. McAllister now holds an enormous temporal charge. If he leaves the shop he will return to his time, while the weapon will be shot into the future by the same amount. As he dresses in a protective suit that retains the charge, he realizes there is a problem - unless he removes the suit he will retain the charge and the motion will not stop. The group seizes him and throws him out the door. He finds himself back in 1947, but after a short time is propelled into the future again, and then back and forth as if on a seesaw. He notices that each swing is further than the last, and ultimately realizes his ultimate duty is to remove the suit at the beginning of time, causing the Big Bang.  The Weapon Shop  A small businessman named Fara faces mounting professional and personal troubles despite his fierce devotion to the Empress who rules the solar system. He is infuriated when a weapons shop, which sells fantastic technology but which is not controlled by the Empress, materializes in his town. He fails in his efforts to have the shop expelled, and is soon further humiliated and impoverished when his son participates in a scam against him. Nobody is willing to help him except, surprisingly, the operators of the weapons shop. Fara discovers that the size and power of their organization far surpass his initial understanding, and that they represent a bulwark against the otherwise absolute power of the Empress. Although most of the villagers follow the Empress through blind authority, the Weapon Shop has been secretly working in order to protect their rights and freedom. They offer him evidence that organizations owned by the Empress herself organized the theft of his money and store. The weapons shop organization restores his stolen property, and he quietly joins their resistance to the state.  External links  * Category:Short stories by A.

Bluetooth advertising can also be received via laptop or PDA. Bluetooth advertising is permission based advertising, which means that when a mobile device has received a Bluetooth message, the recipient has the choice to either accept or decline the message. The recipient needs to positively indicate that they wish to receive marketing messages. While not all Bluetooth enabled mobile devices users leaves their Bluetooth activated, they can interact with a sign to encourage them to turn on their Bluetooth to receive the content. The advertiser is required to explain that those marketing messages may contain information about other companies‚Äô products and services, if appropriate. It is highly recommended that the Direct Marketing Associations guidelines are used. Bluetooth advertising proximity range Bluetooth advertising generally is a broadcast function. The average range of Bluetooth advertising in class 2 is 15 meters to 40 meters for most Bluetooth enabled mobile devices. As with all wireless transmission, the range and accessibility to most Bluetooth advertising depends on the transmitter power class and the individual portage of the receiver equipment. However, with advances in mobile devices technology, this distance for proper receiving is increasing to reach 250 meters or more in nowadays smart phones, tablet computers and other mobile devices. The selectivity goes down with extension of range. Hence the transmission power raise as well as receiver sensitivity raise will reduce the contextual connection between actual location of receiver and contents of broadcast message. There are several major types of Bluetooth advertising solutions. That are generally Bluetooth dongles as transmitter hardware in conjunction with mostly USB networked common server functions. Embedded scheduling software serves transmission via dongles to enabled Bluetooth receivers. As Bluetooth reception modes require battery power, the distribution depends on the preparedness of the bearers of receiver units for receiving such transmission. Bluetooth advertising content types Bluetooth advertising can send file formats like image files, ring tone files, vCard, barcodes, audio files, Java applications, mobile applications, video files, text files and theoretically any file format mobile devices can handle. There are two types of possible communications in Bluetooth 1-Broadcasting or 2-Connection. Broadcasting doesn't need pairing( connection ). Broadcaster will send data along with its ID and any receiver can receive it by recognizing that ID. It is best suited for gaming where one device has to continuously send its status to other devices. Apple provides this feature through iBeacon but one can develop their own. It's easily possible in Android but little bit tricky in iOS. See didDiscoverPeripheral and CBCentralManager class for that. See specific data using CBAdvertisementDataManufacturerDataKey. Bluetooth advertising applications Bluetooth advertising applications include: * Broadcast location-based coupons. * Contextual advertising. * Localized information. * Gaming and music. * Content on demand. * Specific and targeted campaign.

Orchids in this genus have swollen, fleshy rhizomes and thin, pale, upright fleshy flowering stems with resupinate, bell-shaped white or pale yellowish brown flowers. They are native to Africa, Madagascar, Southeast Asia, Australia and various islands of the Pacific. Description Orchids in the genus Didymoplexis are small, leafless, terrestrial, mycotrophic herbs with a swollen, fleshy rhizome. The flowering stem is thin, upright and fleshy with a few scale-like bracts fleshy and one to a few flowers. The flowers are resupinate, white or pale yellowish brown and often last for less than a day. The sepals and petals are joined at the base to form a short, bell-shaped tube with the tips spreading widely. The labellum is relatively broad and has a band of calli along its midline. Taxonomy and naming The genus Didymoplexis was first formally described in 1843 by William Griffith and the description was published in the Calcutta Journal of Natural History. The name Didymoplexis is derived from the Ancient Greek didymos meaning \\"double\\" or \\"twin\\" and plexis meaning \\"twine\\", \\"twist\\" or \\"weave\\" referring to the interlocking calli on the labellum.

As Christians were forbidden to practice usury, i.e., taking loans on interest, it created a sort of monopoly of the credit business to the Jews. However, the so-called \\"Coarsini\\" (named after the town of Cavour in Piedmont), and the Lombards, who were a kind of travelling bankers, often charge interest much greater than Jewish lenders. Life Michele Carcano was born in 1427 to a noble family of Milan, he joined the Franciscans in 1442. After his ordination, he became an itinerant preacher. The mons pietatis of Perugia was founded in consequence of Carcano's preaching in that city in 1461, in which he inveighed against the usury of the Jews. The fund for that charitable establishment was made up in part by voluntary contributions and in part by money lent by the Jews themselves.Benigni, Umberto. \\"Montes Pietatis.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 29 January 2019 He preached against usury, which he connected to the Jews. His anti-Semitic discourses did much to embolden persecution against Jews, particularly in the case of the blood libel concerning Simon of Trent. On Holy Thursday in the year 1475, the child, then about 20 months old, son of a gardener, was missed by its parents. On the evening of Easter Sunday the body was found in a ditch. Several Jews were accused of the alleged murder, cruelly tortured, and executed.Wolfsgr√ºber, C√∂lestin. \\"Trent.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15.

Al Morgan (January 16, 1920 ‚Äì March 3, 2011) was an American producer of The Today Show during the 1960s, and a novelist best known for his trenchant look at media personalities, The Great Man (Dutton, 1955), which reviewers compared to The Hucksters and Citizen Kane. It was this novel which popularized the phrase \\"The Great Unwashed.\\" As in Citizen Kane, a reporter sets out to gather information on a well-known deceased public figure. Some critics suggested the deceased character, national radio commentator Herb Fuller, was inspired by Arthur Godfrey. Kirkus Reviews commented: :Five decisive days in the life of radio reporter Ed Harris afford in inside spot on the airways and introduces the hustler, huckster world of the \\"electronic pitch game.\\" For Ed, who has been asked to do the memorial show which will be a monument to Herb Fuller, who has just died, has also been tapped to succeed him, and in filling in the background on the Great Man he learns the lesson that success is only a packaged deal. He can be a Great Man - but he will also be a heel. From Carol, a girl on the Fuller show and one of Herb's many women, he finds out that sex is only a \\"kind of job insurance. Like social security.\\" From Beasley, who gave Fuller his start, he gets the text of a first sermon in Worcester which brought him his following - until he started mixing dirty jokes in with the hymns. From Sid, who had a contract to hold over Fuller - and now Ed, he gets the facts behind a memorable patriotic speech Fuller was said to have delivered from abroad. And the dissolute spectacle of the man behind the legend finally cumulates to the last truth that any network can create a character and commercialize it... A brash, brisk transmission - to the audience which liked The Hucksters, the pace is unimpeded and the prose is picturesque. The publishers will give it their pitch - and men should sponsor it.Kirkus Reviews Morgan and Jos√© Ferrer collaborated on the screenplay of The Great Man, and it was directed in 1956 by Ferrer who also portrayed the lead role. Time's review detailed the story twists: :The Great Man (Universal- International) is a corrosive, cynical comment on TV-Radio Row. It is directed with vigor and played with bounce, and though it is talky, the talk is amusingly semiliterate in the Madison Avenue manner. Adapted from the novel by Radioman Al Morgan, it focuses on the men who guide the stars of the TV-radio industry, holds them high to show how low they are, and growls: in this business, anything goes, even integrity‚Äîif it sells soap and toothpaste. :Whatever the merits of the argument, the pictorial demonstration is compelling. The Great Man pounces quickly on its subject matter and, from first image to last, never lets go. Aiming a screenful of bile at the industry in general, it releases its most acidulous contempt at a single personality, an \\"American idol.\\" Is it a roman a clef? Says Author Morgan: \\"No one has sued me yet.\\" :As the movie opens, the great man dies in an auto crash. A witheringly sardonic radio executive (Keenan Wynn) springs into action. The great man must be replaced. He picks Commentator Jose Ferrer, a promising gossipist on Manhattan night life who is at the halfway point to corruption, with ambition gnawing away at his remaining illusions. But before Ferrer can get the job, he must be okayed by the boss of the network (Dean Jagger). Ferrer makes his pitch at a meeting of the network's top brass, throwing them a soft sell, very sincere, about how he would conduct the full hour, coast-to- coast memorial show being planned for the dead man as \\"a portrait in sound of the common man magnified.\\" As the camera plays on the alert faces of the brass, each attentive but ready to cut off the speaker's head at the first false note, it is plain that Ferrer's fate is riding on the words he is improvising. When he finishes, the boss breaks the silence with three words: \\"I'll buy it.\\" That throws the entire network behind Ferrer. He sets off with his tape recorder to find out from those who knew the great man best what he was really like. :Loved by \\"150 million of the Great Unwashed\\" who knew him on the air, the great man was loathed by those who knew him in the flesh. His wife never gave him a divorce, but let him stray at the end of a long leash. Among other places, he strayed into the boudoir of one of his singers (Julie London). Making love to him, she says, \\"was my way of paying a premium on my job insurance.\\" By the time the great man's portrait is filled in by his pressagent (\\"I was paid to work for him, not to like him\\"), and by a simple, slightly ridiculous man who gave him his start‚Äîwinningly played by Ed Wynn (\\"He was not a nice person\\")‚Äîwhat emerges is \\"a glorified con man with his voice amplified.\\" The dramatic question: Now that Commentator Ferrer knows what a monumental heel the great man was, will he turn the memorial show into a farce by doing a tearjerker or into a scandal by telling the truth? What he does is an improbable surprise, but well worth seeing.\\"The New Pictures.\\" Time, January 21, 1957. Bosley Crowther reviewing the film in The New York Times (January 2, 1957), described the film as: :... a smashingly brutal and generally absorbing expose of a piece of deception and hypocrisy within the radio industry... the New Year's first flash of cynicism... Maybe you have some recollection of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. Well, this will remind you of it, especially as it begins. With a witheringly sharp-focus camera and a hard- boiled-reporter approach, cued by a personal narration that is laced with sophisticated slang, Mr. Ferrer, as a radio talker, takes out to \\"find the story behind\\" a phenomenally popular air artist, just killed in an accident. The information, gathered from \\"loved ones,\\" associates and fans, is to be used to develop a mammoth, one-hour, nationwide memorial program. This, you can see, is very similar to the beginning of \\"Citizen Kane.\\" And so are initial developments, as the reporter detects that the deceased was not a saint. From the dead man's press agent, business manager, employer and ex-girl friend, he discovers that this nationally worshiped \\"idol\\" of the airwaves was strictly a heel. This verbally imparted exposition leaves our man mildly amazed. But the thing that really disturbs him is the accumulating indication that his radio sponsors are cold-bloodedly determined to perpetuate the tawdry myth of the \\"great man.\\" Knowing, as he does, the dark truth, they still mean to go ahead‚Äîand even fake a great deal‚Äîwith a monstrously mawkish memorial program.Crowther, Bosley. \\"Screen: The Great Man,\\" The New York Times, January 2, 1957. When Morgan and Ferrer collaborated again two years later on the book for the musical comedy, Oh, Captain!, they were nominated for Broadway's 1958 Tony Award for Best Musical. Morgan's other novels include One Star General (Rinehart & Company, 1959) and Anchor Woman (Stein & Day, 1974).

The Opava territory thus had not been part of the original Polish Duchy of Silesia in 1138, and was first ruled by an illegitimate offshoot of the Bohemian P≈ôemyslid dynasty, not by the Silesian Piasts like many of the neighbouring Silesian duchies. Its capital was Opava (Troppau) in the modern day Czech Republic. From 1337 onwards, the P≈ôemyslid dukes also ruled the adjacent former Piast Duchy of Racib√≥rz, whereupon Opava became united with the Upper Silesian lands. When the Opava branch became extinct in 1464, it fell back to the Bohemian Crown, from 1526 part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the final three centuries of its existence, the duchy was ruled by the House of Liechtenstein. It was dissolved with the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, but the title of Duke of Troppau and J√§gerndorf still exists, belonging to a present-day monarch, Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein. History Coat of arms of the Duke of Opava, Wernigerode Armorial, late 15th century Opava was initially established as a Moravian province under the rule of King Ottokar's son Nicholas I, who first appeared as a \\"Lord of Opava\\" in 1269 and became the progenitor of the Opava branch of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. After Ottokar was killed in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, Nicholas had to ward off against claims raised by his stepmother Kunigunda of Halych and her lover Zavis of Falkenstein residing at Hradec Castle near Opava. Nevertheless, he reached his confirmation by both the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany and his stepbrother King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and retained his territory even after the murder of the last P≈ôemyslid king Wenceslaus III of Bohemia in 1306. Upon the extinction of the royal branch of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty and the subsequent turmoil around the Bohemian throne, Henry of Carinthia gave Opava in pawn to the Silesian duke Boles≈Çaw III the Generous. When finally in 1310 the mighty House of Luxembourg ascended to the throne, it was redeemed by King John of Bohemia in 1311. Opava was officially raised to a duchy in 1318 and was confirmed as a fief for Nicholas' son Duke Nicholas II by King John,Hans Ferdinand Helmolt: The World's History: A Survey of Man's Record, 1907, who soon had to fend off the Hungarian troops of King Casimir III of Poland.Geary, Patrick J.: Readings in Medieval History The conjunction with Silesia was accomplished when Duke Nicholas II married Anna of Racib√≥rz, sister of the Piast Duke Leszek of Racib√≥rz, also a Bohemian vassal since 1327. When Leszek died without heirs in 1336, King John vested his brother-in-law Nicholas II with the Silesian Duchy of Racib√≥rz (Ratibor, Ratibo≈ô), whereafter he ruled both duchies in personal union until his death in 1365, when his eldest son John I succeeded him. In 1377, Duke John I again separated Opava from the duchies of Racib√≥rz and Krnov (J√§gerndorf, Krn√≥w) and granted it to his younger brothers Nicholas III (‚Ä†1394), Wenceslaus I (‚Ä†1381) and Przemko (‚Ä†1433). Afterward, Opava ownership changed several times, mainly due to purchase and partitions. Przemko's sons sold their shares to the Bohemian king George of Podƒõbrady by 1462; their P≈ôemyslid cousins however retained Racib√≥rz and Krnov. In 1465 King George gave Opava to his second son Victor, who also became Duke of M√ºnsterberg in 1462. Victor in turn had to cede it to the Bohemian anti-king Matthias Corvinus in 1485, who installed his illegitimate son John as duke. Atlas Novus by Joan Blaeu, 1645 In 1506 King Vladislas II Jagiellon of Bohemia granted Opava to Duke Casimir II of Cieszyn (Teschen), who had married a daughter of Victor and held the duchy until his death in 1528, after which it was again seized by Bohemia. Meanwhile, in 1521, with the death of Duke Valentin of Racib√≥rz, the Opava line of the P≈ôemyslids had finally become extinct and all their possessions had fallen back to the Bohemian Crown, which in 1526 passed to the Habsburg Monarchy. Prince Karl I of LiechtensteinPrince Karl I was invested with the Duchy of Troppau in 1614 by Emperor Matthias of Habsburg. After the 1620 Battle of White Mountain Prince Karl also acquired the Duchy of Krnov, and ever since the heads of the Princely Family of Liechtenstein bear the title Duke of Troppau and J√§gerndorf. In 1742, in the course of the First Silesian War and the Treaty of Breslau, the Duchy was divided once more, with the part north of the Opava River including G≈Çubczyce (Leobsch√ºtz, Hlubƒçice) and Hluƒç√≠n (Hultschin) becoming part of Prussia. The southern part with Krnov, Brunt√°l (Freudenthal), Fulnek and Opava itself remained part of Austrian Silesia, a crown land of the Austrian Empire from 1804. The Austrian Duchy of Troppau ceased to exist when the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved in 1918 and the area (Troppauer Land) including the city became part of Czechoslovakia. The Prussian share remained a part of the Silesian province until 1945, when it fell to Poland in accord with the Potsdam Agreement.

Such cathedrals and monasteries occur mostly in areas where the ice ages have deposited such rock material on the one hand, and where on the other hand there is little or no access to natural rock for quarrying and fashioning. In Europe, the primary areas with fieldstone churches are Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg (including Berlin) in Germany, as well as Poland, Finland, parts of Scandinavia and the Baltic states. The stones used are often granite, gneiss or quartzite; they can be used both hewn and unshaped. Since some of the churches are painted, the stones are not always visible. Especially in later examples, the fieldstones are often combined with other materials, such as brick or half-timbered parts. Many fieldstone churches are in the Romanesque tradition, and others are Gothic or in somewhat later architectural styles. The earliest examples date to the 11th century (in some regions later, depending on the date of Christianisation and of the German eastward expansion). Many early examples in Holstein are associated with the activities of St. Vicelinus and are thus known as Vizellinskirchen (Vicellinus churches); they often have round towers. Some of the earliest churches in Denmark (especially Bornholm) are fieldstone-built round churches. The flourish of the development of fieldstone churches was around the end of the 12th century, after which they became less common due to the increasing popularity of brick- built architecture (see Brick Romanesque and Brick Gothic). Their construction mostly ceased at the end of the 16th century. In the context of architectural revival styles, especially of Neo-Romanesque, further fieldstone churches were erected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

He was legitimated by his father with the consent of Pope Urban IV and raised at the Prague court. As his half-brother Wenceslaus II was designated to succeed his father on the Bohemian throne, Nicholas in compensation received Troppau, then a part of the Moravian march. He supported his father in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, was captured by Hungarian forces, but regained his duchy from the victorious German king Rudolph of Habsburg.

Compton was the largest station between Newbury, Berkshire and Didcot, Oxfordshire, serving the villages of Compton, East Ilsley and Aldworth. The station closed in 1962. Facilities The station consisted of two platforms with the ticket offices and station buildings located on the Northbound platform. This was the only station with the exceptions of and Newbury to have a footbridge linking the platforms, most likely to preserve the use of a footpath over which a Public Right of Way existed and to eliminate the danger of users having to cross the line by other means. To the north of the station was a goods shed plus cattle pens and three sidings which supported a busy coal trade and the loading of the products of the foundry. Evidence of the routes of these sidings can still be traced where continued use of weedkillers on the trackbed still inhibits the growth of invasive plants. A signal box was located at the north end of the southbound platform and there is an unusual single-truck bay set into the northbound platform to facilitate the loading of a horse-box to the rear of a Didcot-bound train. There is still the remains of a service road which ran from the station yard down alongside the embankment to meet the village road passing under the nearby bridge; the lower end of which has now been absorbed into the grounds of Compton Primary School. The station received relatively large volumes of goods traffic for the area with Baker's Foundry being located in the nearby village. Proposed East Ilsley branch A link line to nearby East Ilsley was planned but never built, although certain parts of the proposed route were levelled and ballasted for reasons as yet unknown. There was a facility at Compton for incorporating the junction and for the stabling of a small locomotive to operate the route. The site today The station house, booking hall and some outbuildings (lamp and oil stores and a porter's shed) and the nearby substantial brick road overbridge are still in existence. A public footpath allows access to the platform side revealing the complete platforms but with the trackbed filled in to the same level and laid as a lawn. An enamel \\"Platform tickets to be given up on leaving platform\\" sign, although it is not known if this is original. The large, well-built and relatively intact goods shed was demolished in 2001 to make way for a small business area.Karau, P., Parsons, M. and Robertson, K.

In 1990, he added quality control duties to his responsibilities, coordinating offensive and defensive scouting of future opponents, while providing internal analysis of the team's own tendencies. In the 1990s, the Cowboys organization felt they could find placekickers and punters through free agency, without the need of paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap, so they allowed talented and productive players to leave, instead of signing them into long-term contracts. In 16 seasons, he was entrusted with helping to find and develop young talent. He scouted and coached seven rookie or first-year free agent kickers, that included Ken Willis, Lin Elliott, Chris Boniol, Richie Cunningham, Tim Seder, Jon Hilbert and Billy Cundiff. He also signed and coached 5 rookie or first- year free agent punters, that included John Jett, Micah Knorr, Filip Filipovic, Toby Gowin and Mat McBriar.

In 2006, Hoffman served as assistant special teams coach under special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis and head coach Jim Mora. =Miami Dolphins= In 2007, Hoffman was hired as assistant special teams coach for the Miami Dolphins. He worked under first- year head coach Cam Cameron and special teams coordinator Keith Armstrong. He contributed to kicker Jay Feely setting the single-season franchise record for field goal percentage at 91.3. He also instructed rookie punter Brandon Fields. In 2008, he was one of only two coaches initially retained after Cameron's firing by Tony Sparano. He helped to develop rookie free agent kicker Dan Carpenter, who went on to make 21-of-25 field goals (84.0%), including a Dolphins rookie record 14 straight. =Kansas City Chiefs= In 2009, Hoffman was hired by the Kansas City Chiefs to be the special teams coach for the first time in his career. In his first year, the special teams units improved significantly. He contributed to rookie Ryan Succop becoming an NFL starter and tying for the highest field goal percentage (86.2%) by an NFL rookie since 1970. Punter Dustin Colquitt set a new single-season team net punting average (40.8). =Oakland Raiders= On February 3, 2012, Hoffman was hired as special teams coordinator of the Oakland Raiders by new head coach Dennis Allen. In his lone season with the team, placekicker Sebastian Janikowski achieved a 91.2% field goal percentage and was 25-for-25 inside of 50 yards for the first time in his career. He was relieved of his duties at the end of the season. =Tennessee Titans= On February 18, 2013, Hoffman was hired as an assistant special teams coach for the Tennessee Titans. On October 3, 2016, he was promoted to special teams coordinator after Bobby April was relieved of his duties.

Hazell scored 43 victories in 1917‚Äì18 making him the fifth most successful British \\"flying ace\\" of the war, and the third most successful Irish-born pilot, behind Edward Mannock and George McElroy, as well the only pilot to survive the war from both groups. Early life Hazell was born in Roundstone, County Galway, on the west coast of Ireland, to Thomas Hazell and Cecile Buckley (daughter of VC recipient Cecil Buckley). He attended Tonbridge School until 1911. First World War Upon the outbreak of the war in August 1914, Hazell volunteered for service as a private with the South Irish Horse. On 10 October he was commissioned as second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. As part of the 49th Brigade in the 16th (Irish) Division, the 7th Inniskillings were initially based at Tipperary, where Hazell was promoted to lieutenant on 4 June 1915. His regiment moved to Finner Camp in August 1915, and moved to Woking in England in September. The regiment landed in France in February 1916. Soon after Hazell transferred to the Royal Flying Corps. In April and May he was assigned to No. 5 Reserve Squadron, based at Castle Bromwich. He was appointed a flying officer on 5 June, and survived a severe crash before completing his training, and eventually joined No. 1 Squadron on the Western Front. Flying Nieuport 17 Scouts, he shot down 20 enemy aircraft between March and August 1917, being appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain on 25 May, and was awarded the Military Cross on 26 July. His citation read: Between 25 May and 25 June 1918 he served as an instructor at the Central Flying School, with the acting rank of major. He then took command of \\"A\\" Flight, No. 24 Squadron, flying the S.E.5a. On 22 August 1918, Hazell shot down an observation balloon despite its escort of seven Fokker D.VIIs. The escort was led by German ace Ernst Udet, who attacked and riddled Hazell's petrol tank, propeller, and two longerons with bullets. In spite of this Hazell fought his way back, eyes full of petrol, and landed safely. Udet thought that he had forced the British pilot to crash, and actually claimed him as his 60th victory. Hazell finished the war with 43 confirmed kills, the top British surviving ace of the 1914‚Äì18 war (excluding Dominion airmen). His claims tally consisted of one captured enemy aircraft; ten enemy observation balloons destroyed (two of which were shared); 18 enemy aircraft destroyed (including one shared); and fourteen aircraft driven down 'out of control' (including three shared). Hazell was twice awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and both were gazetted on 2 November 1918. His citations read: On 22 October he was appointed a squadron commander with the acting rank of major, taking command of No. 203 Squadron, flying Sopwith Camels, remaining there until 2 April 1919. On 8 February 1919 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation read: Post-war career On 1 August 1919 Hazell was granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force as a captain, returning to No. 24 Squadron. In June 1920 he took part in the RAF's Aerial Pageant at Hendon, in which he shot down a kite balloon from a Sopwith Snipe. He was promoted from flight lieutenant to squadron leader on 30 June 1922, and commanded No. 55 Squadron, and briefly No. 45 Squadron, as part of Iraq Command. On 22 July 1923 he was posted to the RAF Depot, on his return to the Home Establishment. On 1 December 1923 he was appointed to command of No. 111 Squadron, based at Duxford. On 11 June 1927 he returned to the RAF Depot at Uxbridge, and on 20 July was placed on the retired list at his own request.

(oval). Donated by Mrs. Philip Dix Becker and Family Eulabee Dix Becker (October 5, 1878 - June 14, 1961) was an American artist, who favoured the medium of watercolours on ivory to paint portrait miniatures. During the early 20th century, when the medium was at the height of fashion, she painted many prominent figures, including European nobility and famous actresses of the day. Early life Dix was born in Greenfield, Illinois, to Mary Bartholomew and Horace Wells Dix,Hirshorn, Anne Sue. \\"The portrait miniatures of Eulabee Dix\\". Antiques (November 1, 1994). Accessed at Encyclopedia.com on 2008-01-03. She had an early interest in art, and her talents and love of reading were encouraged from an early age. Her family moved several times during her early years due to financial setbacks. During her teens, Dix went to live with wealthy family members in St. Louis, where she attended Washington University, and spent a year studying oil painting and life drawing at the St. Louis School of Fine Art. Her work there was recognised with two medals. Dix returned to her parents in 1895, when they set up home in Grand Rapids, Michigan. There she taught art classes, and was inspired by the daughter of an Episcopal minister to paint portrait miniatures. New York studies In 1899 Dix moved to New York City, where she first studied with William Merritt Chase, however she left after one week, partly due to Chase's focus on oil painting, and also because she disagreed with his philosophy of colour. She went on to continue her studies at the Art Students League with George Bridgman, of whom she did approve. She also underwent tuition with William J. Whittemore, who taught her the technique of painting on ivory. Whittlemore was a founder of the recently established American Society of Miniature Painters (ASMP), where she exhibited some of her work. She also studied under Isaac A. Josephi, who was the first president of the ASMP. Carnegie Hall Towers studio Dix took a tiny studio apartment at 152 West 57th Street, on the 15th floor of one of the Carnegie Hall towers. Here she worked on commissions for many prominent New Yorkers, including the actress Ethel Barrymore and photographer Gertrude K√§sebier. By coincidence her neighbour, Frederick S. Church, was also from Grand Rapids, and he helped her make contacts within New York artistic circles. Miniaturist Theodora Thayer, whom Dix associated with and admired, also had a studio nearby.

In 1904 Dix met Minnie Stevens Paget, a close friend of Edward VII, and wife of Arthur Paget, a high-ranking officer in the British Army, who later reached the rank of General, and was knighted. They became close friends, and it was to be near Paget that Dix began to divide her time between New York and London. When in London, she took up residence in an up-market residential hotel near Stanhope Gardens, in Kensington. Through her connection with Paget, Dix received commissions from many prominent figures, including the Holywood actress Ethel Barrymore, whom she painted in Philadelphia in around 1905, fashion designer Countess Fabricotti, as well as several from Paget herself. Dix made a number of trips to Europe starting in In 1906, where she profited from greater access to historical miniatures and European paintings than was possible in America. She held her first exhibition, Exhibition of Portrait Miniature by Miss Eulabee Dix, at the Fine Art Society on London's New Bond Street, where she exhibited 24 works. That same year she also held shows at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. In New York Dix had the opportunity to paint writer Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known by his pseudonym Mark Twain. In 1908 she did the last painting of him from life. Dix as a subject Robert Henri, Lady in Black Velvet. Portrait of Eulabee Dix, 1911 Dix herself was the subject of two portraits by renowned artist Robert Henri, to whom she was introduced in 1910 by prominent Irish artist John Butler Yeats. For one of these, she posed for a full-length portrait in her wedding dress. She was also photographed on at least four occasions by her friend Gertrude Kasebier. Marriage On December 22, 1910 Dix married Alfred Leroy Becker, a New York lawyer, after a three-year engagement. The marriage produced two children, Philip and Joan. File:Eulabee Dix, Philip Dix Becker, 1912.jpgEulabee Dix, Philip Dix Becker, 1912, watercolor on ivory, 3\\" in diameter, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York John Butler Yeats, referring to Eulabee Dix's strong personality, wrote to his daughter Lily the day after the wedding: :I once told her [Dix] I would not envy the man that she married, for she would be sure to devour him. She has a clinging way like ivy, which we know always kills the tree to which it attaches itself The marriage ended in 1925, after 15 years. It had been a strained marriage, partly because both of them had pursued successful careers in their chosen field. The situation was made worse when Dix aborted a pregnancy against her husband's wishes. Becker ended the marriage by declaring his love for another woman. Changing fortunes Following her divorce in 1925, Dix sailed with her children to France, and divided her time between Europe and New York. She won a medal at the Paris Salon in 1927, and also in New York and Philadelphia in 1929. The stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting depression were to affect Dix's work, as many of her former clientele had seen their fortunes wiped out. Frustrated with her stagnant career, she became estranged from her son, Philip, who went to live with his father. Dix moved to East 57th Street, where she lived for around seven years. Despite now living in a working-class neighbourhood, she continued to dress in extravagant outfits, always wearing a hat and carrying a cane. When miniaturism went out of favour in the 1930s, she gave lectures on the art of miniature painting. She also adapted her techniques, turning to floral still life paintings, and large oil works. In 1937, with her daughter now married, Dix moved to Southern California, where at first she lived on a ranch near Santa Barbara. In an attempt to find emotional stability, she briefly joined a community of monks led by Ananda Ashrama, who preached religious tolerance and simple living. Despite her impatience, the experience reportedly had a calming effect on her. Declining years During World War II Dix took a job with the Plas-Tex Corporation painting radium on airplane parts. During this time she suffered from exposure to radiation, which resulted in a small pension. Following this, she worked in a laundry, and joined the International Association of Machinists, drilling holes in airplane parts. She was justifiably proud of her part in helping the war effort, but her painting all but stopped. Despite this, she exhibited in the miniature division of the California Art Club. Her last miniature portrait was of her granddaughter, Elizabeth Becker, started in January 1950, added to in April, 1950 at her 3d avenue studio in NYC and unfinished due to her failing eyesight. Her grandson was visiting during Easter break from Hingham, MA, and noted her difficulty in getting \\".. good light\\" (her words) in the studio under the 3d ave EL. It remains in her archives at The American Museum of Women in the arts. Her grandson, Peter Becker, delivered it there spring 1998 from her daughter-in-law (Mildred P. Becker) holdings during the final distribution of Mrs. Becker's remaining art work holdings under her trust. Her last portrait commission, in 1951, was from Kaufman Thuma Keller, who at the time was Chairman of the Board of the Chrysler Corporation. However deteriorating eyesight meant she was unable to finish the painting. In 1956, aged 78, Dix sold her possessions and moved to Lisbon, Portugal where in 1958 an exhibition spanning her life's work was held at Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga. It was her last exhibition, and newspapers in New York and Portugal carried articles. Her last portrait, a head and shoulders, thought to be of the wife of the American Ambassador to Portugal (1958), was done in Lisbon during this time. It is on loan to the Museum of Nebraska Art in Kearney, from her grandson, Peter Becker. Robert Henri's wedding dress portrait of Dix is also in The Museum of Nebraska Art's permanent collection. Dix returned to the United States in 1961, moving in with her son and his wife in Woodbury, Connecticut. On June 14, 1961, the day before she was due to be moved to a care home, Eulabee Dix died. She was interred at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. Legacy Dix's work hangs in several institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon; the National Museum of American Art, Washington DC; and the National Portrait Gallery, Washington, D.C. The Museum of Nebraska Art holds Robert Henri's wedding portrait of Dix as well as a dozen of her works. The National Museum of Women in the Arts has in its permanent collection over 86 of her paintings. They also hold an archive of letters, journals and other manuscripts relating to Dix's life, as well as her palette and brush, her awards, and a pencil sketch by John Butler Yeats. The archive, known collectively as the Eulabee Dix Papers, was entrusted to the museum in 1989 by Joan Becker Gaines, Dix's daughter. ReferencesFurther reading * Ridley, Jo Ann (1997).

It rises in the center of a vast park anchored with several lakes. The ch√¢teau was built for grand receptions during the Second Empire and hosted many prestigious guests. The harmonious architecture of the building is the result of a union between spaciousness and refinement in the classical style. The palace can be visited in group visits and can be rented exclusively. At Baronville, you may celebrate your wedding, hold a seminar or a business meeting, launch a product, or use for a photo shoot or film setting.  From the Roman Empire to the Counts de Roug√©  Nowadays' Baronville is the third ch√¢teau built on the same place. The name Baronville dates back to the Roman Empire. It was at this time that the place was called Baronis Villa, meaning 'house of the baron', itself a title held by 'hommes forts', who were charged with the protection of the empire's borders. In the Middle Ages, the ch√¢teau was a fortified manor house, of which there still remains a significant part of the drainage system, the foundations and cellars. Local legend has it that the Pucelle d'Orl√©ans, or Saint Joan of Arc, saved Baronville and the surrounding countryside from English occupation during the Hundred Years' War. Between 1620 and 1623, a Louis XIII ch√¢teau was built on the same site by Claude de Montescot and his son, Jacques. In 1783, the d'Aligre family bought Baronville. Originally from Chartres, this family had already given two great chancellors of France and Gardes des Sceaux: Etienne Ist, marquis d'Aligre, Chancellor of France from 1624 to 1635, and Etienne II, marquis d'Aligre, Chancellor from 1674 to 1677. Etienne Fran√ßois, marquis d'Aligre and count de Marans spent a considerable part of his fortune in restoring the ch√¢teau and its former gardens. The property of the d'Aligre family, as well as their name and titles, were transferred by marriage to the noble house of the marquess of Pomereu by royal command on 21 December 1825. Armand, marquis de Pomereu d'Aligre, destroyed the second ch√¢teau in 1867 and commissioned the architect L√©on de Sanges to design the present ch√¢teau, which was finished in 1868. The same talented workers worked on the roofs of Baronville, of Mont Saint-Michel (France) and on the Statue of Liberty in New York (USA). During the World War I, Catherine de Clermont-Tonnerre, Viscountess de Pomereu d'Aligre, set up a military hospital on the estate. During World War II, Field-Marshal Friedrich Paulus made his headquarters in Baronville, and several other German units (including the Luftwaffe) occupied the Ch√¢teau. After decades of restorations of the park and the palace, it could be rented for exclusive events since 1980. The Estate is now home of the Count and Countess de Roug√© (see House of Roug√©), since the last Pomereu d'Aligre of this line married Count Claude de Roug√©. In 2011, the Count Aymeric de Roug√©, great-grand son of the Marquis de Pomereu d'Aligre, restored (or \\"rebuilt\\") most of the Carrousel de Baronville, in order to host events and seminars. This part is opening in 2012, after one year of refurbishments. Aymeric de Roug√© now manages the entire estate.  Famous guests  Among other famous guests, Baronville hosted Paul Pogba, Geoffrey Kondogbia, American model Hilary Rhoda, Korean actress Han Ye-seul, Chinese actress Angelababy, Brazilian footballer Ronaldo, French actress Audrey Tautou, Italian-American actor Alessandro Nivola, Daniela Cicarelli, Roger Hanin, Belgian filmstar Beno√Æt Poelvoorde, Prince Jean of Luxembourg, Anne Fontaine, Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, King of Saudi Arabia, French actress Marie Gillain, Sir Elton John, Mr. Pierre Salinger, Michel Galabru, French actor, Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, 13th and last emperor of Vietnam, Charlotte Casiraghi, Philippe S√©guin, as well as a considerable number of French ministers, international diplomats and many others.

Childhood Roberts was born in Mexico, Missouri, the younger of two surviving daughters of James H. and Mary Harris Roberts.Many architecture scholars have misidentified Roberts' parents; mistakenly stating that Wright's client Charles E. Roberts was her father. He was not. See for example: The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, by William Allin Storer, Second Edition, p. 150. Isabel Roberts' father, James H. Roberts was the son of William and Sarah Roberts of Utica, New York. Charles E. Roberts was the son of David and Elizabeth Roberts. Charles E. Roberts and James H. Roberts were not siblings, in fact, no family connection has been found between these two men. James was a mechanic and inventor born in Utica, New York; Mary, a homemaker and a native of Prince Edward Island. They had been married in 1867 in New York state. They lived for a time in Missouri, where Roberts and her sister Charlotte were both born. Leaving Missouri, the Roberts family moved several more times, including to Providence, Rhode Island.United States Census 1880 They eventually settled in South Bend, Indiana,221 S.

This friendship eventually led to Roberts' introducing Laura to Frank Lloyd Wright and Laura's commissioning from Wright's studio the K. C. DeRhodes House. Architectural education Isabel Roberts spent three years in New York City, studying architecture in the atelier Masqueray-Chambers (1899-1901), the first atelier (or studio) in the United States established to teach the practice of architecture along the French lines of the Ecole des Beaux Arts. It was established by Emmanuel Louis Masqueray; architect Walter B. Chambers shared in this enterprise. Located at 123 E. 23rd Street, this was the first wholly independent atelier opened in the United States. Masqueray is best remembered as the architect of the St. Louis Exposition and of the Cathedral of Saint Paul in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Roberts found herself among an impressive roster of future architects who studied with Masqueray, including William Van Alen, who would become the architect of the Chrysler Building. Starting in 1899, Masqueray made a concerted effort to include women among his architectural students and even opened a second atelier especially for women students at 37-40 West 22nd Street in New York. As was said at the time, \\"...he has unbounded faith in women's ability to succeed in architecture...provided they go about it seriously.\\"What Women Can Earn, by Grace Hoadley Dodge, Thomas Hunter, page 109 While in New York, Roberts lived at 129 West 96th Street.1900 United States Census Oak Park, Illinois Isabel Roberts was among Wright's first employees when he left Louis Sullivan and opened his own studio in Oak Park, Illinois. Frank Lloyd Wright was one of a number of emerging architects who were part of a movement that Marion Mahony called The Chicago Group and later came to be known as the Prairie School. The Chicago Group espoused Louis Sullivan's credo, \\"form follows function,\\" which became evident in their work, hallmarks of which include: a close relationship of the building to the landscape, an openness and informality of the floor plans, large overhangs on the exterior structure, a use of horizontal bands and clustered windows and a restrained use of conventionalized forms from nature as a harmonious ornamental theme throughout each building. Also evident were the influences of Japanese architecture and the English Arts and Crafts movement. An early researcher and author on the Prairie Period was Grant Carpenter Manson, who interviewed several of the Oak Park Studio members in 1939 and 1940, and wrote that in the studio Roberts worked as \\"bookkeeeper and general factotum\\" who \\"did occasionally try her hand at design and worked on some of the detail-drawings of her own house\\".Manson, Grant Carpenter, \\"Frank Lloyd Wright: The First Golden Age\\" 1958, page 217. Further clarification of Isabel Robert's role in the Oak Park Studio comes from Wright's son John Lloyd Wright, who observed first-hand the contributions made by Roberts and others in the Oak Park studio. John Lloyd Wright relates that William Drummond, Francis Barry Byrne, Walter Burley Griffin, Albert McArthur, Marion Mahony, Isabel Roberts and George Willis were the draftsmen. He further clarifies that they made up the five men and two women who each were making valuable contributions to Prairie style architecture for which Wright became famous.\\"My Father: Frank Lloyd Wright\\", by John Lloyd Wright; 1992; page 35 Isabel Roberts has been described by Wright scholars as Frank Lloyd Wright's secretary, bookkeeper or office manager. What many have missed is that, like all employees at the time, she contributed to the lively and creative design atmosphere of the Studio. Wright biographer Brendan Gill calls Roberts \\"the office manager of the Oak Park studio\\".Gill, Brendan, \\"Many Masks\\" 1998, page 11. Similarly, Diane Maddex labels \\"Isabel Roberts, the office manager of his studio in neighboring Oak Park.\\"Maddex, Diane, \\"Wright Sized Houses\\", 2003, page 94 David A. Hanks manages only the term \\"secretary\\" to describe Roberts' role.Hanks, David A., \\"The Decorative Designs of Frank Lloyd Wright\\", 1999; page 93 So, too, biographer Meryle Secrest defines Roberts' roll simply as: \\"Isabel Roberts, secretary\\".Secrest, Meryle, \\"Frank Lloyd Wright\\", page 145 H. Allen Brooks skirts the issue with \\"Isabel Roberts, on the staff.\\"Brooks, H. Allen, \\"Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School\\" 1984, p 17. This is consistent with Frank Lloyd Wright's writing about the Oak Park \\"...studio adjoining my home, where the work I had then to do enabled me to take in several draughtsmen and a faithful secretary, Isabel Roberts...\\"Wright, Frank Lloyd, \\"A Testament\\" 1957, page 35 Grant Carpenter Manson wrote \\"Isabel Roberts, for whom one of the most celebrated Prairie Houses was built in River Forest in 1908, was not an architect; she was bookkeeper and general factotum at The Studio...\\"Manson, Grand Carpenter, \\"Frank Lloyd Wright to 1910: The First Golden Age\\", 1958, page 217 Manson's information was incomplete and inaccurate, as shown in the reference letter Wright wrote for Roberts in 1921, as noted below. Melenaie Birk says Roberts was \\"a bookkeeper and assisted with drafting in Wright's Oak Park studio\\".Birk, Melenaie, \\"Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie\\", 1993, p 1889 Roxanne Williamson wrote: \\"Isabel Roberts managed the office but also seems to have done some drafting.\\"Williamson, Roxanne, \\"American Architects and the Mechanics of Fame\\", 1990, page 223 Henry Russell Hitchcock and Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., writing 45 and 55 years later, \\"Isabel Roberts, one of the drafters in his office\\".Hitchcock, Henry Russell and Edgar Kaufmann, \\"The Rise of an American Architecture\\", 1970, page 232. Notably, Thomas A. Heinz presents his view of Isabel Roberts' work while in Wright's employ, saying, \\"She was an architect in her own right and her talent and position in Wright's Oak Park office has been largely ignored and underestimated.\\"Heniz, Thomas A., editorialized in \\"The Vision of Frank Lloyd Wright\\"; pages 140-141 Isabel Roberts also produced some original designs for the leaded art glass windows in the Prairie houses.\\"Miss Roberts works most of the time on ornamental glass...\\" Charles E. White, Jr. Letters, 1903‚Äì1906, by Charles E. White, Jr. from the Studio of Frank Lloyd Wright Among the light- screens she is known to have designed are those in the Harvey P. Sutton House in McCook, Nebraska.Frank Lloyd Wright: His Life and His Architecture, by Robert C. Twombly, p. 111 Charles E. White, Jr., who wrote valuable letters about his time as an architect in the Oak Park Studio, said that Roberts worked on ornamental glass in the spring of 1904, a time when the following projects were underway: Darwin D. Martin House, Burton J. Westcott House, Mrs. Thomas Gale House, Robert M. Lamp House and Unity Temple. The \\"light screens\\" in these may owe their design in part or in full to Roberts.Writings on Wright: Selected Comment on Frank Lloyd Wright, by H. Allen Brooks, p. 84 Isabel Roberts is remembered by her extended family, today, as an architect. More so than other Studio employees, Roberts was often part of the Wright family circle and was frequently a babysitter for their increasingly large family of six children. Photographs taken by Frank Lloyd Wright in front of the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio show her with his wife Catherine, the children, his mother Anna and sister Maginel.See for instance photos in the Oak Park Public Library Collection and in the collection of the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio. Isabel Roberts and Catherine Lee Tobin Wright were exact contemporaries. While she was in Wright's employ, Roberts and her mother commissioned a house from Wright's studio, which is known as the Isabel Roberts House,https://www.flickr.com/photos/jigsawman/3495078024/ in the Chicago suburb of River Forest. Some scholars contend that it is based on an unbuilt commission for Joshua Melson in Mason City, Iowa.Article on W B Griffin on pbs.org The Isabel Roberts House was designed by Isabel Roberts, per her own statement, even though it has always been attributed to Wright, out of whose studio it emerged.Allaback, Sara, \\"The First American Women Architects\\" 2008 The house was designed for Isabel and Mary Roberts to share, which they did for a decade before leaving Illinois. Also, according to her own statement, while in Wright's employ, Roberts designed the K. C. DeRhodes House in South Bend, Indiana, for her South Bend friend, Laura Caskey Bowsher DeRhodes.Allaback, Sara, \\"The First American Women Architects\\" 2008, citing Roberts' AIA application. After Wright went off to Europe with Mamah Borthwick Cheney in 1909, Isabel Roberts was among the remaining Oak Park Studio employees working to complete Wright's unfinished commissions. Wright had arranged for architect Hermann V. von Holst to oversee the work; he, with Studio employees Isabel Roberts and John Van Bergen, as well as Marion Mahoney and Walter Burley Griffin (who were by this time no longer employees but working under contract), brought what work they could to completion‚Äîmuch of it modified to Marion's designs. Then Roberts literally locked the doors of the Oak Park Studio, thus closing the productive Oak Park years of Wright's career. Roberts worked for William Drummond for about a year. During that time, the following works were on the boards: Ralph S. Baker House (1914‚Äì1915), 1226 Ashland Avenue, Wilmette, IL; John A. Klesert House (1915), Keystone Avenue, River Forest IL; First Congregational Church (1915), 5701 West Midway Park, Chicago, IL 60644.Work with Drummond, per her AIA application Orlando, Florida Isabel Roberts and her family, accompanied by members of the William Drummond family, were visitors to St. Cloud, Florida, as early as the winter of 1915.St. Cloud Tribune December 2, 1915, p. 5 Roberts and her mother Mary moved to St. Cloud a decade after the Isabel Roberts House was completed.1920 United States Census Mary Roberts was in failing health due to the lingering effects of influenza. Roberts's sister Charlotte and her husband John B. Somerville were by that time established residents of St. Cloud. Mary Roberts died in Florida, in 1920.Roberts, Mary, Obituary; August 19, 1920 ‚Äì St Cloud (FL) \\"Tribune\\" Once in Florida, Isabel Roberts went into architectural practice with Ida Annah Ryan, who was the first woman in the United States to earn a master's degree in architecture, from MIT. As the firm of \\"Ryan and Roberts\\", they were among no more than a dozen architecture firms active in Orlando in the 1920s. Their business is listed under the heading \\"Architects\\" as \\"Ryan and Roberts\\" in the 1926 and in the 1927 Orlando City Directories, at 240 S. Orange St. and the Kenilworth Terrace address. One of only 10 architectural firms listed in 1926, the others including: Frank L. Bodine, Fred E. Field, David Hyer, Murry S. King, George E. Krug, Howard M. Reynolds, Frederick H. Trimble and Percy P. Turner. And one of 12 firms so listed in Orlando in 1927, which included Maurice E. Kressly.Orlando City Directories, 1926-1931 Soon after arriving in Florida, Roberts attempted to become a member of the Florida chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Letters of recommendation from John Van Bergen, Hermann V. von Holst and Frank Lloyd Wright which accompanied her application make it unmistakably clear that these men who had been her colleagues in Chicago considered Roberts to be an architect.Allaback, Sara, \\"The First American Women Architects\\" 2008 Even so, Roberts was not admitted to the AIA. Nonetheless, throughout the 1920s, the architectural firm of Ryan and Roberts created landmark buildings in Central Florida, some of which still stand, today:Photos of their work can be seen at: https://www.flickr.com/photos/11072784@N06/ Veterans Memorial Library *Veterans Memorial Library, 1012 Massachusetts Ave., St. Cloud, Florida. Isabel Roberts' brother-in-law, John B. Somerville, served on the building committee, a connection which resulted in Ryan and Roberts obtaining this commission. In 1922, an outline of what was desired was laid before architects Miss Ida Annah Ryan and Miss Isabel Roberts of Orlando. The plans submitted by these ladies were subsequently accepted. The architects insisted on a motto. Carlyle's, \\"The true university is a collection of books,\\" was chosen. The building, although described as of Grecian style is in fact reminiscent of the designs of many of the Prairie School small bank buildings of the upper Midwest by Louis Sullivan, William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie, Frank Lloyd Wright and others. It is constructed of hollow tile with stained stucco exterior and is well cared for and in daily use today. It now houses the St. Cloud Heritage Museum. The building is currently owned by the City of St. Cloud; however, the museum is operated solely by volunteers of the Woman's Club of St. Cloud.Information courtesy of Anita Parks; Volunteer Curator; St. Cloud Heritage Museum * Amherst Apartments, 325 West Colonial Drive, Orlando, Florida. The Amherst Apartments were, for many years, Orlando's most prestigious apartment address. Designed by Ida A. Ryan and Isabel Roberts in the Prairie Style and built in 1921-1922, it featured forty-seven apartments situated on the south shore of Lake Concord. The building closely resembles the design for the German Embassy Building (1915) by William Eugene Drummond; Roberts worked for Gunzel and Drummond in 1915. The Amherst Apartments were demolished in 1986. * Tourist Club House, 700 Indiana Ave., St. Cloud, Florida. This club house for the Tourist Club of St. Cloud was opened in the city park on December 3, 1923. Designed by Ida Annah Ryan and Isabel Roberts, it shows the influence of the Prairie School with which Roberts was associated, as a rectangular structure with a barrel-roofed auditorium. Frank Lloyd Wright's Oak Park Studio developed this style with open, airy plans, low-pitched hip or gable roofs, horizontal brick walls, exposed rafter ends, broad overhanging eaves and grouped wood windows. The building was torn down circa 2005. * The Ryan/Roberts Home and Studio, 834 Kenilworth Terrace, Orlando, Florida (private). Ryan and Roberts designed this Mediterranean Revival style home and adjoining studio for their own use in 1920‚Äì24. The stucco structure with gable roof is in a simplified Mediterranean revival style. The former studio faces the street. Details of the design include asymmetrical window placements, decorative attic vents, side yard orientation and gently scalloped corner buttresses. It is a very well maintained private residence today. * The Chapel at the Fisk Funeral Home, 1107-1111 Massachusetts Avenue, St. Cloud.

The building now houses the St. Cloud Twin Theatres.Information courtesy of Anita Parks; Volunteer Curator; St. Cloud Heritage Museum * The Peoples Bank Building, southeast corner of 10th Street and New York Avenue, St. Cloud, Florida. The bank failed in the late Twenties; the building is now used as a cafe and barber shop.Information courtesy of Anita Parks; Volunteer Curator; St. Cloud Heritage Museum * The St. Cloud Presbyterian Church (demolished) was a Mediterranean Revival remodeling of the church building, designed by Ryan and Roberts in the early 1920s. Isabel Roberts was a member of this congregation. Photos of this stylish remodeling may be seen in the St. Cloud Heritage Museum. * Ross E. Jeffries Elementary School, 1200 Vermont Avenue, St. Cloud, Florida, circa 1926; Though positive documentation has been lost to time, records show that the designers of the Mediterranean Revival style school's original building may have been Ryan & Roberts. The building is distinguished by an arched porch in the offset tower main entry and a low profile accentuated by a curved parapet roofed bay. The facade consists chiefly of large tri-part Chicago style windows, with small end windows as accents.Facts Are Elusive As School Marks 75th Anniversary, by Barbara J. Saffir, Orlando Sentinel, November 5, 1997 * Lester M. Austin, Sr. Residence, 541 North Boyd Street, Winter Garden, Florida, circa 1927. A large Mediterranean Revival stucco house with tile roof and triparte arched windows. The Austin Residence is well-maintained and remains in private hands.\\"West Orange Reverie\\" in Reflections, Historical Society of Central Florida, Fall 2009; p. 12 * The Fraser Residence, Orlando, Florida (private). A spacious, elegant Mediterranean Revival stucco mansion situated on one of Orlando's secluded lakes, the Fraser Residence is well-maintained and remains in private hands. Ryan and Roberts' freedom with window shapes and placement is particularly evident in this house, as is their use of round-headed French doors and similar windows, without any 45 degree angle dividers and with the two half circle segments on each side. It was a popular device with the firm and might be thought of as one of their \\"trademarks\\". This home served as Orlando Opera Guild's 1988 Designers' Show House. * Unity Chapel, Orlando (demolished). For many years, this charming building, in a stuccoed English vernacular style, was the worship home of First Unitarian Church of Orlando, near Lake Eola. Ida Annah Ryan was a member of this congregation. Some scholars have had a hard time identifying this building, which Roberts listed on her AIA application. It is not to be confused with Frank Lloyd Wright's famous Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois. * Lake Eola Bandstand (built 1924, demolished)https://books.google.com/books?id=FpbiKJsetJwC&pg;=PA6&lpg;=PA6&dq;=%22ORLANDO+-+HISTORY+IN+ARCHITECTURE%22&source;=web&ots;=n2AJgwHSL3&sig;=xE5_ZbPG9Ll- Jjw17b43b4NnLsM&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=3&ct;=result#PPA18,M1 pages 18-19 Cantilevered hip roof over lozenge shaped deck, with distinctive Prairie Style lamps on the entrance bridge stairs. Additional residential and commercial structures by Ryan and Roberts continue to be identified as current owners become more aware of the significance of the contributions these women made to the field of architecture. Isabel Roberts was a member of the St. Cloud Presbyterian Church (another of their commissions, a remodeling of an older structure, it is now demolished) until she moved from St. Cloud to Orlando in the early 1920s, at which time she joined First Presbyterian Church of Orlando. Isabel Roberts and Ida Annah Ryan lived and practiced at their Kenilworth home and studio in Orlando for the remainder of their lives. Isabel Roberts died in Orlando on December 27, 1955 at the age of 84, and was buried in Greenwood Cemetery, Orlando, alongside her mother Mary Roberts and her sister Charlotte Roberts Somerville; none of their graves have markers.Courtesy of Don Price, Greenwood Cemetery records, Orlando, FloridaDalles, John, \\"The Pathbreaking Legacy of Ryan and Roberts\\", in \\"Reflections\\", the journal of the Historical Society of Central Florida, Summer 2009; pages 8 and 9.

Uranie, Bot. 421. 1829. and 5 in South Africa.Plants of Southern Africa: an Online Check List Description Orchids in the genus Nervilia are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with an oval to almost spherical tuber and sometimes a few short roots. One or two flowers are borne on an erect, fleshy, leafless flowering stem. When flowering the plants lack leaves, but a single erect or gound-hugging leaf develops after the flower has fully opened. The leaves are usually wrinkled or crumpled with distinct, fan-like veins, giving rise to the genus name. The flowers are often short-lived, lasting for only a few days. The sepals and petals are similar, but the labellum is prominent and often composed of three lobes. The genus is poorly understood, mainly because the flower and leaf are present at different times, so that herbarium specimens are often incomplete. Nervilia is the sole member of its subtribe, the Nerviliinae. Taxonomy and naming The genus Nervilia was first formally described in 1827 by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupr√© after an unpublished description by Philibert Commerson. The description was published in his book Voyage autour du monde. The name Nervilia is derived from the Latin word nervus meaning \\"nerve\\", referring to the veined leaves. =Species list= The following is a list of species of Nervilia recognised by the Index Kewensis as at 16 August 2018: *Nervilia acuminata (J.J.Sm.)

Known as Titi in his family circle, he was the third son of the painter Camille and Julie Pissarro.  Life  He was born in Pontoise, Paris, in the year of the first Impressionist exhibition. Like his siblings Lucien and Georges, he spent his formative years surrounded by his father's fellow artists such as Claude Monet and Pierre- Auguste Renoir who frequented the Pissarro home. F√©lix's works very early demonstrated great strength and originality. His father regarded him as the most promising of his sons but before he was able to realise his full potential, he contracted tuberculosis and died in a sanatorium at 262 Kew Road, Kew (which is now in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames), at the age of 23.

History=World War II= The squadron was constituted in a major Army reorganization of October 1933, but it was not activated until 1939, shortly after World War II had begun in Europe and the Air Corps began to expand. The squadron was allotted to the Fourth Corps Area and partly organized by July 1934 with reserve personnel at Shreveport, Louisiana and assigned to the 2d Transport Group, On 5 June 1936 it was allotted to the Fifth Corps Area and again organized with reserve personnel at Columbus, Ohio by August 1937. All reserve personnel were withdrawn from the squadron in October 1939.Clay, p. 1374 The squadron was activated on 14 October 1939, at Olmsted Field, Pennsylvania and assigned to the 10th Transport Group. Relieved from the 10th Transport Group on 1 December 1940 and assigned to the 60th Transport Group. Relieved from the 60th Transport Group on 19 May 1941 and assigned to the 61st Transport Group. The squadron made airlift history during World War II when, in October 1942, it moved to Port Moresby, New Guinea. Then flying Douglas C-47 Skytrains, the 6th became the first personnel transport squadron to fly in the Pacific. It was during this assignment that the squadron earned the nickname Bully Beef Express, as it carried tons of boiled beef to allied combat troops in Australia and New Guinea. The French called it \\"boujili boef', and the Americanization of the term has continued to this day to be the squadron's emblem. The 6th performed aerial transportation in the Pacific Theater and Southwest Pacific Theater during World War II and in the Far East during the Korean War and after until 1968. =Strategic airlift= It has performed worldwide airlift operations since April 1970. The 6th conducted resupply missions in support of scientific stations in the Antarctic during Operation Deep Freeze from 1971 to 1974. It resupplied Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. It evacuated Vietnamese refugees during the fall of Saigon in April through June 1975.

Formerly an independent community, it was incorporated into Zurich in 1934 to build district number 12. The district comprises the quarters Schwamendingen Mitte, Saatlen and Hirzenbach. The district numbers 11 and 12, both based in Glatt Valley, are commonly referred to as Zurich North.  History  Schwamendingen was an Alemannic settlement, named after one Swuamund, archaeologically attested from the 5th century. The settlement was given to the Grossm√ºnster in the 9th century after the death of its last Alemannic owner, Picho son of Ertilo. The settlement is recorded as consisting of ten houses in 915. The Grossm√ºnster presented the village with a church bell in 1461. During the Swiss Reformation, the first Protestant pastor in Schwammendingen, Hans Schmid, took office in 1526. Schwamendingen and Oerlikon became independent municipalities in 1872. These were incorporated into the city of Z√ºrich in 1934, together with Seebach, Affoltern, Witikon, H√∂ngg, Altstetten and Albisrieden.  Population  Schwamendingen counts a population of approximately 32,500 people. With a foreign population of 37%, it's above the city-wide average of 30%, most likely relating to the relatively low cost of living.  Traffic  The A1 motorway crosses Schwamendingen. In 2006 and 2011, the city, canton and country have agreed to loans being used for a 900m long enclosure, aiming to decrease the noise and air pollution in the community. Tram numbers 7 and 9 are connected to Schwamendingen, as well as bus lines 61, 62, 75, 79, 94 and 787.

With a filmography spanning six decades and nearly 30 films, Grigsby occupies a unique position in British documentary filmmaking, having witnessed and commented on many of the dramatic changes in British society (and beyond) from the late 1950s into the next century. As a critic noted, \\"from Michael Grigsby back to John Grierson runs an unbroken tradition in British documentary-making: a passionate commitment to the poetry of everyday life.\\"Matthew Sweet \\"Michael Grigsby: Shooting on the Edge\\", The Independent, 22 June 2004 Early life and career Born in Reading, Berkshire, Grigsby‚Äôs passion for documentary dates back to his time at Abingdon School, an independent boarding school for boys, where he attended from 1949 through 1955. There, he ran the school‚Äôs film society and discovered the films of John Grierson‚Äôs documentary movement. These had an amazing impact on then 14-year-old boy. While at school, he also talked the headmaster into funding his first attempts at documentary filmmaking. He produced Ut Proficias in 1953, which was placed with the British Film Institute. Another film, No Tumbled House (1955), deals with the realities faced by a boy in a boarding school. Career After leaving Abingdon, he gained his first job as a trainee assistant editor at Granada Television in Manchester, working with Harry Watt, who had co-directed the short film Night Mail (1936). Unfortunately, Watt left shortly afterwards, and Grigsby was then offered a job as a studio cameraman, which by his own admission was very dull, but gave him a chance to purchase his own 16mm Bolex camera. Along with a bunch of disaffected Granada colleagues, he set up a filmmaking collective, Unit Five Seven, and spent several years shooting and editing Enginemen, a short film about work in a locomotive shed, in his spare time. By chance, the critic and filmmaker Lindsay Anderson heard of his project. Anderson was particularly impressed by the rushes, and with fellow filmmaker Karel Reisz, he helped Grigsby secure funding from the British Film Institute to complete the film, which was included in the last Free Cinema programme at the National Film Theatre in March 1959, alongside Reisz‚Äôs We Are the Lambeth Boys and Robert Vas‚Äô Refuge England. Growing in confidence, Grigsby made another short documentary with the Unit Five Seven, Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday (1962), about mill workers in Blackburn, Lancashire preparing for the weekend. After these two well received shorts, he succeeded in persuading Granada to support his work and was finally allowed to direct his first documentary for the company, Deckie Learner (1965). Later work Michael Grigsby at the NFT in 2004 His work continued to demonstrate a fidelity to the concerns and principles embodied in these early films. Grigsby set out to make films about ordinary people, and those at society‚Äôs margin. He gained a reputation as a filmmaker who ‚Äì to use his own words ‚Äì \\"gives a voice to the voiceless\\". Thus, whether he‚Äôs filming trawlermen (Deckie Learner, 1965; A Life Apart, 1973), the survivors on both sides of the Vietnam War (I Was a Soldier, 1970; The Search, 1991; Thoi Noi, 1993), ordinary inhabitants of Northern Ireland (Too Long a Sacrifice, 1984; The Silent War, 1990; Rehearsals, 2005), families facing up to social disintegration in Thatcher‚Äôs Britain (Living on the Edge, 1987) or the traumatised Lockerbie community 10 years after the Boeing 747 disaster (Lockerbie, A Night Remembered, 1998), Grigsby does his utmost to let people speak for themselves. Hence his belief in the importance of long research periods (up to six months) prior to shooting, to gain the participants‚Äô trust; hence also the still frames, the long meditative shots and the moments of silence, allowing people the space in which to get their points across. This unhurried pacing appears truly daring when compared to the frenetic filmic vocabulary more favoured today. Grigsby‚Äôs documentaries have also been compared to free-form jazz; he liked working instinctively, and the structure of his films generally came to him only after he had built a real understanding of the place, the landscape and the people. His films‚Äô inner quality also comes from the highly creative way in which he arranged sounds (often a combination of natural sounds, snatches of dialogues, archive material and live or added music) and images, thus creating symbolic contrasts between them, rather than resorting to a didactic voice-over commentary. In short, Grigsby used eminently cinematic techniques more frequently associated with art cinema than with documentary television. Although he addressed political issues (Northern Ireland, labour relations, effects of wars), there is no crude attempt in his films to ‚Äòpropagandise‚Äô. Instead, he utilises the documentary genre in a unique fashion, bringing his humanist vision to bear on problems in society, so that viewers become participants too - involved, engaged and thinking. Influenced by John Grierson‚Äôs documentary movement, emerging as part of Free Cinema, his approach reaching maturity during documentary television‚Äôs golden age, Grigsby at the later stages of his career came full circle. Still as active and enthusiastic as ever despite the current lack of support for independent, imaginative documentaries in British television, amongst a number of new documentary features, he was working to develop his first fiction feature film. He also returned to the place where he made his first film as a pupil, Abingdon School, to set up the AFU Abingdon Film Unit in 2003 with Jeremy Taylor, the school's Head of Drama, where over thirty boys (and girls from the neighbouring school of St Helen and St Katharine), aged 12 to 18, worked together under their supervision along with several other industry professionals to make a handful of short films each year. He was as proud of this new enterprise as of his finest films; he saw it as his own way of passing on the torch of the great British documentary tradition to the next generation of filmmakers. The Abingdon Film Unit itself has gained significant press, owing to films such as Gravel & Stones (2007), a documentary which focuses on the impact of disability on people in Cambodia, a country that, after thirty years of war, has one of the highest rates of disability in the developing world; and also One Foot on the Ground (2010): a 24-minute film which follows a young Moldovan basketball-player, Andreii Zelenetchii, as he struggles to keep alive his dream of playing professional in Europe‚Äôs poorest country. The Unit has now produced over 150 films, many of which have been screened at festivals throughout the UK and abroad, with a number winning awards along the way. Festivals include Raindance, the London International Documentary Festival and the British Film Festival in Dinard, France. Awards include Best Documentary and Best Animation at the Future Film Festival in London and the National Young Filmmaker‚Äôs Award at the Leeds Student Film Festival. In 2012 Grigsby's non fiction feature, 'We Went to War' was released. Co-authored with creative producer Rebekah Tolley, the film is a follow up to Grigsby's film, I Was a Soldier (1970), and returns to the stories of the three Vietnam veterans of the earlier film: David, Dennis and Lamar, forty years after their return from combat to their homes in the heartlands of Texas.

Members provided the local birth, marriage and death registration service, the majority working in local Register Offices. After decades of campaigning, together with UNISON, the major public service union, the Society finally succeeded in seeing statutory registration officers receive legal employment status in 2007 when, on 1 December of that year, they became employees of their relevant local authority following the enactment of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007. The Society also played a major part in the development of the registration service over many years, working closely with the General Register Office and local authorities. Its membership had an exceedingly close and strong attachment to their work and therefore to the service they delivered to the public. With the arrival of the long-awaited employment status for the field registration officers the Society, as a trade union, had no further role to play. The majority of its members were also members of UNISON. On 12 March 2009 a resolution was passed that the Society be dissolved. The Registrar of Trades Unions concurred in January 2010 and the Society of Registration Officers closed for business with the same dignity with which it had vigorously pursued its aims for many decades.

It allows a breed registry to direct the evolution of the breed towards the ideal by eliminating unhealthy or undesirable animals from the population. The removal of individuals from a population is called culling, and does not suggest killing the animal in question. Typically, culls are castrated or they and their offspring are unable to be registered. Registries which implement studbook selection differ from registries which require only two parents of the proper pedigree or registration status. For example, a horse foal with two Thoroughbred parents is almost certainly a Thoroughbred, but a foal with two Oldenburg parents may not be accepted through studbook selection to be an Oldenburg. The pattern of studbook selection varies from nation to nation and registry to registry, but among horse registries, particularly warmblood registries, the general outline includes an inspection of foals before formal registration, evaluation of conformation and movement of broodmares, and evaluation of the conformation, movement, health, and performance ability of stallions. Decisions about which mares and stallions are suitable breeding stock are made by elected breed judges, who strive for objectivity and transparency. Foal inspection Oldenburg brand showing the last 2 digits of the UELN Foals are usually presented at a local mare and foal show by their dam's side. If the foal's sire and dam are in the studbook, and he generally fits into the breeding goal, he receives his papers and a brand on the left thigh. The brand identifies his registry. Although foals are not usually scored, some registries award \\"Premium\\" status to high-quality foals, and colts may be deemed stallion prospects by the judge(s). Foal inspections are also used to determine whether or not a stallion is producing offspring that fit the breeding goal. Studbook inspection The first method of evaluating breeding stock in many warmblood registries is the studbook inspection. Fillies may be evaluated at age 3 at a local mare and foal show, and colts may be evaluated at age 2 at the K√∂rung, which translates to \\"breed survey\\", \\"bonitation\\" or \\"licensing\\". Typically there are prerequisites in terms of pedigree and height, which vary depending on the registry. Most registries would like to see colts at least 15.3 hands high at the withers, and fillies at least 15.2hh, with the expectation that they will grow a bit more. Pedigree requirements also vary, and many studbooks expect to see only stallion sons of Main Mare Book mares. This encourages local breeders to keep high-quality mares in the region. Preferably, future breeding stock have at least 4 generations of approved sport horse pedigree. Mares with less pedigree, or less than is desirable to her registry, may be entered into a \\"Pre-Mare Book\\", though she generally cannot produce stallion sons. What constitutes \\"approved\\" also depends on the registry. Most studbook inspections follow a similar outline. The horse is judged on their conformation from each side, and then led to and away the judge(s) at the walk and trot on a hard surface to show the gaits. To evaluate the canter, horses are turned loose in an enclosed area one at a time. To evaluate jumping ability, the horse is sent down a chute over fences without a rider (\\"free jumping\\"). Horses are scored from 1 to 10 on a variety of traits, which may include any of the following: =Type= Type is a subjective quality, divided into \\"breed type\\" and \\"sex type.\\" A horse with high sex type exhibits strong secondary sex characteristics; in other words, feminine mares and masculine stallions. Breed type varies widely between registries, but essentially refers to the attractiveness of the horse and its suitability for sport. This aesthetic is an important part of breeding marketable horses, though registries and their judges tend to be conscious of the danger of overweighting beauty. =Conformation= Standards of conformation do not vary as significantly for horses as they do for dogs, as a horse's conformation is extremely important to its ability to perform and stay sound doing so. Generally, all horses are ideally divisible into three equal parts: forehand, trunk, hindquarters. This is called \\"harmony\\" and has that effect on the eye. Another quality generally agreed upon is that from the front and rear, all four legs should be straight. Beyond that, uphill build, high-set neck, a mobile head-neck connection and long legs are more important in dressage horses than jumping horses. The musculature and outline of the back and loin, called the topline, is important to most registries, as are large joints and hooves with \\"dry\\" legs. Conformation scores are usually broken down further to allow breeders to compare specific traits in horses - for instance the \\"forelimbs\\" and \\"hindlimbs\\" are almost always awarded separate scores. =Gaits= The walk, trot, and canter are the gaits needed for sport. All three are important for dressage, and the canter is especially important for jumping. In all three, a long stride and even rhythm are paramount. Most registries look for a diligent, marching walk in which the entire body is used. The trot and canter are ideally energetic with obvious suspension (moment in which the horse is totally airborne) and an elastic quality. The energy for all three gaits should come from the hind end. Scores may be given for \\"walk\\", \\"trot\\" and \\"canter\\" individually, with a separate score for \\"correctness of gaits\\". Some registries do not ask to see the mare canter, though this is uncommon. The canter is, in some cases, weighted more heavily for jumping mares. =Jumping= The free jump can give insight into the jumping talent of a horse. At inspections, stallions in particular are judged on their ability to jump and their form. The best jumpers approach the jump confidently and alter their stride to find the correct take-off spot (\\"scope\\"), arc over the jump (\\"bascule\\") and draw their forelegs up out of the way. Horses that do not arc over the fence, knock down fences, lose their rhythm, dangle their legs or hold their heads high and stiff are not good jumpers. All registries require stallions to free jump to pass the studbook inspection, though usually dressage-oriented stallions are not asked to jump as high. Mares may not jump at all, or may only be asked to jump if they are from jumping-oriented families. =Overall impression= The category for \\"overall impression\\" gives the judge(s) a place to comment on other qualities. Obvious behavioral tendencies or personality traits may be noted here, as is the physical maturity of the horse. =Results= Most registries require that a stallion earn an average 7.0 with no score below 5.0 to be licensed. Mares who do not earn a sufficient score (usually average 6.0 none below 5.0) are usually entered into the Pre-Mare Book. Health examinations Almost all studbooks have some type of health requirement for stallions seeking approval. The veterinary exam may occur before, during, or after the K√∂rung, and always rules out stallions with congenital defects of the genitalia or dentition. Stallions may also undergo radiographs to screen against OCD, laryngoscopies to screen against airway obstructions, and semen analysis to ensure fertility. Stallions which have had surgeries or other treatments to correct a congenital defect are not allowed to breed. Based on the registry, stallions may have to be free of cribbing, recurrent airway obstruction (\\"heaves\\"), equine recurrent uveitis (\\"moon blindness\\"), laryngeal hemiplegia (\\"roaring\\"), glanders, etc. Performance tests Performance tests take place when the breeding horses are old enough to be ridden, and are designed to give the registry detailed, objective information on the actual performance ability of the horses. It is mandatory for a stallion to prove himself in sport, and mares complete performance requirements to earn awards. Mare performance tests () are often open to geldings, as well. By comparing mother-daughter scores, patterns in the traits that stallions pass on can be calculated. A performance test for mares or geldings is either a one-day \\"Field Test\\" or 2- to 5-week \\"Station Test\\". A stallion performance test () is either a 30-day \\"suitability test\\", or a \\"station test\\" lasting 70, 100, or even 300 days. Today, only young stallions owned by the State Stud of Celle attend the 300-Day Test. The suitability test must be combined with a performance record in order to fulfill a stallion's performance requirement. =Field test= The field test lasts only one day and is designed for mares and geldings with some education under saddle. In a field test, the horse is scored on the basic gaits, free jumping ability, and rideability. A guest rider is also used. =Station test= The station test is attended by young horses, held separately for stallions, is made up of an initial training period and a final test. The training environment, usually held at one of the state-owned stud farms, is standardized to increase the reliability of the results. Before the final test, the training director scores the horses on a number of traits. The final test is run by visiting experts and guest riders, who also score the horses. The results of the station test provide insight into the characteristics that make a riding horse: not just physical ability, but the interior qualities that make him or her a good partner. Horses attending a station test are evaluated on the following: Interior qualities The scores for the \\"inner\\" qualities are given by the training director, who depends on the input of the horse's riders and handlers. The interior qualities include character, temperament, constitution, and willingness. A horse with a good character is affable and people-oriented, and does not display defensive reactions such as ear-pinning during grooming, saddling, or everyday handling. A horse with a good temperament is balanced, attentive, responsive, sensitive with a desire to please. A horse with a good constitution is resilient physically and psychologically, not succumbing to pressure, and is healthy with a lot of stamina. A willing horse is courageous, curious, trainable and does not balk from being asked to work. Gaits The basic gaits are evaluated under saddle both during the training period and by the guest experts. The regulations require that the movements be as natural as possible. A good walk is flat-footed with a regular 4-beat rhythm, diligent with long stride. A poor walk is arhythmical, pacey or short-strided. A good trot and canter are rhythmical and never disconnected. The stride is long, the horse swings through a relaxed topline. The trot and canter are elastic and give the impression that the horse is pushing from the rear. In particular, the canter must have a distinct uphill tendency. Short or choppy canter strides are not desirable. Jumping Jumping is scored a number of different ways. The training director scores his or her general impression of the horse's aptitude, and the experts evaluate the horse while jumping with and without a rider. A good jumper never loses the rhythm of his canter. He approaches the jump in balance, arcs over the fence (bascule), draws both the front and rear legs out of the way, and adapts his stride to the space between the jumps (scope). Rideability Rideability is scored by both the training director and the guest riders, and is of paramount importance. A highly rideable horse is comfortable and uncomplicated to ride, and does not require the rider to hold him or her up (self-carriage). The horse is balanced, attentive, intelligent and obedient. Cross country The cross-country test serves to test the stallion's stamina, though he is also judged on his canter and jumping during this part of the final test. His recovery time and heart rate are taken as part of the veterinary examination. =Results= The 70-Day, 100-Day and 300-Day tests fulfill a stallion's performance requirements, and both the station and field tests satisfy a mare or gelding's. A stallion that attends the suitability test must perform at an age-appropriate level in open competition to complete his requirements. A mare or stallion may also fulfill these requirements with performance at a higher level of competition. Most registries prefer to see show results in dressage and show jumping, though eventing and combined driving are sometimes permitted. Some North American branches of sport horse registries even accept show results in show hunters. Registries may have further requirements for stallions to retain their approval for breeding. Most will disapprove a stallion whose offspring do not fit the breeding aim. Awards In the past, registries offered breeders a monetary prize or \\"premium\\" for exceptional mares. The condition of accepting the prize was that the mare couldn't be exported, a method of ensuring that high-quality mare lines were not lost. Today, mares can earn the \\"States Premium\\" award by receiving above-average scores on her studbook inspection and completing the performance requirements. Such a mare is recognized by the prefix \\"St.Pr.St.\\" or \\"SPS\\" before her name. Mares who complete these requirements but don't fit the pedigree regulations can earn the \\"Verbands Premium\\" or \\"Registry Premium\\", which has the prefix \\"V.Pr.St.\\". A stallion may also earn a premium.

As of 2011, it had a population of 21,783. History Dimbaza, which was originally known as Mnxesha, was created as a rural resettlement township, \\"an apartheid dumping ground\\", in November 1967. The first people to settle in Dimbaza arrived in trucks in November 1967 and early 1968, with a rapid increase in numbers between December 1968 and February 1969. By March 1969, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development (BAD) M.C Botha put the population at 2,897, of whom 2,041 were children. The numbers had increased to 3,400 by May. By 1971, the population was sitting at around 7,000, and by 1972 it had reached almost 10,000. Over half of the households in Dimbaza after the resettlement were headed by women. Dimbaza was also used as a dumping ground for ANC and PAC ex-prisoners. Banned Dimbaza residents who were ex-political prisoners included: Ernest Tshazimbane, Moses Bonisile Twebe, Jack Madikane, Walter Cola and Daniel Mafenuka. The first settlers in Dimbaza were housed in tin-roofed wooden huts measuring 16‚Äô x 16‚Äô, and ten feet high which had no floors, ceilings and foundations. Rent was fixed at ¬£1.71 per month for a two- roomed house leaving 85% of the population unable to afford to rent the houses. A few four-roomed houses, which accommodated privileged individuals such as teachers, were built. In 1972, a clinic was built in the area. The first primary school opened in March 1969, and by 1972 there were four primary schools and one secondary school. In describing the conditions in Dimbaza in the late 1960 to early 1970s, clergyman Rev David Russell said \\"the overall reality of a place like Dimbaza is its grinding poverty and the helplessness of the great majority of its inhabitants to do anything about improving their lot....The fundamental question is work. At another level the question is why they were removed there at all.\\" The apartheid government was forced to bring in reforms and improve the infrastructure. Housing amenities were improved and settling into the area was voluntary after 1971. After Ciskei gained its independence, Dimbaza was part one of its large township. After the fall of apartheid in 1994, the township became part of the Eastern Cape. Economy To encourage investors to move into the area, rebates on power and water, and wage bill subsidies were offered in the 70s', and after Ciskei gained 'independence' as a homeland in 1981, a flat 15% tax rate was charged. In 2016, the Eastern Cape government announced that R344-million had been set aside for the establishment of an industrial hub in Dimbaza.

It is located in St. Helena, Californiacalwineries.com Bob Trinchero and owned by Trinchero Family Estates.  History  In 1874 the Swiss-German immigrant John Thomann established a small winery and distillery in St. Helena in central Napa County, California. After his death, the winery and Victorian home beside it were sold to another Swiss family, the Leunbergers, who renamed the estate Sutter Home. As with most Napa Valley wineries, Sutter Home was shut down during Prohibition. The winery remained abandoned until 1948, when it was purchased by John and Mario Trinchero, immigrant brothers from New York City whose family had been active in the Italian wine business. The Trincheros refurbished the winery and began producing Napa Valley wines, initially scraping by making generic jug wines. For years they operated ‚Äúmom-and-pop‚Äù style, selling to their Napa Valley neighbors, who filled their barrels and bottles at the winery‚Äôs back door.Harvesting the Dream In 1968 Louis ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Trinchero (Mario's oldest son) began vinifying Amador County Zinfandel. =White Zinfandel= In 1972, another of Bob Trinchero‚Äôs innovations provided the American wine consumer with a new style of premium wine known as White Zinfandel. Initially labeled as an Oeil de Perdrix, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms demanded something in English on the label, and the name, \\"A White Zinfandel Wine\\" was added. By 1975 the name Oeil de Perdrix was removed. A fortunate accident occurred during the making of the 1975 vintage, as some 1,000 gallons of bleed-off juice from red Zinfandel refused to ferment to dryness, retaining a substantial amount of sugar, and Trinchero put the wine aside for the time. He said, \\"Two weeks later, I tasted that wine and it was sweet, had a pink color, and I thought, 'Darn, that's pretty good. We bottled it, and the rest is history.\\" By 1987, Sutter Home White Zinfandel had become the best-selling premium wine in the United States. In 1994, Wine Spectator gave Trinchero its Distinguished Service Award for \\"having introduced more Americans to wine on the table than anyone in history\\". The Sutter Home Victorian house is featured on the wine bottle labels =Present= In collaboration with Bob Torkelson, the Trinchero family manages the large winemaking organization, overseeing operations from grapegrowing and production, marketing and sales. The Trincheros are noted for their industry leadership, commitment to sustainable agriculture and preserving the environment.WRAP of the Year 2005 Today, Sutter Home is the second largest family-owned winery in the world and the fourth largest winery in the United States. All winemaking, bottling, shipping and warehousing operations are concentrated in three modern facilities in Napa County. The original winery site on Highway 29 houses the winery‚Äôs Visitors Center. Production Sutter Home's White Zinfandel production increased from 25,000 cases in 1981 to 1.3 million in 1986. The winery currently produces about 10 million cases a year, with Sutter Home White Zinfandel making up a good percent of the sales. Sutter Home Winery produces 21 varietal wines including Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, White Zinfandel, White Merlot, Gew√ºrztraminer, Chenin blanc, Moscato, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Red Blend, Pinot noir, Pinot grigio, Sweet Red, Red Moscato, Moscato Sangria, Pink Moscato, Riesling Moscato, Sweet Riesling, Ros√©, and Sangria, as of 2020.

He signed the Futurist Manifesto of Aeropainting in 1929. He was associated with the city of Perugia most of his life, living in Milan for six months as a student and in Rome from 1926-39... Dottori's' principal output was the representation of landscapes and visions of Umbria, mostly viewed from a great height. Among the most famous of these are Umbrian Spring and Fire in the City, both from the early 1920s; this last one is now housed in the Museo civico di Palazzo della Penna in Perugia, with many of Dottori's other works. His work was part of the art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics and the 1936 Summer Olympics. Life Dottori was born in Perugia to a working-class family. His mother died when he was eight years old. He was admitted as a young man to the Academy of Fine Arts in Perugia, and was employed at the same time by an antique dealer. In 1906 he worked as a decorator in Milan, where he was able to visit museums and exhibitions. He resumed his studies in 1908, mixing in avant-garde art circles in 99Florence. In 1910 he began work with the magazine Defense dell'Arte. In 1911 he went to Rome where he met Giacomo Balla and became an adherent of Futurism. In 1912 he joined the first Futurist group in Umbria. In 1915 he fought in World War I, at the same time writing Parole in libert√† (\\"Words in freedom\\") which he published under the name G. Voglio. In 1920 he founded the Futurist magazine Griffa!. In the same year he had his first exhibition in Rome. In 1924 he participated in the Futurist Congress, where he had already acquired a certain notoriety, presenting his thesis on Rural Futurism. In the same year he exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the first Futurist to do so. In the course of his life he participated in ten Biennales. From 1926 to 1939 he lived in Rome, contributing to various art magazines. In 1925 he exhibited at the Permanente and in 1927 at the Gallery Pesaro in the first of a series of Futurist exhibitions, including a one-man show in 1931. His major contribution to Futurism was Aeropainting. He was one of the signatories of the 1929 Aeropainting Manifesto, signed also by Benedetta Cappa, Fortunato Depero, Fillia, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Enrico Prampolini and others, who are among its major representatives. In 1932 he was one of the first Futurists to paint sacred subjects, following the Futurist Manifesto of Sacred Art (1931) signed by Marinetti and Fillia. The Futurist involvement in religious art followed the signing of the Lateran Treaty between the Vatican and Fascist Italy in 1929. Crocifissione, Gerardo Dottori (1927) In 1939 Dottori was appointed to the chair of painting at Perugia, remaining in that post until 1947. In 1941 he wrote the Manifesto of Umbrian Aeropainting in which he proposed that the essence of his Futurism lay in the representation of mystically-inclined landscapes. Dottori carried out many mural commissions, including the Altro Mondo in Perugia and the hydroport in Ostia. Mural painting was embraced by the Futurists in the Manifesto of Mural Plasticism at a time when the revival of fresco painting was being debated in Italy. Following a post-war silence around Marinetti's Futurism, Dottori exhibited in 1951 at Bergamini and the 1953 Biennale of Angelicum and continued to exhibit in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1989 a retrospective of Dottori's work was presented at the Gallery San Carlo. Crocifissione (1927), a Futurist representation of the crucifixion of Christ (pictured right) is now housed in the Vatican Museum.
