He was among a group of young Zikist members who expressed militant criticism of colonial rule and urged concerted action to overcome colonialism. Agwuna later became known as the Eze of Enugu Ukwu, serving the town in that position for 5 decades. Biography Beginning in 1947, the Zikist movement under the leadership of Raji Abdallah and his deputy, Agwuna embraced a radical strategy termed positive action which encouraged civil disobedience to actualize nationalist goals. Two major incidents added fire to this strategy, a racial discrimination incident against a black officer at Bristol hotel and the shooting of Nigerian striking workers in Burutu. In 1948, the group published A Call for Revolution which called for civil obedience and written in a way as to provoke radical actions to end colonialism. Delivering a speech on October 27, 1948, Agwuna argued that the country was a police state and positive action such as strikes, boycotts and civil disobedience were necessary to free Nigerians from an exploitative colonial state.Three days after the speech, Agwuna was charged with sedition, an action he had anticipated on the calculation that the movement's subversive publications, arrest of members and harassment would provoke positive action by Nigerians and also divert attention towards a common enemy. Also, they had calculated that Azikiwe would be arrested. However, Azikiwe was not arrested and their ideas had not yet permeated most Nigerian towns and villages. At the trial, he famously told the judge he had no jurisdiction to try him because he is one of the accusers and also the judge. He was convicted and imprisoned for a year. Agwuna became the Eze of Enugu-Ukwu, Anambra State in 1958 and later became Igwe of Umunri in 1960. He established Obu Ofo Nri Museum as a repository of the cultural heritage of Enugu-Ukwu and other Nigerian communities. The museum was established before the Civil War and parts of it was destroyed during the war.

After additional training and equipping in the Moscow Military District it was assigned to 5th Army and went directly into the winter counteroffensive in mid-December. It fought in the battles around Rzhev in the summer and winter of 1942, taking heavy casualties for little gain. In spring of 1943 the division began shifting southwards, campaigning in southeastern Belorussia in the autumn and then moving into the northern Ukraine. On the last day of 1943 the 336th was recognized for its role in the second liberation of Zhitomir and was awarded that city's name as an honorific. During 1944 it continued to advance from western Ukraine into Poland, and in the last month of the war joined 4th Ukrainian Front's advance into Czechoslovakia, gaining additional honors along the way. The division continued to serve briefly into the postwar period. Formation The division began forming at Melekess in the Volga Military District in August, 1941.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 Its order of battle was as follows: * 1128th Rifle Regiment * 1130th Rifle Regiment * 1132nd Rifle Regiment * 909th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 81 Col. Grigorii Mikhailovich Shapovalov took command of the division on September 13, a position he would hold until his suicide in December. As with the 334th Rifle Division, the 336th moved to Gorkii, in 60th Reserve Army, to complete its training and equipping, as best as could be done under the circumstances. =Battle of Moscow= On December 9 the division arrived just west of Moscow to join 5th Army in Western Front, and went right into the offensive against Army Group Center.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 81 This introduction to battle did not go well, and Shapovalov lost control of his men, leading to a disorderly retreat. Overwhelmed by his responsibility, Shapovalov took his own life on December 15. The division came under command of Col. Nikolai Nikolaievich Solovev until March 29, 1942, during which time the command stabilized. 5th Army issued orders on the same day for the division to form a shock group with the 19th and 329th Rifle Divisions to attack from the line Terekhovo - Velkino - Gorbovo - Lyzlovo westward in the direction of Ruza. On December 20 the 336th, backed by the 20th Tank Brigade and 136th Independent Tank Battalion, broke into Ruza and became involved in street fighting with the enemy. However, heavy counterattacks followed the next day, throwing the division and its armor support out of the town. 5th Army renewed its offensive on the night of January 5‚Äì6, 1942, but the 336th was limited to a diversionary role while 32nd Rifle Division led the attack. This produced a breakthrough by January 9. Dorokhovo was taken on the morning of January 14, and 19th Rifle Division was left facing Ruza while the 329th and 336th advanced to outflank the town from the left. Facing the threat of encirclement, the German forces fell back westward, and Ruza was finally liberated on January 17.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 3 and part V, ch. 4 As a result of this fighting the division was gutted, and on the same day received reinforcements from the 43rd Rifle Brigade and was withdrawn into the reserves of Western Front for rebuilding. In February it was back at the front, in 50th Army of Western Front, where it remained until June.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 81 Colonel Solovev was briefly succeeded in command by Maj. A. G. Dobrinskii until April 15, when Maj. Gen. Vladimir Stepanovich Kuznetsov took command of the division, a post he would hold until July 1, 1943, when he moved on to command of 40th Rifle Corps. Battles of Rzhev From June, 1942 until March, 1943, the division was assigned and reassigned among several armies within Western Front. From August to December it saw action in both the First and the Second Rzhev-Sychyovka Offensive Operations while serving in 31st Army.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 81 While 31st Army gained some successes in the summer offensive, the story was quite different come November. The plan for Operation Mars called for the divisions on the left flank of the Army to support the main thrust of 20th Army towards Sychyovka by attacking through the valleys of the Vazuza and Osuga Rivers. The 88th, 336th and 239th Rifle Divisions (north to south) would be supported by the 32nd and 145th Tank Brigades. But when the attack opened on November 24 it was a costly failure. In spite of an apparently effective artillery preparation the defenses of the German 102nd Infantry Division remained largely intact, and inflicted infantry casualties of as much as 50 percent on the attackers, while also decimating the tank brigades, and effectively ended 31st Army's participation in the offensive.David M. Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp. 50, 82-83 In one day of combat, the 336th lost 749 men killed and 2,297 wounded, for a total of 2,946, among the highest casualties in Operation Mars in such a short period of time.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, p. 90 Into Ukraine In early 1943 the 336th was assigned to 20th Army while rebuilding from its Rzhev debacle. In March it was reassigned to 61st Army in Bryansk Front, the start of a southwards trend of the division's combat path. General Kuszetsov was succeeded by Col. Maksim Arsentevich Ignachev on July 2. After fighting through the summer in the offensive to liberate Smolensk, 61st Army went into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in late August, and then into Central Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 81 By September 30 the 336th had been assigned to the 89th Rifle Corps, along with the 356th and 415th Rifle Divisions. On that date, as Central Front continued its drive to the Dniepr, 89th Corps reached the river south of Radul, but was unable to gain a bridgehead on the west bank due to strong German resistance and well-organized artillery and mortar fire. Between October 8 and 14 the Front carried out a major regrouping to prepare for further crossing operations, and the division was ordered, with its Corps, into new positions south of Liubech. Prior to the start of Belorussian (former Central) Front's Gomel‚ÄìRechitsa Offensive in early November, the 336th and the 415th, along with their Liubech sector, were transferred out of 89th Corps and into 13th Army of 1st Ukrainian Front.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 28, 99, 106, 181 A further move later that month took the division to the 15th Rifle Corps in 60th Army. It would remain under those two commands for the duration, and in 1st Ukrainian Front until the last month of the war. In December, while fighting against the German counterattack west of Kiev, each rifle regiment of the division organized a \\"tank fighter\\" group made up of three sappers, and two sections of 3 - 5 men each armed with Molotov cocktails and anti-tank mines for last-ditch close combat antitank work. In late December, despite this heavy fighting, the division had about 7,000 officers and men in the ranks, with an average of 100 men per rifle company, a very respectable strength for a rifle division at that stage of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 81-82 On December 31, the division was recognized for its role in the second liberation of Zhitomir as follows: In the following months the 336th continued with its Army in clearing western Ukraine, helping to liberate Rovno and Lutsk and other towns and cities, in the process of which, by March, 1944, the rifle companies were down to about 80 men each, 30 of which formed a submachine gun platoon in each company.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 82 For most of August the division was in the hands of Col. I. I. Petukhov until he was succeeded by Col. Lazar Vasilevich Grinvald-Mukho, who would remain in command until the last month of the war. On February 19, 1945, the division was recognized for its role in the capture of towns of Gleiwitz and Czekan√≥w with the award of the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class. Into Postwar On April 4, Maj. Gen. Mikhail Fyodorovich Borisov took command of the division, which he would hold for the duration. At about the same time the division, along with the rest of 60th Army, was transferred to 4th Ukrainian Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 82 The soldiers of the division were in western Czechoslovakia when news came of the German surrender. Based on their record of service they carried the full title of 336th Rifle, Zhitomir, Order of Suvorov Division (Russian: 336-—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –ñ–∏—Ç–æ–º–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –æ—Ä–¥–µ–Ω–∞ –°—É–≤–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è), and eight non-commissioned officers had been named Cavaliers of the Order of Glory. On May 28 it was further honored with the award of the Order of the Red Banner. The division was disbanded in the summer of 1945 with the Northern Group of Forces.

Description Oberea pupillata measures between . These beetles have a long and slender body. Head, thorax and abdomen have all about same width, and elytra are not tapered. Head and antennae are black and antennae are shorter than body. Pronotum is orange with two elongated black spots on the sides. The elytra are mostly blackish, yellowish at the base and rather hairy. The body is orange, with black markings on the sides and below the abdomen. The last abdominal segment shows a black mark. The legs are orange. This species in quite similar to Oberea oculata (Linnaeus, 1758). Biology Adults fly from May to September. The life cycle lasts from two to three years. Usually a single egg is laid in a branch of the host plant, after making an incision on the bark. Larvae are xylophagous. These stem borers live and feed mostly in longitudinal galleries on etruscan honeysuckle (Lonicera etrusca).

Opened in 1921, the 800-seat venue hosts a variety of events, including dance and music performances, film screenings, and arts education. Prior to a renovation in 2011, the theater was primarily home to classic films. The Neptune Theatre is operated by the non-profit Seattle Theatre Group, which also operates the Paramount Theatre and Moore Theatre. It is one of several venues that host the annual Seattle International Film Festival. The theater and building were designated a Seattle landmark in 2014. Architecture The Neptune Building, which houses the Neptune Theatre and several small businesses, is described as a \\"vaguely Renaissance Revival style\\", three-story building with a brick facade. Its north facade, facing NE 45th Street, has a prominent marquee with the word \\"Neptune\\" in neon lighting; the final letter \\"e\\" in the marquee is stylized as a trident that appears to pierce the other letters. It was designed by Henderson Ryan, a Kentucky-born architect who also worked on the Moore Theatre and Ballard Carnegie Library. The interior of the Neptune Theatre features a nautical theme, with a central concession stand shaped like a boat, marble finishes, and statues of Neptune. History The \\"U-Neptune Theatre\\" was opened by the Puritan Theatre Company on November 16, 1921, featuring the silent movie Serenade and seating an audience of 1,000 people. The theater was built with a Kimball orchestral theater organ, which was removed in 1943. By the end of the 1940s, the theater was renamed the Neptune, given a small renovation and changed ownership. The theater went through several management changes during the coming decades, suffering from erratic bookings and poor equipment. It was kept afloat in the 1970s by showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, a cult classic film. In 1981, the Neptune came under the ownership of the Landmark Theatres chain, which also owned the Harvard Exit Theatre in Seattle. The company renovated the theater with a new sound and projection system, hoping to bring out the venue's \\"long-sought potential\\". Landmark renovated the theater again in 1994, replacing seating and adding a Dolby Digital and Sony Dynamic Digital Sound system, along with a 16 mm film projector. =Rocky Horror= In 1991, the theater set a record by playing The Rocky Horror Picture Show every week for 14 years, longer than any other movie had played in Seattle. By 1993, it was one of four U.S. theaters which had played the show the longest, according to the National Rocky Horror Fan Club in New York, one of several U.S. theaters playing it in a midnight movie format. =Recent renovation= The theater's exterior in 2011 Landmark lost its lease in 2010 to the Seattle Theatre Group, a non-profit organization that also operates the Moore Theatre and Paramount Theatre. The Neptune was closed for a $700,000 renovation in January 2011 and re-opened on September 25, 2011, becoming a performing arts and music venue in addition to a movie theater. The 2011 renovation saved the building from demolition for the adjoining U District Link light rail station on NE 45th Street. Sound Transit was forced to re-engineer the station to avoid the theater building, and to underpin the Neptune's foundation. After the theater's 2011 renovation, its first act was Pacific Northwest musician Mark Lanegan at a soft opening in June; the official opening in September was marked by a screening of Rocky Horror. The building was nominated to become a city landmark in 2012. The Seattle City Council passed an ordinance in 2014 designating the Neptune Building as a city landmark, levying certain protections on the property.

After that she was a post-graduate at the Institute for New Media at the St√§delschule, Frankfurt (1991-1992) and a research fellow at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne, department for media science (1996-1998). Works Gabriel explores human reality while her work includes robotics, some Virtual Reality (VR) work, installations, performative formats and painting. Perceptual Arena is an interactive and immersive Virtual Reality installation developed by Ulrike Gabriel and otherspace in 1993 for the exhibition Artlab3, Hillside Plaza, Tokyo. This work has been further shown at V2 Exhibition Rotterdam, Le Manege Sallestrau Maubeuge, the Voyages Virtuales exhibitions in Paris, and at the Serious Chiller Lounge in Munich. Perceptual Arena is a realtime virtual environment that explores what the mind can do. This creates an audio-visual space texture that has the interaction of the user as an important attribute. The interaction is simply to be in the space, to distinguish it and to move around and to grab on to the resulting virtual clay. This defines the space and is what's used for the further interaction. The space matches the individual perception. The perceivable evolves through perception of it. To be involved and possibly mess up in this process can transform the world, but can also push it out of balance and therefore destroy. The use of polygons and sounds is created and always changing by the personal views. The viewer is the only thing that can manipulate what is happening. The complexity of the arena world results out of the total interrelation of all its factors which in the end all depend on the users input data. These are some things the viewers might encounter. The view onto the space, their movement in the space, a history of movement and view, a virtual sensor in the field of view which applies history onto the space, the total access with a data glove onto the space through the field of view, and the virtual clay which is object and result of all this factors. In another work called Breath that was established in 1992 the human breath is explored. There are sensors that are used in this project on the belt that they wear that regulates breathing. The people who use them can alter the dynamics of the sounds that are being duplicated around them. The breathing causes the polygons in the computer-generated image to fluctuate. It is said that the more you breath regularly the more complicated and disorganized the visual and acoustic processes become. Ulrike Gabriel creates a complicated system of biofeedback that goes beyond normal relationships between action and reaction. The way interaction with human beings is being used is something that is explored way beyond a normal mind. Gabriel is using her mind to go beyond the depths and think outside the box. The way that breath in this project is being used is connected with virtual space in which the spectator experiences in a cybernetic world presenting images how breath mechanism can be linked with time. In the picture system, there are 400 polygons in the hyperplane that can move. The technology that is used for this project is beyond our days. So to start out a participant stands in front of a big screen wearing a sensor belt around the waist. The sensor detects amplitude of the lung and abdominal muscles in breathing. So because of that action the data is fed to a computer. When it first starts out regularly grid-shaped CG polygons, subdivided in small pieces, are projected on the screen. As the data of the magnitude of breathing are sent in, parts of the cellular texture start to develop in real-time. When breathing is at a stable pitch the polygons begin to transform drastically. When solidity is gone and pitches move back and forth, polygons calm down as if they were going back to the beginning stage. Looking at his visualized breathing, the participant finds it difficult to continue to breath calmly. Gabriel presents that automatic physical functions such as breathing are actually automaton controlling us. It is said that a mechanical autonomous environment contradicts human consciousness. She regards human body as an accumulation of complex data, and tries to interface human body with computer in a paradoxical association. Gabriel created Terrain, a series of installations where the motion of a colony of solar-powered robots is controlled by the viewer's brain waves.

Prelude In April 1966, prisoner interrogations revealed that the Viet Cong (VC) 271st and 273rd Regiments of the 9th Division were moving into War zone C. In early May a captured VC notebook revealed plans for a major offensive near L·ªôc Ninh. A CIDG patrol also killed a VC officer 5 kilometres southeast of L·ªôc Ninh and retrieved documents showing that 3 regiments from the 9th Division and the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 101st Regiment planned attacks near L·ªôc Ninh by 10 May. The attack did not materialize, but on 17 May Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces tangled with VC from the 271st and 273rd Regiments west of An L·ªôc. BG William E. DePuy instructed Col Brodbeck's 3rd Brigade to counter the coming offensive. Operation =El Paso= From 19‚Äì20 May, the 3rd Brigade's three infantry battalions moved to L·ªôc Ninh and began area searches. By 24 May the searches had failed to locate the VC and BG DePuy ordered the 3rd Brigade to withdraw from the area. =El Paso II= In late May, US intelligence learned that the VC had postponed their B√¨nh Long offensive and now planned to cut Highway 13 and attack An L·ªôc, Ch∆°n Th√†nh and L·ªôc Ninh. MG Jonathan O. Seaman ordered BG DePuy to counter this new offensive and Operation El Paso II was launched on 2 June. The 3rd Brigade already in the operational area would be reinforced by the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment (1/4th Cavalry), the 2nd Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment (2/18th Infantry) and the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment. On 8 June, Troop A 1/4th Cavalry comprising 9 M48 tanks and 32 other armored vehicles left Phu Loi Base Camp to move to An L·ªôc. That afternoon near the village of Tau O the lead M48 was disabled by a mine as part of an ambush by 2 battalions of the 272nd Regiment. The remaining vehicles formed a perimeter and fought off the VC attack for several hours before reinforcements from the ARVN 5th Division arrived and the VC withdrew. Searches of the area found 105 VC bodies and it was estimated that a further 200-250 dead had been removed, US losses were 14 killed and ARVN losses were 19 killed. On 9 June, the operation was expanded by the addition of Col Sidney Berry's 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division which was tasked with searching for the VC from Highway 13 west to Minh Thanh. On 11 June, Company A 2/28th Infantry patrolling northwest of L·ªôc Ninh with a CIDG platoon was engaged by the VC 1st Battalion, 273rd Regiment located on two adjacent hills, Hill 150 and Hill 175. As the battle developed Company C 2/28th Infantry was deployed as reinforcements and following air and artillery strikes assaults were launched on the hills. At 14:30 Company C and the battalion's reconnaissance platoon assaulted Hill 177 from the south and west but were pushed back by a VC counterattack. The reconnaissance platoon took position in a trench which was covered by a VC machine gun and lost 19 killed. Despite this by 16:15 the VC were forced from the hill and withdrew northwest harassed by air and artillery strikes. On Hill 150 Company A made 2 assaults both of which were repulsed, Company B then joined the fight and by 16:30 had forced the VC from the hill where they were ambushed by a waiting CIDG Company. US losses were 33 killed, while VC losses were 98 by body count and subsequent intelligence indicated that half of the 1st Battalion had been killed. On 30 June, Troops B and C 1/4th Cavalry and Company C 2/18th Infantry left An L·ªôc to escort engineers to repair a bridge at Cam Le and carry out reconnaissance along Highway 13 north of the bridge. At 09:40 as Troop B proceeded north of the intersection of Highway 13 and Highway 17, they drove into an L-shaped ambush by the 271st Regiment. Within 30 minutes all of Troop B's M48s had been disabled. Air strikes and gunships were directed to support the beleaguered unit and Troop C rushed to the scene allowing Troop B to withdraw south and then west to set up blocking positions. By midday the VC began to withdraw to the west, fighting their way past reinforcements arriving at the battlefield. The 1st Brigade was ordered to pursue the VC and deployed west towards the Cambodian border. In order to cover the 271st Regiment's withdrawal, the VC commander Senior Col. Ho√†ng C·∫ßm ordered the 273rd Regiment to attack Company A 2/18th Infantry which was in a night defensive position near the border. At sunset on 1 July the position was assaulted by a VC platoon, Company C 2/18th Infantry moved to reinforce Company A and the VC withdrew by 20:00. At 05:45 on 2 July the VC attacked the position again with mortar fire and several ground assaults, bad weather delayed US airstrikes but they eventually forced the VC to withdraw by 09:00. US losses were 13 killed, while VC losses were 98 killed and an estimated further 110-152 bodies removed. Aftermath Operation El Paso II officially concluded on 13 July. Operation El Paso III was then launched by the 1st Brigade in the same area and continued until 3 September with negligible results. Total US casualties were 125 killed, while the US/MACV claimed VC losses were 825 killed through body count, with a further 1,249 estimated killed.

The incident was part of the larger Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, an armed conflict between Indonesia and Malaysia (with the military support of Britain) over the formation of the latter as an independent state. On 27 August 1964, the British aircraft carrier HMS Victorious and her two destroyer escorts sailed through the Sunda Strait, an international waterway claimed by Indonesia, en route to Australia. Upset by the casual warning the British had given of the ships' impending passage through the Strait (a telephone call made two days before, which did not mention the carrier) and wary of the possibility that the British were attempting to provoke a violent response, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided two days later to prohibit the warships from making the return journey to Singapore, scheduled for the middle of September. Infuriated by what was perceived as yet another affront to British prestige after the recent landings at Pontian and Labis by Indonesian volunteers in southwestern Malaysia, members of the British Cabinet, particularly Peter Thorneycroft and Louis Mountbatten, favoured sending the carrier back through the Strait in spite of the Indonesian ban. Though British naval commanders in the Far East had grave concerns that the Victorious would be indefensible while in passage, the prevailing opinion was that not to send the ship would result in an immense political defeat on both a domestic and international scale as well as the loss of rights to an important waterway. Tension mounted as the British and Indonesians each refused to bend, and as the carrier's time to sail came, war became increasingly likely. On 10 September, however, the Indonesians proposed a way out: an alternative route through the Lombok Strait. The British took them up on this offer, to the relief of both parties, and the Victorious made a peaceful return through Indonesian territory. War was averted, and the climax of tensions during the Confrontation had been passed. Never again was the threat of all-out war a realistic possibility, despite some large land battles in northern Borneo the following spring, and the Confrontation wound down by late fall of 1965. It had never escalated into a major conflict, and a peace deal was signed the following year.  Origins  On 31 August 1957, the British territory of Malaya received its independence from the Crown as a part of Britain's colonial withdrawal from the Far East, after nearly a decade of tortuous counter-insurgency warfare by British and Commonwealth troops against Malayan rebels in the Malayan Emergency.\\"The Malayan Emergency: 1948‚Äì1960\\". Australian Government Department of Veteran Affairs. Retrieved 1 July 2011. British plans dictated that the new state would be federated with the British colonies of Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei in northern Borneo in order to better protect British military and economic interests in those regions. Brunei did not join, but Sarawak, Sabah, and Singapore had all agreed to join the new Federation by 1963.Simpson 2012, p. 161. This project, labeled the 'Grand Design' by politician Malcolm MacDonald in the 1950s, became the cornerstone of British strategic thinking concerning Southeast Asia, and led to the initial federation of the numerous Malayan states in spite of their multifarious differences, with Singapore and the Borneo states to join later. This plan also earned the support of the Malaysian government, which hoped to forestall claims from Indonesia on Borneo.Easter 2012, pp. 5‚Äì6. = Beginnings of Confrontation = President Sukarno of Indonesia was a driving force behind Konfrontasi. Indonesia, meanwhile, and especially her longtime president Sukarno, was vehemently opposed to the creation of the Federation. Sukarno opposed both the preservation of the 'imperialist' British presence in Southeast Asia, a region in which he aspired to be the supreme power, and the incorporating of the Borneo colonies into the new Federation, as his goal was to control the entire island. Indeed, through possession of the Kalimantan region, Indonesia already controlled the vast majority of the massive island. To improve Indonesia's position at the negotiating table before the Federation was created, Sukarno initiated a period of Konfrontasi (Confrontation) with Malaysia. Consisting initially of frequent raids by Indonesian 'volunteers' into Malaysian territory, the conflict was not considered a war by either side, least of all by the Indonesians. In fact, when questioned on what exactly the Confrontation was, Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia replied, \\"Confrontation does not include war, because it can be carried on without war.\\" To Sukarno, this sort of operation had a number of merits. Starting a military operation against 'imperialists' would help to bind together the antagonistic forces of the army and the Communist Party (PKI) in supporting him, while not creating a fully escalated conflagration would prevent the militarily superior British and their Commonwealth allies from using their full force. Indonesia had also pulled off a successful operation using similar techniques in the West Irian campaign against the Dutch a decade previous, a raiding campaign into Western New Guinea had ended with the Dutch ceding that territory to prevent Indonesia from 'falling' to Communism.Simpson 2012, pp. 161‚Äì2. = Confrontation expands = Kesang River on the Malay Peninsula. The main part of the Confrontation is generally split into three distinct phases. In the first, Indonesia supported revolts against the Anglo-Malaysian rule in Northern Borneo, most notably the Brunei Revolt in December 1962. In the second, the guerrilla raids for which this conflict is most reputed for began in earnest, from April 1963 onwards. The fighting in this phase, while causing some damage and casualties, was relatively small in scale and the incursions were usually only made by small bands of no more than platoon size crossing the Kalimantan border into Sarawak and Sabah. These operations were the essence of the initial strategy to improve the Indonesian negotiating position and continued alongside said negotiations throughout the summer of 1963. However, 16 September, the negotiations concluded with the formation of the Malaysian Federation, which included Malaya, Singapore, and most importantly, the two Borneo states (Sarawak and Sabah). In response, the raids were intensified into larger groups working with or consisting of Indonesian regular troops. This was the beginning of the escalation of the conflict into its third and most dangerous phase.Simpson 2012, p. 162. However, that phase was a year in coming. After spending most of 1964 engaged in northern Borneo and becoming ever more frustrated with Britain's opposition to her plans, Sukarno delivered a groundbreaking yet bitter speech in Jakarta on 17 August for Independence Day. In it, he railed against the Western powers, particularly Britain and America, for their policies in Vietnam and Malaysia. Most famously, he declared that the following year would be a \\"year of living dangerously\\"Tuck 2016, p. 30. for Indonesia. This speech, especially as it came a week after Sukarno had acknowledged North Vietnam's statehood, was to be a signal of intent, and Sukarno meant to back his words up with action. That very night, a small contingent of Indonesian soldiers landed at Pontian, in the state of Johor on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. Though the raders were quickly apprehended by elite Malaysian security forces of the Senoi Praaq, it was clear to all parties that the Confrontation was rapidly expanding. A threatened Malaysia declared a state of emergency and put pressure on the British to act in their defense.Subritzky 2000, p. 116.  Crisis  = Victorious sails from Singapore = HMS Victorious underway in the Pacific in 1964. On 26 August, the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious sailed from Singapore with her two escorting destroyers, HMS Caesar and HMS Cavendish, bound for Fremantle in Western Australia. The genuine purpose of the voyage is still disputed, but it is probable that the carrier group was passing through as a show of strength to Indonesia in the wake of the Pontian landings as well as the routine 'goodwill visit' that the vessel was purportedly making to Britain's ally.Auerswald 2000, p. 103.Roberts 2009, p. 52. The task force was surprisingly met by very little Indonesian response as it passed through their territorial waters, the carrier reporting only a single Tupolev Tu-16 aircraft making a flyover as the warships passed through the Sunda Strait the following day.McCart 1998, p. 153. The ownership of the Strait itself was complex, as Indonesia claimed it despite British assertions that it was an international waterway that her warships could pass through at any time. Following standard British procedure in such a situation, the British Military Attache in Jakarta had telephoned ahead to the Indonesian Director of Naval Intelligence that the squadron would be passing through Indonesian territory without seeking their clearance, a precedent set the last time Britain had used the Straits in October 1963.Easter 2012, p. 99. This policy, engineered by the Foreign Office, had the dual purpose of notifying the Indonesians of a possibly provocative action without recognizing what they thought to be exaggerated claims on international waters. The return date to Singapore was not set exactly at the time of sailing but was to be sometime in mid-September.Boon Kwan 2005, p. 406. = Initial Indonesian response = Subandrio, pictured here in 1964. The following day (28 August), Deputy Foreign Minister of Indonesia Suwito summoned the British Charge d'Affaires complain that the British notification had been far too casual, and whilst not asking for the British to receive Indonesian permission for such an action, he asked Britain to give a more formal, preferably written, announcement next time. Or else, Suwito warned, \\"present tension might result in an unplanned, unwanted but serious incident,\\" a statement that was quickly passed on to the British government.Easter 2012, p. 100. The Charge d'Affairs replied that any further notice would be in writing, so as not to provoke any issue. Several days later, on 2 September, the day after the Labis landings, Subandrio took an even tougher line, telling the Australian Ambassador to Jakarta that the Victorious would be refused return passage through the Strait. The motivations for such a ban are not clear, as official documents on from the time are unavailable, but Subandrio's announcement was in line with government policy on passage through Indonesian waters, which was moving towards cracking down on unauthorized passages after an American carrier group had made the voyage earlier in the month.Boon Kwan 2005, p. 402. Indonesian policy-makers was also likely worried about the threat of British air power so close to Jakarta as well as the possibility that the British were attempting to provoke a response similar to the Vietnamese had made against America during the Gulf of Tonkin incident earlier that year. The latter seems exceedingly probable given Sukarno's furious response to the incident, and it is unsurprising in such a context that the response to the British incursion was equally forceful. In any case, the pervading thought in the Indonesian command was that this was a direct retaliation to the Pontian landings and a signal of British resolve, which although worrying could not overtake the British violation of their nautical claims in importance.Boon Kwan 2005, p. 407. = British resolve and plans for forcing the Strait = The Foreign Office, meanwhile, was determined not to back down in the face of what was seen as a further affront to British prestige and a challenge. Thorneycroft argued that if the Victorious did not pass through the Straits on her return journey, Britain \\"should suffer a substantial political defeat with unpredictable effects on our military position in the Far East,\\" and was supported in this view by Admiral Mountbatten and David Luce, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff.Boon Kwan 2005, p. 408. Mountbatten went even further, warning Thorneycroft that a failure to meet the challenge would have \\"serious repercussions\\" on Britain's \\"whole military stature, not only in the Far East but worldwide.\\" Luce and Mountbatten also thought this the perfect opportunity to put pressure on Jakarta for the first time, Luce stating that the return passage \\"might pass the initiative to us\\" and Mountbatten seeing it as an opportune moment to divert Sukarno from his Malaysian raiding. At the very least, innocent passage through the Strait had to be defended. The views of Whitehall were not echoed by the naval commanders, especially Sir Varyl Begg, Commander-in-Chief of British forces in the region, who believed that the carrier was too weak to defend herself against Indonesian attack or strike in turn against them. Begg adjudged that the narrowness of the Strait combined with local geographical features restricted the ships' movement and negated their radar, while custom prevented the carrier from flying its aircraft or even carrying them on deck, rendering it and the escorts extremely vulnerable in case of attack. He offered instead to send the destroyers, which were far more expendable than a fleet carrier. His views were supported by the High Commissioner to Malaysia, Lord Antony Head, who argued that there would be very little gain for Indonesia and loss for Britain if the carrier was not risked. Luce, however, remained adamant that the Victorious must sail through herself, but in order to assuage Begg's fears assured him that the more modern carrier HMS Centaur would be on hand to provide air cover for the task force. Reinforcements were also rushed to Singapore to meet any Indonesian provocation. Thorneycroft ordered Begg to begin planning for the forced passage of the Strait, as officials determined on 3‚Äì4 September that the carrier must not be diverted. In the resulting Cabinet meeting on naval deployments on 7 September, Thorneycroft and Mountbatten argued the case for the forcing of the Strait with the task force, acknowledging that though the carrier would be at risk of severe damage or loss, preventing Sukarno from achieving a victory of brinkmanship was worth the peril. Though Foreign Secretary R.A. Butler strongly represented Begg's argument that the Victorious was too valuable an asset to lose, Thorneycroft's arguments won out. The Cabinet concurred that the ship should not be diverted, as a blockage of the carrier would increase Sukarno's prestige to no end, and approved preparations for Operation Althorpe, a plan to wipe out the Indonesian air force in retaliation for an attack.Easter 2012, p. 102. Although no precipitous decision was made, and though the Cabinet had agreed to examine the matter further.Boon Kwan 2005, pp. 408‚Äì9. = The Indonesian alternative and resolution of the crisis = On 9 September, Suwito informed a British diplomat that the Strait would be closed for naval exercises and that it would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they might have to fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means.Easter 2012, p. 101. This was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover.Boon Kwan 2005, p. 409. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place. In the Cabinet meeting of the next morning, Butler raised the issue once more, informing them that Indonesia was attempting to prevent the innocent passage of the Victorious through the Sunda Strait on the pretext of naval exercises. Thorneycroft then spoke, stating that Sukarno would \\"gain in prestige\\" if he stopped the vessels from sailing through and that he might close other waters to the Royal Navy should he be successful. He acknowledged that he had originally planned to send the carrier through the Strait herself, but after discussion with Head and Begg decided to send the destroyers through instead, and send the Victorious north around Sumatra. The ships would still be able to uphold the right of passage while forcing Sukarno to either attack them or let them through. If Indonesia did attack the ships, \\"it would be an act of war... and we [Britain] should have to retaliate in force.\\" Though the Cabinet noted that the destroyers could be lost if attacked, it was deemed necessary not to bend to Sukarno. Britain and Indonesia were on the precipice of all-out war. What the Cabinet did not know yet, however, was that Indonesia had prepared an alternative to going over the edge. That same day, 10 September, Suwito asked for Britain to avoid a terrible 'misunderstanding,' and in a secret offer asked them to use the Lombok Strait instead. While further away from Jakarta, it was still claimed by Indonesia and might help the British attempt to save face while not stepping into a war they did not truly desire. With the Foreign Office's backing, Thorneycroft and Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home approved the compromise and notified Suwito that the ships would take the Lombok Strait instead. Suwito appeared, according to eyewitnesses, \\"extremely relieved\\" at having avoided full conflict.Easter 2012, pp. 102‚Äì3. The Victorious, after rendezvousing with the destroyer HMS Hampshire along with the frigates HMS Dido and HMS Berwick, sailed safely through the Lombok Strait on 12 September.  Aftermath  The Sunda Straits Crisis was the closest the Indonesia- Malaysia confrontation came to total war, and in the end, a standoff was indeed avoided, but the shadow of conflict had not entirely passed. Indonesia had not yet finished with her landings in Malaysia, and Britain had committed to retaliation if worst came to worst after pressure applied by Malaysia through both government channels and the United Nations.Easter 2012, p. 103. However, the crisis rapidly abated after the passage of the Victorious through the Lombok Strait. Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman reported secret peace feelers from Sukarno on 16 September, and though the British doubted the sincerity of these offers there was little doubt that the incident had rattled Jakarta's confidence. Indonesia's support from Africa and Asia in the UN began to waver and only survived condemnation for their antics in Malaysia due to a veto from the Soviet Union. As a result of this success, the Tunku told the British on 18 September that he would not seek to retaliate directly and would attempt to bring the case back to the UN, to the relief of Britain, who welcomed the \\"let-off.\\"Subritzky 2000, p. 121. Britain cancelled plans for any more inflammatory passages by their capital ships, and from that point forward in became clear that it was not in the interest of either side to go into war.Kraska & Pedrozo 2013, p. 137. = Disputed result = The debate over who came out the best from the Crisis, Britain or Indonesia, continues on into the present, and though many historians depict a British advantage (admittedly, these historians are British and American) there is a credible case for the success of both sides.Boon Kwan 2005, p. 410.  Britain  A preponderance of historians favour the story that though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok Strait rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through a show of force during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, including Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, are content with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the Strait for one reason or another, and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it.Fremont-Barnes 2015, p. 112. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda Strait issue altogether. This was a sentiment shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok Strait went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign of hostility, and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok Strait was just as convenient for passage as the Sunda Strait, despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia.Boon Kwan 2005, p. 411. At the very least, the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.  Indonesia  In contrast, historian Toh Boon Kwan argues at length the cause of the Indonesians, asserting that their claim to victory is equally as valid, if not more than that of the British. He states that British policy makers, in their relief at being let out of the spiral towards war, had forgotten that the Lombok Strait was militarily advantageous to Indonesia, as Indonesian warships could screen the task force easily from a nearby naval base. Symbolically, too, the forcing of ships of the vaunted Royal Navy to take the long way around their territory can be regarded as a major diplomatic success. Indonesian politicians gained strength from the Crisis, now believing that they could go toe-to-toe with 'Imperialists' and survive \\"brushes with danger.\\" This, acknowledged Boon Kwan, oddly contrasts with the defeatist views of the army, who were irritated at how close they had come to war, and who in any case carried out the policies of the Confrontation with little relish. It was the army, he asserts, that sent the peace initiatives to the Tunku in September.Boon Kwan 2005, pp. 411‚Äì2.

After enlisting in the Coldstream Guards, he was seconded to the Department of Explosives Supply and did research into munitions. After the war he studied the vapour pressure of metals before his interest turned to combustion. He pioneered the use of liquid methane as a fuel.  Early life  Egerton was born in Glyn Cywarch, near Talsarnau, Gwynedd, Wales, on 11 October 1886, the fourth son of Colonel Sir Alfred Mordaunt Egerton, an officer of the Rifle Brigade and the Royal Horse Guards, and Comptroller to the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and his wife, The Honourable Mary Georgina Ormsby-Gore, the oldest daughter of William Ormsby-Gore, 2nd Baron Harlech. He grew up at Glyn Cywarch and Brogyntyn, houses that belonged to his maternal grandfather. He was educated at Eton College, which he entered in 1900. Contemporaries included Robert Strutt, Thomas Ralph Merton and Julian Huxley. After graduating from Eton in 1904, he entered University College, London, where he read chemistry under the tutelage of Sir William Ramsay. He graduated in 1908 with first-class honours, and went to Nancy University to perform post-graduate work. He intended to then proceed to Germany, but this was cut short in 1909 by an offer of a position as an instructor at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. His research there was largely devoted to nitrogen oxides, on which he published three papers in 1913 and 1914. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 1 July 1909 in University of London contingent of the Officers' Training Corps.  Career  In 1913 he went to Berlin to work in the laboratory of Walther Nernst. Frederick Lindemann was also there at this time, and the two became friends. During the July Crisis in 1914, Nernst helped Egerton and his wife leave Germany. They arrived back in England on 3 August 1914, the day before Britain declared war on Germany, joining the Great War. Egerton joined the Coldstream Guards, but was soon seconded to the Department of Explosives Supply in the Ministry of Munitions, where he helped with the design and construction of the chain of National Explosives Factories in response to the Shell Crisis of 1915. Two of his brothers were killed in the war. During the final stages of the war, he was engaged in studying the problem of synthetic ammonia production. In January 1919, soon after the war ended, he joined an Inter-Allied mission under Harold Hartley, the Controller of the Chemical Warfare Department in the Ministry of Munitions, to study the German chemical industry. He found that the Germans had been able to produce vast quantities of synthetic ammonia using the Haber process. Later that year he joined the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University, where he succeeded Henry Tizard as Reader in Thermodynamics in 1923. He resumed work that he had commenced in Berlin on the vapour pressure of metals. He wrote seven papers on the topic in 1923, but by 1935 he discontinued research in the area, having measured the vapour pressure, heat of vapourisation and specific heat ratios of cadmium, lead, magnesium, potassium, sodium, thallium and zinc. From 1924 on, he had become increasingly interested in combustion. He was particularly interested in the phenomenon of engine knocking, and how it might be prevented. He studied the propagation of flames, the mechanism of hydrocarbon oxidation, and the role of peroxides in their combustion. For his research, he created a special kind of burner that could create a stationary plane flame front for the purpose of examining the flame's properties. Egerton was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1925, and served on its council from 1931 to 1933, and as its Physical Secretary from 1938 to 1948. He also served on several quangos, including the Scientific and Advisory Committee of Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Fuel Research Board, the Heating and Ventilating Research Committee, the Engine Committee of the Aeronautical Research Council, the Water Pollution Board and the Advisory Committee of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. In 1936, he assumed the chair of Chemical Technology at the Imperial College of Science. During the Second World War he pioneered the use of liquid methane as an alternative to petrol as a fuel for motor vehicles. Trials were carried out with a bus on a route in the Midlands. He was a member of the War Cabinet's Scientific Advisory Committee, and was Chairman of the Admiralty's Fuel and Propulsion Committee. In 1943, he was sent to Washington, DC, to reorganise the British Central Scientific Office there, and to improve scientific liaison with the Americans. In this, he was successful, establishing good relations with American scientific administrators such as Vannevar Bush and James Conant. He was knighted for his services on 1 January 1943, an honour which King George VI conferred on him in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 9 February 1943. After the war he was awarded the Rumford medal in 1946. He was the Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Council of the Ministry of Fuel and Power from 1948 to 1953, and was director of the Salters' Institute of Industrial Chemistry from 1949 to 1959. Between 1948 and his retirement from the Imperial College of Science in 1952, he published seventeen papers.  Family  In 1912 Egerton married The Honourable Ruth Julia Cripps, the daughter of Lord Parmoor, and the sister of his friend Stafford Cripps. They had no children, but did adopt a nephew.  Death  Egerton died on 7 September 1959 at Mas del Soleou, a country estate in Mouans-Sartoux, France, that he had inherited from his mother. His papers are held by the Royal Society and the Imperial College Archives and Corporate Records Unit. His correspondence with Lord Cherwell is in the Nuffield College, Oxford library, and correspondence with Archibald Hill is kept in the Churchill Archives Centre.

It is a ground orchid with a single leaf and one or two pale green flowers with red stripes. It is mainly only found in the Little Desert National Park in Victoria and in the far south-east of South Australia but there are four records from New South Wales. Description Caladenia tensa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, 60-120 long and 10-15 wide, often with red spots near its base. One or two pale green flowers with red stripes along the sepals and petals, and 40‚Äì50 mm wide is borne on a stalk 200‚Äì300 mm tall. The sepals have fairly thin, yellowish, club-like glandular tips, 6‚Äì12 mm long. The dorsal sepal is erect, 30‚Äì40 mm long and 2‚Äì3 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 30‚Äì40 mm long, 3‚Äì4 mm wide and spread slightly apart from each other and turning stiffly downwards. The petals are 25‚Äì35 mm long, about 2 mm wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is 18‚Äì20 mm long and 18‚Äì22 mm wide, pale green with a white central area and a dark red tip. Each side of the labellum has thin green teeth up to 4 mm long, grading to small white teeth near the labellum tip. The tip of the labellum is curled under and there are four well- spaced rows of calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to OctoberCaladenia tensa near Kiata in the Little Desert Taxonomy Caladenia tensa was first formally described in 1991 by Geoffrey Carr from a specimen collected near Kiata and the description was published in Indigenous Flora and Fauna Association Miscellaneous Paper. The specific epithet (tensa) is a Latin word meaning \\"stretched\\" or \\"extended\\". Distribution and habitat In Victoria, the rigid spider orchid is found between Horsham and Ouyen and west to the border with South Australia, mostly in the Little Desert National Park. In the past it has been recorded in the Cape Gantheaume, Billiatt and Mount Boothby Conservation Parks in South Australia and near Lake Cargelligo, Trundle and Carrathool in New South Wales but its present distribution is unclear. It grows in eucalyptus and cypress woodland. Conservation Caladenia tensa is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"vulnerable\\"under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The main threats to the species are habitat loss, weed invasion and grazing by rabbits. The effect of fire on the species is unknown.

The character, created by Geoff Johns, Greg Berlanti, and Andrew Kreisberg, is an original creation for the series and is not based on any existing character appearing in comics published by DC Comics. Most versions of Wells are from parallel universes, often defined by their high level of intelligence and scientific knowledge. Cavanagh has played several different versions of Wells, most notably Earth-1's Harrison Wells; Harry Wells of Earth-2; writer H. R. Wells of Earth-19; detective Sherloque Wells of Earth-221; and explorer Nash Wells who temporarily became the series' version of Pariah. He has also portrayed, in a less prominent capacity, the Council of Wells and the Council of Harrisons, which consist of various doppelg√§ngers. Critics and fans have praised Cavanagh's performances as various versions of the character, particularly Harry, although some criticized his performance as H. R. and Sherloque. The Council of Wells and Council of Harrisons received a mixed reception from critics; some praised their humor and Cavanagh's versatility in portraying them while others criticized their skit-like nature.  Concept and creation  Executive producers Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg, and DC Comics CCO Geoff Johns, created the character of Harrison Wells for The CW series The Flash, although he is first mentioned in the Arrow season 2 episode \\"Three Ghosts\\". While a character named \\"Dr. Wells\\" had appeared in \\"Elevator To Nowhere\\", a 1980 episode of the ABC animated series Super Friends, and another namesake character in Flash TV Special #1, a January 1991 tie-in comic book with the CBS live-action series The Flash (1990), Johns has said that Harrison Wells is an original creation for the CW series. On February 10, 2014, Tom Cavanagh was cast in the role, described as \\"a rock star in the world of physics and the mind and money behind Central City's S.T.A.R. Labs Particle Accelerator.\\" This differed from the comics where Garrison Slate founded S.T.A.R. Labs. Cavanagh described Apple founder Steve Jobs as an inspiration for the character. It was eventually revealed that \\"Wells\\" was actually Eobard Thawne, who assumed the real Wells' identity after murdering him. Subsequent seasons has Cavanagh portray other versions of Wells.  Characterization  Cavanagh has differentiated each version of Wells he portrays based on character mannerisms, voice, and origin story. He described Harry Wells of Earth-2, introduced in season two, as someone who \\"seems bad but he's good\\", the opposite of Thawne. Grant Gustin, who portrays Barry Allen, described Harry as a \\"douchebag\\". Cavanagh said, though he was not written that way, it was his idea to portray the character as egotistical. He also described Harry as \\"socially awkward\\", but ultimately \\"a good guy at heart\\". Kriesberg differentiated Harry from Thawne by calling him \\"a tortured man who's beset with guilt\\" who loves his daughter. He added, \\"[Harry is] a jerk, but he's doing everything he's doing because he loves his daughter more than anything in the world.\\" According to Cavanagh, Harry was created to give the series a \\"daily antagonist\\". Season three introduces \\"H. R.\\" of Earth-19. Cavanagh described him as \\"a bit of a con man ... But I didn't want to repeat myself from [season two], so what I thought I would try [this season] is a guy who fills it up with comedy.\\" He said the character was created to bring more \\"comedic power\\" to the series in a way that would not undermine its serious narrative. Regarding the relationship between Harry and H. R., he said, \\"Harry hated [H. R.] because he thought he was an idiot. H. R. thought Harry was the best thing ever.\\" H. R. and the three other versions of Wells seen in the episode \\"The New Rogues\\" were created by Cavanagh. Sherlock Holmes was the inspiration for Sherloque Wells, introduced in season five. Cavanagh described Sherloque as \\"a very intelligent human being who is maybe not to be trusted\\", and as being filled with \\"intrigue and deceit, fun, humor, intensity, and very loud.\\" He called the character a combination of Harry's intelligence and H. R.'s comedic personality. Cavanagh later expanded, saying, \\"The idea of Sherloque, a master detective, who's really funny because he'll have this pomposity but also he'll actually be good at what he does, tracking down the Reverse-Flash, essentially me tracking down me... fits with the story and it's not indulgent\\". Sherloque was written as a French man, and a rival of Ralph Dibny because of them being in the same profession. Season six introduces Nash Wells, who Cavanagh described as \\"a bit of an adventurer, a swashbuckler.\\" He said the character was almost written as an Australian, but the writers \\"ended up going with something different ‚Äì but we were very close to making him Australian.\\" Season six showrunner Eric Wallace described Nash as \\"a man who can kind of get in a fight and hold his own\\", unlike any previous version of Wells. Nash eventually becomes the series' version of Pariah. Regarding the creation of the Council of Wells, Cavanagh recalled: > We had a sprinkling of it when they were on their quest for H. R. Wells last > year where we had Hells Wells, Mime Wells, and Steampunk Wells, and so that > was just a one-off, but that got everybody's juices flowing like, 'If we > were to do that, what would that look like with there being a Council of > Wells that could convene?' [...] We thought, 'Oh, this is going to be > completely obnoxious and shameless when I get a hold of it,' and it is > proving to be super obnoxious and ultra-shameless in hopefully the most > appealing way. The Flash season four and five showrunner Todd Helbing described the Council of Wells as being \\"all about intelligence and being the smartest people in the universe\\", and the Council of Harrisons as its \\"emo version\\". Cavanagh described Herr Wells as someone who thinks \\"everything that is not German is not good\\" and Wells 2.0 as a \\"bad ass from the Outback, who doesn't like anybody\\". Gandalf, a character in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth stories, was the model for Wells the Grey, Hugh Hefner was the inspiration for H. Lothario Wells, and the Mad Max franchise was the inspiration for Wells 2.0. Cavanagh commented that, despite the one-off and skit-like nature of these versions of Wells, \\"in my mind, they're real guys. They exist. The situation is comic, but they're not.\\"  Fictional character biographies  = Harrison Wells (Earth-1) = In season one, Harrison Wells is introduced as the founder and director of S.T.A.R. Labs, located in Central City on Earth-1. He activates a particle accelerator that explodes, allowing dark matter energy released to transform various people, including Barry Allen, into metahumans. Months later, Wells has become a recluse and a pariah of Central City while he and his assistants Cisco Ramon and Caitlin Snow help Barry as the Flash; Wells pushes Barry to run faster to increase abilities as a speedster by taking down metahuman criminals. While it is eventually revealed that \\"Wells\\" is actually Eobard Thawne (the Flash's archenemy from the 22nd century), the real Wells was married to the late scientist Tess Morgan, whom he met when they worked as research partners in Maryland, and was injured in a car crash that killed Tess and was caused by the time-displaced Thawne, who then stole his likeness using a futuristic device, killing Wells in the process in order to develop the particle accelerator sooner and return to the future. In the present, Tina McGee tells Barry of always suspecting something was off about Wells after Tess died. An investigation into Tess's death eventually leads to Team Flash's discovery of Wells's corpse and Thawne's masquerade. In subsequent seasons, Thawne's various actions using Wells's identity make it difficult for doppelg√§ngers of Wells to be in the general public. = Harry Wells = Harrison Wells, the founder and director of the S.T.A.R Labs on Earth-2, travels to Earth-1 in season two. Nicknamed \\"Harry\\" by Cisco, he tells Team Flash he plans to help them stop Zoom, who has kidnapped his daughter Jesse. Zoom extorts Harry into developing a Speed Force transmitting device to steal Barry's speed in exchange for Jesse's life, but when Harry cannot continue with the plan he confesses his collaboration with Zoom to the team. He gains Barry and Cisco's help rescuing Jesse from Earth-2; Harry and Jesse then seek refuge on Earth-1. After Zoom's defeat, they return to Earth-2. In season three, Harry approaches Team Flash to dissuade Jesse, now a speedster, from being a superhero, but eventually comes to accept his daughter's intentions. The two return to Earth-2 after helping the team recruit another Wells as Harry's replacement. Later, Harry is captured and imprisoned by Gorilla City's denizens and Team Flash rescues him. He later helps Team Flash fight Savitar. Following Savitar's defeat, Harry remains on Earth-1 as a favor when Barry enters the Speed Force to stabilize it. By the beginning of season four, Harry has returned to Earth-2 for undisclosed reasons; Cisco mentions him as one of the scientists who aided in developing a way behind Barry's retrieval from the Speed Force. Harry returns after an argument with Jesse, and helps the team fight Clifford DeVoe. He builds a \\"thinking cap\\" to augment his intelligence with dark matter to outwit DeVoe, but after the device is pushed past its safety limits, his brain is damaged; now the more he uses his intellect, the faster he loses it. Following DeVoe's defeat, with help from his wife Marlize, Team Flash manages to restore Harry's intelligence to a functional level, though he is unable to be restored to his previous genius-level intellect, and he returns to Earth-2. As Earth-2 was destroyed by the Anti-Monitor months before the Crisis began, Harry was among those who perished. Following the events of the Crisis, in which the multiverse is rebooted, Harry is still presumed dead as Team Flash mistakenly believe the multiverse is gone, though they did learn his intellect was recovering prior to the event. However, it is later revealed that Harry's consciousness remains, along with that of other Wells doppelg√§ngers, in the mind of Nash, the only remaining Wells with a physical body. = H. R. Wells = Harrison \\"H. R.\\" Wells of Earth-19 is one of several versions of Harrison Wells in season three who finds the cryptogram sent by Harry through the multiverse and expresses interest in aiding Team Flash. Although Harry objects, Team Flash finalizes H. R. as his replacement. H. R. is later revealed to not be a scientist; he admits that he came to Earth-1 primarily to get material for a novel, and is only the founder and \\"idea man\\" for S.T.A.R. Labs on Earth-19. Barry suggests letting the overbearingly good-natured H. R. stay a few weeks, and he proves his worth by helping form plans and locating powered criminals. He trains Wally West in the use of his newly-acquired speedster powers and, after discovering how many criminals breached the facility, attempts to transform S.T.A.R. Labs into a museum to maintain Team Flash's cover. Gypsy, an enforcer from Earth-19, arrives to retrieve H. R. on charges of interdimensional travel as it is forbidden on Earth-19, but is defeated by Cisco. She spares H. R. and warns him not to return to Earth-19. In the battle against Savitar, H. R. sacrifices himself by disguising himself as Iris and taking her place to be killed by Savitar. His actions earn him Harry's respect, and his death is avenged when Iris kills Savitar. = Sherloque Wells = Harrison Sherloque Wells, a detective from Earth-221, is hired in season five by Team Flash to investigate the mystery of the metahuman serial killer Cicada. He is forced to stay on Earth-1 after his initial deductions prove incorrect because this version of Cicada has a different secret identity than the 37 versions Sherloque has previously identified. After investigating further, he announces Cicada's true identity: Orlin Dwyer. He is also suspicious of Barry's future daughter Nora West-Allen, and secretly investigates the speedster, leading him to discover her allegiance with his Earth-1 doppelg√§nger's impostor and killer Eobard Thawne. Sherloque has married, and subsequently divorced, Renee Adler of various Earths in the multiverse and eventually starts dating the Earth-1 version of her. He sends the Earth-1 Renee, who is a metahuman, to his Earth to keep her safe from Cicada II, who is continuing the late Dwyer's mission. After Cicada II is defeated, Sherloque returns to his Earth to reunite with the Earth-1 Renee. During the Crisis, Sherloque perished, but after the rebooting of the multiverse, his consciousness was fused with Nash's mind. = Nash Wells = In season six, Harrison Nash Wells, an explorer and self- proclaimed myth-buster from an unidentified Earth, comes to Earth-1 in search of a substance called eternium, which he eventually finds in the sewers of Central City. He later aids Barry and Cisco in a heist in exchange for a crypto-circuit he claims only Cisco can build. After obtaining it, he returns to the sewers and tracks the Monitor's movements. Joe tracks Nash in the sewers, but both become trapped until they are rescued by Ralph Dibny. After Team Flash offers to help, Nash reluctantly agrees and tells them he knows how to save Barry from his prophesied death during the impending Crisis. He brings the team to a wall he claims protects a portal the Monitor uses to hide out, expressing his desire to expose him as a false god. Nash later destroys the wall, and finds a door etched with symbols, before a voice promises him a new life in exchange for bowing down before it. Nash initially refuses, but ultimately agrees after the voice seemingly saves him. Following this, a blinding light appears and teleports him inside. During the Crisis, it is revealed that Nash inadvertently freed the Anti-Monitor, who tricked him into thinking he was the Monitor and used him to escape his imprisonment. As a result, Nash became a \\"Pariah\\" cursed to bear witness as penance while the Anti-Monitor destroys the multiverse. As billions of Earths are wiped out, Pariah assists Team Flash in destroying the Anti-Monitor's anti-matter cannon, but the Anti-Monitor succeeds in destroying the multiverse anyway. Before he is killed, Pariah teleports the seven heroes capable of stopping him, the Paragons, to safety. After the Paragons and Oliver Queen defeat the Anti- Monitor and reboot the multiverse, Nash is restored to his pre-Crisis self on the newly formed Earth-Prime. Though he initially lacks his memories as Pariah, J'onn J'onzz restores them to ensure he never forgets what he did. When Nash learns the Anti-Monitor is still alive, he works with Barry, Ray Palmer, and Ryan Choi to develop a bomb capable of shrinking the Anti-Monitor for eternity. After Cisco takes a leave of absence from Team Flash, Nash joins them as a substitute. He also starts seeing hallucinations of Harry. Allegra Garcia learns she had a doppelg√§nger who worked for Nash and starts to get weary around him. When Nash tries to explain himself, he hallucinates Sherloque warning him that \\"he is coming\\". Nash's body is eventually taken over by Thawne, though he remains alive. When Team Flash work to exorcise Thawne from Nash, they deduce that as the only surviving version of Wells following the Crisis, Nash was fused with all of his counterparts, explaining his hallucinations. As for Thawne, he had become a being composed of negative tachyons who possessed Nash following the Crisis. While in Nash's head, Team Flash learn that Thawne is using his negative memories against him to finalize the possession, particularly the death of his partner and adoptive daughter Maya (Allegra's doppelg√§nger), who had died while on an adventure with him on Earth-13. With his friends' help, Nash comes to terms with what happened and accept that it was his fault, expelling Thawne from his body. Despite this success, Team Flash cannot do anything about his other counterparts' consciousnesses. After Nash assists Allegra in fighting her villainous cousin, Esperanza Garcia, she starts warming up to him. = Other variants of Wells = Throughout the series, many versions of Wells from across the multiverse have made brief appearances. In season three, several variants of Wells, along with H. R., appear as candidates to replace Harry from Team Flash, such as \\"Hell's Wells\\", a cowboy from an unspecified Earth; Wells of Earth-17, a British-accented steampunk scientist; and a French-speaking mime artist from another unspecified Earth. During the fourth season, Harry briefly creates the \\"Council of Wells\\", which consists of the smartest versions of himself from across the multiverse: Herr Harrison Wolfgang Wells, a German author and scientist from Earth-12; H. Lothario Wells, a playboy-scientist from Earth-47; and Wells 2.0., a cyborg from Earth-22. Also shown is a wizard named \\"Wells the Grey\\" from Earth-13. Following Harry's expulsion from the Council because of his declining intelligence, Cisco introduces him to the \\"Council of Harrisons\\", based more on empathy than intelligence. Along with Harry, this group includes Lothario Wells (also expelled from the Council of Wells); the Italian Sonny Wells of Earth-24; and H. P. Wells, a French poet from Earth-25. During the Crisis, all existing versions of Wells perished, but after the rebooting of the multiverse, their consciousnesses were fused into Nash's mind.  Reception  Adam Holmes of Cinema Blend ranked Harry sixth on his list of 10 Best TV Characters DC Introduced in 2015. Reviewing Cavanagh's performance as Harry in the episode \\"The Darkness and the Light\\", Eric Walters of Paste said, \\"Having Tom Cavanagh back is wonderful, and he has brought a renewed energy with him. When Harrison 2 referred to Cisco as 'Crisco,' I knew this episode was going to be hot fire.\\" Screen Rants Jason Berman ranked Cavanagh fifth on his 2016 list of 20 Best Actors in the Arrowverse, saying, \\"By now, it has become clear that actors on The Flash are tasked with playing various incarnations of their characters. But Tom Cavanagh (who plays Harrison Wells) has had to take that to the extreme. Cavanagh has showed off his acting chops by playing no less than different versions of his character on The Flash.\\" In September 2017, Irina Curovic of Comic Book Resources described Cavanagh's portrayal of the versions of Wells introduced to that point as \\"flawless\\", noting that, \\"Harry was the best fit for team Flash. Not only did he contribute to the team, but he also established meaningful relationships with the members of the team.\\" In his review of the season 4 penultimate episode \\"Think Fast\\", which shows Harry's declining intelligence because of the effects of the Thinking Cap, IGNs Jesse Schedeen felt that \\"Cavanagh is doing a fine job of depicting Harry's deteriorating mental state, playing it both for laughs and tragedy as the situation demands.\\" Reviewing the episode \\"The New Rogues\\", which features Cavanagh portraying multiple versions of Wells, Angelica Jade Basti√©n of Vulture said that the different Wells \\"let Tom Cavanagh stretch himself even more as an actor.\\" However, she criticized his portrayal of H. R. in the episode \\"Untouchable\\", feeling he was an \\"annoying character\\" who was \\"just another symbol of the show's inability to grow\\", with his only purpose being to \\"continue the Harrison Wells mythos.\\" Writing for Comic Book Resources, Stephanie Holland also criticized H. R., describing him as a \\"hipster Wells, who carries around drumsticks, wears a stupid hat and skinny jeans.\\" She felt he was included only to \\"keep Tom Cavanagh around in a new role.\\" Holland added that while Cavanagh was \\"fantastic at making every Wells different, HR just didn't fit on the show.\\" Digital Spys Morgan Jeffrey felt H. R. did not contribute much to Team Flash except for \\"plenty of enthusiasm\\", and was \\"a tad annoying\\", but wrote that, by sacrificing his life to save Iris, H. R. \\"eventually proved his worth.\\" The Council of Wells and the Council of Harrisons received a divided reception among critics; some praised their humor and Cavanagh's versatility in portraying them, while others criticized the skit-like nature of both Councils. In his review of \\"When Harry Met Harry...\\", Schedeen felt the Council of Wells was \\"basically an excuse for Cavanagh to put on funny wigs and ridiculous accents.\\" He had similar feelings for the episode \\"Harry and the Harrisons\\" where Harry joined the Council of Harrisons. Scott Von Doviak of The A.V. Club said this Council did not \\"make a whole lot of sense, even from a comic-book multiverse perspective\\", and that its members felt like \\"community theater skit characters.\\" Mike Cecchini of Den of Geek said he was initially skeptical of Sherloque during the character's introduction in the fifth season, but while reviewing the episode \\"Godspeed\\", said he turned into an \\"absolute delight\\". He claimed that, despite the character's limited screen time in the episode, he used it \\"incredibly effectively\\", appreciating \\"the way that he doubles down on not telling the team about his Nora suspicions.\\" In contrast, Schedeen said that while Cavanagh was able to differentiate the various versions of Wells through subtle intonation, body language and personality changes, \\"Sherloque relied far too heavily on a silly French accent. He felt gimmicky in comparison to his predecessors. And while Sherloque definitely had his moments in Season 5 (mainly as he turned his considerable skills of deduction against his own teammates), the character too often felt superfluous.\\"  Other appearances  * Cavanagh voiced Thawne masquerading as Earth-1 Wells in the episode \\"Ants on a Hamburger\\" of the animated series Robot Chicken. * During the Arrowverse crossover event \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\" featuring episodes of Supergirl, Arrow, The Flash, and Legends of Tomorrow, Cavanagh appeared as Harry in each of them. * The Earth-27 version of Wells appears in The Flash: Johnny Quick, a 2018 tie-in novel to The Flash. * The final scene of The Flash episode \\"The Last Temptation of Barry Allen, Pt. 2\\" featuring Nash first appeared in the Batwoman episode \\"A Mad Tea-Party\\", and was re-used for the Supergirl episode \\"The Wrath of Rama Khan\\", and the Arrow episode \\"Purgatory\\".

In 1860, Darling moved with her husband from Wisconsin to Missouri. When the war broke out, Darling elaborates in a letter to Mary G. Holland that everyone's first reaction was to flee for their safety. After the initial panic, Darling's husband enlisted with the Missouri Home Guard on July 20, 1860, and Darling followed suit. Darling was hired to the regimental hospital; she was supposed to be paid $12 monthly but never received any compensation for her work. Even when the soldiers were away and nursing work was scarce at the hospital, Darling would bake up to fifty pounds of flour into bread daily. When Darling did travel with the regiment, she would work and live out of a tent, fully integrated into camp life, to serve the soldiers. In December 1861, Darling's husband fell ill with typhoid fever. He was transported to Mound City Hospital in Illinois until March 1863. Darling did not have contact with her husband during this entire period. When her husband returned to the service, Darling joined the regiment in Memphis to care for him until the winter of 1864. After this, Darling worked solely in camps, and subsequently out of tents and makeshift shelters, until the end of her service, notably serving near the Shiloh battleground.

Before the arrival of the Spaniards, a village situated along the northeastern part of Palo was a thriving community. Its tribal chief was Kawaring, who propelled his people to engage in agriculture. He was likewise respected and loved by his people such that when the Spaniards eventually came to the village and asked for its name, the natives enthusiastically replied, \\"Kawaring\\", presuming that the Spaniards were asking for their ruler. Due to miscommunication, the name was distorted and the place became known as Pawing. Pawing was mainly an agricultural community made possible by fertile lands and sufficient water supply coming from the Pawing creek. World War I broke out and due to in-migration in 1898, mat weaving was introduced. The new settlers occupied the southern portion of the village and they produced an enormous quantity of mats, hence the name Pabrika. The area near the bridge was called May-Tulay, and the northern portion was called Mohon to emphasize the boundary between Pawing and Marasbaras. The first public building to be constructed was the school which offered two grades in 1914. After a couple of years, the school was closed down to make way for the national highway. Modernization has affected the once-agricultural village. Pabrika had to be phased out to accommodate the government center. Residents had to be relocated and more families settled in an area along the irrigation canal, hence the name Dike. Nowadays, Pawing is a semi-urban community with numerous government offices that were built on the property. Nevertheless, the resiliency of the people to cope with change has not marred their cultural heritage that is purely Pawingnon.

It is a remake of the 2000 Swedish film Naken. The film stars Marlon Wayans, Regina Hall, Jonathan Todd Jackson, Scott Foley, Loretta Devine, Brian McKnight and Dennis Haysbert. The film was released on Netflix on August 11, 2017. Plot Substitute teacher Rob Anderson is offered a full-time teaching job, but is reluctant to make that long-term commitment. He and his fianc√©e, physician Megan Swope, fly to Charleston, South Carolina for their wedding the next day. Megan's disapproving father, high-powered businessman Reginald, has invited Megan's successful ex-boyfriend Cody. Rob goes out drinking with his best man, Benny, only to wake up on his wedding day, naked in an elevator in a hotel far from the church. He is arrested for streaking, but when the church bells ring, he is pulled back in time, waking up in the elevator an hour earlier; Rob realizes he is stuck in a time loop, reliving this hour. Desperate to go through with the wedding, Rob gradually adapts to his situation. When he learns that no wedding at that church has ever been canceled, he concludes that God has intervened to make it so. Rob develops multiple ways to obtain clothing and travel to the church; gains the trust of a police duo, a biker gang, and singer Brian McKnight; learns that Cody is planning a hostile takeover of Reginald's company; and has meaningful conversations with his mother, Megan, and Reginald. He eventually discovers that Megan's jealous maid of honor Vicky abducted him and put him in the elevator after hiring a prostitute named Callie to seduce him; however, Rob did not cheat, and Callie only ended up helping Rob with his vows. In the final iteration of the loop, Rob enlists the cops to race across town. He calls Callie to invite her to the wedding and bring his suit from the hotel to the Church. He is able to expose Cody and Vicky, earns Reginald's approval, and marries Megan. He tells her he has accepted the teaching job and wants to have a stable, grounded life with her.

Reception Naked received generally negative reviews from critics upon release, criticizing the concept and humor. In his review of the film, Mike D'Angelo of The A.V. Club said, \\"For many, Groundhog Day qualifies as a near-perfect comedy. Apparently, though, there are some highly motivated people out there who think it‚Äôd be a whole lot funnier if the guy stuck in the endless time loop were constantly running around with his bare ass exposed and his hands covering his junk.\\" He later added, \\"Let‚Äôs place the blame where it squarely belongs: on the moronic premise. Groundhog Day but he‚Äôs naked? Why?\\" and later said that the film \\"is so tickled by the very idea of public nudity that it squanders much of its energy on Rob‚Äôs efforts to find clothes.\\" \\"The film clearly does not care about establishing a realistic world,\\" Cody Schmitz of Decider said about the film, \\"It just wants to get Wayans in that magic elevator and in the nude.\\" Renee Schonfeld of Common Sense Media called it a \\"lowbrow farce with action, swearing and partial nudity.\\" The film holds 0% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 8 reviews.

History Finke, who may have been born Johann Wilhelm Finke from Cuxhaven in Germany, and would have been pronounced fink-e arrived in South Australia aboard the Tam O'Shanter in November 1836 as part of the First Fleet of South Australia. He was a member of a syndicate with Osmond Gilles, the first colonial treasurer, his nephew John Jackson Oakden and three othersOther members were Gilles' ward Emily Blunden (died 1875) who also emigrated aboard HMS Buffalo, H. R. Wigley (Resident Magistrate and father of W. R. Wigley), and solicitor Matthew Smith (c. 1794 ‚Äì 18 November 1858) who entered the ballot in February 1839 for the right to purchase land in Glenelg, in which they were successful. Finke is shown as \\"chief clerk of the Treasury\\" in the public notice of the ballot. Finke had been appointed chief clerk to Gilles, and in 1839 was put in charge of mining galena for his Glen Osmond Union Mining Company, the first mine for metal-bearing ores in South Australia and perhaps Australia.Margaret Goyder Kerr Colonial Dynasty: The Chambers family of South Australia He was also appointed Honourable Secretary of Glenelg Pier and Warehouse Company, which had offices in Gilles Arcade. Finke was an energetic explorer and prospector throughout South Australia, but particularly in the northern Flinders Ranges, where he established productive copper mines at Nuccaleena and Oratunga, but missed the huge deposits at Burra and Kapunda. He frequently employed Scottish explorer John McDouall Stuart as travelling companion on these trips. Finke and James Chambers developed the Moolooloo station, from where Stuart's final and successful expedition departed. James died before the party's triumphant return and Finke not long after. John Chambers, as executor of his brother's Will, sold the run to Philip Levi & Co., who sold it to John Rounsevell in 1871.Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia Vol II, Reprints from Stock and Station Journal Publishers Ltd. Adelaide 1927 Finke died at the John Bull Inn in Currie Street, Adelaide. His remains were buried at the North Road Cemetery, in the Adelaide suburb of Nailsworth. Anna Timmermann, Andreas Finke and Wilhelmina Arndt of Germany were named as having an interest in two properties in Glenelg two years after Finke's death. Recognition The Finke River in central Australia and Mount Finke in South Australia were named after him by Stuart in 1858 and 1860 respectively. Finke Bay on the coast of the Van Diemen Gulf in the Northern Territory is considered to be named by Stuart after Finke in 1862. The tiny settlement of Finke which grew around a railway siding on the Central Australia Railway and is now also known by its traditional name Aputula, derived its name from the nearby Finke River.

Accident The aircraft took off at 3:59pm. Shortly after rotation the aircraft began to pitch up faster and higher than usual, the right wing dropped and the aircraft started turning to the right. The aircraft failed to gain speed and altitude, the right wingtip struck the ground and cartwheeled while disintegrating, the initial impact occurred beyond the threshold and right of runway 23, the aeroplane was completely destroyed. Cause The crash was due to reverse thrust applied during a simulated failure of no.4 engine on takeoff. The situation occurred when very rapid rearward movement of the power lever caused the associated thrust brake lever to enter the reverse idle position. After take-off, minimum control speed (MCS) required to overcome this abnormal state of thrust imbalance was never achieved. The condition was recognised by the pilots and rectified but there was not enough time nor altitude available to allow the aircraft to recover.

She was the first African-American Caribbeanist and the first to focus on Dutch Caribbean culture\\". She developed a \\"methodology for the study of African American Anthropology\\" that acknowledged the diversity among and within black families, communities and cultures. Her other areas of research included Mestizos in Mexico and communities in India and Israel. \\"Committed to the betterment of the human condition\\", Green also focused her efforts towards international human rights. Early life and education Vera Mae Green was born in Chicago, Illinois, where she lived in poor urban areas and attended the city's public schools. She was an only child and an avid reader. Having developed an interest in anthropology at an early age, as a child she drew distinctions between the portrayal of Native Americans in Hollywood films and actual Native American people and culture. Consequently, sometimes her friends avoided sitting next to her when watching movies because they thought she might spoil the show. Green's academic pursuits sometimes were delayed because of her lack of finances. However, she maintained an interest in social science. After receiving a scholarship, she went on to study sociology and psychology at William Penn College in Oskaloosa, Iowa. In 1952, she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Roosevelt University, where she studied under anthropologist St. Clair Drake and sociologist and newspaper columnist Horace R. Cayton Jr., the co-authors of the seminal book Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City. \\"Drake encouraged Green to seek graduate studies in the social sciences but her lack of finances eliminated that possibility.\\" Prior to moving to New York City for graduate studies, she held several positions at various social welfare agencies in Chicago. While her work in direct services with some of the city‚Äôs vulnerable populations was rewarding, she found it necessary to continue her studies. She enrolled in Columbia University. Under the direction of anthropologists Charles Wagley and Eleanor Padilla, Green studied the ‚Äúrelationship among social stress, health and disease‚Äù in East Harlem, New York. While at Columbia University, she also studied under Native American anthropologist Gene Weltfish, who was investigated during the McCarthy era. Amidst controversy, Green supported efforts to help Weltfish keep her position at Columbia University. Weltfish's position was terminated. \\"Standing up for Weltfish caused [Green] acceptance into Columbia University‚Äôs doctoral program.\\" But, she and Weltfish became friends. In 1955, Green earned a Master of Arts degree in Anthropology, from Columbia University. In 1969, she earned her Ph.D. from the University of Arizona. \\"In 1980, there were less than one-hundred Afro-Americans who held a master's or Ph.D. in anthropology.\\" Green was one of them. Career Applied and social anthropologist Vera Mae Green made significant contributions to Caribbean Studies, interethnic studies, black family studies and the study of poverty and the poor. Prior to earning her master‚Äôs in anthropology, Green held various social services positions in her hometown, Chicago. She \\"worked as a group worker, social welfare aide, child welfare worker and, in the city‚Äôs housing authority, as a community tenant-relations aide\\". After earning a Master of Arts in anthropology from Columbia University, Green returned to providing direct services to marginalized communities but, this time, her focus included international community development. In 1956, she worked with the United Nations in a community of mestizos in Mexico. She became a ‚Äúfundamental educator with UNESCO‚Äù, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. While in this role, she also focused on community development in India. Green's personal experience, professional work on poverty and field work in East Harlem with Wagley and Padilla made her an ideal researcher for anthropologist Oscar Lewis's study of a poor urban area in Puerto Rico and in New York. In 1963, Green \\"served as one of Lewis' research assistants.\\" Her \\"field notes from that project became Lewis‚Äô [book]\\", La vida: a Puerto Rican family in the culture of poverty--San Juan and New York. In 1967, Lewis won the U.S. National Book Award in Science, Philosophy and Religion for La Vida.\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1967\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-05. After her experience on the project and with encouragement from Lewis, Green entered a doctoral program at the University of Arizona in Tucson, where she earned a Ph.D. in anthropology. Green's doctoral fieldwork was carried out on the Caribbean island of Aruba. Her dissertation, \\"Aspects of Interethnic Integration in Aruba, Netherlands Antilles\\", was done under the direction of anthropologist Edward H. Spicer, who also provided a way for Green to enter the university's doctorate program. Anthropologist St. Clair Drake described Green's anthropological work in the Dutch Antilles as groundbreaking. Drake explained that her work marked a turning point for black students who wished to do research on non-black groups. Previously, black students were \\"discouraged by their professors who would very likely to have used the argument that it 'wouldn't lead anywhere'. In some cases, they would have thought that blacks would not be accepted in the field by either 'natives' or their 'colonial overlords'. Green chose to research issues surrounding the social structure in the Dutch-controlled island of Aruba. There were very few West Indian anthropologists of color either, graduate students from the islands preferred fields like economics, political science, history, and the classics. When Green chose the Dutch Caribbean, it put her into the category of the unusual\\". She was the first African-American Caribbeanist. A Caribbeanist is a scholar who focuses on the \\"Caribbean region in the Americas\\". In some academic institutions, Caribbean Studies are often a part of Latin American Studies programs. The first African-American Caribbeanist, and the only African-American Caribbeanist, during most of the 1960s, Green was known for ‚Äúher study of family and ethnic relations in the Dutch Antilles and the United States‚Äù. She served as \\"supervising anthropologist for a research project in Aruba\\" and, in 1974, she published a book, Migrants in Aruba, which is based on her dissertation. Her other post-doctoral publications on topics involving the Caribbean included \\"Methodological Problems Involved in the Study of Aruban Family\\", which was presented during the Second Conference on Family in the Caribbean in 1973, \\"Racial vs. Ethnic Factors in Afro-American and Afro-Caribbean Migration\\", which was published in Migration, Change and Development: Implications for Ethnic Diversity and Political Conflict in 1975 and \\"Dominica in Political Parties of the Americas\\", published in 1982. Determined ‚Äúto foster the growth and development of a methodology for the study of Afro-American anthropology‚Äù, throughout her career, she insisted on the acknowledgment of diversity among and within black families, communities and culture and proposed methods for studying black communities. She published several articles during the 1970s, including ‚ÄúThe Confrontation of Diversity within the Black Community‚Äù, in which she documents \\"unification and polarizing influences\\" within the community. In the article, Green explained that \\"While in recent years Blacks have tended to become more unified at one level, there are indications that there are polarizing influences operating at another level. This influence may be felt in the differential use of the terms Negro and Black by certain of the more verbal segments of the population. The former is utilized to denote the \\"Uncle Toms,\\" or integrationist individuals of African descent, while the latter term is used to denote those who have undergone a \\"rebirth\\" in terms of Black pride. The \\"Toms\\" are often derogatorily referred to as \\"middle class,\\" and in contrast, there is a glorification of \\"our roots,\\" which by implication means the lower classes and the folk families. Implicit in this new usage is the accompanying idea that all persons of African descent were unaware of their history and sought escape from any form of \\"Negro\\" connection. As a result, the stage is being set for a confrontation of diversity among persons of African descent within the United States\\". In 1978, Green‚Äôs article ‚ÄúThe Black Extended Family: Some Research Suggestions\\" was published in Extended Family in Black Societies which was edited by Edith M. Shimkin and Dennis A. Frate. The article examined the limitations and contributions of two studies: (1) one conducted by Demitri B. Shimkin, Gloria J. Louie and Dennis Frate and (2) a second study conducted by Jack Jr. In her article, Green asserted that while the data presented in the studies could have \\"potentially increase[d] the understanding of [U.S.] black families in academic and administrative circles\\", it did not go far enough. She explained that the Shimkin, et al. and Jack studies focused primarily on \\"kinship ties\\", \\"adult adoption\\" and \\"fictive kin\\" in black families but missed the importance of nonkin and nonkin household units. The Shimkin, et al., and Jack studies also focused on \\"one type of extended family in the South\\" and as in other research on black American families, not enough attention was given to cultural ecology, ethnolinguistics (in this case the way the black families defined and perceived \\"weakness\\" and \\"strength\\") and situational factors, like cultural overlapping and cultural division among families. Over the course of her career, she also focused on the diversity of poverty, migrants and human rights. In 1980, International Human Rights: Contemporary Issues, a book Green co-edited with Jack L. Nelson, was released. In the introduction of the book, Nelson and Green proposed that nations come to a consensus on what are human rights. They explained that in \\"effort to have rhetoric and principles of political leaders, including political leaders in the United States, reflected in the actions, a worldwide agreement on the definition, characteristics, and example of human rights that would lead to appropriate development, monitoring and enforcement. Lack of intention consensus is the problem with human rights\\". As an educator, her ‚Äúwork on poverty, immigration, and poor and disenfranchised people of color, particularly those of African descent, was a mainstay in the classroom\\". In 1969, Green taught at various universities, including the University of Iowa, in 1969, and the University of Houston from 1969 to 1972. In 1972, she joined the faculty at Rutgers University, where she was appointed \\"graduate advisor and chair of the Anthropology Department and chair of the undergraduate division of Livingston College. From 1976 to 1982 she was the director of the Latin American Institute at Rutgers, which offered undergraduate and graduate certificate programs. With her \\"extensive network\\", Green attracted influential scholars and politicians, who gave lectures at the institute. Green served on the Executive Council of the American Anthropological Association. One of the founders of the Association of Black Anthropologist, she also served as the association's first president, sometimes hosting meetings in her home. She also took on the role of \\"convener to Quaker anthropologists\\". She was fluent in Spanish, French, Urdu, Tamil, Dutch, German and Papiamento.  Religion  A member of the 57th Street Meeting of Friends, Green was an unprogrammed Quaker who lent her expertise to support the mission of her faith. In 1973, at the request of the Religious Society of Friends, Green conducted a study to find out why black people were not joining the organization and what the organization could have done to attract black members. Green revealed her findings at a Friends General Conference meeting in June 1973 and distributed them in a report titled, \\"Blacks and Quakerism: A Preliminary Report\\". She found that some did not know about or knew very little about Quakerism. She also found that some of the religion's ideology like \\"lack of ceremony\\" and \\"understanding of humanity\\" appealed to black people while others like \\"patience\\" and \\"passivity\\" did not. Green also contributed to the anthology Black Fire: African American Quaker on Spirituality and Human Rights.

Legacy  In 1980, she was celebrated for her service and contribution to the field of anthropology, commitment to people of color and for her mentorship to young anthropologists by the Association of Black Anthropologists. Johnnetta Cole wrote Green's eulogy, which appeared in several publications. Green never married. And, did not have children of her own. She left her possessions, which included ‚Äúnotable collection of Caribbean art, to be auctioned off and the proceeds from her possessions to support scholarship programs for black and Puerto Rican students in need at Rutgers University and William Penn College. She also planned for the proceeds to support the Zora Neale Hurston collection of Southern black culture at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida. She arranged for her library and papers to be kept at the Tuskegee Institute. A. Lynn Bolles wrote an article, \\"African-American Soul Force: Dance, Music and Vera Mae Green\\" about Green's passion for dance, particularly the Rhumba. The article was published in Sage, in 1986. In 1996, anthropologist and author A. Lynn Bolles dedicated her book, Sister Jamaica, to the memory of Vera Mae Green.

Wright and published by HarperCollins. The novel was nominated for the 1995 Scotiabank Giller Prize and Governor General's Award in the English-language fiction category.  Plot  Howard Wheeler returns to his home in Northern Ontario where his family lived. Upon his mother's death, he comes back to sell off the property and reminisces about his childhood memories. His father Ross 'Buddy' Wheeler is an unsuccessful hockey player and his mother Grace Wheeler is a schoolteacher. Grace is a stern, taciturn woman who considered her decision to marry Ross as her biggest mistake. She had assumed that Ross's fascination with hockey would end after marrying and assuming responsibilities. Their married life is on rocks. Howard lives a life in-between his two parents, but is always Mama's boy. After the couple separates, Howard lives with Grace. Years later, when Howard accidentally meets his father, he regrets not having been in contact with him for these many years. The two meet in an unceremonial and awkward way, pondering their past and the mistakes which they could have remedied.  Publication and development  The book was the first of Wright's books to be published by HarperCollins, and his eighth novel overall. It was edited by Phyllis Bruce who later went on to work with Wright on various other projects. In a 2004 interview with the magazine Quill & Quire, Wright called The Age of Longing his \\"favourite among his novels\\".  Reception and review  Wright met success only after the publication of this novel in 1995. The novel was short-listed for the 1995 Scotiabank Giller Prize along with A Fine Balance (by Rohinton Mistry), The Piano Man's Daughter (by Timothy Findley), Mister Sandman (by Barbara Gowdy), and Like This (by Leo McKay). Judged by writer Mordecai Richler, critic David Staines, and novelist Jane Urquhart, the award was eventually presented to Mistry. Wright was also nominated for the Governor General's Award for the English-language fiction category which was ultimately presented to Greg Hollingshead for The Roaring Girl. Wright won both the Giller Prize and the Governor General's Award in 2001 for his novel Clara Callan.

It forms black crystals with three slightly different layered atomic structures, Œ±, Œ≤, and sometimes Œ≥. Lithium iridate exhibits metal-like, temperature-independent electrical conductivity, and changes its magnetic ordering from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic upon cooling to 15 K. Structure Li2IrO3 typically crystallizes in the Œ± or Œ≤ phase, and a rare Œ≥ phase has been reported. The crystal structure of Œ±-Li2IrO3 consists of an alternate stacking of hexagonal Li layers and honeycombs of edge-sharing IrO6 octahedra with Li in the center. The offset in adjacent layers results in a relatively low (monoclinic) crystal symmetry. Li2IrO3 crystals have abundant twinning defects where the ab crystal planes are rotated by 120¬∞ around the c axis. Synthesis Synthesis of Li2IrO3 from Li and Ir metals, which are oxidized during heating. The spiral staircase-like growth chamber allows for nucleation of different crystals at different staircase steps. Time- temperature diagram of Li2IrO3 synthesis. Li2IrO3 crystals can be grown by direct sintering of Ir and Li metals, which both oxidize during heating in ambient atmosphere. The Œ± phase is formed at 750‚Äì1050 ¬∞C, while heating to higher temperatures results in the Œ≤ phase. The use of Li metal instead of more traditional lithium carbonate, which is easier to handle and store, results in larger crystals. The Œ≥ phase can be obtained by the calcination of lithium carbonate and iridium(IV) oxide, followed by annealing in molten lithium hydroxide at 700‚Äì800 ¬∞C. Properties Lithium iridate is black in color and has a relatively high, temperature-independent electrical conductivity characteristic of metals. Its both Œ± and Œ≤ phases exhibit the Kitaev exchange coupling between magnetic spins originating from Ir4+ ions. These spins form an antiferromagnetic lattice at temperatures below 15 K (N√©el temperature, TN), while the material is paramagnetic above TN. Potential applications Lithium iridate is a potential electrode material for the lithium-ion battery. This application is hindered by the high costs of Ir, as compared to the cheaper Li2MnO3 alternative.

Ormeau is a rare and endangered rainforest tree of the genus Brachychiton found in Queensland, Australia.  Description  A species of Brachychiton, a tree reaching up to 25 metres in height, The leaves are dropped during dry seasons, a time when the species favours for reproduction, and return as pale to coppery coloured new growth. The flowering period is during September, the profuse display of green to white bell-shaped flowers appearing at the terminus of the branches;the width of each flower is around 10 mm. Fruiting pods appear around January to February, these are 3 cm long, brown, and boat-shaped. During the later stages of growth the trunk begins to form an exaggerated bottle-shape, and the leaves alter from a deeply lobed shape, divided from five to nine times, to a glossy and often elliptical leaf 12 to 20 centimetres long. The tree is capable of attaining a long life, somewhere over 120 years. Sexual maturity is reached after around twenty years.  Distribution and range  The Ormeau bottle trees are largely restricted in range, extending over of 6.5 km2 and have a very low population in an area of occupancy that is less than one square kilometre. The largest stand is regarded as the most viable population, recorded as 131 plants in located a conservation area. Two reproducing groups were found in a location that contain less than ten trees, other individuals occur as non-seeding outliers within the total population of 161 trees.  Conservation  The main group occurs within an 'environmental park', the Wongawallan Conservation Area in the rural suburb of Wongawallan, Queensland, where it is afforded some protection from threatening factors. The small groups outside this area are located on a lease for proposed quarries. The national government named this tree as one of thirty plants to be the given the highest priority for protection from extinction, and that its status be improved by the year 2020. The major threats identified are habitat loss, fire, insect and weed infestation and the remaining genetic diversity of their low numbers.

The battle ended in a decisive victory for the Later Jin and resulted in the capture of Fushun and two other nearby fortresses. Background The Jin khan Nurhaci was motivated to attack Fushun due to his grievances with Ming policies toward Jurchen tribes and heavy rains that had ruined the crops of his people, causing impending starvation. Military action against the Ming dynasty had been planned by Nurhaci for several years, and its initial success was the culmination of years of effort and planning. Nurhaci's preparations included establishing military farms to raise soldiers and supplies, distributing cattle to increase agricultural output, and cutting down trees to build siege weapons and buildings. By attacking Ming, Nurhaci hoped to consolidate his position as khan among the recently assimilated Jurchen tribes such as the Haixi Jurchens. Fushun, located on the Hun River about 10 kilometers east of Shenyang, was one of 18 key fortresses established in Liaodong by the Ming founder, the Hongwu Emperor. Fushun was targeted because of its close location to the Jin capital Hetu Ala, and also because it was isolated and less-well protected than other Ming fortresses. Its commander, Li Yongfang, was a mid-ranking commandant with only about 1,200 men under his command. Nurhaci was also familiar with the terrain and administration of Fushun since as a Ming tributary, he had traded there in the past. He knew that while Ming strength in the region was nominally 90,000, military administration had been lax, the quality of soldiers was poor, and salaries and rations had gone unpaid for several months. In strategic terms, Fushun made for a good springboard for a Jin assault. Course of battle On 7 May, Nurhaci proclaimed his Seven Grievances against the Ming and departed his capital of Hetu Ala with 20,000 men. The Jin army was met with heavy rains which hampered their movement but they were still able to make quick progress and arrived at Fushun on the 9th. A letter was delivered to the city explaining that the Jurchens were there because \\"your Ming country helped the Yehe.\\" The letter stated: The Jin army assailed the city walls with siege ladders and the unprepared garrison gave their lives in a hasty defense. Li Yongfang and his lieutenant, Zhao Yipeng, decided to surrender on the condition that no one was to be harmed. Nurhaci agreed to the terms and entered the city. Li was made a commander in the Jin army and granted a granddaughter of Nurhaci as his concubine for his role in minimizing Jin losses. Li would be the first in a series of Ming defections. Nurhaci left 4,000 men to hold Fushun while he took the remaining army to capture two nearby fortresses, which fell in quick succession. Meanwhile, news of the loss of Fushun had reached Ming on the 12th and a relief contingent of 10,000 under Zhang Chengyin was dispatched to retake the city. The Ming army arrived on the 15th and immediately set up three camps, dug trenches, and began bombarding the city with cannon fire. However Nurhaci's sons Hong Taiji and Dai≈°an sallied forth and routed the Ming forces, dealing heavy casualties. The victorious Jin army returned to Hetu Ala on the 20th. Aftermath Li Yongfang later fought as a lieutenant-general at the side of Nurhaci and participated in the Later Jin invasion of Joseon. Although spared and given privileged status as one of the first to defect, Li lost Nurhaci's confidence in 1622 when he opposed the khan's desire to massacre any Chinese refugees who sought to escape his rule. Despite this, Li remained ambivalent towards Ming overtures trying to re-enlist him in their army. Li Yongfang died in 1634 with the rank of viscount. All nine of his sons continued to provide service to the imperial throne. In response to Jin aggression, the Wanli Emperor made Li Rubai Commander of Liaodong, and Yang Hao the Military Affairs Commissioner. These two had previously served as commanders in the Ming army during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98), but their lackluster performance during the war had resulted in demotions. Hence Wanli's selection was at once understandable for choosing veterans, but also complicated by their careers. Furthermore, Li Rubai's father Li Chengliang had once served as Nurhaci's surrogate father, after Nurhaci's own father had been killed during a conflict for the leadership of the Jianzhou Jurchens. Two other military commanders, Du Song and Liu Ting, were also ordered to hasten to the northeastern frontier. The Ming court hoped to raise enough resources to amass a force of 130,000 for a punitive expedition against the Later Jin. The Ministry of War released 200,000 taels of silver for recruitment of soldiers. The Court of the Imperial Stud released 60,000 taels to purchase war horses. The Ming court was also intent on building new ships for military transportation, but ran into a lack of funds in the Ming capital, and were forced to requisition supplies from Nanjing, the secondary capital. Problems with military administration such as unpaid salaries and a lack of funds were also presented to Wanli by Acting Minister of War Bi Sancai. Bi hoped that Wanli would dip into his own personal funds to finance the war effort, which required five times more than what the Ministry of War could raise on their own. Wanli responded by saying that the imperial coffers were empty.

The club fields a team in both the Men's SBL (MSBL) and Women's SBL (WSBL). The club is a division of Kalamunda & Districts Basketball Association (KDBA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the City of Kalamunda. The Suns play their home games at Ray Owen Sports Centre. Club history =Background= Kalamunda & Districts Basketball Association (KDBA) was incorporated on 1 October 1971. In 1991, after a period of non affiliation with Basketball Western Australia, KDBA entered teams as the Kalamunda Hornets in the WA Junior State League competition. After a decade of little success for KDBA, Basketball Western Australia encouraged the amalgamation of KDBA and their regional rival Swan Districts Basketball Association (SDBA). For a number of years, Kalamunda and Swans both entered about 9‚Äì12 of the 14 available divisions‚ÄîBasketball WA sought to fill all divisions. This led to Hills Raiders Basketball Association (HRBA) seeking an opportunity for their players to access this level of competition. As a result, a new association called Eastern Region Basketball Association (ERBA), playing as Eastern Suns, was formed in 2001. The ERBA's inaugural president was Bob Little (HRBA President & SDBA Life Member) and all three associations had two representatives with ERBA. Initially there was input from all three associations, but this deteriorated when Swans (SDBA) found themselves in financial difficulty with increasing debt to Basketball WA. KDBA was in a position to seek a license from the State Basketball League (SBL) but was unwilling to assume the SDBA debt as part of their license (in excess of $40,000). Swan City Mustangs SBL and Association ceased to operate following the 2003 season. In 2005, Basketball WA indicated that they would not be happy with the Eastern Suns (ERBA) having SDBA as part of the structure at either WABL or SBL level. They were only prepared to support an affiliated Association as the governing body of the WABL program. There were a series of meetings where SDBA maintained they still existed and HRBA sought to have representative involvement. Subsequently, HRBA declined to remain involved, and on 12 January 2006, ERBA was formally disbanded. In March 2006, the KDBA introduced their representative arm as the Kalamunda Eastern Suns. A formal approach to join the SBL was made and initial indications were that 2007 would be possible. Subsequently, Basketball WA made a statement in March 2007 claiming that Kalamunda could enter the SBL with both Men's and Women's teams in 2008. =SBL= In 2008, Kalamunda & Districts Basketball Association (KDBA) secured a Men's and Women's SBL license. The inaugural men's coach was Joe Mackay, while Craig Mansfield and Rob Butt coached the women's team. While the men's team finished in ninth place with a 12‚Äì14 record, the women's earned a finals berth with a sixth-place finish and a 13‚Äì11 record. They went on to sweep the third-seeded Cockburn Cougars in the quarter-finals, before losing to the Perry Lakes Hawks in the semi-finals. In 2013, the women's team made their way through to their first WSBL Grand Final behind coach Craig Mansfield and captain Chelsea Armstrong, as well as Ajay Jones, Jennie Rintala and Melissa Moyle. They finished the regular season in fifth place with a 12‚Äì10 record and advanced through the first two rounds of the finals undefeated, beating the Lakeside Lightning in the quarter-finals and the South West Slammers in the semi-finals. In the championship decider at the WA Basketball Centre on 30 August, the Suns were defeated 72‚Äì47 by the Wanneroo Wolves.

The composition was written at the request of a Persian priest, sent to Epiphanius by letter from the Roman emperor in Constantinople.Allen A.

A fifth Greek translation was discovered in wine jars in Jericho, and a sixth in Nicopolis near Actium. Afterwards, Origen arranged six columns of the extant Greek translations and two of the Hebrew side by side, naming it the Hexapla.Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 33-34, 36 Epiphanius expands his description of the translation of the seventy-two translators (known as the Septuagint) and how they were assigned thirty-six cells, two to each cell, on the Pharian island. Two translators translated the Book of Genesis, another two the Book of Exodus, another two the Book of Leviticus, and so forth, until the entire 22 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible had all been translated into the Greek tongue.Excluding Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon, which books had only later been added to the canon, according to Jewish tradition. The seventy-two translators were drawn from the twelve tribes of Israel, six men to each tribe who were skilled in the Greek language. In folios [49a‚Äì50a] Epiphanius gives a description of the canonical books of the Hebrew Bible and translations made of the same. In his day, he notes that the Scroll of Ruth and the Book of Judges were joined together, and considered as one book. So, too, the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah were joined, and considered as one book, as were First and Second Chronicles (Paraleipomena) considered as one book, as were the First and Second Samuel (Book of First and Second Kingdoms) considered as one book, and the First and Second Kings (Book of Third and Fourth Kingdoms) considered as one book.Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version (ed.

Steven Notley & Ze'ev Safrai, in their book, \\"Eusebius, Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture (Brill: Leiden 2005, p. 19, note 47), have noted: \\"According to his (Epiphanius') formulation, it would seem that he was of the opinion that Hiwarta, which means 'white' (lavan), is the translation of Azekah. About five kilometers to the southeast of Tell Zechariah is a high hill called Tell el-Beida, meaning in Arabic 'white'. In current maps, the site is named Tell Livnin, which means the hill of bricks (livanim), and it is to this that Eusebius (who also wrote about Azekah) most probably referred. 'Azekah' is not 'white', either in Hebrew or in Aramaic. Le-azek in Hebrew means to remove stones, and then the soil appears a bit paler. It therefore appears that Epiphanius, who was born in Beit Zedek, near Eleutheropolis, identified Azekah with Tell el-Beida. Azekah is six kilometers from Eleutheropolis, and Tell Livnin is eight kilometers from there. Epiphanius adapted the new name to the identification by means of an etymological exegesis that has no linguistic basis. At any rate, no settlement existed on Tell Azekah in the Roman-Byzantine period. The early site moved from the high hill to the fields in the plain at the foot of the tell. It may possibly have moved as fr as Kh. el-Beida, although this is difficult to accept.\\" Bethel (¬ß 73); Ophrah (¬ß 67); Carthage (¬ß 79) - where the Canaanites had migrated from Phoenicia and who were called in his day Bizakanoi (scattered people); Rekem (¬ß 71), Jaffa (¬ß 75), Jerusalem(¬ß 74), et al.

With respect to events in Rome after the reign of Pertinax, both Epiphanius and Jerome do not mention the ascension of Didius Julianus after the assassination of Pertinax, but write only that Severus succeeded him.Cf. Chronicon of Jerome, 2005 online edition (tertullian.org), year 193. Epiphanius, by his own admittance (On Weights and Measures, p. 66 [folio 71c]), was familiar with Eusebius' Chronicle from which Jerome had based his Chronicon and may have used it to construct his own chronologies. This may have been because they did not consider his 9-week reign, which he obtained through usurpation, to be legitimate. Similarly, Epiphanius does not mention the ascension of Aemilian. It can be adduced from Jerome's Chronicon that Aemilian, who \\"caused a revolt in Moesia,\\" was never officially confirmed by the Senate in Rome.Chronicon of Jerome, 2005 online edition (tertullian.org), year 254 Epiphanius' method of recording the regnal years from Augustus to Hadrian, with his pinpoint recollection of the number of months and days to each reign, can be said to be accurate, based on Josephus' own testimony about himself, saying that he was aged 56 in the 13th year of the reign of Caesar Domitian,Josephus, Antiquities (20.11.3) and that he (Josephus) was born in the 1st year of Caesar Gaius.Josephus, Vita ¬ß 1 Using Epiphanius' chronology, the years are indeed collected as 56. By comparison, the span of years in Suetonius' De vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars), which gives 14 years for Claudius and 15 years for Nero, the same time frame would span a period of some 58 years!Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars (the Loeb Classical Library series), vol. ii, book v, paragraph xlv See also * List of Roman emperors * Ptolemaic dynasty Additional reading * Renan Baker, \\"Epiphanius, 'On Weights and Measures' ¬ß14: Hadrian's Journey to the East and the Rebuilding of Jerusalem\\", pub. in: Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, vol. 182 (2012), pp. 157-167 References External links * Epiphanius‚Äô Treatise on Weights and Measures: The Syriac Version, Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization (SAOC) Category:4th-century books Category:Syriac literature Category:4th-century history books Category:Works by Epiphanius of Salamis Category:Christian apologists Category:Chronologists Category:Holy Land during Byzantine rule Category:Greek chronicles Category:Roman-era biographers Category:Textual scholarship Category:Byzantine writers Category:History of the Levant Category:Obsolete units of measurement Category:Units of volume Category:Systems of units Category:Human-based units of measurement Category:Roman emperors Category:Christian apologetic works ","title":"On Weights and Measures"},{"id":"53552375","text":"Fanattic Sports Museum (FSM) is a sports museum, dedicated to various types of sports and located at Ecospace Business Park in Action Area - II of New Town, Kolkata, India.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. History At the beginning of the 1900s, Saugatuck was becoming more popular as a resort town. The municipal water system at the time consisted of a series of cisterns coupled with private wells. Several fires destroyed wooden buildings in town, and the system was proving inadequate. After yet another fire in November 1903, a special election was called to approve the issuance of $8500 in bonds to pay for design and construction of a system of water works. The measure passed, and in early 1904, the village hired John W. Alvord to prepare plans for and superintend the construction of a 100,000-gallon reservoir located at a high point west of the Kalamazoo River, along with pumps to feed the reservoir and a main running back into the town. Work began in May, and what is now the south section of this pump house was completed by mid-August. The entire system was operational by October 1904. When the system was completed, this pump house contained two 25-horsepower gasoline-powered pumps that drew water from seven wells and pumped it to a nearby reservoir. In 1912, the pump house was enlarged with another section to house an electric power generating station. The pump house continued to be used for both water and electric generation until approximately 1930. After the pumping and electric generation facilities had been moved to another location, the pump house was abandoned. By 1970, the building was in complete disrepair, and a portion of one wall had fallen in. The building was slated for demolition. However, in 1972, Dr. and Mrs. William Shorey of Chicago offered to lease the property from the village for twenty years to serve as their cottage, in exchange for restoring the building. The village agreed, and the couple removed the old equipment, redid brickwork, installed a new roof and new floor, and converted the building into a cottage. By 1992 the lease had expired and William Shorey had died. The city leased the pump house to the Saugatuck-Douglas Historical Society, who refurbished the interior and opened it as the Pump House Museum. In 2001, the Society added an entrance pavilion. Inside the Museum, volunteers design and construct a new exhibit every year, focusing on local history. Description Road side of pump house The Saugatuck Pump House is a single story red brick structure with a hipped roof on a concrete and block foundation. The building was constructed in two parts, and measures 58 feet in length along the river sides by 27 feet wide (in the 1912 north section) or 22 feet wide (in the 1904 south section). It is located on the west bank of the Kalamazoo River, across from downtown Saugatuck. The hipped roof ends in flaring eaves with wide overhangs and exposed rafter ends. Four sets of triple windows topped by white-painted colonial caps are located on the river side. Two triple windows and two double windows are in the low road side. The roof, originally clad with slate, is covered with asphalt shingles. The interior is divided into two connected rooms and a small bathroom. It still contains the original wood- finished ceilings, along with some original exposed brick walls. Other sections of the interior are finished with sheetrock. A paved entry trail and small garden are outside the building.

She is a daughter of the Czech contemporary sculptor Stanislav Hanzik.  Biography  Her work contributed in important ways to the exploration of developmental and regenerative processes in the nervous system. With her husband and scientific collaborator, Dr. Vaclav Ourednik, she worked for over three decades at renowned universities and institutions such as Harvard University and ETH Z√ºrich. Together, they published in high-profile scientific journals like Science, Nature and PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Their work described plastic processes governing the development and regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) and the design of innovative therapeutic approaches towards injury and degenerative disease of the spinal cord and brain. During the International Year of Astronomy 2009, the two researchers founded the Alpine Astrovillage, a center for astrophotography and stargazing. It is situated in the Eastern Swiss Alps, in the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Val M√ºstair-Swiss National Park. For her scientific, educative, and popularizing work, Jitka Ourednik received many credits and recognitions. She organized scientific congresses and chaired talk sessions during national and international events. Her neuroscientific research focused on the induction of then still unexplored regenerative capacities of the CNS in relation to transplantation of embryonic neural tissue and of neural stem cells. In 2005, the scientist couple was invited to present their new ideas and findings during the prestigious Nobel-Forum lectures for young investigators at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Since 2009, the two have dedicated themselves exclusively to their popular science and educative work and the running of their AAV Center in Switzerland.

He was one of the most prolific Art Nouveau style Brussels architects of his time, and also worked as a property developer. Most of his work was produced from 1897 to 1909 and in particular between 1898 and 1904, the period during which he achieved around fifty houses. Blerot married Yvonne de Gheus d'Elzenwalle on July 25, 1912, in Ixelles. Yvonne de Gheus d'Elzenwalle was born on September 26, 1893, in Ixelles and died in her home town on December 5, 1951. Biographical facts =Background= Ernest Blerot was born on February 21, 1870 in Ixelles, in a bourgeois and Catholic family. He was the middle child of a family of three. His father Joseph Ernest Blerot who was born on August 25, 1838 in Bastogne and died on October 9, 1917 in Ixelles, was a pharmacist, chauss√©e de Wavre, 165, and had married Jeanne M√©lanie Knaepen on April 25, 1864 in Ixelles, who was born in Ixelles on April 15, 1844 and died in the same place on April 14, 1900. =Ernest Blerot‚Äôs early years= He was fourteen years old when he implemented a system similar to the concept of the Yale locks. Enjoying hiking, he regularly went to the Alps of the Valais in Switzerland. He obtained his master's degree in architecture at the former architecture school on the Sint-Lukas campus in Schaarbeek. The architect =Specificities= Ernest Blerot‚Äôs intent was not to reinvent architecture, in contrast to Victor Horta. The architecture design of his projects differed slightly from the classic pattern of the Brussels one-family houses of the time that was partly determined by the establishment of regulations which set the widths and depths of the lots in the new residential neighborhoods, six- meters facade for about fifteen meters deep. The middle-class houses consisted often of a semi-underground level for services (kitchen cellar) topped with the elevated ¬´ ground floor ¬ª that was composed of three adjoining rooms, and with two floors of bedrooms. The bulk of the architect‚Äôs buildings are concentrated in a few streets and blocks in groups of terraced houses, the most important being a series of seventeen houses that occupied an entire side of a street. This standardisation kept the homogeneity of the whole, and above all helped strongly reduce construction time and cost. This work process made houses designed by Blerot affordable to the petty bourgeoisie with whom he was very popular. For every house, Blerot designed a different facade, every indoor and outdoor decorative element was customized. He designed his own stained-glass windows, sgraffito works, decorative ironwork, mosaics, pieces of wooden furniture or door handles with meticulous attention to detail. =The business man= Ernest Blerot kept some of the houses he built as his private property. He will later transform part of it into apartment buildings he will rent out. He made a fortune in a short time. During the following years, when the public's attraction for the Art Nouveau began to decrease, he would find it difficult to adjust to the new needs and will cease his activities. =After the First World War= in Voormezele In 1919, Ernest Blerot dedicated himself to the reconstruction of in the Ypres area, inherited from his wife‚Äôs family. At the end of his life, enthusiastic about mechanical things, he designed prototypes of motor vehicles. He died on January 19, 1957, in his mansion located near the Ixelles Ponds, and was buried at Voormezele, near Ypres.

It has broadly egg-shaped to wedge- shaped leaves, white flowers arranged singly or in groups of up to three on the ends of short side branches and fruit that fall from the plant shortly after the seeds are released. Description Leptospermum oligandrum is an erect spreading shrub that grows to a height of and has thin stringy or flaky bark on the older stems. The young stems are silky-hairy at first, later glabrous. The leaves are broadly egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base or wedge-shaped, long and wide tapering to a petiole less than long. The flowers are white, wide and arranged singly or in groups of up to three on short, leafy side shoots. The flower buds have egg-shaped, reddish brown bracts and bracteoles at the base but that usually fall off well before the flower opens. The floral cup is or more long on a thin pedicel long. The sepals are long and are not differentiated from the floral cup. The petals are long and the stamens about long. Flowering mainly occurs from September to December and the fruit is a capsule long with the remnants of the sepals attached but that falls from the plant when the seeds mature. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum oligandrum was first formally described in 1852 by Nikolai Turczaninow in the Bulletin de la Classe Physico-Math√©matique de l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale des Sciences de Saint-P√©tersbourg from material collected by James Drummond. The specific epithet (oligandrum) is derived from ancient Greek words (), meaning 'few' and , genitive (, genitive ), meaning 'male', referring to the few stamens in the flowers.Backer, C.A. (1936).

Plot Fifteen-year-old Touya Mochizuki is accidentally killed by God. As an apology, God allows him to be resurrected, but since he cannot send him back to his old world, he instead reincarnates him into a fantasy world along with a single special request. Touya uses his request in order to bring his smartphone into the new world with him, which God modifies. As such, while Touya cannot contact his old world with it, the phone can be easily recharged by magic and can otherwise function such as accessing data from the old world and can use relevant features for his new world such as the GPS function to locations which are comprehensively identified on it. God also greatly amplifies Touya's physical, magical, and cognitive abilities to a certain degree as a further apology for the inconvenience of killing him. Taking full advantage of his second chance at life, Touya befriends many different people, mainly females and high-ranking people in the new world.

The battle ended with the Jin conquest of Qinghe despite taking heavy casualties. Background The Jin army had conquered the fortress of Fushun and defeated a Ming army 10,000 strong. After resting for a month in Hetu Ala, Nurhaci set out again to take the fortress of Qinghe. After the initial Jin attack on Fushun, the Ming court assigned the military commanders Li Rubai and Yanghao to Liaodong. The fortress of Qinghe was reinforced from several hundred men to a garrison force of 6,400. Yang Hao advised the commander of Qinghe, Zou Chuxian, to lay an ambush for the Jin in a nearby mountain pass with cannons. However Zou opted to stay in the fortress. Course of battle Nurhaci arrived at Qinghe and besieged it. The defenders fired cannons and hurled logs and boulders at the enemy. Despite sustaining heavy casualties, the Jin army was able to take the northwest corner of the wall before the defenders could reload their cannons. The battle continued within the city from street to street until the entire city was slaughtered. Zou died in combat. The Jin army fanned out from Qinghe and took an additional 11 nearby towns, reaching as far as Shenyang. An advance force laid siege to Shenyang but was repulsed by Li Rubai and He Shixian, suffering 230 casualties. Aftermath Liu Ting arrived at Shanhai Pass, which marked the border between China proper and Liaodong. He immediately began training recruits from far off Sichuan, but stressed to the Ming court that he needed more time. Ming's Ministry of Revenue raised taxes three-hundredths of a tael per mu to help fund training and supply costs for the Liaodong defense. The court also put a bounty of 10,000 taels on Nurhaci's head.

It has thin, firm bark, egg-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, relatively large, pink flowers and fruit that fall from the plant with the seeds. It grows in windswept rock crevices near Esperance. Description Leptospermum sericeum is a shrub that typically grows to a height of and has thin, firm bark. The leaves are egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, mostly long and wide, tapering to a short, broad petiole. The leaves are covered with a layer of silvery grey hairs, at least at first, sometimes becoming glabrous later. The flowers are pink, wide and are arranged singly or in pairs on short side shoots. The flower buds have reddish brown bracts and bracteoles at the base but that fall off well before the flower opens. The floral cup is long on a short pedicel and is densely covered with soft hairs.

Flowering mainly occurs from August to September and the fruit is a capsule about long on a pedicel usually long. The remnants of the sepals remain attached to the fruit, but the fruit falls from the plant when the seeds mature. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum sericeum was first described in 1806 by Jacques Labillardi√®re who published the description in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. Labillardi√®re mistakenly gave the type location as \\"Capite van Diemen\\" (Tasmania). George Bentham considered it a synonym of Kunzea sericea Turcz. in Flora Australiensis, as did Joy Thompson in her 1990 paper in the journal Telopea. The Australian Plant Census considers that Charles Gardner was correct in listing Kunzea sericea and L. sericea as separate species, the former occurring more than from the coast and L. sericea as being found on the islands of the Recherche Archipelago. (Kunzea sericea is now considered to be a synonym of Kunzea pulchella.)

The squadron operates worldwide, and recovering aircraft from post-crash incidents is a large part of their work. Whilst they are a component of the British military, they may be asked to attend and recover aircraft from non-military incidents (such as the 2015 Shoreham Airshow crash) as they have a Memorandum of Understanding with the UK's Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB). History = Background = Western Desert while transporting salvaged Hawker Hurricane fuselages to Helwan, Egypt during the Second World War. Assessing, salvaging, repairing and transporting crashed aircraft was the responsibility of No.'s 49, 58, 60 & 71 Maintenance Units during the Second World War. Gradually, 71 MU took over all responsibility for this task worldwide as well as carrying out routine aircraft transportation. This was strengthened as the other MU's were disbanded. 71 MU was formed in July 1940 at Slough with elements taken from 49 MU at RAF Faygate. The unit was moved to RAF Bicester in 1953. In 1976 the unit merged with 60 MU to form the Repair and Salvage Squadron (RSS) at RAF Abingdon. The RSS was moved to RAF St Athan in 1992 where it stayed for 15 years. = Establishment = The Joint Aircraft Recovery and Transportation Squadron (JARTS) was established on 1 May 2007. It was formed from the RAF's Forward Support Integrated Project Team and the Aircraft Recovery & Transportation Flight (ARTF) based at MOD St Athan, which dealt with fixed wing aircraft post-crash management (ACPM) and the Royal Navy's Mobile Aircraft Support Unit (Transport & Salvage) at DARA Fleetlands in Gosport, which carried out similar activities for rotary wing aircraft. The two elements operated from their respective home stations until the Autumn of 2010 when they were combined at MOD Boscombe Down in Wiltshire. Boscombe Down's location near RAF Benson and RAF Odiham, AAC Middle Wallop and RNAS Yeovilton was seen as convenient for the frequent tasks involving helicopters that JARTS undertakes. Initially subordinate to No. 85 (Expeditionary Logistics) Wing, at some point JARTS moved under the command of No. 42 (Expeditionary Support) Wing. Between its inception in 2007 and October 2010, JARTS was responsible for the routine movement of 600 aircraft worldwide.  Role  The Joint Aircraft Recovery and Transportation Squadron is the only unit within the British Armed Forces which carries out aircraft recovery and transportation. JARTS is based at MOD Boscombe Down in Wiltshire. It is part of the RAF A4 Force, the RAF's deployable engineering and logistics capability. The squadron is primarily staffed by Royal Air Force service personnel and the Royal Navy make up the rest (about 20%). Aircraft recovered by JARTS may have crashed or more typically suffered a hard landing. The squadron provides aircraft post- crash management (ACPM), specialist handling capabilities and onward transportation to the aircraft's home station or other location for repair or scrap. The unit also regularly transports retired military aircraft which are destined to become gate guardians or museum exhibits, which although a secondary to the main task of post-crash management, fulfils the bulk of JARTS's work.. JARTS also have a remit to assist the AAIB when requested to do so by the AAIB. Some of the most notable instances of this have been Pan Am Flight 103 (the Lockerbie Disaster), the 2008 Boeing 777 crash at Heathrow and the 2015 Shoreham Airshow crash, when a former RAF Hawker Hunter crashed onto the A27 road in East Sussex. The aircraft was in private hands, but because of the knowledge and experience held by JARTS of moving old aircraft that are used as gate guardians, the AAIB requested their help. Moving gate guardians is also within the remit of JARTS and whilst this is This can involve simply swapping aircraft over, such as at RAF Leeming when a Gloster Javelin was swapped for a Tornado F3 which was repositioned at the front gate; or when a base closes such as at RAF Brampton when its F4 Phantom was moved back to Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk, from where it used to fly. Aircraft moves are also undertaken to enable training to be accomplished on them at various sites.

He ruled from 1869 to 1888, and tried to keep Negri Sembilan independent from British rule. His son Tuanku Muhammad Shah succeeded him and modernised his state. Early Life Tuanku Antah was the son of the late Yamtuan Radin, the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan from 1824 to 1861, and of his consort, Tuanku Ampuan Intan Tunku Alang Husain. One of his wives whom he married was Cik Puan Wan Siti binti Haji Doraman in which they lived at the Kampung Tanjung Jati, Kuala Pilah. They had issued 2 sons Tunku Putra Sulaiman Ibni Tuanku Antah and Tunku Laksamana Abdul Kahar Tuanku Antah. History =Sungai Ujong= His struggle against the British began in March 1872 when Datuk Kelana Syed Abdul Rahman, who governed Sungai Ujong (modern- day Seremban) allowed the British to open a tin mine and set up their operations within his domain. With the help of British soldiers, he defeated his enemy Datuk Bandar Tunggal and burned Rahang. As the appointment of a foreigner, Resident PJ Murray, into Datuk Kelana's court was seen by other local officials as an invitation of a British invasion, the officials crowned Tuanku Antah as the Yamtuan of Seri Menanti, who did not recognise Datuk Kelana's authority. Datuk Kelana claimed Terachi as part of his territory in 1875, causing Tuanku Antah to get angry. He dismissed the local government there that supported Datuk Kelana. Resident PR Murray interpreted this as a breach against Datuk Kelana's administration, so he went to Terachi with 20 soldiers lead by Lieutenant Hinxman, and an interpreter and doctor from Australia known as Dominic Daly to investigate, but they did not find any sign of disorder there. PR Murray returned to Sungai Ujong, but Daly travelled from Kampung Terachi to Kuala Pilah to measure their distances. Daly was turned away when his party stumbled unto 200 men who threatened them to leave, and requested PR Murray to help him. =Battle of Bukit Putus= Tuanku Antah mobilised 4000 soldiers in preparation for the oncoming British invasion, and was helped by several others: Datuk Siamang Gagap, the Tunku Besar of Tampin, and the people of Rembau, Jelebu, and Johol. His army marched into Bukit Putus and Paroi, where he warned PJ Murray not to interfere with his sovereignty by trespassing into Terachi. The British Resident then requested help from the Straits Settlements, who sent 20 soldiers led by Lieutenant Peyton from Melaka, while Lieutenant Hinxman and his troops immediately dug trenches and fortified their compound, due to uprisings. Lieutenant Hinxman also brought another army with him, consisting of 30 troops, 30 policemen, and 6 Arabs, to attack Tuanku Antah at Paroi, but they were outnumbered by the locals, who surrounded and defeated them, while Tuanku Antah's forces occupied a house along the banks of the Linggi River as their base of operations. On 5 December 1875, the British used Datuk Kelana's cannons to fight against Tuanku Antah. After a one-hour-long shootout, Lieutenants Hinxman and Peyton advanced through a swamp to destroy Tuanku Antah's fort, but they were not able to find him, and Tunku Laksamana took his place to govern Seri Menanti. Reinforced by 350 soldiers led by Governor Anson from Pulau Pinang, the British bombarded Tuanku Antah's fortress. Tuanku Antah was forced to retreat, and the British retook Paroi. With the arrival of the battleship HMS Thistle to Sungai Ujong, still more reinforcements arrived under Lieutenant Colonel Clay, who led his group of 280 soldiers to retake Bukit Sungai Ujong. He later led his troops through Langkap into Bukit Putus, where his forces defeated more of Tuanku Antah's soldiers, and advanced on to Seri Menanti. Notified of the British approaching to his capital, Tuanku Antah fled with his family to Johor, where they came into the protection of Sultan Abu Bakar. Sultan Abu Bakar then advised him to make peace with the British. On May 1876, Tuanku Antah arranged a meeting with the four Undang-Undang of Negeri Sembilan between them and William Jervois, the Governor of Singapore. Under a peace treaty between all the belligerents , the British agreed to allow Tuanku Antah to rule Seri Menanti, Johol, Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunung Pasir, and Innas, and renamed his title Yang Di Pertuan Seri Menanti while the other regions of Negeri Sembilan will continue to be ruled by their respective leaders, and Sungai Ujong remains under British rule. =Death= After two years of retreat into Johor, Tuanku Antah returned to Seri Menanti, where he lived there for eleven years. He died in 1888, and was buried at the Seri Menanti Royal Mausoleum.

It is located approximately south west of Port Hedland and south east of Karratha on the Peawah River in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.  Background  The station was one of the earliest pastoral leases in the North West, with the lease being taken up by the Withnell family in the late 1870s or early 1880s. Gold was discovered on the property in January 1888. Jimmy and Harding Withnell were working on the property when they saw a crow sitting on their lunch box. Jimmy picked up a stone to throw at the crow and noticed light reflecting off particles of gold. This was one of the earliest reported discoveries of gold in the North West. Roy Hill Station was established in 1886 by Nat Cooke, who owned Mallina Station. Mallina had suffered from several years drought, so Cooke was keen to secure new pastures. The station was owned in 2008 by Peter Cook, a pharmacist, who owned other properties in the Pilbara including Croydon, Hooley, Pyramid and Sherlock Stations. In 2015 it was purchased by Bettini Bros (now Bettini Beef) in a package with Pyramid and Sherlock Stations. The Bettinis still owned the leases in 2018.

The novel was released in Polish on March 10, 2015, and shortly afterward, on March 24 that year, in English (translated by Stanley Bill). It has been described as \\"an experiment in reading (and creating) the electronic literature of the future\\". It is Dukaj's first novel and was translated to English as of 2017. His homepage described the work as his \\"debut in English\\", though several of his short stories (The Golden Galley, 1996, The Iron General, 2010, The Apocrypha of Lem, 2011) have been translated prior to this. The novel has inspired a 2020 Netflix-original Belgian TV series Into the Night. Plot The novel presents a post-apocalyptic, cyberpunk vision of Earth where biological life has been wiped out, inhabited by robots and mechs, many of which are humans whose consciousness has been digitized in the wake of an extinction event. Significance and analysis The novel is an example of electronic literature, available only in digital formats, and has no traditional paper version. It was designed from the beginning not only to incorporate more traditional elements such as illustrations, but also hypertext, and 3D-printable models of main robotic characters designed by Alex Jaeger, the art director of Transformers films. The novel composition is layered, with the narrative layer, an encyclopedic/hyperlinked footnote layer, and a multimedia layer, including illustrations and a short movie-like trailer done by Oscar-nominated Platige Image studio. One of the novel's central questions is: \\"What does it mean to be human?\\" Other subjects are \\"staples of cyberpunk and related genres, such as the artificial intelligence\\". The novel is representative of Dukaj's prose, posing philosophical questions about the future of man and technology. The other major element of the novel is Dukaj's attempts to introduce the reader to the new style of electronic literature. The novel was nominated for the 2016 Janusz A. Zajdel Award.

She belonged to the generation of women painters in the 1880s who adopted the French Realism style, becoming an active member of the √ñnningeby artists colony on the island of √Öland. As an author, she is remembered mainly for her depictions of Scandinavian artists at the end of the 19th century. Biography Born on 16 April 1862 in H√§meenlinna, R√∂nnberg was the daughter of Johan R√∂nnberg and Evelin Sofie Stenvall. She studied at the Finnish Art Society's Drawing School (1875‚Äì81) in Helsinki and at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts (1881‚Äì85) in Stockholm. She went on to attend courses in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian and the Acad√©mie Colarossi. Portrait by Elin Danielson-Gambogi She became particularly attached to the artists colony at √ñnningeby where the painter Victor Westerholm had a summer house. One of the most important members of the group, she first visited in 1886 and returned year after year. She contributed to the colony's success by including it in her fictional and non-fictional writings. One of the members of the colony was Elin Danielson with whom she painted both in √ñnningeby and in Paris. In 1888, Edvard Westman invited her to join him in Denmark. They met in Copenhagen and together visited the Danish artists colony in Skagen. For a time they planned to marry but never did. Portrait by Ida Gisiko-Sp√§rck, 1895 Her paintings often included people. Her best works appeared around 1890, some achieving success at exhibitions. Her early works of outdoor scenes on √Öland were inspired by the French en plein air movement. She continued to paint in the 1890s and even later, introducing brighter colour and sweeping brushstrokes. In 1932, she arranged a solo exhibition of the paintings. She became interested in the lives of the inhabitants of the √Öland Islands, including them in her fiction and non-fiction writings. From the early 1890s, she concentrated increasingly on her short story collections including Fr√•n √Ölands sk√§r (1899) and Brovaktens historier (1905) which received a Swedish literature award in 1905. In 1938, she published an account of the artist colony in Konstn√§rskolonien p√• √Ñland 1886‚Äì1914. Hanna R√∂nnberg spent her later years in a villa on the coast in Kulosaari just outside Helsinki where she died on 9 October 1946.

In the interview, Davis expressed vivid concern over why this school had not been built with proper safe spaces; the majority of schools in Oklahoma at the time also lacked safe spaces.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Msm2Rl3jlg&t;=17s&list;=PLer- Jt80Br3I6MG5Yurh81cZucLqfeYFd&index;=2 Betsy Gunzelmann, author of Developing Safer Schools and Communities for Our Children: The Interdisciplinary Responsibility of Our Time, wrote that lives could have been saved if such a room was present.Gunzelmann, Betsy. Developing Safer Schools and Communities for Our Children: The Interdisciplinary Responsibility of Our Time. Rowman & Littlefield, February 5, 2015. , 9781475807554. p. 46. According to Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management Albert Ashwood, the cost of a safe room would have ranged from $600,000 to $1 million. A civil engineer who serves as an associate professor and as the director of the Donald G. Fears Structural Engineering Lab at the University of Oklahoma, Chris Ramseyer, examined photographs of the third grade building and concluded that the construction of the third grade center was flawed as the rebar in the reinforced concrete walls was not long enough. It was not possible to study the debris itself since it had been cleared before engineers had a chance to examine it. On August 19, 2014 the rebuilt school opened with a safe area. Campus The current building has a portion considered to be a \\"safe area\\" under Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) standards. This includes a hallway which, in order to limit injuries due to flying debris during a tornado, has no windows, as well as four classrooms with attached bathroom facilities. During normal operations, early childhood and pre-Kindergarten students are housed in this section. The building, with a capacity for 600-640 pupils, had a total cost of $12 million, paid from insurance coverage, and was built with a similar size as the previous building. When it opened, the school received new computers also paid for by insurance money. In the building, designed in a similar manner to that of South Lake Elementary School, has multiple wings with different grade levels; two classrooms each are dedicated per grade. The media center is across from the office, which was designed as the entry point for visitors. The wing for third through fifth graders includes the school's art room, computer lab, and music room. Included in the new school building is a section of the wall of the old school, decorated with the panther mascot, that survived the tornado. The school has the Plaza Towers 7 Memorial, a memorial to the seven students who died in the 2013 tornado. It was completed in November 2014, and includes a large tree adjacent to a set of seven benches; each bench has the name of the child and features specific to each child's personality and interests. It is decorated with gray and mahogany granite slabs. The plaques were decorated with silhouettes of the students. The Moore Rotary Club coordinated the fundraising to establish the memorial, which raised $226,000 for the memorial itself and $20,000 for maintenance. Fundraising concluded in 2015.

It was dedicated, as a hostel for \\"friendless\\" men, on 25 October 1938 by Coadjutor Archbishop of Sydney, Norman Gilroy. It was named after Dublin dockworker and reformed alcoholic, Matt Talbot. By 1944 the hostel was providing 1,600 free meals a week. The hostel was first located at the St. John's Church building on Kent Street. It transferred from its original Kent Street location to Ozanam House in Young Street in December 1952.  Mission  The hostel helps men over the age of 21 who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The employees are trained in several disciplines. In time of crisis they offer to help and support the affected people. The guests receive meals (the hostel serves around 620 hot meals each day), access to sanitary facilities, clothing, and basic medical. Furthermore, the hostel offers a case management, legal and housing support, as well as advocacy and special care for people with sleeping rough and trauma. Each year more than 35,000 men profit from the offer. Complementarily, the Ozanam Learning Centre offers diverse programs for men and women over 18 during the day.  The Hostel  Altogether, the hostel holds 98 beds. It also has room and space for further occupations. The hostel has an art space for creatively gifted persons and a gym to convey community- building values. In the computer room, useful skills are taught to facilitate re-entry into society. In the barbershop, people are helped to restore their appearance. The kitchen is used as a place to learn more about cooking and nutrition.

Therefore, software like Octopussy plays an important role in maintaining an ISMS within ISO/IEC 27001-compliant environments. Octopussy has the ability to monitor any device that supports the syslog protocol, such as servers, routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, and its important applications and services. The main purpose of the software is to alert its administrators and users to different kinds of events, like system outages, attacks on systems or errors in applications. However, unlike Nagios or Icinga, Octopussy is not a state-checker and therefore problems cannot be resolved within the application. The software also makes no prescription whatsoever on which messages must be/must not be analyzed. As such, Octopussy can be seen as less powerful than other popular commercial software in the same category (event monitoring and log analysis). Octopussy is compatible with many Linux system distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, CentOS, RHEL and even meta-distributions as Gentoo or Arch Linux. Although Octopussy was originally designed to run on Linux, it could be ported to other Unix variants like FreeBSD with minimal effort. Octopussy has extensive report generating features and also various interfaces to other software, like e.g. NSCA (Nagios), Jabber/XMPP and Zabbix. With the help of software like Snare even Windows EventLogs can be processed. Octopussy is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.  Characteristics  Although Octopussy is free and open-source software it has a variety of characteristics also found in some professional enterprise applications like Splunk, SAWMILL or Kiwi Syslog. The dashboard page in Octopussy 0.9.4+ (2007-2014) = Octopussy features = At the time of writing, Octopussy comes with the following set of features: * Basic LDAP support (v1.0+) for Octopussy users and contacts with filter mechanism * Alert sending by email, IM (Jabber), NSCA (Nagios) and Zabbix * Map functionality to show the system infrastructure known to Octopussy * Exportable reports by email, FTP and SCP * Input & output plugins for manual and automatic reports * Report scheduling and automated report generation based on parameters * A log viewer to search for syslog messages received by Octopussy * An RRDtool to provide data graphing of syslog activity for enabled services * Comprehensive service definitions (Apache 2, BIND, BSD Kernel ...) * A wizard to easily create new services and/or message patterns for existing services * An option to enable or disable services and alerts for every system under surveillance * Online updates for services, tables and l18n (language support) * Multi-language support: English French German Italian Spanish Portuguese Russian * A web-interface for viewing current devices status, alerts, log messages, etc. * A themable interface and report documents * Manageability of Octopussy core services from the operating system shell * Flat-text formatted configuration files (integrates with many configuration editors) * An option to timely rotate and store received syslog messages in various locations * User management with the ability of granular permission configuration * Simple outline of styles and GUI components in ASP for easy modification = Supported services = Some of the (meta-)services supported by/known by Octopussy are: Apache 2, BIND, BSD Kernel, BSD PAM, BSD System, Cisco Routers (ASR), Cisco Switches, ClamAV, DenyAll Reverse Proxy, DRBD, F5 BigIP, Fortinet FW, HP-Tools, Ironport MailServer, Juniper Netscreen FW, Juniper Netscreen NSM, LDAP, Linux AppArmor, Linux Auditd, Linux IPTables, Linux Kernel, Linux PAM, Linux System, Monit, MySQL, Nagios, Neoteris/Juniper FW, NetApp NetCache, Postfix, PostgreSQL, Samba, Samhain, SNMPd, Squid, SSHd, Syslog-ng, TACACS, VMware ESX(i), Windows Snare Agent, Windows System, Xen ... The alert viewer page in Octopussy 0.9.4+ (2007-2014) = Processible events = Events receivable from services and thus processible by Octopussy include: * Failed and/or successful logins, especially of higher privileged users * Violation of access permissions or policies in applications and operating systems * Write and/or read access in critical environments, e.g. with AppArmor or SELinux * Established or terminated VPN tunnels in systems, like e.g. Juniper Netscreen * Objects like processes or files which security context or configuration changed * Started or stopped processes on an operating system level * Critical system states like (unrecoverable) hardware or software failure * Change in operating system state due to boot, reboot or shutdown * Information regarding network connections/traffic, including ICMP messages, etc. * Detection or otherwise handling of malware (i.e. worms, viruses, trojans)  Dependencies  The software requires RSYSLOG installed on the syslog-server and expects systems that are monitored to run one of the numerous available syslog services, like e.g. syslogd/klogd, RSYSLOG or syslog-ng. The software further depends on the Apache 2 HTTP Server installed, with Apache::ASP, Mod_Perl and Mod_SSL. Octopussy also requires a MySQL DBMS (actual database is installed/copied during Octopussy setup) as well as a recent Perl interpreter installed on the operating system, with a variety of Perl modules from CPAN (e.g. Crypt::PasswdMD5, DBD::mysql, JSON, Unix::Syslog, XML::Simple). A comprehensive list of those modules can be found within the software packages/archives README.txt file. In addition to that NSCD and RRDtool are a requirement. RRDtool aids in the creation of graphs that will be displayed on the Octopussy dashboard or shown on a per-device/per-service level.  Architecture  Architecture of Octopussy 1.0.14 (2014) Octopussy receives syslog messages via syslog protocol and therefore behaves passively, not running any type of network agent on the remote machines under monitoring/surveillance. Octopussy completely conforms to RfC 3164 and RfC 3195 of the IETF, describing syslog as the logging mechanism in Unix-like/BSD operating systems. That especially includes the internal representation of the facility and severity-principle where applicable. The software is driven by a semi-stateful event correlation engine. This means that the engine records and thus knows its internal state, but only uses it to some extent to link together logically related elements for the same device, in order to draw a conclusion (i.e. to generate an alert). In Octopussy the semi-stateful correlation engine, with its so called sliding window (a shifting window being the logical boundary of a number of events during a certain period of time), is capable of comparing known past events with present ones based on a limited number of comparative values. = Octopussy Dispatcher = The Octo-Dispatcher is the component used by the Octopussy software to receive syslog lines from RSYSLOG and dispatch them into device directories. Every device registered and activated within Octopussy gets its syslog messages assigned to it depending on the device name. Noteworthy is also the adjacent Octo-Replay component, which is the program used by the Octopussy software to replay log messages for some device or service (it receives and processes recognized logs and puts them back into the incoming directory). = Octopussy Parser = The Octo- Parser and Octo-Uparser are two of Octopussy's most important core components. The Octo-Parser is the program used by the Octopussy software to parse logs in syslog format for each device registered within Octopussy. It basically uses a regex-engine and commences pattern matching on incoming syslog messages. The Octo-Uparser is restarted every time device's services are changed, to check if previously received \\"unknown\\" log messages can be associated with a service. In some cases Octo-Pusher is also called in advance to process non- syslog messages incoming from some devices. In that regard, the device setting \\"asynchronous\\" is helpful to process such log messages, after they were sent to an Octopussy server using e.g. FTP, rsync or SSH/SCP. An RRD graph page in Octopussy 0.9.4+ (2007-2014) = Octopussy Interface = The Octopussy interface (GUI) is the default user-interface and provides configuration management, device and service management as well as alert definition and therefore extends the Octopussy core components. Devices are displayed in tabular form on the Devices page, with the following descriptors as a minimum: hostname, IP address, log type, device model/type, FQDN and OS. Hence, the interface (Octo-Web) mainly provides access to other Octopussy core components like Octo-Commander, Octo-Message-Finder, Octo-Reporter and Octo-Statistic- Reporter. The Octopussy front-end/GUI is written in Perl 5, employing Apache::ASP to structure and display content. In addition to that, Octopussy core services can also be accessed from the operating system shell. That represents a convenient way for administrators to start/stop services or make fundamental configuration changes. = Octopussy RRD = The Octopussy RRD graph generator is a core component of the software and installed by default. Since the generation of such graphs is very resource intensive administrators may opt to disable it on an Octopussy syslog server with a less powerful CPU and a low amount of RAM. The generated RRD graphs displays the activity of all active services for monitored devices, highly depending on the specific service. After a restart of the Octopussy software or during operation, Octo- Dispatcher and Octo-Parser will always process syslog messages in their buffer and queue first and RRD graph generation is delayed. Octo-RRD further depends on Octo-Scheduler, to execute the Octopussy::Report function in order to generate syslog activity RRD graphs, that have been scheduled previously. Finally Octo-Sender has the capability to send report data to arbitrary recipients.  Extensions  There is a plug-in/module system in Octopussy, which is mainly geared towards the modification of Octopussy reports. Such a plug-in consists out of a description file, which defines the plug-in name and functions, and a code file with perl code to process the actual data. There are also extensions for software related to Octopussy, like e.g. a Nagios plug-in that checks the Octopussy core services (i.e. Octo-Dispatcher, Octo- Scheduler, etc.) as well as the Octopussy parser states and log partitions.  Services & Patterns  The creation of new services and service patterns presents the most important way to extend Octopussy without making changes to the source code. However, since patterns are outlined as simplified regular expressions, administrators should have at least some basic knowledge about regex in general. It is further strongly recommended to build on already existing services and also understand the meaning of a message objects' basic fields, which are message ID, pattern, log level, taxonomy, table and rank.

Museum was established on 6 August 1992 as the result of converting the Museum Collection Department of the Archives of the University of Wroc≈Çaw into an independent unit within the central administration. The Museum's Department ‚ÄúHouse of Archeologists‚Äù on campus at Koszarowa 3 (building no. 8), where temporary archeological exhibitions are presented, was established on 13 May 2005. The Museum is located in Wroc≈Çaw on the Odra riverbank, in the University's main building (Uniwersytecki Square 1) designed by :de:Christoph Tausch in Baroque style. Its architectural structure with splendid sculptural decor and paintings is regarded as one of the most valuable Baroque monuments in Poland and Central and Eastern Europe. Mathematical Tower Structure The Museum consists of the following historical halls: ‚Ä¢ :pl:Aula Leopoldina, the biggest and most representative hall in the main building, is the only secular Baroque interior in Poland with full decor - illusionist wall paintings by Johann Christoph Handke of Olomouc, decor and sculptural elements by Franz Mangoldt of Moravia and Italian master :de:Ignatius Provisore - which has been so well preserved. ‚Ä¢ Oratorium Marianum, with Baroque interior and furnishings as rich as in Aula Leopoldina, originally served as a chapel between 1728 and 1741. Following the secularisation of the Jesuit Order and the establishment of the University in 1811, Oratorium was converted into a concert Musical Hall. ‚Ä¢ Mathematical Tower with a viewing terrace at 42 meters is the former Astronomical Observatory, designed in 1791 by a Jesuit and professor of the University, :de:Longinus Anton Jungnitz. It still houses the original first instrument ‚Äì the stone line on the floor marking the meridian. It is the only instrument of this kind in Poland. ‚Ä¢ and three exhibition rooms: Roman Longchamps de B√©rier Hall, Stefan Banach Hall, and Pillar Hall. The Museum has a historic profile, and its collections are largely devoted to the history of the University, from the 15th century to the present day. The oldest collections still have descriptive fiches of Leopoldina Academy, although the majority comes from later periods, after 1811.

This was due initially to Government-imposed restrictions on daytime broadcasting hours, and later, budgetary constrictions. The eventual relaxation of these rules meant that afternoon closedowns ceased permanently on the ITV network in October 1972. The BBC took a long time to abandon the practice, and did not commence a full daytime service until the autumn of 1986. A full night-time closedown sequence on British television might typically contain information about the following day's schedule, perhaps a weather forecast and/or a news update, possibly a Public Information Film and finally, a look at the station clock and the national anthem. BBC *On BBC One, the sequence was as follows - the following evening's schedule, the national weather forecast, a Public Information Film (Monday to Thursday nights only) and finally, the clock which led straight into a rendition of the National Anthem (God Save the Queen), played out over the ident. For many years, BBC One Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also signed off with a late news bulletin & local weather forecast read off-screen by the evening continuity announcer. Since 1997, The BBC News Channel has filled the early hours during closedown. *On BBC Two, a look at the following evening's schedule was followed by a closing announcement over the station clock and until the early 1980s a piece of music would often then be played. BBC2 never closed with the National Anthem and the clock just faded to black following the closing announcement, although picture montages accompanied by easy listening music were occasionally utilised. On nights in which Open University programmes were the last programmes on that night, the OU ident was played at closedown, followed by the usual fade to black. This procedure was discontinued when The Learning Zone started airing OU programmes during the night. From October 1995 until the completion of digital switchover, some parts of the overnight dead air time were filled by Ceefax, the BBC's Teletext service. Since October 2012, a loop showcasing brief snippets of current and forthcoming BBC Two programmes are shown during closedown. *Prior to the shutdown of BBC Three's television channel in 2016, the CBBC Channel would go off air at 7 pm each night, as it shared its signal and bandwidth with BBC Three, which commenced programming each evening at the same time. During the closedown sequence, the host on air would say goodnight to the audience, then a brief piece of footage would play until exactly 7:00 pm, when the handover took place. The signal would be handed back to CBBC each morning at around 5 am when BBC Three had its own closedown; to fill the remaining two and a half hours until morning programming commenced, the channel would then air a compilation on repeat, This is CBBC. CBeebies, which shares its signal with BBC Four, carries out a similar process of signing off and handing over each evening at 7 pm. * In the UK, BBC Radio 4 does \\"close down\\" in a sense, at just before 1am with a rendition of the National Anthem (God Save the Queen). While they do not produce any original programming during their \\"off-air\\" hours, audio programming from the BBC World Service is provided. Apart from BBC Radio London, all of the BBC's local and national stations have an off-hours overnight simulcast and, apart from BBC Radio Wales, which carries the BBC World Service, all the locals stations broadcast BBC Radio 5 Live. ITV *Grampian, Scottish, UTV, Tyne Tees, ATV, HTV, Anglia, LWT, Channel, Southern and its successor TVS and Westward and its successor TSW, closed transmission with God Save the Queen - mainly over scenes of the Royal Family. HTV Wales also played Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau in addition to GSTQ. ATV chose to utilize a version of the national anthem, played on a church organ over the station clock whereas other stations chose to utilise regular band arrangements. Granada, Central, Thames, Border and Yorkshire never closed with the national anthem. * Granada and Central played out with special arrangements of their station themes. TSW also used their station theme That's Soul, Write as part of their closing sequence. Thames played either easy listening, popular or instrumental library music over a programme menu and the clock. Scottish also used various pieces of library music for playout during a rundown of programmes for the next day. Border and Yorkshire chose to simply fade out following the closedown announcement accompanied by the station clock. *Grampian, Ulster and Border also signed off with late regional news bulletins read by the duty announcer. For a time, a farming news bulletin, Farming Brief, ran as part of TVS's closing sequence. Most regions also signed off with a weather forecast whilst Westward and TSW also provided a Shipping Forecast. Westward & LWT also occasionally aired short bumpers of Loeki - a cartoon lion whose adventures had bookended the advert breaks on Dutch public television since the early 1970s - prior to switching off the main transmission stream. Some regions (namely Central, Grampian, Granada, LWT, Scottish, TSW, Tyne Tees and Yorkshire) also included a short announcement advertising Independent Local Radio stations in their respective areas as part of their closing sequences. * The ITV regions gradually switched to 24-hour television between 1986 and 1988, under a directive issued by the IBA. Yorkshire Television was first to go round the clock showing programmes from the satellite station Music Box. However, Music Box shut down at the start of 1987 and YTV went back to a nightly closedown although it did air a teletext information service called Jobfinder for an hour after sign-off. In August 1987, Thames/LWT and Anglia began through-the- night broadcasting (Thames had already extended broadcast hours to around 4am previously). The other major regions including Granada, Central, Yorkshire and TVS slowly followed suit during the first half of the 1988 although many had been broadcasting until around 3am for some time, especially at the weekend. By the start of September 1988 the last regions - Tyne Tees, Border, TSW and Grampian went 24 hours although Ulster didn't start round-the-clock broadcasting until 3 October '88. Some overnight programming slots, typically between around 4am and 5am, were filled with Jobfinder, which some regions adopted and others didn't, and, since 1998, ITV Nightscreen. The temporary suspension of ITV's overnight gaming shows in March 2007 forced ITV to return to scheduling Nightscreen in the early hours of the morning until 6am. * Two popular scenes were inspired by the early years of television; firstly, the phrase \\"Don't forget to switch off your television set\\", a warning typically spoken by the station announcer which took place over a blank screen, often after several seconds of the dead air, prior to the transmitter being switched off; and secondly the \\"little white dot\\", a phosphor trace which lingered on the screen as the power faded, diminishing in size until it became invisible. Channel 4 & S4C * Channel 4 closed down with the clock and a play-out of the exploding station ident before fading to black and after a minute or so the Channel 4 testcard appeared. Channel 4 was the only TV station to show the testcard at closedown as the BBC just radiated tone for ten minutes after closedown before the transmitters were switched off for the night. Channel 4 (which, at launch in 1982, was usually closed for around sixteen hours a day) began its 24-hour service on 6 January 1997, after a year of gradually expanding its overnight hours. * S4C, the Welsh-language channel, continues to sign off each night, although it does air English-language infomercials for 2 hours after closedown from Friday to Sunday nights (or every night when the National Assembly of Wales is in recess). From Tuesday to Thursday nights, the channel airs delayed full broadcasts of the day's plenary meetings and committee hearings from the National Assembly of Wales at the end of the day's regular programming.

He is part of a clan that heads a CJNG money laundering branch known as Los Cuinis. He was allegedly responsible for coordinating international money laundering schemes by using shell companies to purchase assets in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. His wife Wendy Dalaithy Amaral Ar√©valo was reportedly working with him on this large money laundering scheme when the couple moved from Mexico to Uruguay in 2011. The original documents of the investigation framing Gonz√°lez Valencia were leaked in 2015 through the Panama Papers, where it detailed real estate transactions and industrial sector investments tied to him. After a multi-year investigation by Latin American officials and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Gonz√°lez Valencia was arrested in Montevideo, Uruguay, in April 2016, and imprisoned for money laundering charges. He was wanted by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine. In May 2020, he was extradited to the U.S. Early life Gerardo Gonz√°lez Valencia was born in , but sources disagree on his exact place of birth. An Uruguayan newspaper stated he was born in the United States and holds a Mexican citizenship. A Mexican newspaper states he was born in Aguilillia, Michoac√°n, Mexico. His parents were J. Abigael Gonz√°lez Mendoza (father) and Estela Valencia Far√≠as (mother). He has several aliases, including Lalo, Silverio, Silver, Flaco, Eduardo, and Laline. According to the Mexican government, the Gonz√°lez Valencia clan was made up of 18 siblings. The males are Abigael, Jos√© Mar√≠a, Arnulfo, Ulises Jovani, Elvis, √âdgar Ed√©n, Mauricio, Gerardo, Jos√© and Luis √Ångel. The females are Rosalinda (also known as Rosal√≠a), Noem√≠, Berenice, Marisa Ivette, Mar√≠a Elena, √ârika and Abiga√≠l. People in their hometown in Michoac√°n nicknamed the clan \\"Cuinis\\" in reference to a squirrel (spermophilus adocetus) from the area that is known as \\"Cuinique\\". It is common for this squirrel to have over a dozen babies each time the mother gives birth. In the 1990s, Gonz√°lez Valencia was accused by a U.S. court of drug trafficking in California. His brother Abigael Gonz√°lez Valencia (alias \\"El Cuini\\") and his in-law Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), who spent few years in prison in the U.S., were also charged with drug trafficking in the U.S. in that decade. Since January 2003, Gonz√°lez Valencia was reportedly responsible for distributing and/or using intermediaries to knowingly distribute at least of cocaine and methamphetamine to the U.S. In the indictment, sworn by a grand jury on 5 May 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia stated that they would seize any drug proceeds that derived from this criminal conspiracy, or seek to forfeit assets equal to that total value. Criminal career =Time in Argentina= Gonz√°lez Valencia's envoys were detected in Argentina in 2009 when they moved to Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires. Argentinian officials also uncovered that they created an entity in Buenos Aires and opened a supermarket chain. The investigation started on 10 March 2009, when three Mexican nationals posing as tourists were driving a Chevrolet Astra and got involved in a car accident with another driver in Puerto Madero. The Mexicans were living in , an upscale complex in the city. The Argentine Naval Prefecture got involved in the incident, but the three Mexicans threatened the officers and told them that in Mexico they would be dead for getting involved with them. The officers took note of the license plates of the vehicle before the Mexican nationals left. Upon further investigation, they discovered that the Chevrolet Astra was owned by an Argentinian strawperson from Ituzaing√≥, Buenos Aires, and that the jurisdiction thus fell to officials in Mor√≥n, Buenos Aires. Officials in Mor√≥n began investigating the Mexican nationals and discovered that there was a suspicious entity, C√≠rculo Internacional S.A., that served as a bar and caf√© store. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) provided evidence to the investigators that the Mexican nationals were likely linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, but the Mor√≥n officials were not able to continue the investigation successfully. On 9 September 2009, the three Mexicans inaugurated a convenience chain store, Corner, in Puerto Madero. The project included plans to open 15 stores with a US$2.5 million investment. They also bought a large storage facility and two other stores in Congreso and Microcentro that did not open. In mid-2010, however, the three individuals fled Argentina after the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified that one of C√≠rculo Internacional S.A.'s sister companies, C√≠rculo Comercial Total de Productos S.A., had invested millions of dollars to the Argentinian entity from Mexico with drug proceeds from Los Cuinis. Investigators later discovered that the three men worked with Gonz√°lez Valencia. He arrived in Argentina the following year and managed C√≠rculo Internacional S.A. He lived at Hotel Faena and sent his three children to a private school in the northern part of the city, and investigators discovered that he paid 6 months of tuition in advance in cash. C√≠rculo Internacional S.A. received about US$1.8 million sums as paid-in capital and deposited them at Banco de la Naci√≥n Argentina. Investigators believe that the money originally came from Los Cuinis. Argentinian authorities investigated if Los Cuinis had bought assets in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre R√≠os, Salta, and Corrientes. =Relocation in Uruguay= Gonz√°lez Valencia and his family arrived to Uruguay in late 2011. They relocated because they wanted to live in a country where people would not recognize them. According to one of Gonz√°lez Valencia's sons, his family left Mexico after they were threatened to death by a group of masked gunmen who entered their house to allegedly kill them. In Mexico, Gonz√°lez Valencia reportedly owned a restaurant ran by Federico Tobares, an Argentinian chef who years later disappeared. Mexican investigators suspected that Gonz√°lez Valencia was behind his disappearance. In Uruguay, the family bought a mansion known as \\"Quincho Grande\\" in an upscale neighborhood in the resort city Punta del Este, Maldonado. The house was and was bought at US$2 million. The mansion had two houses, a pool, garage, laundry room, and a tennis and football field. A few months later, he bought several expensive cars, including two Audis and a Land Rover, and land lots in Punta Ballena and in other parts of Uruguay. Gonz√°lez Valencia told residents at Punta del Este that he was from Mexico and that hunting was his profession. He enrolled his students at a private school there and tried to live a seemingly ordinary lifestyle like other wealthy residents from the area. He did not hide his luxurious lifestyle and was seen by residents driving expensive vehicles. To launder his money, Gonz√°lez Valencia worked through the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which created two shell companies on his behalf: Montella Global S.A. and Deltodo Enterprises. These two companies purchased assets in Uruguay by working through Asesores y Consultores del Sur Ltda. (Asconsur), consulting company in Montevideo that worked as their intermediary. Their main point of contact in Asconsur was Gianella Guarino Anfossi. Montella Global S.A. bought several real estate properties and made investments in this sector. Deltodo Enterprises bought industrial properties in Russia and China. Deltodo also intended to sell craft tequila in Mexico, though this project failed. This information was released through the Panama Papers, a massive document leak that detailed information of offshore entities, on 15 April 2015. Both Gonz√°lez Valencia and his wife Wendy Dalaithy Amaral Ar√©valo were mentioned in the Panama Papers as having ties to both entities. Gonz√°lez Valencia and Amaral Ar√©valo were first mentioned in a document on 17 January 2012, when Ver√≥nica Corbo from Asconsur reached out to Mossack Fonseca asking them for a list of companies to purchase and the costs of transactions. The law firm responded the same day with a list of ten potential companies, including Montella Global S.A. On 26 January, Guarino pressured Mossack Fonseca to legalize purchases in Punta del Este because their client was looking to buy assets there and the Uruguayan government would require such approvals. After the process delayed, Asconsur reached out again on 6 February for an update. The purchases were finally approved the following day. Gonz√°lez Valencia received a passport that approved his relationship with both entities. In September 2012, Guarino asked Mossack Fonseca to sign a petition to provide legal assistant to Gonz√°lez Valencia if he ever needed it. A month later, she asked the law firm if they could extend the legal protection to Panama so that Gonz√°lez Valencia could purchase assets there. Mossack Fonseca stated that Gonz√°lez Valencia was able to do that using Montella Global S.A. On 15 June, Guarino reached out to Mossack Fonseca again and asked them for a list of active companies under the law firm. In October, Asconsur communicated with Mossack Fonseca that Gonz√°lez Valencia wanted to transfer the shares of his entities to H√©ctor Amaral Padilla, his father-in-law, of Mexican citizenship. In December, the couple decided to see if they could purchase assets in Panama using their Uruguayan entities. Mossack Fonseca responded to them on 3 January 2013, with a list of seven Panamanian firms: Seaside Company, Clarisse Company, Amanecer Enterprises, Deltodo Enterprises, Delirio Business, Vani Business, and Tarima Holding. On 10 September, Valeria Martino from Asconsur confirmed that they would proceed to purchase Deltodo Enterprises and put Gonz√°lez Valencia and Amaral Ar√©valo as the owners. On 13 September, Guarino sent Mossack Fonseca a document confirming that she had done her due diligence in the know your customer process. In August 2015, a legal document showed that his father-in-law shared the same address as Gonz√°lez Valencia in Punta del Este. In November, Asconsur filed a final request to transfer the assets owned by Montella Global S.A. in Uruguay to Gonzalez Valencia's father-in-law (he was the legal owner of this entity). Mossack Fonseca responded to Asconsur that since Amaral Padilla was the owner of Montella Global S.A., the changes would take place. Investigation tightens On 19 August 2015, the day the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned several members of Los Cuinis, including Gonz√°lez Valencia's wife, Uruguayan officials started a covert investigation against the couple. They discovered that Amaral Ar√©valo had a domestic bank account through HSBC and had firms in both Uruguay and Panama. She was the legal owner of a Panamanian company known as Montella Global S.A. She also served as an attorney of another company, Tossa del Mar S.A., and as director for Dalaithy S.A. Several Uruguayan assets were bought on behalf of these entities. The Department of the Treasury also discovered she managed Hotelito Desconocido in Tomatl√°n, Jalisco; W&G; Arquitectos in Tepatitl√°n, Jalisco; and HD Collection S.A. de C.V. in the State of Mexico. All were considered laundering fronts for Los Cuinis. Over the course of 2015, investigators gathered evidences against the two through electronic surveillance, videos, uncover agents, and eyewitnesses. They later discovered that Gonz√°lez Valencia and his family had lived in Buenos Aires years back but had visited Uruguay sporadically until they moved there permanently in 2011. His last immigration record was in 2014, when Gonz√°lez Valencia was detected leaving to Brazil with his family through Acegu√°, Cerro Largo. Besides Gonz√°lez Valencia, his wife and three children, investigators learned that the family brought their Mexican nannies and maternal grandparents to Uruguay for several months. Investigators discovered that Gonz√°lez Valencia did not have a formal job or domestic bank accounts. The money he received came directly from Mexico in cash since there were no recorded transactions between international banks that tracked down his name. Uruguayan officials believed that the nature of these activities were signs of the funds probably originating from drug trafficking proceeds from Los Cuinis and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). In March 2016, Uruguayan officials learned that the U.S. government had issued an international arrest warrant with intent for extradition against Gonz√°lez Valencia for allegedly importing cocaine and methamphetamine to the U.S. As the investigation grew in Uruguay, officials discovered that Gonz√°lez Valencia was reportedly laundering millions of dollars through a businessman in Piri√°polis, Maldonado. This contact met the couple frequently at their residence and in other social gatherings, and offered Gonz√°lez Valencia several properties for him to buy in Punta Ballena. He was also suspected of helping Gonz√°lez Valencia sell and buy foreign and national currency. These transactions were made in an exchange house in Piri√°polis (close to Pan de Az√∫car, Maldonado), where investigators saw Gonz√°lez Valencia and his wife on several occasions. The Piri√°polis contact was also recorded making a delivery of US$20,000 to Gonz√°lez Valencia's father-in-law at the exchange house. According to the telephone recordings, Gonz√°lez Valencia and his close associates referred to Punta del Este as \\"Tumba\\" and Montevideo as \\"Big Tumba\\" or \\"Big City\\". In Montevideo, investigators discovered that Gonz√°lez Valencia met with the Piri√°polis contact on several occasions. Amaral Ar√©valo left to the Mexican city of Guadalajara, Jalisco, in early 2016, but planned to return to Uruguay after two months. When his wife was gone, Gonz√°lez Valencia made frequent visits to Montevideo to see his children, who were enrolled at Scuola Italiana, a private school in the capital in Carrasco, Montevideo, for the calendar year. To avoid the long drives from Punta del Este, he decided to move to the city and be closer to his children. He stayed at a hotel while he looked for a home to buy. The investigation reached its final phases when the police discovered that Gonz√°lez Valencia was planning to leave the country with a forged identity. The publication of the Panama Papers just a few days before also accelerated the urgency of law enforcement to prevent Gonz√°lez Valencia from fleeing. They then carried out an operation to apprehend him and his close associates in Montevideo. Arrest On 21 April 2016, Gonz√°lez Valencia abandoned his room at a hotel in Punta Carretas, Montevideo, to pick- up his children at their private school. When he left the hotel, the police started to follow his tracks, but the traffic impeded them from making a move to try and apprehend him. Gonz√°lez Valencia had packed his children's school material and as well as valuable family possessions. Investigators believe that Gonz√°lez Valencia was planning on leaving the country and take his family to Brazil since he had been there before on several occasions. The reason why he did not flee from Uruguay immediately was because his wife was in Mexico, and he was waiting for her to arrive before departing. At around 6 pm, the officers of the National Police of Uruguay and the Department for the Suppression of Illegal Drug Trafficking arrested Gonz√°lez Valencia, his father-in-law, and nine other suspects. Gonz√°lez Valencia tried to escape but was quickly apprehended. When he was about to get arrested, he destroyed his iPhone by throwing it on the ground. He was not armed at the moment of his arrest. On 23 April, Amaral Ar√©valo was arrested by anti-narcotics agents at the Carrasco International Airport after returning from Mexico. She said she had returned to Uruguay to pick up her three children and take them to Guadalajara, Mexico. The children were taken to the by the police, and were later put in custody of their aunt who came to Uruguay from Mexico with Amaral Ar√©valo. The children later went back to Mexico. On 25 April, Uruguayan officials broke into Gonz√°lez Valencia's mansion. At the scene, authorities confiscated 45 cellphones (one was a satellite phone), 7 tablet computers, 9 laptops and weapons. The police seized several possessions inside the property, including furniture and jewelry. The police discovered that there was a fake wall adorned with drawings of Gonz√°lez Valencia's children hung on it. Behind the wall was an empty safe box. In one of the computers, the police retrieved photos of his family during a hunting trip in Africa. Imprisonment A few days after their arrests, Gonz√°lez Valencia was charged for money laundering in a court along with his wife and five other suspects. Investigators alleged that Gonz√°lez Valencia successfully laundered over US$10 million in Uruguay. They concluded that this money laundering scheme was the biggest one in the history of Uruguay. Mexican sources described him as the second-in-command in Los Cuinis, just below his brother Abigael (alias \\"El Cuini\\"), who was arrested on 28 February 2015, in Mexico. His wife Amaral Ar√©valo was described as a key suspect in the case for reportedly heading several of the laundering businesses for Los Cuinis. On 29 April 2016, he was transferred to a newly built facilities in Comcar, a maximum-security prison in Montevideo. He was in an individual cell and only had one hour of recreation time in the prison's patio, but that hour was reserved only for him because the prison authorities did not want for him to socialize with the other inmates. He was allowed to read books and have a notebook. Gonz√°lez was sent to prison along with his father-in-law, two gardeners from Punta del Este who facilitated his money laundering schemes, and his contact from Piri√°polis. In June 2016, prison authorities carried out an investigation inside the cells and discovered that Gonz√°lez Valencia was in possession of an undisclosed amount of white powder, adobe, and salt. When questioned where he got these ingredients, he stated that they were already in his cell when he got there. Federal authorities investigated the prison guards because they believed that if Gonz√°lez Valencia was able to smuggle these items, then that meant that there was a chance that he could smuggle a satellite cellphone to communicate with members of Los Cuinis. They also worried about the possibility of prison guards forming relationships with the inmates, especially when money is involved. Gonz√°lez Valencia told the press that he was tortured in below freezing temperatures by several prison guards when he was asked to give his legal declaration. He then issued a verbal death threat against Ministry of Interior Eduardo Bonomi, and told him that he would hang him from a bridge if the prison guards continue to torture him. That same month, Mexican officials arrived in Montevideo to talk to their Uruguayan counterparts on the case, particularly on the role of Los Cuinis and Gonz√°lez Valencia in Uruguay. In July, a federal judge ordered Amaral Ar√©valo's released from prison. In September, Gonz√°lez Valencia was transferred to a police jail along with his father-in-law. This decision was made after authorities considered that he might escape from prison or that someone might potentially hurt him. While in prison at Comcar, he developed ties with the prison gangs. Investigators saw that he developed a partnership with inmate Luis Alberto \\"Betito\\" Su√°rez, once Uruguay's most-wanted criminal, and that he was distributing money with other prisoners to gain protection or buy out his escape. That same month, Amaral Ar√©valo got approved by a federal court to see her children in Mexico. She paid a US$25,000 fine and was given a 6-month travel permit to come in and out of Uruguay. Her defense stated that she would not flee indefinitely because her children are in Mexico and her husband and father are imprisoned in Uruguay. On 27 June 2018, Uruguayan officials requested a judge to begin in trial in Uruguay for Gonz√°lez Valencia's criminal charges. They asked the judge to consider giving him four years in prison for money laundering charges. In addition, they said that his wife and father-in-law should receive two years, though these two individuals were not in custody at the time this verbal request was made. On 11 March, 2020, the Gonz√°lez Valencia defense issued a habeas corpus and argued that their client was suffering from \\"inhumane\\" treatment in prison. In the complaint, Gonz√°lez Valencia detailed that he was not allowed to have visitors and that prison guards did not let him sleep. He also argued that his cell had video camera surveillance 24/7 and that he was not fed properly. Gonz√°lez Valencia suffered from celiac disease, making him unable to eat gluten, and complained that the prison food did not meet his medical needs. The treatments were \\"illegitimate and similar to torture\\", he argued. Judge Adriana Chamsari√°n rejected the habeas corpus of Gonz√°lez Valencia. The judge considered that there was no evidence that there were \\"conditions of confinement that violated human dignity\\", as Gonz√°lez Valencia had alleged in the habeas corpus. Uruguay's Organized Crime prosecutor, Luis Pacheco, asked Chamsari√°n to dismiss Gonzalez Valencia's proposal, although he recommended that the Ministry of the Interior follow a clear visitation regime. It asked the prison to allow Gonz√°lez Valencia's family members to bring him food - something that was previously denied - and that Gonz√°lez Valencia not be recorded when attending medical examination. During the habeas corpus process, the Ministry of the Interior asked the judge not to transfer the inmate to court hearings since authorities feared he could escape. For this reason, a videoconference hearing was held. In Gonz√°lez Valencia's second hearing, the prosecutor and the judge went to jail to visit him. On April 8, 2020, Gonz√°lez Valencia was transferred to the Libertad penitentiary. Uruguayan officials stated that they were preparing for his U.S. extradition and that they did this because it was a \\"penitentiary policy\\". The transfer was approved by the Ministry of Interior. Extradition process On 16 June 2016, the U.S. government issued an extradition request against Gonz√°lez Valencia. The request was sent to the Embassy of the United States in Montevideo and then to the Ministry of Foreign Relations. From there it was transferred to the Supreme Court of Uruguay, where it reached a federal judge's hands. In the request, it stated that Gonz√°lez Valencia was wanted for murder and drug trafficking charges in California since the 1990s. Uruguayan officials stated that keeping Gonz√°lez Valencia in jail posed a risk because their prestige was in line. Authorities worried that having him in prison increased chances of propelling Los Cuinis to orchestrate his escape. In his extradition hearing, Gonz√°lez Valencia stated that he favored the possibility of being extradited to the U.S. for his charges because he would be closer to his family in Mexico. On 22 February 2017, the U.S. government formalized the petition to have him extradited. On 14 March, Uruguayan authorities stated they were analyzing Gonz√°lez Valencia's legal status for his possible extradition to the U.S. The prosecution stated that they would reach out to Gonz√°lez Valencia's defense and asked if he wanted an immediate extradition. If Gonz√°lez Valencia denied the extradition request, Uruguayan authorities would have to analyze if the U.S. request fulfills the country's legal requirements for extradition and have Gonz√°lez Valencia face trial in Uruguay first before sending him to the U.S. Money laundering in Uruguay is penalized with up to 15 years in prison. If the Uruguayan government chooses this route, he would then be extradited to the U.S. after the conclusion of his sentence for his pending drug trafficking charges. On 2 May 2017, the extradition hearing date was pushed after Gonz√°lez Valencia's defense requested more time to review the case. Argentine officials also asked the Uruguayan government to seize his all assets in Uruguay. They also filed a petition to have Gonz√°lez Valencia and his collaborators investigated in Argentina for money laundering since several of the assets they purchased in Uruguay came from Argentine proceeds. Gonz√°lez Valencia told his defense that he was unsure if he wanted to be extradited to the U.S. (he had previously mentioned that he wanted to go to the U.S. to be closer to his family). On 31 May 2017, Gonz√°lez Valencia's lawyers presented two reasons why their client should not be extradited to the U.S. In their first rationale, they stated that the statute of limitations for his crimes in the U.S. had passed since they claimed it only lasted 5 years. They also stated that Gonz√°lez Valencia should not be extradited to the U.S. because he could face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Uruguayan law prohibits extraditions in cases where the person extradited may face harsher sentences than they would for the crime they committed in Uruguay. = Approval process = On 22 June 2017, Uruguayan officials from the accepted to have Gonz√°lez Valencia extradited to the U.S. after facing trial in Uruguay. The judge, however, stated that in order to have him extradited, the U.S. government had to guarantee that Gonz√°lez Valencia would not face death penalty, life imprisonment, or an equivalent punishment that is harsher than the ones under Uruguayan law. Gonz√°lez Valencia's legal team in the U.S. stated that the U.S. government was considering life imprisonment prior to the request from Uruguay. On 5 September 2017, the Uruguayan government agreed to accept the U.S.'s extradition request Gonz√°lez Valencia without facing trial in Uruguay. As soon as the decision was finalized, his defense was given 10 days to appeal the decision. They told the press they would appeal it. If the extradition request remains firm, the U.S. government would need 40 days to accept the conditions established by the Uruguayan government. Among them was to accept the condition that Gonz√°lez Valencia would be released from prison temporarily or be granted indefinite liberty in Uruguay so he can reach the U.S. Gonz√°lez Valencia's defense said they would appeal the extradition request, and clarified that the charges against him in the U.S. where based out of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. They commented he was not wanted for murder, as previously stated, and that Gonz√°lez Valencia would agree to the extradition if his defense reached an agreement with U.S. officials. On 14 March 2018, Uruguayan authorities questioned Gonz√°lez Valencia for a fake passport he owned under an assumed alias, after he declared he had one in his possession. His defense stated he used the passport to disguise himself and not be linked to his family. They clarified that Gonz√°lez Valencia was not involved to organized crime like several of his siblings, and that he left to Uruguay to be far away from them. They also stated that Gonz√°lez Valencia did not use that passport in Uruguay, for which he should not be charged for it there. On 2 October 2018, an appeals court of the Judiciary of Uruguay confirmed Gonz√°lez Valencia's extradition to the U.S. On 16 October, the United States Department of State, Justice, and Treasury announced a joint law enforcement measure against the CJNG, and publicized previously sealed indictments charging Gonz√°lez Valencia for his organized crime involvement. The appeals court notified Gonz√°lez Valencia of their decision on 26 October, and stated that his defense had until 8 November to repeal the result at the Supreme Court of Uruguay. The defense's case was headed by two lawyers from Maldonado, Gabriela G√≥mez and Ana Audiffred; Gonz√°lez Valencia's previous lawyer V√≠ctor della Valle stepped down. On 19 November 2018, Gonz√°lez Valencia's defense issued their last extradition appeal at the Supreme Court of Uruguay. They explained that the U.S. government based the extradition request on a 1973 treaty between the U.S. and Uruguay, which stated that criminals were extraditable if they were on trial or convicted in the U.S. They claimed this did not apply to Gonz√°lez Valencia's legal situation, and that the U.S. government should have used a 1991 agreement instead, which permits extradition for criminals being investigated. In addition, the defense stated that the 2007 crimes he was accused of in the U.S. have reached their statute of limitations since 2013. On 13 February 2020, Supreme Court of Justice confirmed the extradition to the U.S. (under certain conditions) of Gonz√°lez Valencia. The first condition stated that he would not be extradited until he fulfills his sentence and is released from Uruguayan custody. The second condition was that he should not be tried for crimes other than those referred to in the extradition request, except for two paragraphs of the extradition treaty between both countries. The third and final condition was that Gonz√°lez Valencia should not be sentenced to death or life imprisonment if found guilty. On 16 April 2020, the U.S. government agreed that Gonz√°lez Valencia would not face double jeopardy and that he would not be sentenced to death. However, they said they would not agree to the life imprisonment clause because it was a stipulated requirement in their extradition treaty. Since Gonz√°lez Valencia already fulfilled his money laundering sentence in Uruguay, there was a possibility of him being released if a deal between both countries was not made. On 29 April, however, the Uruguayan government confirmed that Gonz√°lez Valencia was extradition- ready. = Transfer to U.S. = On 14 May 2020, Gonz√°lez Valencia was transferred from prison to the Carrasco International Airport and was flown to the U.S. under heavy security.

After its announcement on March 21, 2017, conflicting naming conventions spawned a number of different names, including \\"seventh-generation iPad\\" or \\"iPad 2017\\". Unlike the iPad Air 2, this iPad does not have a fully laminated display, and also lacks an anti- reflective coating. The iPad received generally positive reviews. It was significantly praised for performance, with reviewers asserting that the model was noticeably faster than older iPad models, and also received positive reviews for its price and battery life. It was criticized, however, for lacking a laminated and anti-reflective screen, and lack of support for the Apple Pencil and attachable keyboards through the Smart Connector. Its introductory price in the United States was the lowest ever for an iPad, with the media noting that the lower price might be an effort to encourage wider adoption of the tablet in the education sector, as well as for businesses needing inexpensive tablets for undemanding uses. On March 27, 2018, Apple announced its successor, the sixth-generation iPad. This also marked the discontinuation of this iPad.  History  This iPad model was announced by Apple on March 21, 2017 in a press release. There has been confusion around its naming, being referred to as just \\"iPad\\" in marketing, but called the \\"fifth-generation iPad\\" in official statements and specifications sheets, a title previously taken by 2013's iPad Air. Other sources refer to it as the \\"seventh-generation iPad\\", when including the iPad Air and iPad Air 2 as the fifth- and sixth-generation iPads respectively. It has also been referred to as \\"iPad 2017\\". = Pricing strategies = Matt Kapko of CIO wrote that Apple's introductory pricing of $329 in the United States for the iPad, a $70 price reduction versus the iPad Air 2, appeared designed to fend off the encroachment of Google's Chromebook laptops in the education sector and to foster wider adoption in customer-facing terminals. Kapko also wrote that the device is designed to appeal to businesses that require inexpensive tablets for undemanding use, including as kiosks, checkout terminals, and hospitality screens.  Specifications  = Software = At the time of its original release, the iPad shipped with iOS 10, a version of Apple's mobile operating system. New units sold come with the new iOS 11 operating system instead. The included Touch ID fingerprint sensor allows the user to unlock the device as well as approve purchases from the App Store, iTunes Store, and iBooks Store. Touch ID and Apple Pay let the user purchase items from websites or from within apps. = Hardware = The iPad has a 9.7-inch (25cm) screen. Compared to the iPad Air 2, the processor is updated from the Apple A8X to the A9 with the embedded Apple M9 motion co-processor. The iPad has 2 gigabytes of RAM.1 gigabyte = 1 GiB = 10243 B. It is 7.5mm thick, which is the same thickness as the iPad Air, compared to 6.1mm of the iPad Air 2. Unlike other iPad models available, this iPad's display is not fully laminated and does not have anti- reflective coating. However, this iPad has a brighter screen than the iPad Air 2 (25% brighter according to Apple). It is available in 32 and 128 GB storage options1 GB = 10003 B. Contrasting with the iPad Pro lineup, this iPad features only two speakers (as opposed to four), has no Smart Connector support, and has no camera flash. It is offered in silver, gold, and space grey colors. Despite its use of the Apple A9 processor and accompanying M9 motion co-processor, introduced with the iPhone 6S in 2015, the iPad does not feature support for always-on \\"Hey Siri\\" voice input, a feature advertised as being made possible by low-power processing in the then-new chips. The use of \\"Hey Siri\\" is limited to when the iPad is connected to power. A product teardown by iFixit showed that the design of this iPad is nearly identical to the iPad Air except for a few differences: the lack of the physical mute switch, the microphone holes are smaller and there is only a single row of speaker holes.  Reception  Dieter Bohn of The Verge wrote that \\"it is a thin, fast tablet\\", and praised the screen for being \\"very good\\", despite not having \\"the fancy True Tone display that the iPad Pro does, nor does it have some of the things that made the screen on the iPad Air 2 so nice: lamination and anti-reflectivity\\". He criticized the lack of support for attachable keyboards and Apple Pencil, while praising the A9 processor as \\"significantly faster than older iPads\\", though noting that it isn't \\"necessarily significantly faster than the iPad Air 2\\", and \\"not as fast as the iPad Pro\\". He also disliked that the iPad only features two speakers, as opposed to four on the iPad Pro, while summarizing the overall review with \\"Fundamentally, what I am trying to tell you is that this is an iPad. You trust that iPads are decent tablets and that they have a basic level of quality, speed, and functionality\\" and \\"Get one if you need one, but don't stress that you're missing out if you don't.\\" Sascha Segan of PC Magazine wrote that \\"The Apple iPad is more affordable than ever\\" and noted that \\"While there's little reason for existing iPad owners to upgrade, the new iPad's price stabs a stake into the heart of many competing Android tablets\\". Although criticizing the non- laminated display for being \\"a little more washed out than its predecessor\\", he claimed that he \\"couldn't see a measurable difference\\" and that it's \\"a nominal degradation in quality that doesn't really matter in everyday use\\". Segan also praised performance compared to the prior iPad models, and also praised improved Wi-Fi performance, writing that it is \\"quite impressive\\" with \\"double the Wi-Fi speeds on the new iPad than I did on the Air 2\\". Jeff Benjamin of 9to5Mac wrote that \\"Sure, it lacks the gorgeous laminated, anti- reflective display of the iPad Air 2, and sure it's not as svelte in either thickness or weight. But there's no denying that the 2017 iPad with A9 dual core processor in tow, is a good value\\". He described the tablet as a \\"solid buy for upgraders and new users\\". Igor Bonifacic of MobileSyrup also praised the performance, as well as number of iPad apps available, but criticized the camera for being outdated and keyboard/Pencil incompatibility, with a summarization reading: \\"The 2017 iPad is not an exciting tablet. But then it's not supposed to be exciting, [...] Apple's latest tablet is an iterative update designed to appeal to a specific subset of consumers\\". Bonifacic also called the tablet \\"perfect for first-time tablet buyers\\". Chris Velazco of Engadget praised battery life, describing it as \\"one of the best iPads we've tested\\", but also criticized the lack of anti-reflection on the display, calling it \\"another cost-saving measure that I wish Apple had reconsidered\\".

The first team currently plays in the and during the 2019‚Äì20 season the reserve team play in North West Women's Regional Football League Division One South. They play their home games at the Jericho Lane Football Hub in Aigburth area of Liverpool. History The club were formed in 1991 and originated from the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education (now known as Liverpool Hope University) where they entered the North West Women's Regional Football League (NWWRFL). The name Feds originates from the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education College origins where the sports teams played as a Federation of the St Katherine‚Äôs and Christ Notre Dame Colleges. In 1993 a reserve team was added, who during the 2019‚Äì20 season are playing in the NWWRFL, and in 1994 a girls youth section was created. They play their football in the Liverpool County FA Girls Leagues. A Development Squad and an under-18s team followed shortly afterwards. The first team won promotion from the NWWRFL into the now-defunct Northern Combination Women's Football League in 2009 when they won the 2008‚Äì09 Premier Division title without losing a single game. They ended the campaign with a record of nineteen wins and three draws from twenty-two games played. They remained in the Northern Combination until 2014 when a major restructuring of the women's football pyramid saw the Combination leagues scrapped and the teams playing at that level moved into the new FA Women's Premier League (now known as the FA Women's National League) Division One, which was divided into four regional sections. In the summer of 2015 Liverpool Feds linked up with the men's club Marshalls F.C. and changed their name to Liverpool Marshall Feds. This alliance lasted for three years, but in 2018 the women's club opted to break away and the word Marshall was dropped from the name of the club, reverting back to their original name. Ground Liverpool Feds play their home games at the Jericho Lane Football Hub in Aigburth, having moved there from their previous home at the I M Marsh Campus of Liverpool John Moores University in 2018.

NEA and professional life Carr (center), with Commissioner of Education Steve McMurrin (left) and President Kennedy, 1962 In 1929, Carr moved to Washington D.C. to become the Assistant Research Director for the National Education Association. He was named Research Director for the group in 1931. In 1940 he was appointed to the role of Associate Secretary and Secretary of the Policies Commission for the NEA and the AUSA. In 1945, he attended the charter meetings for the United Nations and UNESCO as a teaching consultant for the official delegation of the United States. He served as the deputy to the chairperson and consultant on the committee responsible for writing the charter that created each organization. In 1946, he was named General Secretary of the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) and became a consultant for UNESCO. He later worked to help write an early draft of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. His view in the 1940s was that the United States needed to end its isolationist tendencies by teaching that the country \\"is now and forever bound up in the affairs of the world.\\" On January 26, 1952 the NEA announced that Carr would be its new Executive Secretary, effective August 1, 1952. During his tenure, he became an increasingly powerful voice on education policy and pushed for increased Federal aid and other benefits to education. He also advocated for \\"systematic education for home and family life,\\" in which he proposed that schools adopt a curriculum to turn out more efficient consumers. Carr was a member of the American-Korean Mission to aid in rebuilding the educational system of South Korea at the end of the Korean War in 1953. In 1962, he met with President John F. Kennedy and Commissioner of Education Sterling McMurrin to discuss education policy. In 1966, Carr oversaw the merger of the NEA with the American Teachers Association. During his time at the NEA he was awarded the many honorary degrees including: LL.D. degree, honoris causa, by Miami University in 1953; the L.H.D. degree honoris causa, by Columbia University in 1954 and by Boston University in 1957. Carr was against the use of strikes by the NEA. He warned that strikes would destroy the public's trust in teachers. After he retired in 1967 the NEA began giving its full backing to affiliates who went on strike. Retirement After retiring from the NEA, Carr became president of the Council on International Nontheatrical Events. The council is a clearinghouse for American-made nontheatrical films and videos for international film festivals. He stepped down from his role with the WCOTP in 1972. He was also a member of the U.S. Commission on the Bicentennial of the Constitution and a member of the Cosmos Club. In 1983, his wife Elizabeth died. He moved to Denver, Colorado in 1994. He died in hospice care there in 1996. He was survived by one son, Wilfred James Carr, and three grandsons.

A reboot of the original 1967 Doctor Dolittle film and its modern comedy counterparts, Dolittle is based on the titular character created by Hugh Lofting and is primarily inspired by the author's second Doctor Dolittle book, The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle (1922). Robert Downey Jr. stars as the title character, alongside Antonio Banderas and Michael Sheen in live-action roles, with Emma Thompson, Rami Malek, John Cena, Kumail Nanjiani, Octavia Spencer, Tom Holland, Craig Robinson, Ralph Fiennes, Selena Gomez, and Marion Cotillard voicing an array of creatures. The project was announced in March 2017 with Downey set to star, and the rest of the cast joined over the following year. Filming began in March 2018 and lasted through June, taking place around the United Kingdom. The film underwent three weeks of reshoots in the spring of 2019, under the supervision of Jonathan Liebesman and Chris McKay after initial test screenings yielded poor results. Universal Pictures theatrically released Dolittle in the United States on January 17, 2020. The film grossed $249 million worldwide and became the sixth highest-grossing film of 2020, but was a box-office bomb, losing Universal as much as $100 million. It also received generally negative reviews from critics, mainly due to the stale humor, pacing, and incoherent story. Plot In Victorian era Britain, Dr. John Dolittle is a Welsh veterinarian with the ability to communicate with animals. After his wife, Lily, dies at sea, Dolittle retreats from human society and only tends to animals. A boy, Tommy Stubbins, accidentally wounds Kevin the squirrel and is guided to Dolittle's help by Polynesia, a macaw. Queen Victoria summons Dolittle to cure her of a deadly sickness. He refuses until Poly persuades him that he must begin to reconnect with fellow humans. He finds the Queen has been poisoned by kind of nightshade added to her tea. The only cure is the magical fruit of Eden from the faraway land of Lily's birth. Poly, Betsy the giraffe, and Tutu the fox help Tommy escape from his home, and he joins Dolittle's crew including Kevin, monkeys Elliot and Elsie, Chee-Chee the gorilla, Yoshi the polar bear, Plimpton the ostrich, Dab-Dab the duck, and Mini the sugar glider. They put to sail for the cure while evading Dolittle's lifelong rival, Dr. Blair M√ºdfly. Dolittle leaves his lurcher Jip and a walking stick named Sticks behind to guard the Queen while he's traveling. Dolittle's boat is attacked by M√ºdfly and they escape by harnessing a whale who pulls the boat to safety. They continue to Lily's island where, attempting to steal Lily's directions to the fruit tree, Dolittle is apprehended by Lily's father King Rassouli and is locked in a cage with Barry, a moody tiger looking for his mother's approval. Just as Dolittle is to be killed, a newly-courageous Chee-Chee incapacitates Barry. Dolittle and Tommy escape but lose Lily's journal to M√ºdfly and have their ship destroyed. Rassouli loans Dolittle a boat to honour his daughter. Trailing M√ºdfly, Dolittle and company meet Ginko-Who-Soars, a dragon who guards the cure tree. Ginko attacks, causing M√ºdfly to fall down a hole, but soon collapses from internal pain. Dolittle diagnoses and cures the dragon who gratefully shows Dolittle the tree. Dolittle returns in time to heal the queen. Sticks reveals that Lord Thomas Badgley, one of the Queen's chairmen, poisoned her in order to take the crown for himself, and it was he who ordered M√ºdfly to foil Dolittle's quest. The Queen has him arrested for treason, and thanks Dolittle for saving her. Dolittle takes on Tommy as his apprentice and re-opens his sanctuary.

Production On March 20, 2017, it was announced that Robert Downey Jr. would star in The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle, a feature adaptation of Hugh Lofting's second published Dolittle book, The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle. In December 2017, Harry Collett and Jim Broadbent were also cast, in live action roles. In February 2018, Antonio Banderas and Michael Sheen were added to the live action cast, while Tom Holland, Emma Thompson, Ralph Fiennes, and Selena Gomez were cast to voice animals, including a tiger, bear, and a lioness. In March 2018, Kumail Nanjiani, Octavia Spencer, John Cena, Rami Malek, Craig Robinson, Marion Cotillard, Frances de la Tour and Carmen Ejogo all signed on for voice roles as well. The character of Regine, a lioness voiced by Ejogo, was cut from the finished film. Principal production commenced mid-February 2018. Live-action scenes began filming in Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria in May 2018, with further location filming at South Forest, Windsor Great Park and on the Menai Suspension Bridge in North West Wales, in June 2018. In April 2019, it was reported the film had undergone 21 days of re-shoots following poor test screenings. Director Jonathan Liebesman helped to oversee the filming alongside Gaghan, while Chris McKay wrote new material after it became clear from first cuts that the comedy elements of the film were not coming together as well as the producers had hoped. Prior to this, Universal had turned towards Seth Rogen and Neighbors co-writer Brendan O'Brien to help add comedy to the film. However, neither could remain committed to the project and dropped out. McKay was assigned to storyboard sequences and assemble different edits before later leaving to instead direct The Tomorrow War. Liebesman took over McKay's duties and finished the film alongside Gaghan. The Lego Batman Movie scribe John Whittington had also performed rewrites on the script amid reshoots, and flew to London to meet with Downey, who allegedly tore Whittington's script apart in favor of \\"new ideas.\\" The Hollywood Reporter stated that despite a \\"challenged production,\\" there were no fights for power and no competing cuts for the film. In August 2019, it was reported that the film's title had been changed from The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle to simply Dolittle. In January 2020, on Joe Rogan's podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, Downey Jr. discussed the inspiration for the Dr. Dolittle character in the film, which he said stemmed from a Welsh neo-pagan physician called William Price. He said, \\"Same way I did with Iron Man... before I signed on, I was just googling 'weirdest Welsh doctor,' I just wanted to think of, I don't want to just do another English accent.. so there was this guy called William Price, who's a nutty Welsh doctor, he was a neo- druidist, he believed that he could communicate with all nature and all that stuff, so I sent a picture of this wild looking guy wearing this kind of suit with stars on it and like a staff in his hand [to Gaghan]... and he goes, \\"That looks good to me\\" and I was like \\"great let's do this movie.\\"\\" Music artist Sia performed a new song of hers, \\"Original,\\" for the end credits, while Danny Elfman composed the film's score. Release The film was released by Universal Pictures. It was originally set for May 24, 2019, but was moved to April 12, 2019, to avoid competition with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which itself was later moved from May to December 20, 2019. The film was later moved again to January 17, 2020. =Home media= Dolittle was released on Digital HD on March 24, 2020, and on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on April 7, 2020. As of July 12, 2020, the film had made $14.3 million in home media sales. Reception =Box office= Dolittle grossed $77 million in the United States and Canada, and $173.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $250.9 million, against a production budget of $175 million. Due to its high production and marketing costs, the film needed to gross around $500 million worldwide in order to break even; following its debut weekend, it was estimated the film would lose Universal between $50‚Äì100 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $20‚Äì22 million from 4,155 theaters in its three-day opening weekend, and a total of around $27 million over the full four-day Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend. It made $6.3 million on its first day, including $925,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $22 million for three days, and $29.5 million over the four-day frame, finishing third, behind fellow newcomer Bad Boys for Life and holdover 1917. The film made $12.1 million in its second weekend and $7.7 million in its third, remaining in third both times. After months of delays, the film was released in China on July 24, and made $5.2 million from about 3,000 screens in its opening weekend. By August 6, the film had reached $14.6 million in grosses in the country. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 14% based on 223 reviews, with an average rating of 3.86/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Dolittle may be enough to entertain very young viewers, but they deserve better than this rote adaptation's jumbled story and stale humor.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 26 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported an average of 3 out of 5 stars from viewers they surveyed. Courtney Howard of Variety called the film a \\"frenetic, crass kids' flick\\" and wrote, \\"What should have been an awe-filled adventure quickly curdles into an awful one, thanks to a pedestrian formula and the filmmakers' fixation on fart jokes.\\" Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said, \\"From the very first scene, it's clear something is terribly off with this lavishly misbegotten attempt to repopularize an animal-loaded literary franchise that was born exactly a century ago. The oddly diffident star and executive producer Robert Downey Jr. never finds the power-supplying third rail needed to energize a tale that fails to make a real case for being reinterpreted.\\" British critic Mark Kermode gave the film a negative review, saying, \\"Terrible script. Terrible visuals. Dull plot. Dismal gags. The fact that at 101 minutes it really tested one's patience. It is shockingly poor.\\" He particularly criticized Robert Downey Jr.'s attempt at a Welsh accent, calling it \\"something from Mars.\\" In examining the film's ending, Douglas Laman of Screen Rant noted that the film as a whole suffered from numerous problems, including \\"...Dolittle's new backstory involving a deceased wife...the largely lifeless voice-over work of the animal characters [and] its painfully unfunny comedy.\\" In particular, the part in the film in which Dolittle pulls a bagpipe out of the Dragon's behind, inducing a long fart, was criticised as \\"gross\\" and \\"disgusting.\\" References External links  Category:2020 films Category:2020 fantasy films Category:2020s children's adventure films Category:2020s children's fantasy films Category:2020s fantasy adventure films Category:American films Category:Doctor Dolittle films Category:English-language films Category:Films about animals Category:Films directed by Stephen Gaghan Category:Films scored by Danny Elfman Category:Films set in 1819 Category:Films set in England Category:Films shot in England Category:Films shot at Shepperton Studios Category:Films shot in Wales Category:Films with screenplays by Stephen Gaghan Category:Motion capture in film Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Dentsu films ","title":"Dolittle (film)"},{"id":"53554759","text":"Giuseppe Altea (born 11 June 1997) is an Italian footballer who plays as a winger for Italian club Mariglianese.

He was raised by his grandparents, Dafydd and Hannah Dafis of Abergwili, Carmarthenshire. On completing his education at the local school, he entered employment as a farm labourer at a farm in Rhyd-y-Rhaw, Peniel. Whilst there he began to attend services at Peniel Congregational Church, and it was there, in 1903, that he began to preach. Following a period studying at the Old College School in Carmarthen, he moved, in 1905, to attend classes at Bala-Bangor College. He was ordained minister in September 1908 at Seion, Pontypridd, and from there moved to Addoldy, Glynneath, where he was inducted in January 1911. In 1915, during WW1, he relocated again to become minister of Gellimanwydd (Christian Temple), Ammanford, where he would remain for the next 50 years. During the severe Post WWI economic depression and the Great Slump that began in 1929, poverty and unemployment in Ammenford was so extreme that childhood malnutrition and lack of clothing except for remnant coal sacks became commonplace; Davies became chairman of the local 'Distress Committee' and was able to \\"twin\\" the town with a parish in Merseyside, Liverpool, that provided sufficient funds to prevent actual starvation. An unusually high proportion of young people from Ammanford went on to academic research careers, a fact that several of them later credited to Davies' influence. He was much travelled, venturing around much of Europe on cargo ships from Swansea, and to the United States on a preaching tour. He was in the United States in July 1924.Dr. and Mrs. R. J.

History During the second half of the 19th century, the Nadars purchased most of the lands from Manadu Vellalar landlords. Thus the region is being called by Vellalanvilai. Agriculture is the major source of livelihood for the people. The first Vellalanvilai Nadars became Christians in the early 1840s. People in this region are mainly involved in cultivation of Coconuts, Betel LeafBetel Leaf, Rice, Bananas and manufacturing of palmyra tree (Borassus) products. Weather The climate is very pleasant in rainy and winter season(temperature ranges between 22¬∞C to 27¬∞C),and very hot in summer (temperature ranges between 25 ¬∞C to 39 ¬∞C). A pleasant wind blows in the evening all around the year as it is very near to the Bay of Mannar.

Built in 1890 and 1904, both are architect-designed buildings of high quality, funded by local benefactors. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Winslow School and Littlefield Library occupy a shared lot on the north side of Tyngsborough's town center, on the west side of Middlesex Road just north of its junction with Winslow and Farwell Roads. The school is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, covered by a hip roof and finished in wooden clapboards. Its central portion is flanked on both sides by single-story wings. Bands of windows flank the central entrance, which is sheltered by a gabled portico. The library stands just north of the school; it is a single-story brick building of smaller scale, with a gabled roof and gabled entrance portico. It is the only brick building in the town center. The school was built in 1890 with funding provided by Sara Tyng Winslow, two years after the town embarked on a consolidation of its district schools. Originally located nearer the Congregational church, it was designed by F.H. Bacon after a more expensive design by Frederick Stickney was rejected. The school was enlarged in 1915, at which time it was given a more Bungalow-style appearance, and was moved to its present site about 1940. The library, founded in 1831, was at first housed in the town hall, and was placed in the Winslow School between 1893 and 1901. It then moved back to Town Hall, awaiting construction of the present building, which was completed in 1905 to a design by Stickney & Austin. Funds for the building, as well as an endowment for further acquisitions, were donated by Mrs. Lucy Littlefield on the stipulation that the library be named in honor of her daughter. The school was closed in 2002, and the library was relocated to more modern facilities in the 1990s.

Generally, in self- verifying nondeterminism, each computation path is concluded with any of the three possible answers: yes, no, and I do not know. For each input string, no two paths may give contradictory answers, namely both answers yes and no on the same input are not possible. At least one path must give answer yes or no, and if it is yes then the string is considered accepted. SVFA accept the same class of languages as deterministic finite automata (DFA) and NFA but have different state complexity.  Formal definition  An SVFA is represented formally by a 6-tuple, A=(Q, Œ£, Œî, q0, Fa, Fr) such that (Q, Œ£, Œî, q0, Fa) is an NFA, and Fa, Fr are disjoint subsets of Q. For each word w = a1a2 ‚Ä¶ an, a computation is a sequence of states r0,r1, ‚Ä¶, rn, in Q with the following conditions: # r0 = q0 # ri+1 ‚àà Œî(ri, ai+1), for i = 0, ‚Ä¶, n‚àí1. If rn ‚àà Fa then the computation is accepting, and if rn ‚àà Fr then the computation is rejecting. There is a requirement that for each w there is at least one accepting computation or at least one rejecting computation but not both.  Results  Each DFA is a SVFA, but not vice versa. Jir√°skov√° and Pighizzini proved that for every SVFA of n states, there exists an equivalent DFA of g(n)=\\\\Theta(3^{n/3}) states. Furthermore, for each positive integer n, there exists an n-state SVFA such that the minimal equivalent DFA has exactly g(n) states. Other results on the state complexity of SVFA were obtained by Jir√°skov√° and her colleagues.

They have leveraged open source software, developed since 2006, which is based on a grid technology that enables dynamic behaviors and supports heterogenous hardware. In October 2017 OpenIO completed a $5 million funding round. In July 2020 OpenIO has been acquired by OVH. Product OpenIO is a software-defined object storage solution that supports S3 and can be deployed on-premises, cloud-hosted or at the edge, on any hardware mix. It has been designed from the beginning for performance and cost-efficiency at any scale, and it has been optimized for Big Data, HPC and AI. OpenIO stores objects within in a flat structure within a massively distributed directory with indirections, this allows the data query path to be independent of the number of nodes and the performance not to be affected by the growth of the capacity. Servers are organized as a grid of nodes massively distributed, where each node takes part in directory and storage services, which ensures that there is no single point of failure and that new nodes are automatically discovered and immediately available without the need to rebalance data. The software is built on top of ConsciousGrid, a technology that ensures optimal data placement based on real-time metrics and allows the addition or removal of storage devices with automatic performance and load impact optimization. For data protection OpenIO has synchronous and asynchronous replication with multiple copies, and an erasure coding implementation based on Reed-Solomon that can be deployed in one data center or geo-distributed or stretched clusters. The software has a GridForApps feature that catches all events that occur in the cluster and can pass them up in the stack or to applications running on OpenIO nodes. This enables event-driven computing directly into the storage infrastructure. OpenIO has native object APIs and SDKs for Python, C and Java, it integrates a HTTP REST/API and has strong compatibility with the Amazon S3 API and the OpenStack Swift API. The company also offers a proprietary File System connector to access data stored in an OpenIO object store through file access methods: it is based on FUSE and presents a POSIX File System which can be shared over local networks via NFS, SMB and FTP. OpenIO is compatible with x86 and ARMv7/ARMv8 servers running Linux and has low hardware requirements, it can be installed also on Raspberry Pis and on storage drives with embedded server. The open source code is available on Github and it is licensed under AGPL3 for server code and LGPL3 for client code.  Performance  OpenIO claimed to have reached 1.372 Tbps write speed (171 GB/s) on a cluster of 350 physical machines. The benchmark scenario, conducted under production conditions with standard hardware (commodity servers with 7200 rpm HDDs), consisted in backing up a 38 PB Hadoop datalake via the DistCp command. This level of performance marks, according to analysts, the arrival of a new generation of object storage technologies oriented toward high performance and hyper-scalability.

Armin S. compared his job with the work of a used car dealer, selling and buying securities constantly and making his margin on the Bid-Ask Spread, the difference between the selling price and buying price. ‚Ç¨163 million lawsuit  Armin S. achieved international recognition when he sued BNP Paribas for over ‚Ç¨160m, one of the largest civil cases brought by a private investor in Germany. The German newspaper FOCUS was the first to publish an article regarding a ‚Ç¨163m erroneous trade allegedly involving BNP Paribas Arbitrage. The bank had sold securities for ‚Ç¨326,400 to an investor but the value of the securities was ‚Ç¨163 million, according to the bank. According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days, and BNP had even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules. The lawyer of Armin S., Mario B√∂gelein, stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law. Next, Armin S. commented on his case in the German magazine AnlegerPlus, questioning the breaches on the risk- management side of BNP. On 11 March 2017 the French newspaper Les Echos published an article with the headline ‚Äútrader requests 161m EUR from BNP Paribas‚Äù. A member of the European Banking Authority retweeted the article as an example of operational risks within the banking sector. On 23 May 2017 Bloomberg News dedicated a spotlight article on the case. The 152m EUR case will be one of the largest civil cases of one individual in Germany. The author highlighted the prevailing erroneous trade rules, that erroneous trades could only be canceled until the next day. Hans-Peter Burghof, a renowned university professor, was cited with the words \\"a bank is obliged to execute their trading activities correctly, this may not have happened\\". On 5 July 2017, Armin S. commented on the case with the words \\"If (the loss) is about 163m EUR, this should have caught the immediate attention of a major bank.\\" Further \\"The arrogance of the bankers makes me sick. They think of themselves they are the best and brightest ‚Äì which they sometimes are ‚Äì but once something goes against them they ignore it\\" On 6 July, an article on the front page of the FAZ appeared by Christian Siedenbiedel. A speaker of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said that they would have spotted a 163m EUR mistrade (erroneous trade), however the transaction was executed over-the-counter (OTC), without the involvement of a stock exchange. The lawyer Michael Lusk published an article with the title \\"Do banks' internal control system work?\\" Why BNP did not spot the mistake in their risk management and thereby violated supervisory rules by the European Central Bank remains unknown. Armin S also filed the 152m EUR claim in France, because the relevant jurisdiction is still unknown.  BNP's Risk-management affair  The Financial Times published an article in March 2018 about the case with the title \\"BNP Paribas failed to book trades in Germany for a week\\". They cite internal documents that show why the error has not been detected: as it turns out, BNP forgot to book all trades that happened in structured products in Germany from 2 December 2015 to 9 December 2015. The Financial Times estimates that 8500 trades might have been affected. It also questions if the bank has hedged their positions if the trades have not been booked. Armin S. is cited with the words ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair if on the one hand, BNP wants to rely on statutory safeguard clauses but on the other hand they ignored all control-tasks imposed by the regulators ‚Äî ECB, BaFin and AMF ‚Äî for a whole week\\".

Given that the large majority of children and adolescents in the region are enrolled in the education system, it can be argued that school dropouts in Latin America are predominantly due to the weakening of a link, which for a variety of reasons wore away and finally broke. The fact that school drop out intensifies specifically when young men and women are between the ages of 15 and 17 years and that it increases disproportionately in populations that are under-served in other ways highlights the difficulty the education system has in interacting with populations in situations that are more complex than those with which it was designed to cope. Adolescents and young people from the most disadvantaged social sectors who are typically the first generation from their families to attend secondary school are six times more likely to be out of school.  Main factors of school dropout  Reasons for school dropout among out-of-school adolescents. When analysing the household surveys of some countries in the Latin American region ‚Äì notably, those of Bolivia, Chile, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Paraguay ‚Äì researching the opinions of boys, girls, adolescents, young people as well as their families on the reasons they drop out of school, some recurring features surface that enable us to group the analyses into two main categories. = Material dimension of education = The first is directly related to ‚Äòthe material dimension‚Äô of education. In this case, financial difficulties are the main reason why families do not manage to keep their children and adolescents in school. This is compounded by the deficit of education services and the difficulties caused by chronic illness or disability. These factors loom particularly large among the causes of school drop out in primary education. Later, when they reach adolescence, the work done both outside and inside the home seems, according to those involved and their families, to be the most direct cause of school drop out. Paid work is in fact mentioned by only 20% of young people as the cause of school drop out while a further 20% identify work related to parenting at a young age or the direct care of other members of the household as the reasons for drop out. It is clear from these findings that the link between paid work, caregiving and interruption of each educational trajectory could be thought of as the outcome of family dynamics due to persistent shortages and deprivations. This means that young people dropping out of school is one of the consequences of the difficulties encountered by adults trying to achieve a minimal level of well- being to protect the educational trajectories of their adolescents. In emergency family situations, the roles assumed by youth within the family dynamics for producing well-being are always gender differentiated. Thus, over 70% of those reporting work-related reasons as the main cause of drop out are males while 97% of the females surveyed state that parenting duties and associated domestic tasks are the main causes of school drop out. In other words, the intensification of paid work and of care work during adolescence ‚Äì and its impact on each educational trajectory ‚Äì is a clear expression of the roles assumed by young people in contexts of persistent material privations. Family dynamics while seeking to achieve adequate levels of well-being undoubtedly form a complex web of interactions that, in many cases, affect educational trajectories. The information from the household surveys in the region confirm, to a large extent, a close link between the participation of young people in the family dynamics of the production of well-being and school drop out. This was done by investigating the relationship of the causes for drop out with the school, conditions of economic activities, family structure and constitution of a new household. Percentage of young people living with at least one child aged 0 to 8 years, by educational attainment and by sex. A first approximation enabling us to gauge this group of out-of-school young people shows how the increase in care work among women, men entering the job market early, early motherhood and fatherhood, and a separation from the family of origin affect 39% of them. Indeed, 67% of the young people who left their educational trajectories early are men who work or unemployed women who live together with small children and take care of the members of the household. In any case, the information analysed shows strong indications that a quarter of out-of-school youth aged 18 to 24 years who left school before completing their secondary education have brothers and sisters or other young family members who were adolescent fathers and mothers. The behaviour patterns analysed also revealed that many young people left the household in which they were raised to set up a new household. An over-representation of this subgroup of adolescents and young people who broke off their educational trajectories before completing their secondary level was found in considerably greater proportions among the poorest households, in rural areas and among women. When this cause of school drop out is taken into account, the numbers point to a social gap of 22% within the poorest sectors, a geographical divide of 7% within rural areas and a gender gap of 10% of women. = Subjective dimension of education = The other major group of factors for school drop out is more subtle and directly connected to the analytical framework from which interpretations are made. These factors fall into the ‚Äòsubjective dimension‚Äô of the educational experience. The surveys revealed that 22% of out-of-school boys and girls aged 10 or 11 years state that they are in this situation because they have no interest in studying. This percentage jumps to 38% in adolescents aged 15 to 17 years who also provided this reason for their disengagement with the education system. With the challenge taken on by the countries in the region to guarantee the right to education, this ‚Äòlack of interest‚Äô in studying mentioned by boys, girls, adolescents and young people makes it clear that access to educational services is not something that happens naturally. It is the result of a combination of conditions and doctrines of the educational services linked with the representations that the young subjects make of them.  Intra-school factors associated with school dropout  The process of construction of the identity of youth affects ‚Äì and is affected by ‚Äì the way in which educational experience unfolds. In this respect, the quantitative analysis of factors associated with school drop out within which intra-school factors present a high relative weight should be complemented with a review of these variables, an analysis of violence as a specific factor and, finally, an analysis of the interaction of the reciprocal perceptions of teachers and learners in the school context. = The subjective push factor = The start of the last decade saw a consolidation of the distinction between extra-school factors (poverty, rurality, gender, ethnicity, among others) and intra-school factors (low performance, problems of conduct, teacher authoritarianism, academic performance, perception on the quality of educational provision) associated with school drop out. Various studies have characterized this reality, such as the case carried out by Esp√≠ndola and Le√≥n (2002), who state that: In this manner, the characteristics and very structure of the education system together with the intra-school agents themselves would be directly responsible for generating its expelling elements, whether on account of its inadequate socializing action or because of its inability to channel or contain the influence of the (adverse) socio- economic environment in which children and young people develop. = Violence as a critical push factor = A particularly pertinent phenomenon in this scenario is the problem of violence. Escotto (2015), Trucco and Ullmann (2015) recognize a set of causes of violence affecting the young people concerned. Notably, the growing inequality and exclusion (or exclusions); the series of civil conflicts; drug trafficking; migratory processes and deportations; violence within the family; young people lacking a sense of belonging; the stigmatization of youth; and institutional disaffiliation. To this are added two cultural classifications: a generalized culture validating violence as a mechanism for settling conflicts; and a low tolerance of differences in very unequal societies, which fosters discrimination. Specifically in the educational sphere, violence occurs more or less extensively, aggravating three types of key tensions: # violent behaviour versus the school as a safe and protected place for training the new generations in citizen and democratic conduct and values # the school as a space regulating behaviour (shaping a harmonious school community) versus the emergence of the external space (for example, the reshaping of sociability regarding ICTs and their impact on the daily life of youth) # the educational institution directed towards a homogeneous population versus a new diverse school population. L√≥pez (2011) observes the latter tension as ‚Äò... an imbalance in appraisal terms between the student the school would like to have and the actual student in the classroom from day to day. Not only is it observed that the new students are different but it is also clear that this difference generates uneasiness which, furthermore, is connoted and valued negatively‚Äô. This assertion could explain the strong daily expression of violent behaviour in the school space, both in the form of institutional violence and in the case of aggression among peers or reactions to environmental discrimination. Addressing these situations requires not only rules, consequences and sanctions but more importantly backup measures and the development of personal capacities of tolerance and conflict management, all of which require resources and training facilities that are not currently being provided by the secondary school. = Reciprocal representations between adolescents and teachers = The reciprocal representations between adolescents and their teachers also determine both the various learner trajectories and even the continued presence of some young people in the secondary school. Currently, there is a significant number of young people who have lost faith in the school. Confirming this observation, the national youth surveys conducted in the countries in the region (with their methodological variability and certain local adaptations) highlight the persistence of the traditional models of assessment of the role of the school which is under strain due to many problems, such as the widening educational divides according to socio-economic backgrounds, physical and psychological violence, and the imbalances between learning processes and the labour market, among other factors. At the regional level, a third of the young people interviewed strongly question the relevance of the school as the main socializing institution; this trend is even more accentuated in the Southern Cone. The specifics, however, vary. Nearly 20% of the region agree on the role of teachers and contents, their instrumentality for work or violence in the educational environment, with the exception of Central America and Brazil, where the criticisms in all respects remain at a little over 35%. Among young Mexicans (according to the 2005 National Youth Survey), the reasons for choosing to study are linked to the possibility of having a good job (58%), which means that education continues to be viewed as a possible means to obtain social promotion and mobility. In Argentina (according to the 2009 National Youth Survey in Argentina), some 56% of those surveyed, regardless of their age, stated that youth should study and not work, which confirms the value of education in the social construct and the importance given, above all, to the right to education. In this respect, many of those polled (whatever their age) highly value education credentials and are confident that this will help them achieve social insertion. In Guatemala (according to the First National Survey of Youth in Guatemala ‚Äì ENJU, 2011), youth consider that the education they receive, or have received, is relevant for further learning or for obtaining greater knowledge (40%) while a similar proportion state that education enables them to get a good job, improve their financial situation or even help their family members (37.3%). A lower proportion, 14.3%, of young people see education‚Äôs role as developing socialization capacities, such as getting to know people, making friends, obtaining prestige or meeting social expectations. The survey also revealed that some 43% of these young people have suffered teasing or derision at school (i.e. psychological violence) and 30.8% have been victims of physical violence. Among young Uruguayans (according to the Third National Survey of Adolescence and Youth ‚Äì ENAJ, 2013), the main reason stated by 45.1% of them for attending secondary school is ‚Äòto acquire training‚Äô. The reasoning statement provided on the survey, stating ‚Äòyou hope/were hoping to improve your social position by studying‚Äô scored a mere 6.2%. In Colombia (from the data of the 2000 National Youth Survey), youth consider that first among the factors most contributing to success (in descending order) is personality (38%), the second is preparation (24%) and the third is effort (21%). Teachers, however, rated last in the importance attributed to them by young people as socializing agents in daily life ‚Äì after mother, brothers and sisters, father, friends and boyfriend or girlfriend. Across the board, youth surveys in the various countries indicate that the lack of money (for transport or enrollment) is the main reason for school drop out.

Gaynor, in 1915. The Fire Department of New York operated a fireboat named William J. Gaynor from 1914 to 1961. Construction began in March 1913. Her cost was projected to be $118,000. She was long, with a beam of . According to the New York Times her pumps would \\"normally\\" project 7,000 gallons per minute. However, \\"under high pressure\\", she could throw 13,000 gallons per minute. The vessel was named after a former Mayor of New York City, William J. Gaynor. Gaynor's daughter Marion launched the vessel, on June 26, 1913, at a ceremony in Elizabethport, New Jersey, attended by other senior officials. She was put up for sale in February, 1961. She was no longer in operational condition when she was put up for sale. Operational history On January 22, 1916, the freighter Sygna carrying railway supplies from the neutral United States to wartorn Russia, returned to port when crew discovered a serious fire in one of her holds. The William J. Gaynor was assigned to put out the freighter's fire. At the inquiry her officer's praised the freighter's pilot for preventing the vessels from coming to shore, and starting fires there. The Sygna propeller cut a gash in the William J. Gaynors hull. She had to call on a \\"wrecking tug\\" to open the Sygnas hatch before she could suppress the fire in the hold. On June 21, 1921, the William J. Gaynor was called to Barren Island in Jamaica Bay when a warehouse belonging to the United States Shipping Board was found to be ablaze. By the time the fireboat arrived land- based firefighters had been unable to prevent the fire from spreading to two of the shipping board's four derelict vessels. The freighters Polar Bear and the City of Omaha were also ablaze. The William J. Gaynor with the assistance of land-based firefighters, and the skeleton crews of two more shipping board vessels, was able to keep the two remaining vessels from burning. In 1932 Popular Science magazine published a former crew member's account of the William J. Gaynor fight of a fire aboard a munitions barge, during World War One. The crew member described how, after the fire had been put out, the officer in command of Fort Hamilton, where the barge was being unloaded, praised how he and his colleagues stuck by their stations, and didn't withdraw, when the shells started to explode. He wrote that they took the praise and didn't inform him they had no choice, since they had run aground, and couldn't move until the next tide raised the river's level. In July, 1958, Otto H. Winderl, the Gaynors pilot, and Eugene E. Kenny, the Gaynors Captain, were called to testify as a witness at a Coast Guard board of inquiry into the deadly collision of the freighter Nebraska and the tanker Empress Bay. The tanker burst into flame. The Gaynor and other service vessels had difficulty rescuing survivors. The Nebraska's propeller ripped a large hole in the Gaynors hull. Two crewmembers died, in the blaze, but 49 others were saved. References External links * Category:Fireboats of New York City ","title":"William J.

They acquired extensive lands in Kilkenny County of Ireland and the family flourished there for more than 500 years. They then lost their lands in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Some of the Grace families followed the exiled James II of England to France and others became soldiers of fortune. Grace's father was one of the latter and eventually ended up on an estate in Barbados. In 1707 he came to Philadelphia to live for a while. During this time, Grace was born in the city on April 25, 1709. His mother died while he was a baby and his father went back to Barbados and lived out his life there. Grace was raised by his maternal grandmother. Her name was Constance and she was married to Hugh Lowden, a wealthy merchant. Grace grew up in their Philadelphia mansion on High Street. Mid life Grace was a friend of Benjamin Franklin, who described Grace at 21 years of age in 1730 as a wealthy man with a pleasing personality. He inherited much from his father of estates in Barbados. From his grandmother's side Grace had received an inheritance from the estate of Hugh Lowden (Constance's husband). This included a large sum of money and the mansion on High Street in downtown Philadelphia. Grace was already wealthy as a young man of seventeen years of age in 1723. Franklin stove Franklin's Junto Club of scientists used part of Grace's mansion for their meetings. Franklin mentions in his autobiography that around 1729 the Club no longer had their meetings at a tavern and instead used a room at Grace's house that he had set aside for them. It was proposed to Franklin that books of the members should all be located in the same place for convenience of the researchers. Some of these books were collected and put on shelves in the room used for their club meetings. They were aggregated together from various members in a type of library. So many books were gathered in a year that they became unmanageable and the library was discontinued for a while. Grace's house eventually was leased by Benjamin Franklin for his residence and printing shop business. The three-story brick mansion, originally built in 1710, became the Philadelphia Public Library, eventually fulfilling Franklin's concept. The Pennsylvania Gazette newspaper published on May 29, 1740, a wedding notification that Grace had married Mrs. Rebecca Nutt, a wealthy widow, a few days prior.The Pennsylvania Gazette, front page May 29, 1740. Grace was a close friend of both Rebecca's previous husband and Franklin. Franklin invented his stove in the 1741‚Äì1742 time period; he gave a model to Grace to use as a template for manufacturing the first heating stove and Grace set up a profitable casting business. He did not have to pay Franklin anything for the model, as Franklin wanted his stoves to be available to everyone, relishing popular appreciation of his handiwork and eschewing patents. This combination of events led to the first Franklin stoves being manufactured by Warwick furnaces, which was owned and managed by Grace from his marriage to Rebecca. The stoves originally had an arched and decorated front plate. The stove had a projecting hearth at the bottom that was inserted into a fireplace and the smoke was guided up through the chimney. The stove was more efficient in producing heat for the room than an open fireplace. Death Grace died in the summer of 1766.

The chairs are placed randomly, but cover the length of the performance space. There is a door upstage right leading to a revolving door, and doors on either side of the stage. There are six dancers, three men and three women. Two of the men wear suits, the third wears a loose white shirt tucked into trousers and dances barefoot. Two of the women, one portrayed by Bausch herself, wear long white dresses with bare feet, the other wears a dress, overcoat, and heels. The dance moves about the stage, dancers shifting in and out of duet. At various moments, one or more dance with eyes closed, rushing across the stage strewn with chairs while the other dancers rush about them moving furniture out of the way. The movement is often frantic and repetitive, halting with a feeling of exhaustion. There are themes of manipulation and dependence throughout the dance, which are realized through intense repetition as well as trust between dancers that they will keep each other safe on stage in varying states of awareness. The dancers rely on each other to clear their paths as they dance with their eyes shut, a strong example of the trust shared on- stage.

Following the victory at the Battle of Sarhu, Nurhaci continued the attack on Ming by assaulting the city of Kaiyuan. The Jin attack occurred during a heavy downpour. Ming dispatched a small relief contingent of 100 men, but they were intercepted by a Jin force and suffered 32 casualties. The Jin army besieged Kaiyuan and attacked Ma Lin's outer defenses, which had been heavily strengthened in preference to a safer position on the walls. However the strategy ended badly for Ma Lin, who's forces were defeated. As too many men were already outside, there weren't enough men to man the walls. As imminent defeat became apparent, the Censor Zheng Zhifan fled. The walls were breached and the fighting continued inside the city for three days before it was pacified.

She was the sister of the better-known painter Sofonisba (or Sophonisba) Anguissola.  Biography  Elena Anguissola (who became a nun with the name of Sister Minerva) was the daughter of Amilcare Anguissola and Bianca Ponzoni. The spelling of the surname, in sixteenth century documents, varies between Angosciola and Angussola. Her parents were of noble origins. Her father belonged to the Genoese nobility and had moved to Lombardy. With his family, Amilcare Anguissola lived in Cremona, in a building on Via Pellegrino Tibaldi. He taught all of his children a humanistic culture, with readings of Latin and Italian texts, and painting for the eldest daughters Elena and Sofonisba, under the guidance of Bernardino Campi (1522‚Äì1591). They lived for three years in the house of Campi and in 1546, when the painter left Cremona and moved to Milan, Sofonisba Anguissola became the painting teacher of her younger sisters. This is the first case documented in Italy of girls sent to live at the home of a painter to accommodate their inclination towards art, as well as the first Italian family with painter sisters. In 1550 Elena and Sofonisba (the older sisters) passed into the workshop of Bernardino Gatti, called the Sojaro. They specialized in portraiture and also took inspiration from the art of Moretto da Brescia and the mannerism of the Spanish portrait. The two sisters went to Mantua, where they were received at the Gonzaga court. In 1566 Giorgio Vasari arrived in Cremona and, as a guest in the Anguissola house, marveled at the art of the sisters. Elena retired to the convent of San Vincenzo in Mantua as a Dominican nun, taking the name of Sister Minerva (not to be confused with her younger sister called Minerva). Her name is mentioned in a letter of 1557, written by her father to the Duchess of Mantua and in her brother's will, dated 1575. Perhaps it is her Portrait of the Dominican as Saint Catherine of Siena - it could be her self-portrait - kept in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. = Portraits and interiors, Anguissola family = The alleged portrait of Minerva Anguissola (or self-portrait of Sofonisba) was painted by Sofonisba Anguissola. The young Minerva is forced into a dress of heavy brocade, of a dark brown color, trimmed with fur and lined with natural- colored silk; she wears a precious white shirt, edged with lace and raised in a Venetian style, and has a veil of micro pearls around her neck. The painter lingers on the details: the folds of the dress, the light of the lace, the complex braid hairstyle. Feature of Sofonisba is the depth of the eyes, with slightly dilated pupils. We know another portrait, also this work by Sofonisba. It represents a young woman, adorned with jewels of gold and coral, with her hands resting on a sleeve. It is believed to be her younger sister Minerva. Chess game depicts Lucia (left), Minerva as a teenager (right) and her little sister Europa; on the bottom you can see the nanny, whose discreet presence, together with the open and childish smile of Europa - a discreet touch of humor that contrasts with the chess attention of the older sisters - makes the scene intimate, full of family affections. The two girls play ¬´a battle between amazons, a competition that alludes to the search for and the conquest of a female primacy, of an excellence able to compete, at least on the cultural and intellectual level, with the male one. [...] True Amazons and queens appear the Anguissola sisters, adequately dressed for the occasion and reaching out for a victory that identifies with the goal of a life spent in the study and virtuous occupations ¬ª. On the bottom there is a bluish, Flemish-style landscape . Amilcare Anguissola with his children Minerva and Asdrubale by Sofonisba Anguissola is another Anguissola family intern . Minerva with one hand raises a hem of her dress, of heavy blue brocade, and with the other she holds a bunch of flowers. The father's attention is entirely for the male child, second-born, who holds his arm in protection. A little dog completes the scene. In the background opens a pleasant landscape, tinged with light blue, of clear Nordic influence. Portrait of a nun by Sofonisba Anguissola, signed and dated, perhaps is a portrait of her sister Elena, in the guise of Sister Minerva. The novice nun holds a book in her hand, lined with red leather and with gold friezes. = Children of Amilcare Anguissola and Bianca Ponzoni = The reference text, for this list, is the catalog published in 1994 by Leonardo Arte which was an opportunity to review ancient, well-known documents and to compare them with other unpublished documents. The fundamental dates are: * 1530, date of the parents' marriage * 1551 year of birth of Amilcare and the chronological succession of births of children. Not only were contemporary documents studied, but also the apparent age of the Anguissola family members, in the paintings of Sofonisba. The other dates of birth, in the cited catalog, are expressed in the form of a fork, in two or three years. However, in order to respect the chronological succession of the births of the children, we have opted in some cases for an intermediate dating, inside the fork. The names are not surprising because, except for Lucia and Elena who were the names of the grandmothers, at Anguissola the names were taken from mythology or ancient history. No reference was found for Anna Maria. * Sofonisba (1535-1625), painter, married first Fabrizio Moncada and secondly Orazio Lomellini. * Elena (1536-post 1585), painter, enters the convent with the name Sister Minerva. * Lucia (1537-1565), painter. * Minerva (1539-1566), teacher, not painter, but excellent in Latin and Italian letters. * Europa (1542 (or 1543) -?), painter, married Carlo Schinchinelli. * Asdrubale (1551-1623), musician. * Anna Maria (1555-1611), painter and teacher, married Giacomo di Gaspare Sommi in 1574.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was first of three partial eclipses that took place that year within the space of nearly six months, the last one was on June 1852 in the same hemisphere with a very tiny portion in the same area with the previous eclipse but the remainder in South America. It was the twelfth solar saros 148 cycle of eclipses Description The eclipse was visible in almost the whole of Antarctica which had a 24-hour daylight with the exception of one part of the mid northernmost area of Antarctica by the Indian Ocean and around the area of the Antarctic Circle, a small piece of southernmost Tasmania with Hobart in it, most all of New Zealand's South Island and a small part of Wellington on North Island, the nearby Antipodes, Chatham Islands and Macquarrie Island. It also included the southernmost areas of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. The eclipse started at sunrise around the area of the South Orkney Islands and finished at sunset in New Zealand. The eclipse showed up to 45% obscuration in the area of the greatest eclipse which occurred at sunset. in Tasmania and southeastern Australia and finished at sunset at the Pacific and a tiny part of Western Antarctica. The greatest eclipse was in the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles (or kilometers) north of Antarctica at 68.9 S & 124.3 E at 7:12 UTC (11:12 AM local time on January 20).

Its development consists of four aspects that may define the position of the debate on inclusive education in the region: # Combining traditional programmes with new approaches # Focusing in and beyond the education system # Educational progressivism # Understanding the past and the present  Combining traditional programmes with new approaches  In Latin America as a whole, the most traditional programmes ‚Äì mainly built around the concepts of equity and quality ‚Äì exist side by side with those reflecting renewed sensibilities and approaches, through such themes as Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), comprehensive citizenship education, intercultural bilingual education and ICTs, and academic inclusion. Rather than being anchored in one unified approach, the new agendas tend more to combine together, stacking on top of one another and adding up to a sum of divided trends, projects and interventions. They are predominantly based on educational provision and maintain a fairly marginal relationship with the core of the education system (i.e. its essence and substance). The Education Agenda 2030 presents an alternative to a programme of accumulated themes and places Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and Global Citizenship Education (GCED) at the core of formal, non-formal and informal education through comprehensive measures and academic support. Furthermore, the incorporation of new subjects to the regional agenda has not induced a rethinking of what is understood in the field of inclusive education or what the options and the paths needed to achieve greater equity and quality truly involves. For example, with respect to achieving intercultural bilingual education, we should ask ourselves whether this is rooted in references and curriculum frameworks common to all or, alternatively, requires separate curricula. Likewise, when considering inclusion, if we should aim to deal with the specific nature of groups linked to intercultural bilingual education with or without a base in universal policies or what type of universalism this should be based on; or rather, whether equity involves guaranteeing access to education for these groups or differentiating curriculum approaches and pedagogic strategies to lend education meaning and relevance for them. Generally speaking, education systems are immersed in a variety of actions that seek to overcome the lack or inadequacy of common conceptual threads among the various educational levels. It is possible to consider this while still acknowledging the lack of unified policy frameworks and the ordering of priorities. In any case, education systems are often constructed more in terms of service providers as opposed to providers of learning opportunities.  Focusing in and beyond the education system  Within the field of inclusive education, there are a variety of approaches, policies and interventions that may place the responsibility for the achievement of inclusion outside the education system and instead on those systems that assimilate people with special needs. The multiple foundations of inclusive education policies reflect an adaptable concept that generally lacks its own meaning and projection but instead serves the purpose of other policies.  Educational progressivism  Latin America presents a case of unfinished democratization when it comes to genuine inclusion and educational achievements. Certainly, and particularly in the last 15 years, the region has made notable progress in at least four fundamental respects that fall under what could be termed ‚Äòeducational progressivism‚Äô: i) the strengthening of the concept of education as a right and public good to the detriment of the concept of education as a service and consumer good; ii) expansion of the right to education through an extension of compulsory schooling, with an emphasis on lower and upper secondary education; iii) greater investment in education as a percentage of GDP of each country and a steady improvement of the conditions and inputs aimed at supporting teaching and learning processes, chiefly with respect to physical infrastructures, equipment and materials; and finally iv) the priority given to improving the working conditions and pay of teachers. Educational progressivism has generated the political will to bring about positive change in the regulatory framework and the conditions to implement the right to education and the improvement of learning opportunities, but this has not been matched by the political will to provide each and every child and young person a chance to participate in education and learning. For the most part, this endeavour has lacked the full-bodied institutional, curricular and academic policies needed to achieve this goal. More often, educational progressivism has tended to make use of the traditional battery of classroom approaches thought ‚Äòto be advanced‚Äô, as in the case of the different variants of constructivism rather than to reflect on what are the most pertinent combinations of curriculum and teaching approaches to support and guide learners towards gaining access to relevant and sustainable learning processes. Currently, the urgent need to realize a huge academic effort tailored to the individual learner has not been sufficiently weighted ‚Äì nor has this effort been valued or recognized ‚Äì as a fundamental ingredient for policy change in education.  Understanding the past and the present  How to situate oneself in the most recent past and present in order to get to the root of the problem of achieving inclusive education. A superficial historical perspective ranging over the past four decades runs the risk of presenting an ideological vision classifying this period in terms of gains and setbacks, without any nuances or transitions. Yet, it is important to observe that the challenges to inclusive education have not been confronted or solutions channelled sustainably and satisfactorily in a great variety of ideological and political frameworks. If by inclusion, we understand equity and justice in the processes, participation and outcomes, which entails seeking equality starting from the recognition of differences, then inclusion in this sense constitutes an unfinished business on account of both conservatism and progressivism in education.  Challenges  From a joint regional perspective, it is possible to identify four orders of problems that obstruct inclusive education: # The aggregation of policies for educational changes without any comprehensive rethinking of the vision of education and the role of the education system as their guarantor and support # The broad array of concepts of inclusive education and its adaptability for supporting a wide range of education policy proposals # The lack of linkages between the discourse, regulatory framework and real conditions for putting into practice the right to education, along with the implementation of educational practices bent more on educational approaches than thought from understanding and regarding the expectations and needs of the learners # The observation that inclusive education is thus still unfinished business under democratic governments with markedly different political, economic and social differences  See also  * Education in Latin America  Sources   References  Category:Latin America Category:Free content from UNESCO Category:Education in the Americas ","title":"Inclusive education in Latin America"},{"id":"53555528","title":"Bahoran Lal Maurya"},{"id":"53555530","text":"Luca Verna (born 21 June 1993) is an Italian football player who plays for Catanzaro.

She is best known for rescuing the youngest Allison child, Trevor, from the Titanic. Little is known about her later life, as she refused to give interviews after surviving the shipwreck. She was the subject of books and movies that misidentified her as Alice Mary Cleaver, a woman who was infamous for murdering her own infant.  Early life  Alice Catherine Cleaver was born in London on 5 July 1889. Her father Joseph Cleaver was a postman, and her mother was Lavinia Alice Cleaver (maiden name Thomas).  Work  When she was 22, Cleaver was hired by the Allison family to be a nursemaid for their youngest child, Trevor. She traveled first class on the Titanic with them (under ticket No. 113781) and boarded in Southampton. She stayed in the same room as Trevor so that she could care for him, which was right next to the parents in first class.  Night of the shipwreck  On 14 April 1912 the RMS Titanic struck an iceberg and started to sink. Cleaver took Trevor into her lifeboat, but didn't tell anyone. Speculation claims this confusion could have led to the Allison family perishing, as the mother Bess would not want to leave her son behind. Testimony from that night has speculated why she never alerted the Allisons to her departure from her room, but Cleaver herself never spoke of the incident.  Identity  There has been some confusion over the age and identity of Alice Cleaver, with some mistaking her for Alice Mary Cleaver, a woman who was convicted in 1909 for the murder of her own child. This misconception was printed as fact in at least two books about the sinking of the Titanic, Titanic: An Illustrated History (1992) and Titanic: Women and Children First (1998), and was included as part of the plot for the 1996 television mini-series Titanic. In the miniseries Cleaver was portrayed as an emotionally unstable young woman with premonitions of the disaster, who then sees the opportunity to rescue baby Trevor from the sinking ship as a saving grace from her tumultuous past. Cleaver's age has also been debated due to descriptions of her being a competent nursemaid and a good maternal figure, which Titanic Lives author Rob Rondeau believes were indicative of an older woman.

She is known for her work on neurological disorders that affect learning and memory, particularly for her research on Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and the role of CDK5 and chromatin remodeling in the progression of the disease. Additionally, her laboratory has innovated numerous applications of induced pluripotent stem cells for in vitro modeling of neurological diseases.  Education and career  Tsai was born and raised in Taiwan. In 1984, she received a fellowship to pursue a master's degree in veterinary medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After attending a series of lectures delivered by Nobel Prize laureate and cancer researcher Howard Temin, she developed an interest in molecular cancer research. Tsai earned her PhD in 1990 from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. In 1991, Tsai joined the laboratory of Ed Harlow at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and then the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. In 1994, Tsai joined the faculty in the Department of Pathology at Harvard Medical School. She moved to MIT in 2006. She was appointed director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory in 2009 and is a founding member of MIT's Aging Brain Initiative. In 2019, Tsai became co-director of the Alana Down Syndrome Center at MIT.  Research  In the Harlow laboratory, Tsai studied cyclin-dependent kinases in order to identify their role in cell division. Tsai became interested in CDK5, which she found was not only inactive in cancer cells, but inactive in all other tissue cells except for the brain. She also found that Cdk5 requires p35 to be active. After moving to Harvard Medical School, she began to investigate the function of CDK5 and p35. Tsai found that mice lacking p35 displayed cortical lamination defects and were prone to seizures, and that CDK5-p35 activity was essential for neurite outgrowth during neuronal differentiation. Tsai also discovered that while Cdk5 activity is essential to proper brain development and function, overexpression of Cdk5 was associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Tsai observed that a truncated version of p35 called p25 accumulated in diseased or damaged brain tissue in mice and in tissue samples from deceased Alzheimer‚Äôs patients. In an experiment with genetically-engineered mice, Tsai found that increased expression of CDK5 led to the development of Alzheimer‚Äôs-like symptoms such as a decline in learning and cognition, profound neural loss in the forebrain, and that amyloid plaques developed within weeks. After moving to MIT in 2006, Tsai began to investigate how to ameliorate or reverse Alzheimer‚Äôs symptoms. In a 2007 study, Tsai trained mice to find and remember a platform submerged in a murky pool. When she induced Alzheimer‚Äôs-like symptoms, the mice could no longer find the platform; however, after spending some time in an enriched environment, those same mice could locate platform immediately, indicating their memories had returned. Tsai was able to replicate the same effects as the enriched environment by treating the mice with a drug that inhibited a chromatin-remodeling class of enzymes called histone deacetylases, or HDACs. In later studies, Tsai showed that HDAC2 creates an epigenetic blockade of genes that regulate structural and synaptic plasticity and that some cognitive function could be restored by inhibiting HDAC2 activity. Tsai has elucidated the role of structural and epigenetic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease, showing in two 2015 studies that the DNA breakage necessary to learning was also responsible for cognitive decline, due to decline in DNA repair systems with age, and that the genetic component of Alzheimer‚Äôs primarily affects the regulatory circuitry of immune processes, rather than neuronal processes as expected. In 2016, Tsai demonstrated that visual stimulation of mice with an LED flashing at 40 hertz substantially reduces the beta amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, likely by inducing gamma oscillations. In more recent work, Tsai has created a lab-engineered model of the Blood-Brain Barrier to investigate how Alzheimer disease risk genes, namely APOE, contribute to breakdown of the brain's vasculature.

Background Teach For Armenia was founded in 2013 by Larisa Hovannisian after her two-year teaching experience in an elementary and middle school in Glendale, Arizona through the Teach For America program.http://repatarmenia.org/en/engage/inspiration/a/larisa-ryan Together with its supporters, Teach For Armenia's founding team embarked on an ambitious mission to transform the country's public education system so that educational excellence and opportunity would reach every child, even the most marginalized. Activities =Theory of Problem and Theory of Change= Today in Armenia, approximately 25% of students from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities do not enroll in high school. The country's students have consistently ranked behind their peers in neighboring countries and below international averages in math and science, and these figures decline further with each passing year. Children in the communities Teach For Armenia serves, lack access to the high-quality teaching and educational opportunities that are readily available to their wealthier peers; and an estimated 35% of schools in these communities face teacher shortages. As a result, tens of thousands of Armenian children are being left without the skills they need to pursue higher education and attain financial security. This educational inequity fuels Armenia's most urgent societal problems and entrenches cycles of poverty in a country where about 30% of the population is impoverished.http://data.worldbank.org/country/armenia To address this crucial issue of educational inequity, Teach For Armenia harnesses the energy, enthusiasm, and drive of exceptional university graduates to infuse great teachers into Armenia's most disadvantaged schools and to cultivate lifelong champions for educational excellence.http://armeniangc.com/2015/03/teach-for- armenia-mi-hotim-sozdat-novoe-pokolenie-talantlivyx-pedagogov/ Geographical reach Currently, Teach For Armenia operates in five regions of Armenia: Gegharkunik, Lori, Armavir, Tavush, and Aragatsotn.http://armenianweekly.com/2016/07/07/tfa-2016/ Partnership with Teach For All In 2015, Teach For Armenia officially became the 36th partner of Teach For All, a global network of 42 and counting independent, locally led, and locally operated partner organizations with a shared mission to expand educational opportunity within their own countries by leveraging their country's best talent.http://teachforall.org/en/news/teach-armenia-joins- teach-all Recruitment and Application Acceptance Rate Teach For Armenia recruits highly-achieving university graduates from Armenia and the Armenian diaspora through a uniquely designed admissions process that consists of five- stages: online application, phone interview, subject knowledge test, and assessment center. According to recent statistics, participant acceptance rate is 7.5%. Leadership Development Program Once selected, Fellows participate in a rigorous two-year, context-specific training and leadership development program that prepares them as educators and future leaders of education in Armenia. Prior to the two-year training, Fellows go through Summer Institute, an intensive 6-week, mandatory training program. The objective of the Institute is twofold: first and foremost, it is designed to effectively train future Fellows for their two-year teaching commitment, while helping students from rural communities overcome knowledge gaps through free of charge summer school. During the Fellowship, Fellows receive constant leadership development and classroom management support by the Teach For Armenia training team. Furthermore, Fellows have an opportunity to pursue a free-of-charge master's degree in pedagogy from an Armenian state university.http://www.teachforarmenia.org/summer-institute/ Following completion of the two-year Fellowship, Fellows join the Teach For Armenia ambassador network, a community of passionate and committed leaders who continue to address the issues of educational disadvantage and inequity in Armenia. Teach For Armenia‚Äôs Impact to Date Following its first two years of placements, early data indicates that Teach For Armenia is already making a change. According to recent survey results, student engagement levels in Teach For Armenia classrooms are above average within the Teach For All network, with Fellows establishing rigorous and interactive environments and setting students on an expanded path towards educational opportunity. Furthermore, student assessments show a dramatic boost in student growth both in academics and personal leadership development; after just a year with Teach For Armenia Fellows, students demonstrate double average growth in academic content mastery. Beyond the school curriculum, through extracurricular activities and community projects, Teach For Armenia Fellows are helping students to develop lifelong non-academic skills and mindsets.http://nt.am/am/news/232246/ Supporters Due to Teach For Armenia's early impact and reputation, the organization was able to establish partnerships with important stakeholders in Armenian education, including the national Ministry of Education and regional educational authorities.http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/photoset/9546/91648 Beyond this, Teach For Armenia is also partnered with other education-focused, highly reputable foundations, such as the AGBU,https://agbu.org/news- item/agbu-announces-its-partnership-with-teach-for-armenia/ Scholae Mundi Armenia Foundation,http://www.mediamax.am/en/news/education/18969/ the Simonian Educational Foundation, etc. Board of directors The members of the Board of Directors of the Teach For Armenia Educational Foundation are: * Veronika Zonabend, Chair of the Board (Chair of the Board of Governors UWC Dilijan College, Co-founder of IDeA (Initiatives for Development of Armenia) Foundation, Founder of RVVZ and Scholae Mundi Armenia Foundations); * Sam Simonian (Founder of Tumo Center for Creative Technologies and Simonian Educational Foundation); * Sylva Simonian (Co-Founder of Tumo Centre for Creative Technologies and Simonian Educational Foundation); * Alice Petrossian (Member at Armenian Educational Foundation); * Carol Aslanian (Member of AGBU Central Board of Directors, President and Founder of Aslanian Market Research and Senior Vice President at Education Dynamics); * Pierre Gurdjian (President of Board of Directors at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles); * Yamit Taragan (Senior Director of Growth Strategy & Development in Europe at Teach For All); * Armine Hovannisian (the Founder and Chairperson of Orran NGO and Founder of Junior Achievement of Armenia); * Sonya Hovsepyan (Chief Project Expert at the National Center for Legislative Regulations, Government of the RA); * Serob Khachatryan (Lecturer at Chair of History of Philosophy of Yerevan State University).

A. Milne's Mr. Pim Passes By Mr. Pim Passes By is a play by A. A. Milne. First performed December 1, 1919, at the Gaiety Theatre, Manchester, it opened at the New Theatre in London January 5‚Äì30, 1920, and transferred to the Garrick Theatre (February 2 ‚Äì April 24, 1920) and the Playhouse Theatre (April 25 ‚Äì July 31, 1920), for a total of 246 performances. The Theatre Guild's Broadway production opened February 28, 1921, at the Garrick Theatre in New York City.  Plot  Punch illustration of Dion Boucicault (Carraway Pim) and Irene Vanbrugh (Olivia) in the 1920 London production of Mr. Pim Passes By The play takes place at the Marden house in Buckinghamshire, whose inhabitants include George Marden, Olivia Marden (his wife), Dinah (their niece), Lady Marden (George's Aunt), Brian Strange (Dinah's fiancee), and Anne (their maid). = Act I = The title character, Mr. Carraway Pim, arrives at the Marden house to deliver a letter of introduction for George and is received first by Anne, then by Dinah, who tells Mr. Pim about her life (including her engagement the night before) and the lives of her uncle George and aunt Olivia. Brian enters and converses with Dinah about his attempts to tell her uncle about their engagement. Olivia enters, having overheard part of the conversation, and is delighted to learn of the engagement. She offers to help break the news to her husband. George enters, seeking out Mr. Pim, who has since left; Olivia pushes the young couple to tell George of their engagement. While Olivia is optimistic about their future, George is heavily set against it, citing Brian's young, slow career as a \\"futuristic\\" artist as evidence that he and Dinah will be unable to support each other. George and Brian continue to clash on Brian's career, and George's views on marriage and politics before Olivia sends Brian and Dinah out for a walk. While they are out, Olivia tries to convince George of his hypocrisy and pessimism by questioning him on the motives behind their marriage, as well as their financial well-being. George stumbles and struggles to find answers for her questions while still justifying his decision regarding Brian and Dinah, while also becoming more and more impatient and uncomfortable with the black-and-orange curtains Olivia is sewing and planning to hang up. Olivia reminds George of the first man she fell in love with, and how her father had arranged for her to marry someone else, which resulted in a miserable marriage until her husband died. After George leaves, Brian and Dinah come back. Olivia tells them that she thinks George will be fine with their marriage, though George hasn't made much progress in accepting them. Olivia also reminds them that Lady Marden is coming for lunch, after which Mr. Pim returns. George returns to receive him. While talking to George and Olivia, Mr. Pim tells them that he had just returned from a trip to Australia, and while on his way back, he'd seen a man whom he presumed to be deceased. Mr. Pim tells them the man's name was Telworthy, which was the name of Olivia's first husband, who had also lived (and was presumed to have died) in Australia. Before George and Olivia can process this, Lady Marden is announced to have arrived by Anne. = Act II = Olivia, Lady Marden, Dinah, George, and Brian prepare to have lunch on their terrace, as Anne follows with their coffee. Brian and Dinah retreat back indoors, where they again speak of their concerns regarding their marriage and George. Not long after, Olivia, George, and Lady Marden return inside. Olivia asks Dinah to show Lady Marden \\"the pigs\\" (which George keeps as pets) and they are joined by Brian. Alone at last, Olivia and George begin to tentatively discuss the news Mr. Pim had brought them in Act I. At first, George is in denial about the entire revelation, but Olivia reminds him that her late husband was the only Telworthy in Australia, so it must have been true. George then laments over having married Olivia while she was still another's wife, and expresses his desire to get their marriage annulled for the sake of the Law and their publicity. Olivia reacts to this with some sadness and disbelief. She reminds him that they were happy together, and that she was happy to be away from her first husband. When George holds his position on the annulment, she begins to talk about going back to live with her first husband, which begins to make George angry and jealous. He tells her he doesn't want to send her away, but that he still feels as if he should because it is the right thing to do. They eventually decide to send for Mr. Pim again, as well as consult with Lady Marden. Dinah returns for a brief moment before being sent by George to fetch Lady Marden and Brian, who are still outside. Before they all return, George is conflicted about whether to tell Dinah and Brian about Olivia's situation, but Olivia tells him that they should know. Upon hearing the news, Lady Marden is shocked, and refers to Olivia as a \\"bigamist,\\" while Brian argues that George should fight for Olivia and prevent her from going back to her miserable marriage. Despite this, Lady Marden agrees that the marriage should be annulled, to the disgust of Brian, which causes him to land in another argument with George over morals and marriage before being sent out for another walk with Dinah. George again laments over his confusion; he understands that Olivia does not want to go back to her first husband, but he wants to do the right thing in the eyes of the Law and the public. Olivia finally resigns and laments over George, the man she \\"didn't quite marry\\" in a last-chance-attempt to get him to fight for her. Mr. Pim is then announced by Anne. Mr. Pim joins Lady Marden, George, and Olivia, who question him about Mr. Telworthy again. After confirming it was him whom Mr. Pim spoke of, they tell him of the situation regarding George's and Olivia's marriage, and ask Mr. Pim where Mr. Telworthy might be. Mr. Pim tells them that after seeing him a few days before, Mr. Telworthy had died in Marseilles by choking on a fish- bone, to which Olivia jumps up in surprise and joy. = Act III = Olivia and George marvel over this new revelation, while Mr. Pim laments on having delivered such shocking news to the same family twice in one day. George hastily shows a still apologetic Mr. Pim out, after which he expresses his relief and joy over Olivia's first husband still having died. Olivia puts a damper on the celebration, however, when she reminds George that she was still technically married to her first husband up until a few days ago, when he was said to have perished by Mr. Pim. George, however, has changed his attitude of anxiousness to one of optimism, remarking to Olivia that they can just remarry quietly at the registry office in London the following day. Olivia, deciding to have a bit of fun, suggests that George ought to propose to her again if he wishes to marry her again. The two approach each other and become engaged while putting on the shy, cheeky demeanor of a new young couple. Olivia further taunts George by inquiring whether he can afford to support a wife, and whether he is thinking about their future, as \\"love may seem to be all that matters\\" with a new engagement. George grows impatient, realizing that Olivia is using the situation to change his mind on Brian and Dinah's engagement. After arguing about whether Olivia will accept George's proposal, or whether she'd stay in his house should she refuse it, George storms off in anger. Mr. Pim uses this opportunity to return - this time, by the window - hoping to leave before George returns out of fear. He tells Olivia that he got the name wrong since the beginning - the man whom he had known from Australia, whom he had met on his way back, and whom had died from choking on a fish-bone was named Pelwittle, not Telworthy as he had led everyone to believe. He explains to Olivia how Dinah that told him of Olivia and her previous marriage to Telworthy and her residence in Australia with him, which had led to his mixing up the two names. Olivia confirms that Mr. Telworthy had indeed died before she'd married George, and while she thanks Mr. Pim - who is apologizing yet again for the mix-up - Dinah and Brian come in. They're delighted to see Mr. Pim again, and are oblivious to the conversation which had just taken place. Olivia sends them to see Mr. Pim out, who is anxious to leave before George returns and sees him. Brian stays behind momentarily to tell Olivia that he is \\"on her side\\" about the annulment situation, after which Olivia reveals to him her conversation with Mr. Pim. Before he can say anything more, she sends him off when she hears George returning. George enters humming, appearing to have calmed down a bit. He observes the room and its decor, as well as the curtains Olivia is working on, which he had detested at the beginning of the play. To Olivia's surprise, George (who is established to be very old-fashioned) remarks that they should perhaps consider redecorating the room, to brighten it up a bit, and commends Olivia's curtains. It's revealed that he wishes to take Olivia to London to be married again from his suggesting that they buy new carpet and furnishings to match the curtains. Olivia tells George that she told Brian and Dinah that Mr. Pim had made a mistake with the name (without telling George that the mistake actually happened) so that Brian and Dinah think that Olivia and George had been truly married the whole time. George, not realizing that the mistake was real, asked Olivia if she was actually considering marrying him again, quietly. Coyly, Olivia tells him yes, which greatly pleases George; he proceeds to shower Olivia with affection and offers to buy her whatever new furnishings she should want in London the following day. They embrace, during which Brian and Dinah re-enter and remark on Mr. Pim's big mistake. George, still believing that the \\"mistake\\" was a lie, plays along with them, to the enjoyment of Olivia. George invites Brian to look at the pigs, while Olivia and Dinah converse about Olivia's upcoming trip to London with George; Dinah thinks they are going strictly for shopping. Olivia attempts to hang up her curtains, but realizes she needs George's help. Dinah calls for him, and he returns with Brian, who happily tells Dinah that George has agreed to their marriage after all. As they share in celebration, George steps back to regard Olivia's new curtains, now seeming to have adopted a new appreciation for them. As the four of them sit in the room, Mr. Pim again returns, this time to tell them that he got the first name of the Pelwittle man wrong - though he originally told them it was Henry Pelwittle, his name was actually Ernest Pelwittle.  Characters  = George Marden, J.P. = George Marden is the husband of Olivia Marden, the uncle of Dinah, and the nephew of Lady Marden. He is extremely old- fashioned, and is noted as saying \\"what was good enough for his great-great- grandfather is good enough for him.\\" He is a man of 40-odd years, and though firm in his ways, is still a loving and caring man, as evidenced by his love and concern for his wife and niece. Despite this, he is stubbornly set against his niece marrying the man she loves, who happens to be a new, \\"futuristic\\" artist. George disapproves of his paintings and his politics, which he uses to justify his decision regarding his niece's marriage. He also detests his wife Olivia's new curtains, as they too are \\"futuristic\\" and do not match the rest of the house. However, by the end of the play, he appears to take on a new attitude towards his love of old-fashioned things. = Olivia Marden = Olivia Marden is the wife of George Marden and the aunt of Dinah. In the play, it is revealed that her first husband was a convict and that her marriage to him was miserable. She left him in Australia and, upon hearing of his death, married George Marden, with whom she is much happier. While George is old- fashioned, Olivia is much more open-minded toward new things, and strives to \\"update\\" George in his ways. Throughout the play, she is shown working on a new set of curtains to hang up, which are orange and black. Upon hearing Mr. Pim's news, she fears that she will have to go back to her first husband, as she is still his wife. However, subsequent visits from Mr. Pim assuage her fears as she learns her first husband was dead all along. However, she withholds her knowledge of her first husbands whereabouts in Act III from George, so that they can remarry in London (and apparently rekindle their love for each other), which brings about a change in George's attitude. = Dinah = Dinah is the niece of George and Olivia. She is a bright, chipper young girl who is love with Brian, despite her uncle's disapproval. She is close to Olivia, and, while she loves George, they clash from time to time. It is not known what happened to her parents; she's been the ward of her uncle and aunt for a while. After Anne, she is the first to receive Mr. Pim upon his arrival, and seems very interested in him; she tells him her life story, and expresses the desire to know his. = Lady Marden = Lady Marden is the aunt of George Marden. Often referred to as \\"Aunt Juli-ah\\" throughout the play, she appears to be a very tough, steadfast woman of about sixty. She dresses in pants, which is not traditional for a woman of that time, and is described as looking as if she were \\"always out beagling.\\" She carries riding gloves and a whip. Upon hearing of Olivia's first husband still being alive, she is greatly shocked, and refers to Olivia as a \\"bigamist,\\" before agreeing with George regarding the decision to have their marriage annulled. = Brian Strange = Brian Strange is the fiancee of Dinah. He is an artist who paints the abstract or cubist style which was becoming popular during the 1920s, to the disapproval of George Marden. He appears to have the same demeanor as Dinah, and remains optimistic that George will eventually approve of their marriage. George, however, thinks that Brian will not be able to provide for Dinah, as he hasn't sold a painting in a while. His opinions on politics, morals, and marriage are continuously opposed and dismissed by George throughout the play. = Mr. Carraway Pim = Mr. Pim first enters the play upon the premise of delivering a letter of introduction to George. Throughout the play, he becomes turned around and confused, and ultimately \\"passes by\\" the Marden house several times. With each pass, excluding the first one, he delivers news on Olivia's first husband, Jacob Telworthy, who was thought to have died years before the play took place. He seems old, and gets confused very easily; when Dinah first talks to him at the beginning of the play, he mistakes what she told him about her family for what actually happened to him. He eventually realizes his errors, and attempts to apologize to the Mardens. He is thought to be similar to the character of Mr. Magoo. = Anne = Anne is the maid of the Marden family. She is the first one to receive Mr. Pim, announces his subsequent arrivals, and announces the arrival of Lady Marden as well. In contrast to the rest of the characters, she is the only one thought of as having a \\"clear-head,\\" as the rest of them are very eccentric and excitable.

The belief is that if a wife is devoted to her husband and protects him, then he will prosper and will bring good fortune to her and their family. If not, then there might be misfortune and death. A pativrata listens to her husband and acts accordingly. A pativrata protects her husband in two ways. Firstly, she attends to his personal needs and encourages him to do his duty (dharma). Secondly, she undertakes various rituals and fasts to please the deities, hoping that the Gods will protect her husband from harm and grant him a long life.Sati, the Blessing and the Curse: The Burning of Wives in India, by John Stratton Hawley Sati is often used as a synonym for a pativrata -one who preserves her purity (sattva)- physically, mentally and emotionally.

Produced by Shashi Sumeet Productions, the series starred Rhea Sharma and Avinesh Rekhi. It is the sequel to Diya Aur Baati Hum. Neelu Vaghela, Ashok Lokhande, Kanika Maheshwari, Urmila Sharma and Rishina Kandhari reprised their roles from Diya Aur Baati Hum. It was originally broadcast in the afternoon during the network's Star Dopaher (afternoon) programming block. On 24 July 2017, the series was moved to prime time replacing Saath Nibhaana Saathiya. The series premiered on 3 April 2017 and ended on 1 June 2018 as it could not deliver the expected ratings. Plot The series takes place twenty years after the events in Diya Aur Baati Hum and it revolves around the children of Sooraj and Sandhya, mainly focusing on their daughter, Kanak. Her grandmother, Santosh who initially hates her, thinking her to be the reason behind her parents' death, later accepts her upon realising her love for Kanak. Kanak's life takes a new turn when Uma Shankar Toshniwal, a rich, kind- hearted but superstitious man and an Ayurveda doctor by profession, forcefully marries her, believing that as a sign from Lord Shiva. Uma is a blind believer in morals taught by his greedy and hypocrite maternal aunt. Kanak sets off on a journey with Uma to teach him the greatest moral of life ‚Äì humanity ‚Äì while she is criticized by Palomi and repeatedly harmed by Nanda and later, her lewd son Aditya. In the process, Kanak falls in love with Uma after establishing herself as the perfect wife for him. Soon, Uma and Kanak expose Nanda and Aditya. Soon, Uma, for some unknown reason, marries Meera Mittal, the deranged daughter of a rich businessman, ditching Kanak. =Two years later= Kanak is now self-sufficient and possessing a bitter hatred towards Uma, eventually reappears in his life, who has become a successful business tycoon running the 'K & U' company in the meantime. It is revealed later on that Uma still loves Kanak and was actually blackmailed and forced into marrying Meera to save his younger cousin Suman from receiving punishment for a murder she had inadvertently committed. Meera upon knowing Kanak's identity, alongside with Aditya tries many heinous ways to separate the duo, including an unsuccessful attempt to marry off Kanak to Akshay also was hell-bent on ruining her. Suman is now full of guilt and decides to sacrifice her life so that Uma and Kanak can re-unite. They manage to save her and the truth is finally unveiled before Kanak. She gets rid of her ill-feelings towards Uma and gets Meera arrested with the help of others by hatching a crafty plan. Aditya realises his mistake and has a change of heart, becoming loyal to his brother. Kanak and Uma settle their differences and restore their relationship. It is then that Nanda comes out of jail. After Saras suffering an unfortunate miscarriage on account of failing to reach the medical facility on time, and seeing Uma's grief over the matter, Kanak and Aditya launch a bike ambulance service. This creates a number of enemies for Uma and Kanak from the very outset, and Dr. Parag, the corrupt Dean of Pratistha Medical College, joins hands with Nanda to cancel Uma's license so that he can use the idea to promote his own medical college and take the credit totally upon himself. Kanak decides to study paramedics and become a doctor herself to save the license from being cancelled and so that no one can label her as an amateur when she treats patients. After facing numerous hurdles and hindrances in Dr. Parag's college set by the Dean himself in order to crush her dream, she finally succeeds in revealing Dr. Parag's true nature in front of the public and manages to get him behind bars. It is revealed at this point that Nanda was ill-treated by Dr. Parag while in jail, and she was planning for revenge ever since she got out of jail. She afterwards stops plotting against Uma and Kanak. Uma at this time receives a fake call and is attacked by goons, who also trash his bike ambulance. He recovers a few months later, but loses his memory; to everyone's surprise, he turns into the same superstitious person he was before. He urges Kanak to either choose him or pursue her paramedics course. Kanak ultimately chooses to continue her dream of becoming a doctor. Uma supports her decision, and Aditya then reveals that it was Uma's plan all along to infuse some confidence and passion into Kanak, which she was lacking hitherto, and also that he had never lost his memory. With this, the story finally ends on a happy note as Kanak sets off for her new career with the blessings of all the elders.

Michael Roth (18 June 1936 ‚Äì 23 July 2019)http://micialmedia.de/2019/07/nachruf-fuer- papa/ was a German engineer and professor of automation, specializing in microprocessor technology, computer science and sociology as well as philosophy of science. He was one of the pioneers in the area of computer engineering in Germany.  Life  Roth was born in Lomniƒçka, and originally completed his vocational training as a mechanic for agricultural machinery and as a programmer. He started his university studies in 1957 at the then Hochschule fuer Elektrotechnik Ilmenau in electrical engineering, with a specialization in control engineering under Karl Reinisch. He received his academic degree as a Diplom-Ingenieur (Dipl.-Ing.) in 1963. After that, he worked at the institute for computer engineering (\\"maschinelle Rechentechnik\\") as a scientific assistant. He successfully completed this work in 1967 earning a Doctorate degree as a Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing.). His dissertation was in the domain of computer engineering, focussing on the design of hybrid computers. This constituted an essential foundation for his later research. Subsequently, he finished additional studies at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute in 1967/68. Roth was appointed Associate Professor at the TH Ilmenau in 1970, in the department Technical and Biomedical Cybernetics (\\"Technische und Biomedizinische Kybernetik\\", TBK, Director: Karl Reinisch). In cooperation with expert committees from the Chamber of Technology (\\"Kammer der Technik\\", KdT, the organization of engineers, technicians and researchers of the GDR) and the electronics industry of Thuringia, he developed the new special field of microcomputer technology, which he also introduced as an independent subject, publishing specialized reference books in several editions. Roth stimulated the launch of this technology not only through his research and development work, but also through his involvement in continuous education for this industrial technology as well as through the publication of specialized books. As a researcher, he focused on questions concerning the development of components and tools for intelligent automation systems. In 1978, he was appointed Professor for Automation and Technical Cybernetics (\\"Automatik und Technische Kybernetik\\") at the TH Ilmenau. This appointment spoke highly of his knowledge and his wealth of experience. His lectures and his textbooks extended the training of engineers with degrees in microprocessor technology ‚Äì at the time, microprocessor technology was a rare specialization in the German-speaking area. His cooperation with other professors ‚Äì one of them being in the data centre with its director, Reinhold Sch√∂nefeldReinhold Sch√∂nefeld, Werner Liebich u. a.: Jubil√§um: 30 Jahre Rechenzentrum und Informatik an der TH Ilmenau (Festkolloquium am 29. Nov. 1991). In: Ilmenauer Hochschulblatt. Zeitung der Technischen Hochschule Ilmenau, Jg. 34/16/1991. ‚Äì led to extensive industry-level research and internship opportunities in microprocessor technology with the TH Ilmenau. These opportunities were considered unique when compared to other university facilities in the German- speaking area. Roth thus contributed to establishing research and development at the department of Technical and Biomedical Cybernetics, and made it thrive. In parallel, he worked on the technology transfer to the surrounding computer businesses. During his professional activities, Roth developed various microcontroller applications and implementations. Through this, he gained experience with programming languages, the usage of the accompanying development tools as well as the hardware and software components. Systems for visualization were used to efficiently communicate between man and machine. Further work on real-life applications and objects for demonstration purposes extended his knowledge and experience in the area of programming. He also gained a sound skill level in the area of data communication and the related subdomains. By no means had Roth ever considered this field as being technologically finalized. As such, he continuously worked in close contact with industry and research partners to scientifically advance future development. Through his committee work in the Informatics Society of the GDR and specific publications of books and magazines he contributed to an increased appreciation of the new field of microprocessor technology in East Germany. Furthermore, since his early years, Roth had been interested in a higher-level view of the evolution of science. In 1986, he completed his Habilitation at the TU Dresden in the field of the philosophy of science.  Scientific roles  Roth started as the research area lead of the aforementioned department TBK; he then became its director. On the basis of his specialized research work, he became a co-founder of the specialized studies ‚ÄûComputer engineering‚Äú. In addition to that, he was the founder of the postgraduate degree of an engineer with specialization ‚ÄûMicroprocessor technology‚Äú. Roth was the founder and editor of the magazine ‚ÄûMikroprozessortechnik‚Äú at the East German publishing company Verlag Technik Berlin. In an evening talk at a technical committee conference of the Chamber of Technology (KdT) in Angelroda in April 1982, he described the tedious processes for founding this magazine under the conditions in the GDR: For 15 years he made efforts until a small number of copies of ‚ÄûMikroprozessortechnik‚Äú was allowed to be released. It was forbidden to use the word ‚ÄûInformatik‚Äú, as G√ºnter Mittag, member of the Politb√ºro of the SED considered this a term of West German ideology. The argument of a limited quota of paper available to the publisher had to be overcome as well as the criticism that the publishing company VEB Verlag Technik had not published a new magazine for 28 years. His work as co-founder of the magazine Ethics and Social Sciences (\\"Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften\\", a forum for a culture of deliberation) at the West German publishing company Westdeutscher Verlag illustrates his ability for unconventional thinking and his interest in questions concerning the future.Michael Roth: Pro Zukunft. Internationale Bibliothek f√ºr Zukunftsfragen ‚Äì Robert-Jungk-Stiftung. In: Ilmenauer Uni- Nachrichten 36/7/1993, S. 7. For many years, Roth was the chair of the Thuringia subdivision of the Verband Hochschule und Wissenschaft (Association for Higher Education and Science, VHW) in the German Civil Service Federation, as well as a member of the federal board of the VHW in Bonn (chair at the time: Reinhard Kuhnert). This professional association of professors, university lecturers and scientific assistants at universities and institutes of higher education had been founded in November 1990 in Thuringia to engage employees and civil servants, where the VHW as part of the German Civil Service Federation also has the right of hearing in legislative procedures and the collective bargaining law.Michael Roth: vhw-informationen: Schwerpunktthemen des Interessen- und Berufsverbandes. In: Ilmenauer Uni- Nachrichten 36/3/1993, S. 7. Roth contributed as an expert in the advisory panel ‚ÄûDelphi-Prognose‚Äú of the Fraunhofer Society.  Fields  Michael Roth worked in a wide variety of fields: * Automation Technology * Technical Cybernetics * Computer Engineering * Computer Science and Sociology * Information Society * Knowledge Economy * Evolution of Society as well as * Universities and higher education institutions. Roth gave numerous lectures about his research results at scientific conferences and events, whose realization he partially encouraged and organized himself. His scientific publications at the same time reflect his teamwork and consist of more than 100 pieces of work, including several books with up to 5 editions. In parallel, he participated in various reports, providing expert opinion.  Bibliography (selection)  * Verwendung nichtlinearer Strukturen in steuerbaren Hochgeschwindigkeits-Operationsverst√§rkern.

It has been in the collection of the National Gallery of Art since 1963. Cassatt painted The Boating Party during the winter of 18931894 in Antibes, on the French Riviera. Cassatt spent January and February 1894 at the Villa \\"La Cigaronne,\\" in Cap d'Antibes with her mother. Cassatt was 49 years old when she painted The Boating Party. 1893 had been a successful year for her: she had completed the mural Modern Woman, commissioned for the Woman's Building at Chicago's 1893 World's Columbian Exposition; her exhibition in 1893 at Durand- Ruel's gallery had been well received (footnote: the exhibition contained 98 items.); and the French state had decided to purchase one of her paintings for the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. Description The Boating Party depicts an unknown woman, baby, and man in a sailboat. The boat has a canoe stern, is boomless, and has three thwarts. The inside of the boat is described as yellow. It is an unusual painting in Cassatt's ≈ìuvre. While it does show her familiar theme of a mother and child, most of her other paintings are set in interiors or in gardens. It is also one of her largest oil paintings. Influences = Japanese woodblock prints = In 1890 Cassatt visited the great Japanese Print exhibition at the ecole de Beaux-arts in Paris. Mary Cassatt owned Japanese prints by Kitagawa Utamaro (1753‚Äì1806). The exhibition at Durand-Ruel of Japanese art proved the most important influence on Cassatt. =Manet= Frederick A. Sweet suggests that Cassatt may have been inspired by √âdouard Manet's Boating from 1874.Sweet gives 1879 as the date for the Manet. Quote: The idea was perhaps suggested by Manet's \\"In the boat,\\" of 1879, although the composition is an entirely different.Boating, 1874, Edouard ManetBoating was exhibited at the (fourth?) Impressionist Exhibition of 1879, where it was not well received. Cassatt however, convinced her friend Louisine Havemeyer to buy it. Much of the work from the Havemeyer collection was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum, but some works were left to the Havemeyer children and have since ended up elsewhere. Analysis Art historian and museum administrator Frederick A. Sweet calls it \\"One of the most ambitious paintings she ever attempted\\". His 1966 analysis focusses on the balance of the \\"powerful dark silhouette of the boatman\\", the angle between the oar and the arm that \\"thrusts powerfully into the centre of the composition towards the mother and child\\" and \\"delicate, feminine ones\\". Cassatt placed the horizon at the top of the frame in Japanese fashion. Legacy In 1966, the painting appeared on a US postage stamp.

Sired by the leading stallion Bold Ruler, and out of a Mahmoud mare Grey Flight, he excelled on the track and in his stud career. Like his sire, he would go on to become a leading North American stallion; producing Eclipse Award winners and Kentucky Derby winners. Race career What A Pleasure, trained by Edward Neloy, would peak as a juvenile winning the National Stallion Stakes in the summer of his two-year-old season. In August of that same year he would run second in the Monmouth Park Sapling Stakes in preparation for the Hopeful Stakes later in that same month. He would win this showing and it is considered his best performance. What A Pleasure would go on to race as a three-year-old and ran a decent third in the Gotham Stakes, but he never regained his two-year-old form. Richard Ulbrich of 'Peerage of Racehorses' claims the colt had wrenched his hip after his victory in the Hopeful and this may have dampened his form as a three-year-old. He was retired to stud in 1969 at Florida's Waldemar Farms. Stud career As a sire, What A Pleasure would be the leading sire consecutively in 1975 and 1976 by producing horses like Derby winner Foolish Pleasure, Eclipse Two-Year-Old Colt Honest Pleasure, Gr.1 winner For the Moment, Gr.1 winner Fairway Phantom, and the extensive stakes winner Gene's Lady. Out of four hundred and ninety-eight foals over ten percent were stakes winners. What A Pleasure stood in Florida until his death in March 1983 from a heart attack. Pedigree ¬ß What a Pleasure Native Dancer is shown as descending from (family 5-f), which traces back to the Bazajet Mare. However, the female descendants of his third-dam La Chica have a type of mitochondrial DNA that is inconsistent with other descendants of this family. As mitochondrial DNA is passed exclusively in the female line, this indicates a pedigree error occurred at some point between the Bazajet Mare's foaling in 1754 and La Chica's in 1930. What a Pleasure was inbred 4S x 3D to Blenheim, meaning this stallion appears in the fourth generation of the sire's side of his pedigree and in the third generation of the dam's side. What a Pleasure is also inbred 4S x 4D to Mumtaz Mahal.

With a height of above sea level it is the second highest mountain of the B√ºkk and the sixth highest of Hungary. Before 2014 it was considered to be the highest point of the area, but according to recent surveys Szilv√°si-k≈ë is meters tall. It is easily accessible from Szilv√°sv√°rad on a few hundred meters long tourist path, which leads to a cave in the mountain. Ist√°ll√≥s-k≈ë cave The cave was first explored by P√°l Rosk√≥ in 1911. It is a rich archaeological site with 30,000-40,000 year old finds including cave bear and Bison latifrons bones and tusks, stone and bone tools and a Paleolithic hearth now displayed in the Hungarian National Museum. The site was later excavated by Ottok√°r Kadiƒá in 1929 and M√°ria Mottl in 1938; its planned and detailed excavation started in 1947 and was led by L√°szl√≥ V√©rtes. Based on fill stratification and animal remains used as period indicators, the archaeologists explored the cave's history, and determined the age of the three cultural layers and the characteristics of the human population(s) that lived there. The cave gained protected status in 1944 and specially protected status in 1982. The newest excavations started in 2000 and were led by √Årp√°d Ringer. The importance of the cave lies in the findings of 66 different Ice Age species, which makes its fauna the richest among Aurignacian faunas in Europe; three new mammal species and twenty new bird species were described based on its microfauna.

It was first released as an alpha quality developer preview in March 2017 and released to the public on August 21, 2017. It contains a number of major features, including notification grouping, picture-in-picture support for video, performance improvements and battery usage optimization, and support for autofillers, Bluetooth 5, system-level integration with VoIP apps, wide color gamuts, and Wi-Fi Aware. Android Oreo also introduces two major platform features: Android Go ‚Äì a software distribution of the operating system for low-end devices ‚Äì and support for implementing a hardware abstraction layer. , 17.13% of Android devices run Oreo, with 6.17% on Android 8.0 (API 26) and 10.96% using Android 8.1 (API 27). Android 8.1 is behind Android 10, by now the third still popular version.  History  Android Oreo 8.0 logo Android Oreo was internally codenamed \\"Oatmeal Cookie.\\" On March 21, 2017, Google released the first developer preview of Android \\"O\\", available for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel C, and both Pixel smartphones. The second, considered beta quality, was released on May 17, 2017. The third developer preview was released on June 8, 2017 and offered a finalized version of the API. DP3 finalized the release's API to API level 26, changed the camera UI, reverted the Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity levels in the status bar back to Wi-Fi being on the left, added themed notifications, added a battery animation in Settings: Battery, a new icon and darker background for the Clock app, and a teardrop icon shape for apps. On July 24, 2017, a fourth developer preview was released which included the final system behaviors and the latest bug fixes and optimizations. Android \\"O\\" was officially released on August 21, 2017 under the name \\"Oreo\\". Its lawn statue was unveiled at a promotional event across from Chelsea Market in New York City‚Äîa building which formerly housed a Nabisco factory where Oreo cookies were first produced. Factory images were made available for compatible Pixel and Nexus devices later that day. The Sony Xperia XZ1 and Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact were the first devices available with Oreo pre-installed. Android 8.1 was released in December 2017 for Pixel and Nexus devices, which features minor bug fixes and user interface changes.  Features  = User experience = Notifications can be snoozed, and batched into topic-based groups known as \\"channels\\". The 'Major Ongoing' feature orders the alerts by priority, pinning the most important application to the top slot. Android Oreo contains integrated support for picture-in- picture modes (supported in the YouTube app for YouTube Premium subscribers). The \\"Settings\\" app features a new design, with a white theme and deeper categorization of different settings, while its ringtone, alarm and notification sound settings now contain an option for adding custom sounds to the list. The Android 8.1 update supports the display of battery percentages for connected Bluetooth devices, makes the notification shade slightly translucent, and dims the on-screen navigation keys in order to reduce the possibility of burn-in. = Platform = Android Oreo adds support for Neighborhood Aware Networking (NAN) for Wi-Fi based on Wi-Fi Aware, Bluetooth 5, wide color gamuts in apps, an API for autofillers, multiprocess and Google Browsing support for WebViews, an API to allow system-level integration for VoIP apps, and launching activities on remote displays. Android Runtime (ART) features performance improvements. Android Oreo contains additional limits on apps' background activities in order to improve battery life. Apps can specify \\"adaptive icons\\" for differently-shaped containers specified by themes, such as circles, squares, and squircles. Android Oreo adds native support for Advanced Audio Coding, aptX, aptX HD and LDAC Bluetooth codecs. Android Oreo supports new emoji that were included in the Unicode 10 standard. A new emoji font was also introduced, which notably redesigns its face figures to use a traditional circular shape, as opposed to the \\"blob\\" design that was introduced on KitKat. The underlying architecture of Android was revised so that low-level, vendor-specific code for supporting a device's hardware can be separated from the Android OS framework using a hardware abstraction layer known as the \\"vendor interface\\". Vendor interfaces must be made forward compatible with future versions of Android. This new architecture, called Project Treble, allows the quicker development and deployment of Android updates for devices, as vendors would only need to make the necessary modifications to their bundled software. All devices shipping with Oreo must support a vendor interface, but this feature is optional for devices being updated to Oreo from an earlier version. The \\"seamless updates\\" system introduced in Android 7.0 was also modified to download update files directly to the system partition, rather than requiring them to be downloaded to the user partition first. This reduces storage space requirements for system updates. Android Oreo introduces a new automatic repair system known as \\"Rescue Party\\"; if the operating system detects that core system components are persistently crashing during startup, it will automatically perform a series of escalating repair steps. If all automatic repair steps are exhausted, the device will reboot into recovery mode and offer to perform a factory reset. The Android 8.1 update also introduces a neural network API, which is designed to \\"[provide] apps with hardware acceleration for on-device machine learning operations.\\" This API is designed for use with machine learning platforms such as TensorFlow Lite, and specialized co-processors such as the Pixel Visual Core (featured in Google's Pixel 2 smartphones, but dormant until 8.1 is installed), but it also provides a CPU fallback mode. = Android Go = A tailored distribution for low-end devices known as Android Go was unveiled for Oreo; it is intended for devices with 1 GB of RAM or less. This mode has platform optimizations designed to reduce mobile data usage (including enabling Data Saver mode by default), and a special suite of Google Mobile Services designed to be less resource- and bandwidth-intensive. The Google Play Store would also highlight lightweight apps suited for these devices. The operating system's interface is also modified, with the quick settings panel providing greater prominence to information regarding the battery, mobile data limit, and available storage, the recent apps menu using a modified layout and being limited to four apps (in order to reduce RAM consumption), and an API for allowing mobile carriers to implement data tracking and top-ups within the Android settings menu. Google Play Services was also modularized to reduce its memory footprint. Android Go was made available to OEMs for Android 8.1. = Security = Android Oreo re-brands automatic scanning of Google Play Store and sideloaded apps as \\"Google Play Protect\\", and gives the feature, as well as Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) higher prominence in the Security menu of the Settings app. As opposed to a single, system-wide setting for enabling the installation of apps from sources outside of the Google Play Store, this function is now implemented as a permission that can be granted to individual apps (i.e. clients for third-party app repositories such as Amazon Appstore and F-Droid). A verified boot now includes a \\"Rollback Protection\\" feature, which enforces a restriction on rolling back the device to a previous version of Android, aimed at preventing a potential thief from bypassing security measures by installing a previous version of the operating system that doesn't have them in place.

Collective cell migration is an essential process in the lives of multicellular organisms, e.g. embryonic development, wound healing and cancer spreading (metastasis). Cells can migrate as a cohesive group (e.g. epithelial cells) or have transient cell-cell adhesion sites (e.g. mesenchymal cells). They can also migrate in different modes like sheets, strands, tubes, and clusters. While single-cell migration has been extensively studied, collective cell migration is a relatively new field with applications in preventing birth defects or dysfunction of embryos. It may improve cancer treatment by enabling doctors to prevent tumors from spreading and forming new tumors.  Cell-environment interactions  The environment of the migrating cell can affect its speed, persistence and direction of migration by stimulating it. The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides not only the structural and biochemical support, but also plays a major role in regulating cell behavior. Different ECM proteins (such as collagen, elastin, fibronectin, laminin, and others) allow cells to adhere and migrate, while forming focal adhesions in the front and disassembling them in the back. Using these adhesion sites, cells also sense the mechanical properties of the ECM. Cells can be guided by a gradient of those proteins (haptotaxis) or a gradient of soluble substrates in the liquid phase surrounding the cell (chemotaxis). Cells sense the substrate through their receptors and migrate toward the concentration (or the opposite direction). Another form of stimulation can be rigidity gradients of the ECM (durotaxis). = Confinement = Collective cell migration is enhanced by geometrical confinement of an extracellular matrix molecule (e.g. the proteoglycan versican in neural crest cells), that acts as a barrier, to promote the emergence of organized migration in separated streams. Confinement is also observed in vivo, where the optimal width is a function of the number of migrating cells in different streams of different species.  Cell-cell communication  Migrating isolated cell responds to cues in its environment and changes its behavior accordingly. As cell-cell communication does not play a major role in this case, similar trajectories are observed in different isolated cells. However, when the cell migrates as part of the collective, it not only responds to its environment but also interacts with other cells through soluble substrates and physical contact. These cell-cell communication mechanisms are the main reasons for the difference between efficient migration of the collective and random walk movements of the isolated cell. Cell-cell communication mechanisms are widely studied experimentally (in vivo and in vitro), and computationally (in silico). = Co-attraction = Co-attraction between collectively migrating cells is the process by which cells of the same type secrete chemo-attractant (e.g. C3a in neural crest cells), that stimulates other cells in the group that have the receptors to that chemo-attractant. Cells sense the secreted substrate and respond to the stimulation by moving towards each other's and maintain high cell density. = Contact inhibition of locomotion = Contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) is a process in which the cell changes its direction of movement after colliding into another cell. Those cells could be of the same cell type or different types. The contacts (cell-junctions) are created by transmembrane glycoproteins named cadherins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin or cadherin 11) and other proteins. After cell-cell contact, the protrusions of cells in the contact direction are inhibited. In the CIL process, cells migrate away from each other by repolarizing in the new direction, so that new protrusions are formed in the front while contractions pull the back from contact. *Contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) is the inhibition of cell division with increasing percent of confluency. CIP and CIL are two different processes, which are sometimes mistakenly interrelated.  Examples of studied systems  Collective cell migration is studied over many model species. Border cells in flies (Drosophila melanogaster): the border cells migrate during the differentiation of egg cells to be ready for fertilization. The lateral line in zebrafish: collective cell migration from head to tails is essential to the development of the sensory system of the fish. The sensors of the lateral line measure the flow over the body-surface of the fish. Wound healing: collective cell migration is an essential part in this healing process, wound area is closed by the migrating cells. Wound healing is commonly studied in vitro using cell lines such as Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells. Neural crest cells in mice, Leghorn chicks, amphibians (Xenopus laevis), and fish (zebrafish): collective migration of neural crest cells occurs during embryo development of vertebrates. They migrate long distances from the head (neural tube) to give rise to different tissues.Le Douarin, Nicole, and Chaya Kalcheim. The neural crest. No. 36. Cambridge University Press, 1999. Spreading of cancer (metastasis): common complication of cancer involve formation of new tumors (secondary tumors), as a result of migration of cancer cells from the primary tumor. Similar to collective cell migration in development and wound healing, cancer cells also undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), that reduces cell-cell adhesions and allows cancer spreading.

As of today, the church is preserved in the Village museum of Chi»ôinƒÉu, Republic of Moldova. The church was erected in 1642 by the people of Hiri»ôeni, and was initially located in the H√Ærjauca Monastery. It was relocated to Hiri»ôeni commune of Telene»ôti District, where it was used until 1928, when a stone church has been erected in the commune. People continued to visit the wooden church as a place for paraklesis near the cemetery. By the beginning of the 21st century, the building was in a very bad state. It had no roof, and the wooden walls were damaged by rain and snow. The Ethnography Museum of Chi»ôinƒÉu started negotiating with the people of Hiri»ôeni on the relocation of the building to the capital city. Eventually, they agreed, and the relocation took place in 2009, when the restoration work started. The restoration project was supervised by architects Eugen B√¢zgu and Sergiu Vornicov, and the work was performed by the same team that restored the wooden church of Palanca (H√Ærjauca commune), CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi District. The restoration team preserved as many original elements as possible, so they used the original woodwork and processed them with special materials to improve the durability. The roof was built from scratch. The church was sanctified in the autumn of 2011, with the patron saint of Assumption of Mary. It is the oldest religious historical monument of the Republic of Moldova, and also the largest wooden church in the country, topping at 27 meters. Varvara BuzilƒÉ, secretary of the Ethnography Museum, stated that the church is the only of its type in the Republic of Moldova at this point of time (2011). She said: \\"The Northern Moldovan style of this church makes her similar to the churches of Bukovina. We do not currently have any other church of this type, that would have a similar height or similarly good proportions.\\". There was once a similar church in Telene»ôti District, but it's been demolished in the 1980s.

He was a leading member of the Evangelical Church in the Rhineland.  Life  Karrenberg was born in Velbert, a manufacturing town a short distance to the east of D√ºsseldorf. He came from an entrepreneurial family. Hugo Karrenberg, his father, owned a factory making barrels and rivets, in which Friedrich served an apprenticeship. He would take over the business when his father died in 1940. Early on he also involved himself in youth movement activities, one effect of which was to awaken an interest in socio-ethical questions. He was particularly influenced by the theology of Karl Barth. In the summer of 1925 Karrenberg enrolled at Frankfurt University where he studied practical economics (\\"Volkswirtschaft\\") and sociology. He emerged with a doctorate in political sciences in 1931His doctoral dissertation was published the next year: \\"Christentum, Kapitalismus und Sozialismus. Darstellung und Kritik der Soziallehre des Protestantismus und Katholizismus in Deutschland seit der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts\\". Berlin : Junker + D√ºnnhaupt, 1932 and returned home to Velbert and worked in his father's business. During the next few years, his focus was on the family business, which he continued to run till his death in 1966. Meanwhile, during the Nazi years he served on the informal \\"fraternal council\\" of the Confessional Church. He embarked on a parallel academic career relatively late in life. In 1954 he produced the Evangelical Social Lexicon (\\"Evangelisches Soziallexikon\\") which grew to become a standard reference work, its ninth edition appearing in 2016. For Karrenberg recognition followed more swiftly, and in 1955 the Theology Faculty at Bonn University awarded him an honorary doctorate for it. In 1961 this was complemented with an honorary doctorate from Cologne University, which came with a newly established teaching chair in Social Ethics. Through his numerous publications and scholarly exchanges with contemporary social scientists he achieved recognition in the field. He was able to examine the interface between social problems and religious-ethical questions in the real-world context of his daily experience managing a mid-sized manufacturing business. Karrenberg was also involved in church politics. He was a member of the regional synod and part of the leadership of the Evangelical Church in the Rhineland. From 1946 he served as chair of the Social Ethical committee of his church (which in May 1966 became its Social Sciences Institute). After intensive discussion, on 23 October 1946 he presented the \\"Wort zum Dienst der Kirche am Volk\\", making clear the belief that \\"supporting love\\" for those afflicted by need was not enough. It was necessary to take on a \\"guardianship role\\" (\\"W√§chteramt\\") regarding *the destitution and confusion in the national life\\" (\\"der Not und Verwirrung des ganzen Volkslebens\\"). Between 1950 and 1961 he chaired the Society and Economy Working Group of the German Evangelical Church Assembly. He also chaired the \\"Social Order chamber\\" (\\"Kammer f√ºr soziale Ordnung\\") Evangelical Church (EKD) and in May 1966 became the first head of the newly launched EKD Social Sciences Institute. Karrenberg's engagement in evangelical church matters was also reflected in the area of public relations. From 1949 till 1959 he served as a member of the original production team for \\"Community Voice\\" (\\"Stimme der Gemeinde\\"), a twice-monthly magazine produced for the post-war Fraternal Council of the Confessional Church. He was also a co-producer of the \\"Journal of Evangelical Ethics\\" (\\"Zeitschrift f√ºr evangelische Ethik\\"). Friedrich Karrenberg died in a Berlin hospital on 28 November 1966, following a heart attack.  Publications  * Christentum, Kapitalismus und Sozialismus.

It is an addendum to the Treaty of Lahore signed one week earlier on 9 March 1846 which gives the terms of surrender of the Sikh Darbar at Lahore to the British. The Sikhs cannot pay part of the demand made by the British; Gulab Singh steps in on their behalf to pay Nanak Shahi Rupess,ruling currency of the time, and in return receives Kashmir Valley, part of the Sikh territories, to add to Jammu and Ladakh already under his rule. Gulab Singh accepts overall British sovereignty. Kashmir Valley is a Muslim majority region speaking the Kashmiri language and a distinct culture called Kashmiriyat. * 1857: The War of independence, The Subcontinent fractured into hundreds of states.  1931‚Äì1940: Political mobilisation  ; 1931 * 1931: The movement against the repressive Maharaja Hari Singh begins. It is brutally suppressed by the State forces. Hari Singh is part of a Hindu Dogra dynasty, ruling over a majority Muslim State. The predominantly Muslim population was kept poor, illiterate and was not adequately represented in the State's services.Prem Nath Bazaz, Struggle for Freedom in Kashmir , New Delhi 1954, pp.140‚Äì166 The Glancy Commission appointed by the Maharaja publishes a report in April 1932, confirming the existence of the grievances of the State's subjects and suggests recommendations providing for adequate representation of Muslims in the State's services; Maharaja accepts these recommendations but delays implementation, leading to another agitation in 1934. Maharaja grants a Constitution providing a Legislative Assembly for the people, but the Assembly turns out to be powerless. The 1931 protest led to the Quit Kashmir movement against the Maharajah in 1946 by the Kashmir leader Sheikh Abdullah, and eventually to the Azad Kashmir movement which gained momentum a year later. ; 1932 * April 1932: Glancy Commission recommends the establishment of a legislative assembly, called the Praja Sabha. It would have 75 members, with 15 official representatives, 33 elected representatives and the remaining seats held by the Maharaja's nominees. Of the 33 elected seats, 21 are reserved for Muslims, 10 for Hindus and 2 for Sikhs. * June 1932: All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference founded by Sheikh Abdullah in collaboration with Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas to fight for the rights of State's Muslims. ; 1934 * September 1934: The first elections for the Praja Sabha (the state's legislative assembly) are held.

Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas and Abdul Majid Qureshi request time to study the proposal. * May 1938: Second elections for the state's Legislative Assembly (Praja Sabha). Sheikh Abdullah campaigns on the platform of renaming the Muslim Conference. The party wins 19 seats, all the contested ones. Two other independent candidates that won are said to have joined the Muslim Conference later. * May 1938: Hindu Progressive Party launched, pledging support to Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity. * June 1938: Sheikh Abdullah introduces the resolution for renaming the Muslim Conference to National Conference in the Working Committee of the party. The resolution carries with fourteen of the twenty members supporting. Four members oppose the resolution: Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas, Abdul Majid Qureshi and Chowdry Sheikh Abdullah Bhati from Jammu and Master Abdul Aziz from Muzaffarabad. ; 1939 * 10‚Äì11 June 1939: Under Sheikh Abdullah's leadership, a special session of the Muslim Conference changes its name to National Conference and throws it open to people of all religions, 175 delegates vote in favour and 3 delegates against.

Referring to British India, it states \\"That geographically contiguous units are demarcated into regions which should be so constituted, with such territorial readjustments as may be necessary, that the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in a majority, as in the North-Western and Eastern zones of India should be grouped to constitute Independent States in which the constituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign\\".

A broadside ironclad, Osmaniye carried a battery of fourteen RML Armstrong guns and ten 36-pounder Armstrongs in a traditional broadside arrangement, with a single RML as a chase gun. Among the more powerful of Ottoman ironclads, the Navy decided to keep the ship out of the action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 to preserve the vessel. She spent the 1880s out of service, though she was heavily rebuilt in the early 1890s and converted into a more modern barbette ship. She was nevertheless in poor condition by the time of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, as a result saw no action, and was disarmed after the war. She remained in the naval inventory until 1923 but saw no further service, and was broken up thereafter.

A supplementary barque rig with three masts was also fitted. The ship was armed with a battery of one rifled muzzle-loading (RML) Armstrong gun and fourteen RML Armstrongs. These were supplemented with ten 36-pounder guns, also manufactured by Armstrong. The 229 mm gun was placed on the upper deck, forward, and the rest of the guns were mounted on each broadside. The ship's wrought iron armored belt was thick, and was capped with thick transverse bulkhead at either end. Above the belt were strakes of armor thick that protected the battery, transverse bulkheads connected the battery armor. Service history =Construction and early career= Osmaniye was ordered from the Robert Napier and Sons shipyard in Glasgow in 1862. Her keel was laid down in March 1863 and she was launched on 2 September 1864, originally under the name Gazi Osman. She began sea trials on 27 June 1865, by which time she had been renamed Osmaniye for Sultan Osman I, and she was commissioned into the Ottoman fleet in November that year. Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to prepare for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. The Russo-Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war, but unlike many of the other, smaller Ottoman ironclads, Osmaniye and her sister ships remained in the Mediterranean Fleet. The Navy feared losing the largest ships of its fleet, and so kept them primarily in port for the duration of the conflict. The wooden warships of the Mediterranean Fleet sortied in April 1877 to patrol the coast of Albania, but Osmaniye and the rest of the ironclads remained in Souda Bay. In January 1878, as Russian forces approached the Ottoman capital through the Balkans, several vessels began transporting a reserve army from Dedeagac to Gelibolu; Osmaniye and the royal yacht joined the operation and carried the last elements of the army on 31 January. =1880s‚Äì1890s: inactivity and reconstruction= Osmaniye after her reconstruction After the conclusion of the war in 1878, Osmaniye was laid up in Constantinople. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended and the ships rarely left the Golden Horn. By 1883, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Osmaniye was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. During this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. In 1884, the 36-pounder guns were removed and a light battery of four quick-firing (QF) Hotchkiss guns and two 4-barreled Nordenfelt guns were added. In 1885‚Äì1886, the navy conducted experiments with converting Krupp breeck-loading fortress guns for use aboard Osmaniye. These were old guns manufactured in the mid-1870s, and the navy attempted to use the gun carriages from the existing muzzle-loading guns or the fortress mountings the Krupp guns had used ashore. After the work was completed in 1886, the ship briefly went to sea to test the guns, one of the only times the ship left the Golden Horn in the 1880s. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . Osmaniye was again refitted at the Imperial Arsenal from 1890 to 1894, the first vessel to receive these updates. The ship's main battery was strengthened by the installation of two Krupp K L/35 guns. The upper deck was cut down forward and aft, where these guns were installed in individual barbettes. The barbettes, which appeared to be standard, heavily- armored mountings, actually consisted of about of wood and a thin plating. The guns themselves were fitted with 25 mm thick gun shields. Eight L/25 Krupp guns and six L/25 Krupp guns were installed on the broadside. The 150 mm guns took the place of the old Krupp guns in the gun battery, though half of the gun ports were plated over, while the 105 mm guns were installed in sponsons in the upper deck. Two of the 47 mm guns were removed and three more Nordenfelt guns were added. During the refit, she also received two vertical triple-expansion engines in place of her original machinery, and six coal- fired Scotch marine boilers replaced the box boilers; the new propulsion system allowed her to steam at a speed of . She was again placed out of service in 1897 in √áanakkale. =Later career= That year, with the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Osmaniye was mobilized into the 1st Squadron. The Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Osmaniye, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy, which possessed the three modern s. Despite the fact that Osmaniye and her sisters had been refit just three years previously, the inspectors discovered that many of the pistons on their Krupp guns were bent, rendering the guns useless. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. On 15 May, Osmaniye took part in a training exercise that only served to highlight the poor training of the crews. With no possibility left to use the fleet in an active way, the Navy withdrew Osmaniye from service and removed her guns. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, particularly the British Admiral Henry Wood and the German Admiral Eugen Kalau vom Hofe, who led the inspection. The fleet proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau- Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed the ships, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work due to its weak finances. Following a lengthy process of negotiations, Krupp received the contract to rebuild Osmaniye on 11 August 1900, along with several other warships. By December 1902, however, Krupp withdrew from the deal, and Osmaniye was ultimately not reconstructed. In 1908, Osmaniye was towed back to Constantinople, where on 31 July 1909 she was decommissioned. She remained in the Navy's inventory until 1923, however, when she was sold to ship breakers.

She was the only member of her class built at the Thames Iron Works, with work lasting from her keel laying in 1863 and her launching in 1864. A broadside ironclad, Mahmudiye carried a battery of fourteen RML Armstrong guns and ten 36-pounder Armstrongs in a traditional broadside arrangement, with a single RML as a chase gun. Among the more powerful of Ottoman ironclads, the Navy decided to keep the ship safely in the Mediterranean Sea during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878 to preserve the vessel. She spent the 1880s out of service, though she was heavily rebuilt in the early 1890s and converted into a more modern barbette ship. She was nevertheless in poor condition by the time of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, as a result saw no action, and was disarmed after the war. She saw no further active service, being used briefly as a barracks ship from 1909 to 1913, when she was sold to ship breakers and dismantled. Design Profile drawing of the Osmaniye class Mahmudiye was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The hull was constructed with iron, incorporated a ram bow, and displaced normally and BOM. She had a crew of 26 officers and 335 enlisted men as completed, but only 250 after 1894. The ship was powered by a single horizontal compound engine which drove one screw propeller. Steam was provided by six coal-fired box boilers that were trunked into a single, retractable funnel amidships. The engine produced a top speed of on sea trials, though by 1891, decades of poor maintenance had reduced the ship's speed to . Mahmudiye carried of coal. A supplementary barque rig with three masts was also fitted. The ship was armed with a battery of one rifled muzzle-loading (RML) Armstrong gun and fourteen RML Armstrongs. These were supplemented with ten 36-pounder guns, also manufactured by Armstrong. The 229 mm gun was placed on the upper deck, forward, and the rest of the guns were mounted on each broadside. The ship's wrought iron armored belt was thick, and was capped with thick transverse bulkhead at either end. Above the belt were strakes of armor thick that protected the battery, transverse bulkheads connected the battery armor. Service history Mahmudiye, named for Sultan Mahmud II, was built by the Thames Iron Works shipyard in Blackwall, London; she was the only member of her class not built at Robert Napier and Sons. The ship's keel was laid down in 1863 and she was launched on 13 December 1864. She was completed for sea trials in 1865 and commissioned into the Ottoman fleet the following year. Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to prepare for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. At the start of 1877, the ship was assigned to the 1st Division of the Mediterranean Fleet, based in Volo, along with the ironclad . The Russo-Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war,but unlike many of the other, smaller Ottoman ironclads, Mahmudiye and her sister ships remained in the Mediterranean Fleet.{{sfnLangensiepen & G√ºlery√ºzpp=5, 194 The Navy feared losing the largest ships of its fleet, and so kept them primarily in port for the duration of the conflict. The wooden warships of the Mediterranean Fleet sortied in April 1877 to patrol the coast of Albania, but Mahmudiye and the rest of the ironclads remained in Souda Bay. After the conclusion of the war in 1878, Mahmudiye was laid up in Constantinople. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Mahmudiye was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. During this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one- third the normal figure. In 1884, the 36-pounder gun were removed and a light battery of four quick-firing (QF) Hotchkiss guns and two 4-barreled Nordenfelt guns were added. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . She was again refitted at the Imperial Arsenal from 1892 to 1894. The nature of the refit is unclear; according to Bernd Langensiepen and Ahmet G√ºlery√ºz, the alterations were extensive. They state that she received two vertical triple-expansion engines in place of her original machinery, and six coal-fired Scotch marine boilers replaced the box boilers; the new propulsion system allowed her to steam at a speed of . Her armament was radically revised; all of the old muzzle-loaders were removed and a battery of new Krupp breech-loading guns were installed. Two Krupp K L/35 guns were added in individual barbettes, one forward and one aft. Eight L/25 Krupp guns and six L/25 Krupp guns were installed on the broadside. Two of the 47 mm guns were removed and three more Nordenfelt guns were added. But Ian Sturton reports less significant alterations, noting that half of the original main battery guns were removed and six sponsons for light guns were added to the upper deck, three per side. He notes that the reconstruction described by Langensiepen and G√ºlery√ºz was only definitively carried out to and , but that \\"details of [Mahmudiyes] reconstruction are obscure.\\" With the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Mahmudiye was mobilized into the 1st Squadron. The Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Mahmudiye, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy, which possessed the three modern s. Despite the fact that Mahmudiye and her sisters had been refit just three years previously, the inspectors discovered that many of the pistons on their Krupp guns were bent, rendering the guns useless. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. With no possibility left to use the fleet in an active way, the Navy withdrew Mahmudiye from service and removed her guns at √áanakkale. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, particularly the British Admiral Henry Wood and the German Admiral Eugen Kalau vom Hofe, who led the inspection. The fleet proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed the ships, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work due to its weak finances. Following a lengthy process of negotiations, Krupp received the contract to rebuild Mahmudiye on 11 August 1900, along with several other warships. By December 1902, however, Krupp withdrew from the deal, and Mahmudiye was ultimately not reconstructed. In 1904, the ship was towed to Constantinople, and she was decommissioned there on 31 July 1909. She was thereafter used as a barracks ship in Kasƒ±mpa≈üa until 1913, when she was broken up.

She is known for her surreal self- portraits, mostly done as oil paintings. Her work has been praised for its jarring visual impact as it defies normal representations of childhood being cute and innocent. Early life and education Matsui was born in 1984 in Okayama, Japan where she grew up. As a student, she studied oil painting and went on to win the Shell Art Award in 2004. Her education also led her to study abroad in Finland as an exchange student at the University of Art & Design Helsinki in 2006. She graduated in 2008 with a B.F.A. from Tama Art University in Tokyo, and completed her M.A. in 2010 at the Tokyo University of the Arts. She continued her education in 2012 by fulfilling an artist residency at the Kunstlerhaus Bethanien in Germany, having been sponsored as a fellow for Japan's Agency of Cultural Affairs Overseas Training Program.  Career  Before she even graduated from Tama Art University, Matsui debuted as a rising artist in 2004 at the age of 20. That year, Matsui's painting \\"I Love Ebi-Chili\\" won the gold medal for Takashi Murakami's Geisai art fair in Tokyo. One of the jury members there, Herv√© Chand√®s (who is also the director of the Foundation Cartier in Paris), took note of her paintings and brought her on to be displayed in a group show (\\"J'en r√™ve\\") in summer 2005. Her pieces at the show were bought and are currently in a collection at the Foundation Cartier. Since then, her paintings have also been purchased by the Pigozzi Collection (New York), the Takahashi Collection (Tokyo), and the Ohara Museum (Okayama). In addition to being shown in exhibits across Japan and Europe, her paintings are popular among private art collectors, such as the French billionaire Francois Pinault and the fashion designer Maurizio Galante. Most recently, her paintings were featured in a solo show exhibition (\\"Planet of the Face\\") in 2016 at the Kirishima Open-Air Museum. She is currently based in Tokyo.  Art Style  thumb Matsui most commonly produces oil painting portraits of herself, distorting her features in surreal ways that end up disturbing or absurd. Although she began her career through Murakami's Geisei art fair, her paintings are elaborately composed and contain depth that distinguishes her work from the Superflat art style associated with Murakami and Kaikai Kiki artists. Matsui intentionally chose not to join the Kaikai Kiki (Murakami's art production and artist management company), choosing to prioritize art school education instead. As a young artist, her self-portraits are often used as an exploration in understanding the unknown world. Her paintings play upon popular themes of Japanese kawaii culture, as well as incorporating symbols of childhood nostalgia such as toys or lullabies to represent the anxiety of young adults growing up. Axelotls are a reoccurring motif in her work meant to highlight both the fantastical and otherworldly quality of her paintings.

She was also known for being a model for the artist Emanuel Phillips Fox, notably in his 1912 painting Nasturtiums.  Early life and family  Edith Susan Gerard Anderson was born on 16 February 1880 in Brisbane, Queensland. The name \\"Edith\\" came from her mother and the name \\"Gerard\\" from a Scottish grandmother. She was the youngest child in her family. She was the daughter of John Gerard Anderson, the head of the Department of Public Instruction, and Edith Sarah Wood. Her brother Arthur was a prominent doctor, and her eldest sister Maud was one of the first women to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Sydney, making her possibly Queensland's first female university graduate. Their grandfather was Reverend James Anderson.  Mid-life and marriage  = Life in Paris = Anderson lived with the artist Emmanuel Phillips Fox and his wife, Ethel Carrick, at their Paris home located at 65 Boulevard Arago near the Luxembourg Gardens, where Anderson modeled for Fox. He gave her painting lessons based on the impressionistic style that he learned when he attended the National Gallery School in Melbourne from 1878 until 1886 under G. F. Folingsby. Fox also helped set up her garden at her apartment. Anderson met her husband, Australian painter Theodore Penleigh Boyd, during this trip to Paris. Fox introduced Boyd and Anderson when Boyd worked in a studio next door to Fox's. Boyd described Anderson as \\"intelligent as well as beautiful‚Ä¶it was in nearly every way a perfect match.\\" They married in Paris on 15 October 1912; at their wedding, she was given away by Fox because of the close friendship the couple had with the painter. Notable guests at the Anderson-Boyd wedding include Rupert Bunny and Bessie Gibson. Following the marriage, Edith Susan Gerard Anderson changed her name to Edith Susan Boyd. = Life in Australia and life after Anderson's wedding = In 1912 following their wedding, Anderson and Boyd took their honeymoon to Chartres, Mentone, Rome, Florence, and Venice. In 1913, the couple then returned to Melbourne, Australia where their first child, Pamela Boyd, was born but died two weeks later. In 1914, the couple moved to Warrandyte, where Penleigh Boyd built the couple a home studio, known as The Robins for Anderson and the children. Anderson gave birth to her second child John Beckett Boyd (1915-1980), most commonly known as Pat Boyd, in 1915. In 1917, following the birth of Pat Boyd, Penleigh Boyd enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force, so Anderson was left without him for several months. However, while Boyd was enlisted in the army, he allowed three-fifths of his pay for the support of Anderson and their children. Anderson had to assist Boyd following his return from war because he was gassed in Ypres in 1917 and was left with lasting physical problems. Anderson reunited with her husband after he was sent to England and then later repatriated to Australia in March 1918. = Decline of Anderson's marriage = On 3 January 1919, Anderson had her second son Robin Boyd (1919-1971) at Armadale, Melbourne. Robin Boyd became an influential Australian architect, writer, teacher, and social commentator. In 1922, Anderson and her family sold \\"The Robins\\" and moved to Sydney, Australia. Here Penleigh Boyd was hired by Sydney Ure Smith as one of the organizers of a major exhibition of contemporary European art. Because of this opportunity, Anderson and her family moved to England to select paintings for this exhibition, but Penleigh Boyd returned to Australia without Anderson in June 1923 because their marriage was tumultuous during this time. During this separation, Boyd cheated on Anderson by having a brief affair with a Melbourne socialite Minna Schuler, who was the daughter of the editor of The Age. Before Anderson and her children returned to Australia, Penleigh Boyd bought back \\"The Robins\\" and purchased a new Hudson car in Sydney in 1923. Anderson met Boyd at Port Melbourne when the returned on 24 November 1923; however, the couple began to argue immediately. On 28 November 1923, Anderson husband's died when he crashed his car near Warragul when he was speeding between Melbourne and Sydney. Anderson buried her husband at Brighton Cemetery in Victoria. = Following the death of Anderson's husband = Following her husband's death, she was left with money from his estate (including the profit from the sale of \\"The Robins\\", the repaired car, and 40 paintings), a small inheritance from her father, and an annual allowance from Penleigh's father, which allowed her to support her sons without the need to work, even during the Great Depression. However, she continued to write dramas and radio plays because of her interest in these topics. Following the sale of \\"The Robins, Anderson moved to one of Malvern East's oldest apartment blocks at Toorak. She then bought a brick bungalow in Malvern East in 1927. Interactions with members of her past husband Penleigh's family to a degree continued and David Boyd, now deceased, son of Doris and Merric Boyd, gives description to some of these in his 2012 memoir, An Open House: Recollections of My Early Life.  Career  = Modeling career = Edith Susan Gerard Anderson attended the Slade School in London in 1905 and also lived in Paris, modeling for the artist Emanuel Phillips Fox. As a model, she was known for her bright red hair that is a focus of many of Fox's works.Society's \\"Perfect Memorial\\" to Margaret Olley ‚Äì Flowers and an artist whose work she loved\\"\\". Look (Art Gallery Society of NSW): 15. November 2011 Fox was attracted to Anderson as a model \\"by her rich auburn hair and grey-green eyes‚Äîboth fashionable at the time.\\" Pictures of her have been described as \\"full of tender sympathy for the model.\\"John MacDonald, Sydney Morning Herald, 20 April 2011 \\"Pictures such as On the Balcony or Nasturiums . . are brilliant decorations but also full of tender sympathy for the model, Ethel Anderson.\\" http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/fine-art-of-a-happy- marriage-20110427-1dxac.html Many of the paintings that Anderson modeled for were painted in-situ in the small central courtyard located in the Fox studio- apartment on Boulevard Arago in Montparnasse.Art Gallery of NSW media release November 2011. \\"Many. . were painted in-situ in the small central courtyard garden of the Fox studio-apartment on Boulevard Arago, Montparnasse, Paris.\\" She appeared in up to seven possible paintings by this artist in 1912, including \\"The green parasol, On the balcony, Nasturtiums, and Mrs. Penleigh Boyd. She also possibly appeared in The bathing hour in 1909.  Nasturtiums  Nasturtiums is the most well-known piece of artwork that Edith Susan Gerard Anderson modeled for, possibly as early as September 1912. This painting depicts Anderson wearing a printed mauve dress, black hat and gloves, reading in a garden sitting in a cane chair against a background of nasturtium leaves and flowers going up a trellis. She modeled for this piece in 1912 in Paris for Emanuel Phillips Fox, shortly after he was elected a member of the International Society of Painters and after returning from spending time painting in Spain and Algeria. This painting of Anderson was created with the context of Parisian domesticity, due to Anderson's lifestyle, during the period known as the Belle √âpoque. = Edith Susan Gerard Anderson as an artist = After she married into the Boyd family Anderson continued her individual career in painting and drawing. She had previously exhibited a significant number of paintings in the 1910 Royal Queensland Art Society Exhibition.  Works  Notable works of Edith Susan Gerard Anderson include: * Mary had a little lamb * Mimi * The song of the morrow * Water colors * Blue mountains * Margaret * Portrait * Sunlight * Highlander  Later life and death  In her later life, Anderson wrote several dramas that were staged by repertory companies, as well as radio plays for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. She died in East Burwood, Australia on 31 March 1961. Three of Emmanuel Phillips Fox's portraits of Anderson are held by her family. However, Nasturtiums was re-purchased in 2011 at an auction by the Society of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, serving as a memorial to Margaret Olley, who was a Sydney painter and a patron of the gallery who died a few months earlier.

Aves, 35 Mass. 193 (1836), was a case in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on the subject of transportation of slaves to free states. In August 1836, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw ruled that slaves brought to Massachusetts \\"for any temporary purpose of business or pleasure\\" were entitled to freedom. The case was the most important legal victory for abolitionists in the 1830s and set a major precedent throughout the North.Finkelman (2015), p. 85.  History  In 1836, Mary Aves Slater of New Orleans went to Boston to visit Thomas Aves, her father. She brought with her a six-year-old girl named Med who, under Louisiana law, was considered the property of Slater's husband, Samuel Slater. When members of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society learned that an enslaved girl was staying in Boston, they hired attorney Rufus Choate to bring the matter to court. Choate was joined by abolitionist attorneys Ellis Gray Loring and Samuel E. Sewall. A writ of habeas corpus was served on Thomas Aves, the owner of the house where Med was staying. It was served in the name of a male abolitionist, Levin H. Harris, because it was considered unseemly in those days for women to take part in public affairs. On August 21, 1836, the case was brought before Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.Finkelman (2015), p. 86. Benjamin Robbins Curtis, later known for his dissent in the Dred Scott decision, represented Aves. Curtis argued that the doctrine of comity required Massachusetts to respect the laws of Louisiana, and therefore Mrs. Slater should be allowed to bring Med home with her.Finkelman (2015), p. 86; Hunter (2015), p. 135. Loring argued that the comity principle did not apply \\"in doubtful cases,\\" and that there was no consensus on slavery; England and several other European nations had a policy of \\"disregarding the lex loci in the case of slaves,\\" giving them \\"immediate and entire liberty\\" when they were brought there from another country.Knapp (1836), p. 30. He characterized slavery as immoral, and expounded on the commonwealth's longstanding commitment to liberty.Hunter (2015), p. 135. When giving his opinion, Shaw discussed several precedents in international law, including the British case of Somerset v. Stewart (1772), and the abolishment of slavery in Massachusetts. The only people who could be treated as slaves in Massachusetts, he reasoned, were fugitive slaves, and then only because the U.S. Constitution specifically required it. Therefore, Med had become free as soon as her alleged owner voluntarily brought her to Massachusetts. He cited several cases demonstrating that even in Southern states it was understood that a slave became free when voluntarily brought to a free state. Commonwealth v. Aves was later used as a precedent in other Northern states. Connecticut used it in Jackson v. Bulloch (1837); New York and Pennsylvania used it in legislation declaring that slaves became free when brought to those states; and Ohio courts began using it in 1841. By the start of the Civil War, every Northern state other than Indiana, Illinois, and New Jersey granted freedom automatically to any slave brought within its borders. Med was placed in the custody of the abolitionist women, while her mother and siblings remained enslaved in New Orleans. The women renamed her Maria Somerset, after Maria Weston Chapman and the Somerset case. At some point later she was moved to an orphanage.

She was the daughter of Old Settler Cherokee Chief Thomas Chisholm, wife of Virginia state senator Robert L. Owen Sr. and mother of U.S. Senator Robert Latham Owen Jr. and Major William Otway Owen. Narcissa is most recognized for her Memoirs written in 1907, where she narrates accounts of her life along with the stories and traditions of her Cherokee ancestors. Early life and family background Born on October 3, 1831 in a log cabin near Webbers Falls (in what was then Arkansas Territory, soon became Indian Territory and would become Oklahoma) to Cherokee chieftain Thomas H. Chisholm (1790‚Äì1834) and his Virginia-born wife Malinda Wharton (1803‚Äì1864) (great-granddaughter of British Jacobite politician Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton). On her paternal side her grandfather was John D. Chisholm, a Scotsman who married a Cherokee woman named Martha Holmes. Narcissa was the youngest of four siblings. Her sister Jane Elizabeth married Caswell Wright Bruton and became Mrs. Jane Bruton. Neither of her brothers, Alfred Finney Chisholm (1830-1862), who married Margaret Harper, and William Wharton Chisholm (1830-1862), who married Susie Pindar, survived the American Civil War. Her paternal great-grandfather, John Beamor, had emigrated to the Carolinas to spread the gospel among Cherokees. In 1699 the 23 year old English missionary married 16 year old Quatsis, sister of chief Caulunna. Rev. Beamor later became a member of South Carolina's House of Burgesses and owned a plantation and at least 10 negro slaves. Around 1730 he traveled with a group of Cherokees to England. There he made a treaty that was opposed by a Cherokee group led by Oconstota, a war chief prior to the Revolutionary War and an ancestor to Narcissa. Eastern Cherokees later entered into treaties with the Americans in 1777 and 1782 (after further conflict and a smallpox epidemic). One of his grandsons, Rev. Jesse Bushyhead (1804-1844), became a noted Baptist preacher, as well as a schoolmaster. By 1812 there are efforts to move Cherokees into Arkansas county of the Louisiana Purchase by Thomas Jefferson. From 1814 to 1817 the Western Cherokees (Old Settlers), with John Chisholm‚Äôs support, work to secure title to land in northwestern Arkansa. In 1819 the Old Settlers or Western Cherokees moved westward with their slaves and settled on the Spada and Arkansas Rivers. A century earlier (according to an estimate of Christian Priber whom Narcissa labeled a French Jesuit, but who was actually a German utopian), the nation had about 50,000 warriors, but by 1819 only about 15,000 remained, of which a third (including the Chisholms) lived west of the Mississippi River. In 1827 the Cherokee Nation held a general convention and adopted a national constitution, at a convention led by John Ross and which elected Charles R. Hicks Principal Chief. Thomas Chisholm, a slave and landowner, moved his family to Beattie's Prairie in 1828. In 1834 he is elected as third chief, which Narcissa later acknowledges in her Memoirs as the last hereditary war chief. While at a gathering between Cherokees and Plains Indians in Talequah he caught typhoid fever. His wife brought him back home, but he did not recover, dying in 1834 when Narcissa was only 3 years old. Narcissa's mother remarried a widower and future Judge William Wilson (1811 - 1897) His first wife was Ruth Drumgould, whose mother was Kah-ta-yah, whom young Narcissa met in 1836 when the grandmother was nearing 100. Young Narcissa also learned about her Cherokee heritage from \\"Granny Jenny,\\" her father's former nurse and the daughter of enslaved Africans.Gregory D. Smithers. Diasporic Women: Wahnenauhi, Narcissa Owen, and the Shifting Frontiers of Cherokee Identity. Vol. 38, no. 1, 2017, pp. 210. EBSCOhost, Shortly before eastern Cherokee moved through the area, forced from their homes along the Trail of Tears. Narcissa later wrote of witnessing a group of Army-supervised Cherokee camp on their mother's farm in January 1839, noting the cruelty of herding human beings accustomed to warm winters through the cold and wind. She described how many refugees were sick and dozens died and were buried in what had been the family graveyard. Education and family life Having lost her father so early, Narcissa Chisholm was to some extent transferred between family members during her youth. Initially, her elder sister and brothers were educated at Dwight Mission School while her mother raised her. Narcissa attended Rev. Bushyhead's mission school circa 1843. Consistent with her later focus on Cherokee civilization and assimilation, Narcissa's memoirs also related how his son Dennis Bushyhead was educated at Princeton University before being elected Principal Chief of the Cherokees, and that his son Jessy Bushyhead became a physician in Claremore, Indian Territory‚Äîall far different from the noble savage stereotype. Narcissa Chisholm moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1846 to live with her decade-older sister Jane and attend an academy there run by Melvin Lynde. She then moved to southern Indiana where she attended a school run by John Byers Anderson.Accounts differ as to whether the college was in New Albany, Floyd County, Indiana (which established a public high school in 1853) or Dearborn County (which had the Moores Hill Male and Female Collegiate Institute founded in 1854 and which ultimately became the University of Evansville after moving in 1919 She returned to Fort Smith in 1848 and attended a female academy, Mrs. Sawyer's School, in Fayetteville, Arkansas. After graduating with a degree in music and art in 1850, she replaces her music teacher for a year. She also briefly served as a bridesmaid at the wedding of prominent Cherokee Wash Mayes. She then accepted a position teaching music in east Tennessee. While teaching in Masonic High School in Jonesborough, Washington County, Tennessee, she met Virginia-born civil engineer Robert L. Owen Sr., who was surveying a railroad route over the Appalachian Mountains from Lynchburg, Virginia toward Nashville, Tennessee. They married on October 4, 1853. They moved near the Clinch River while Mr. Owen continued his survey work, and then to Lynchburg, where Owen became President of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. Narcissa bore two sons: the future U.S. Army Dr. William Otway Owen, born 1854 in Broylesville, Tennessee and future U.S. Senator Robert Latham Owen Jr. born 1856 in Lynchburg, Virginia. Narcissa bore two sons: the future U.S. Army Dr. William Otway Owen, born 1854 in Broylesville, Tennessee and future U.S. Senator Robert Latham Owen Jr. born 1856 in Lynchburg, Virginia. Narcissa later spent many pages of her Memoirs describing her Scots-Irish heritage, as well as labeling her Cherokee heritage as \\"royal,\\" explaining in part the native names she had given her sons: Caulunna (William) and Oconosta (Robert Jr). In Lynchburg, the Owen family (and their slaves) lived at Point of Honor, a mansion overlooking the James River and various railroad lines serving the city. Through his mother (and grandmother Betty Lewis, George Washington's niece), Robert Owen inherited several relics of the first President. Career =Virginia= During the American Civil War, Robert Owen ran the railroad (a crucial supply and troop line for the Confederacy) and his wife and Mrs. Thomas J. Kirkpatrick led the women of St. Paul's Episcopal Church who sewed uniforms and otherwise assisted the same cause. Their sons were too young to fight, but Robert Owen's brother, Dr. William Owen, ran 30 hospitals in the city (a major hospital center for the Confederacy). Lynchburg never fell to Union forces, which withdrew after false reports (for some of which Narcissa Owen later took credit) of Confederate troop strength in the town. Shortly after the war ended, Robert Owen resigned as President of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, after losing a fight against merging the railroad with several owned by former Confederate General (and future Republican Senator) William Mahone. Robert Owen served a term in the Virginia Senate, then purchased a plantation near Norfolk, Virginia from a former surveyor buddy, where he died unexpectedly shortly before the Panic of 1873. Her husband's death left Narcissa Owen with young children to raise, and what little financial security remained after Robert Owen's death soon vanished. Narcissa Owen returned to teaching to send her sons to college. =Oklahoma= In 1880, Narcissa Owen moved to Oklahoma Indian Territory to teach music at the Cherokee Female Seminary, the first institution of higher learning for women west of the Mississippi River.Rose Stremlau. A Cherokee Woman‚Äôs America: Memoirs of Narcissa Owen, 1831-1907 (Review). Vol. 20, no. 4, 2009, pp. 87. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1353/ail.0.0050. Her younger son Robert L. Owen, Jr. had graduated from Washington and Lee University in 1887, and already moved to Okhahoma to continue a teaching career as orphanage principal, as well as read law and begin a legal career. Robert Owen became Indian Agent (1885-1889) during the presidency of Democrat Grover Cleveland, then organized the First National Bank of Muskogee in 1890 (and served as its president as well as practiced law for the next decade). In 1895, the 62-year old Narcissa Owen retired from teaching, devoting herself to art and also worked to refute misconceptions of Native Americans as primitive and uncouth. She studied at the Library of Congress and the Corcoran Gallery, and painted landscapes (as well as portraits and miniatures) using oil paint, as well as used the more traditional women's medium of needlework.Laura R. Prieto, At Home in the Studio: The Professionalization of Women Artists in America (Harvard University Press 2001) pp. 141-144 Her self-portrait of 1896 displayed above indicates her Victorian-era respectability and wealth. Owen also displayed tapestries at the Oklahoma Territory's pavilion, for she did not believe in hierarchies of artistic medium. Her painting \\"Thomas Jefferson and His Descendants,\\" won a medal at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri in 1904. Displayed in the Indian Territory Building throughout the exposition, Narcissa‚Äôs portraits showcased six generations of Jefferson‚Äôs descendants: Thomas Jefferson himself, his daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph, his grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph, his great-granddaughter Mrs. R. G. H. Kean, his other great-granddaughter Mrs. John S. Morris, and the Adelaide and Pattie Morris. Narcissa‚Äôs interest in honoring Thomas Jefferson comes from her family‚Äôs history and friendship with him. In 1808 Owen‚Äôs father Thomas Chisholm receives the Silver Peace and Friendship Medal from Jefferson for his efforts to unite the Eastern and Western Cherokees. The medal became lost to the family for some time after the passing of Alfred Chisholm in 1862. It wasn't until 1905 that the medal was recovered by a prospector in Wichita Mountains. By further admiration Owen later named her ranch near the Little Caney River \\"Monticello,\\" after Jefferson‚Äôs home in Virginia. In 1900 her son Robert L. Owen began a 6 year legal battle in Oklahoma and Washington, D.C., which ultimately led to a judgment for the balance due the Cherokee from the 1835 treaty ($5 million including interest from 1838). This catapulted him into prominence, and he was elected one of Oklahoma's first two U.S. Senators after the territory achieved statehood on November 17, 1907. Although some Native American leaders disagreed with Robert Owen and had opposed statehood (and some would later disagree with the disbursement of the funds obtained), the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention (which met in Muskogee in 1905) proved a precursor of the statehood convention. Narcissa Owen moved to Washington, D. C., where she acted as her son's hostess, and continued working to refute misconceptions of Native Americans. On October 3, 1907, Owen privately published her Memoirs, probably in Washington, D.C., although another copy was found at the multi-ethnic, library-friendly Tuesday Club of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, which had gathered at her Oklahoma home \\"Monticello\\" in honor of her 75th birthday the previous May 1, as mentioned at the Memoir's conclusion.Linda Williams Reese, Women of Oklahoma, 1890-1920 (University of Oklahoma Press 1997), p. 86 As Owen's modern editor has noted, the Memoirs combine traditional storytelling modes (and humor, including trickster imagery) and Native perspectives deriving back to Sarah Winnemucca's Life Among the Paiutes: their wrongs and claims (1883) and Lucinda Lowery Hoyt Keys' Historical Sketches of the Cherokees (1889).Kilcup pp. 11-30, 151-155 Death and legacy Narcissa Owen died in Guthrie, Oklahoma on July 12, 1911 (far from her ranch as well as Bartlesville). Her corpse was returned to Lynchburg, Virginia for a funeral at St. Paul's Church, and burial beside her husband at Spring Hill cemetery (where her son Robert would later also be buried).The Indian's Friend\\" Vol 23, no. 12 (August 1911) available at https://books.google.com/books?id=j1dQAQAAMAAJ&pg; Her former home, Point of Honor is on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the Cherokee Female Seminary. The former is now a city museum for Lynchburg; the latter is a coeducational state university. Her painting of Thomas Jefferson is now in the collection of the University of Virginia. Her painting of Sequoyah (a copy of a painting by Charles Bird King) is owned by the Oklahoma Historical Society, which allows its display at the Oklahoma Judicial Center; the Society also has her self-portrait of 1896 depicted above and gold medal. Several of her other paintings are in the collection of the Oklahoma Museum of Art and Gilcrease Museum.

The story revolves around a deaf agent, Tom Clerc (played by Insolera), from New York City who is a carrier of a powerful genetic mutation. He is sent to Japan with his colleague, Ken Wong, to investigate crimes believed to have been committed by Japanese deaf mutants. The film's characters, both villains and agent, use sign language as their superhuman powers. The film also stars Carola Insolera, Ben Bahan, Hiroshi Vava, Humberto Insolera, and Noboru Kuragawa. The film makes several references to deaf history, culture, and sign language linguistics. Six languages are spoken and signed in the film: English, Japanese, Italian, American Sign Language, Japanese Sign Language, and Italian Sign Language. Plot Tom Clerc is a deaf secret agent who comes from a multi-generational deaf family. He is a descendant of Laurent Clerc, considered the Father of the Deaf in America. In the film Laurent Clerc brought sign language to the United States two centuries earlier. Tom is a carrier of SGx29, the powerful Sign Gene mutation. However, he lost a significant portion of his powers during a battle with Jux Clerc. Jux Clerc is Tom's brother and the leader of the group 1.8.8.0, an evil organization dedicated to exterminating Sign Gene mutants. Hugh Denison is the head of the Q.I.A. (QuinPar Intelligence Agency), an agency affiliated with the Pentagon and composed of selected agents with Sign Gene mutation. Denison sends Tom Clerc and his colleague Ken Wong to Osaka, Japan. The pair end up fighting a Japanese gang led by Tatsumi Fuwa. During their encounters with the gang, Denison and Clerc learn that they can only win the conflict by conforming to the Japanese way. Along with his journey, Tom Clerc learns that his powers are not lost.

All deaf mutants who are carriers of this genetic mutation turn out to be superheroes with the ability to create superpowers through the use of Sign language. They are blessed with arcane powers such as being able to make doors close by signing the word 'close', or having their hands metamorphose into weapons which can spew fire by signing the word 'weapon.' Production =Development= Sign Gene was shot in Japan, the United States, and Italy. Originally starting out as a short film, it garnered a groundswell of interest which led Insolera to believe the film had a chance of a larger production and attracting a bigger audience. He rewrote the script into a feature-length film. Casting opportunities were advertised by of word of mouth. Insolera was especially interested in actors who were native signers fluent in sign language. The film is designed with a Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's Grindhouse touch√©. =Historical, cultural and linguistic references= Sign Gene makes several coded references to deaf history, deaf culture, and sign language linguistics. Q.I.A. stands for QuinPar Intelligence Agency, and QuinPar refers to the five parameters, the phonological components in sign language linguistics that form signs: handshape, movement, location, orientation, and non-manual signals. Agent Tom Clerc shares the surname of a famous figure in deaf history, Laurent Clerc, a deaf educator who brought sign language to the U.S. And 1.8.8.0. is a reference to the Second International Congress on Deaf Education, which took place in Milan, Italy, in 1880. It was there that educators codified their recommendation to eliminate sign language from deaf education‚Äù. Figures such as Alexander Graham Bell and Jean Massieu are present in the film as well. Release The film had its world premiere on September 8, 2017, in Milan and was released in theaters by the UCI Cinemas on September 14, 2017. It had its U.S. release on April 13, 2018 and release in Japan on September 14th, 2018. =Critical response= Sign Gene received positive reviews from critics.

Rankings rely on subjective impressions by the scholarly community, on analyses of prize winners of scientific associations, discipline, a publisher's reputation, and its impact factor (particularly in the sciences).  Ranking Challenges  Publications are often judged by venue, rather than merit. This has been criticized in the Leiden Manifesto and the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment. According to the manifesto, \\"Science and technology indicators are prone to conceptual ambiguity and uncertainty and require strong assumptions that are not universally accepted. The meaning of citation counts, for example, has long been debated. Thus, best practice uses multiple indicators to provide a more robust and pluralistic picture.\\" In a study assessing an increasingly- diversified array of publishers and their service to the academic community, Janice S. Lewis concluded that college and university librarians ranked university presses higher and commercial publishers lower than did members of the American Political Science Association. According to Colin Steele, a librarian at the Australian National Library in Canberra, \\"Listings of publishers by title also fail to take into account that some university presses are strong in certain disciplines, but not across the whole spectrum.\\" Rankings can vary widely by discipline.  American Political Science Rankings  The American Political Science Association (APSA) has ranked academic publishers, taking into consideration both book and journal publication. In 2007, their top-ranked (A+) publishers were: #Cambridge University Press #University of Chicago Press #Columbia University Press #Harvard University Press #MIT Press #Oxford University Press/Clarendon (UK/US) #Princeton University Press #Stanford University Press #University of California Press #Yale University Press In 2007, their second-ranked (A) publishers were: # Alfred A Knopf # Allen & Unwin # Cornell University Press # Duke University Press # Edward Elgar # Elsevier Science Ltd # IPA, Warsaw # Johns Hopkins University Press # Kluwer # Manchester University Press # Melbourne University Press # New York University Press # Palgrave MacMillan (UK & Australia, St Martins' Press in US) # Politico's # Polity Press # Routledge (Taylor and Francis) # Sage Publications # Science Publishers # Univ of Pennsylvania Press # University of Michigan Press # University of Minnesota Press # University of New South Wales Press # University of Toronto Press # WHO/EDM, Geneva # Wiley- Blackwell # AP, London # Basic Books, New York # Blackwell, Oxford # Clarendon Press, Gloucestershire, UK # CRC, Ghent, Belgium # CRC, New York # Harper & Row, New York # John Wiley & Sons, West Sussex, UK # Pergamon Press, Oxford/Amsterdam # Prentice Hall, Eaglewood Cliffs (NJ), USA # Random House, New York # Springer, London/Berlin  SENSE rankings  The Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment (SENSE Research School) has ranked scientific publishers every year since 2006. SENSE works in conjunction with the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), in accordance with the standard evaluation protocol for Dutch universities. The school developed its ranking in conjunction with performance criteria for its staff. rating A, B, and C journals and A, B, C, D, and E publishers. A-publishers are ranking scheme,http://www.sense.nl/gfx_content/documents/ABCDE- indeling%20Scientific%20Publishers%20SENSE_approved_May_2009.pdf the \\"few top- notch international publishers\\"; B-publishers are \\"good international publishers\\"; C-publishers are \\"decent international publishers and excellent national publishers\\"; D-publishers are \\"professional publications published by major international organisations and good national publishers\\", and E-publishers are \\"publications mainly published for a non-academic general public by national organisations and small local publishers\\". The SENSE Ranking was recognized in bibliometric literature and other universities' attempts to rate publishers.See for example the Ranking List of Academic Book Publishers, provided by the Education University of Hong Kong. This \\"Hong Kong\\" ranking quotes rankings by the Australian Political Studies Association; and another publisher ranking system of the Centre for Resource Studies for Human Development (CERES) of the University of Utrecht in addition to the SENSE Ranking. The \\"Hong Kong\\" ranking emphasizes the high correlation between all these ranking attempts by explicitly stating \\"There was a high level of consistency in the ranking of Book Publishers among the three systems.\\" The latest SENSE ranking, like its previous rankings, is based on the subjective assessment of a publisher by prominent Dutch and international scientists. An Excel table is available at the school's website. In 2017, their top-ranked (A) scientific publishers were (in alphabetical order): # Academic Press (Elsevier) # Cambridge University Press # Oxford University Press # Routledge # Sage Publications # University of Chicago Press # Wiley Their second-ranked (B) scientific publishers were (in alphabetical order): # Ashgate # Brill # CABI # Edward Elgar # Elsevier # Nomos # Springer Verlag # Taylor and Francis  Spanish National Research Council rankings  In 2012 and 2014, the Spanish National Research Council asked 11,864 Spanish academics to name the 10 most prestigious academic publishers from over 600 international and 500 Spanish- language publishers. It received 2,731 responses, a response rate of 23.05 percent. Results were compiled using a weighted average.http://ilia.cchs.csic.es/SPI/metodologia_2014.html and http://ilia.cchs.csic.es/SPI/prestigio_expertos_2014.php The results were: # Cambridge University Press # Oxford University Press # Springer Nature # Routledge # Elsevier # Peter Lang # Thomson Reuters # Blackwell # De Gruyter # McGraw Hill  Granada Rankings  To quantitatively assess the output of a publishing company, a research group associated with the University of Granada created a methodology based on the Thomson-Reuters Book Citation Index. The quantitative weight of the publishers is based on output data, impact (citations) and publisher profile. According to the Granada study, the 10 leading companies were: # Springer # Palgrave Macmillan # Routledge # Cambridge University Press # Elsevier # Nova Science Publishers # Edward Elgar # Information Age Publishing # Princeton University Press # University of California Press  Libcitation rankings  The Research Impact Measurement Service (RIMS) at the University of New South Wales presented a quantitative methodology of bibliometric comparisons of book publishers.For a recent summary of the literature see Tausch, Arno (2017), Die Buchpublikationen der Nobelpreis-√ñkonomen und die f√ºhrenden Buchverlage der Disziplin. Eine bibliometrische Analyse Bibliotheksdienst, March 2017: 339 ‚Äì 374. In a Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology article, Howard D. White et al. wrote: \\"Bibliometric measures for evaluating research units in the book-oriented humanities and social sciences are underdeveloped relative to those available for journal-oriented science and technology\\". The RIMS proposed what they called a \\"libcitation count\\", counting the libraries holding a given book as reported in a national (or international) union catalog. In the follow-up literature, comparing research units or even the output of publishing companies became the target of research. *Drummond, R., & Wartho, R. (2009).

The building fronting the street at No. 34 was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 12 March 1951. The rear wings and the building at No.36 are not listed. History The Royal Silk Manufactory was originally established by John Beckett at the corner of Store Kongensgade (No. 83) and Hindegade in 1739. It was destroyed by fire but was rebuilt by his successor, Charles Maillot (1718-1745), a Frenchman, with support from the kommercekollegiet, in 1742. The new factory was built by Philip de Lange. It was destroyed by fire in 1745, It was rebuilt but went bankrupt shortly thereafter. Maillot left the country but died in Quebec later that same year. Peter Reiersen (1713-1773), who had been appointed as bookkeeper at Almindelige Varemagasin in 1738, managed to revive the operations. It had 43 looms and 143 workers. A large mew factory complex was constructed in Bredgade in 1755-56. Reiersen answered to four directors: Gilles Willhelm Daemen (1702-1787), Conrad Christian Dauw (1693-1775), Peter van Hurk (1667-1775) and Cornelius Schumacher (1703-1777). The latter was married to Reiersen's sister, Elisabeth Reiersen (1718-1755). Miels Lunde Reiersen The production stagnated in the 1770s. In earky 1775 it was taken over by Niels Lunde Reiersen. At this point the number of employees had fallen to 28 weavers and approximately one hundred workers. After Lunde Reiersen's death in 1795 it was taken over by his business partner Hans Brandorph. He lived with his family in one of the apartments. Friderich Hoppe (1770-1837), the owner of Rosenfeldt at Vordingborg and a board member of the Reiersen Foundation, lived in another apartment. He went bankrupt in 1802. The silk production was for a while revived by John Baverstock with support from kommercekollegiet. John and Robert (Richard?) Baverstock had together with four silk workers come to Copenhagen from London to establish a silk production. Johan Carl Modeweg The factory was in 1806 sold to Charles aigist Selby, Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck, Jean de Coninck and William Duntzfelt. In 18011, it was sold to Jean Frederik Christian Gandil (1791-1840). In 1813 to 1825, it was owned by Ulrich Christian von Schmidten and Ole Christian Borch. The complex was acquired by Johan Carl Modeweg in 1825 and once again turned into a textile factory but he moved the production to Brede Works in 1831. The complex was later home to Bredgade Steam Mill. It closed in 1897. The buildings were then acquired by piano manufacturer Hindsberg. Several prominent residents have also lived in the complex. The later Minister of Defence Christian Frederik Hansen lived at No. 34 in 1824-1825. The composer lived at No. 34 from 1874 to 1884. Architecture The complex is centred on two courtyards. The architect was possibly Niels Eigtved. The building fronting the street served as headquarters and also contained a residence for the manager.

The title of the novel was announced in September 2016 and the cover was revealed on December 12, 2016. Premise Thirty years have passed since the events of Babylon's Ashes and Earth is back on its feet after the attack that crippled the planet in Nemesis Games. The crew of the aging gunship Rocinante are still together, working contracts for the Transport Union, who have control of the Ring station and the 1,300 worlds the gates lead to. No one has heard from Admiral Duarte and his rogue fleet in the thirty years since they broke away from the Martian Congressional Republic Navy, until now. They have spent their time in the Laconia system building an advanced fleet using leftover technology from the protomolecule creators. They return through their gate to take over Medina Station and launch an attack on the Sol system. Characters James Holden, aging Captain of the Rocinante, after over 30 years of working the Rocinante, Holden looks to the next chapter of his life, retirement. Until the Laconians return through the gate and Holden is drawn back in to the fray. Bobbie Draper, former Martian Marine and now working on the Rocinante. When Holden retires, Bobbie takes up the mantle of Captain of the Rocinante. Camina Drummer, former head of security at Tycho Station, now the president of the Transport Union. The Transport Union's control of Ring station, and the 1,300 worlds it connects to, makes Drummer one of the most powerful people in all of humanity. Santiago Jilie Singh, a Captain in the Laconian Navy, recently promoted to command The Gathering Storm. After the Laconians take Medina Station, Singh is appointed as the governor of the station. Naomi Nagata, one of the best engineers in the solar system and XO of the Rocinante, she is looking forward to a quiet retirement alongside Holden, until the Laconians return and Naomi gets pulled in to the resistance with the rest of the crew of the Rocinante. Alex Kamal, pilot of the Rocinante, after another failed marriage, and a son who is in university, Alex is still at the helm of the Rocinante, with no plans of leaving. Amos Burton, mechanic on the Rocinante, still very close friends with Clarissa, Amos has become her caretaker as her health is declining.

He was released by rogue members of the OPA, and has been working with the rogue Martian fleet under Admiral Duarte ever since. He is the lead researcher on Laconia and is working on making Duarte immortal using protomolecule technology. Winston Duarte, was an admiral in the Martian Congressional Republic Navy, until he and a splinter group broke away from Mars and went through the ring gate to the planet Laconia. Duarte learned of Laconia and the vast amount of protomolecule technology that was left behind by the creators through his position at the MCRN, and felt that it needed to be acquired and understood, in the event that the race that destroyed the protomolecule builders returned.

The garden extends for 70 hectares and is administered by the Botanic Institute of Venezuela (FIVB). Its code of international recognition as a botanical institution, as well as the acronym of the herbarium, is VEN. It is located in the geographic center of Caracas, forming part of the whole of the University City, with its main entrance at Salvador Allende Avenue off the bridge that connects Plaza Venezuela with the Tamanaco Entrance of the UCV.  History  In 1945, intense scientific work began on the reforestation and planting of exotic trees on lands of the former Ibarra estate to give life to the Botanical Garden of the UCV under the direction of Dr. Tobias Lasser, supported by the Swiss horticulturist August Braun and Venezuelan outfielder Pedro Naspe. Opened to the public in 1958, this was the country's first botanical garden and was part of the original project of the University City of Caracas. In addition to hosting the National Herbarium, the Botanical Institute of Venezuela has an extensive art collection. The garden, as part of the University City, is one of two botanical gardens named as a World Heritage Site; the other is Kew Royal Botanic Garden in London. Students of the Central University of Venezuela and city inhabitants, as well as tourists, once enjoyed visits to the garden when it was being properly maintained. = Bolivarian Venezuela = During the crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, many of the garden's features were stolen, destroyed or died as a result of mismanagement. Lagoons and plants have dried up due to shortages in Venezuela, where water is scarce, with more than one-third of the multiple palm tree species dying in the gardens. Santa Cruz water-lilies, once a popular feature in the gardens, have all died out. Due to the crisis, looters stole electrical wiring, plumbing and computers that helped irrigate the gardens while the guard station tasked with securing the area was completely stripped of all material from the roof to the foundation. In July 2018, the gardens received only an annual budget of $66 per year, with curators working desperately to maintain the gardens despite the lack of resources.  Features  The Botanical Garden of Caracas had more than 2,500 species that corresponded to about 200 botanical families, of which 50% were from Venezuela, the rest of Central America, Africa, India and other regions of Asia and South America. Of its 70 hectares, 15 of them had certain areas where the plants were distributed by sectors, the remaining 55 hectares, were reforested and have been dedicated as a preserved native forest. Areas that were once included were: *Laguna Principal *Interpreting Paths *Orchid *Tropical Humid Forest *Laguna Venezuela *Xeroitic Garden *Palmetum, was one of the most important collections of Palms in Latin America, housing some 4,000 specimens of about 250 species. *Zingiberales *Bromeliad *Ar√°ceas *Recreational didactic zone *Economic Garden *Arboretum Gallery Caracas Jard√≠n Bot√°nico.jpg File:Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de la U.C.V..JPG File:Jardin botanico ccs.jpg Laguna Venezuela, Jard√≠n Botanico de la UCV Caracas, Venezuela.jpg File:Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de Caracas - Distrito Capital 3.jpg File:Cyrtostachys renda en Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de Caracas.JPG File:Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de Caracas - Distrito Capital 4.jpg Guacamayas.JPG File:Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de Caracas - Distrito Capital 2.jpg Flor de Caracas.jpg File:Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de Caracas - Distrito Capital 1.jpg File:Tobias Lasser.jpg 3.Laguna Venezuela, Jard√≠n Botanico de la UCV y parque Central en Caracas, Venezuela.jpg Avenida de Roystonea oleracea en Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de Caracas.jpg File:Fotos RN Sendero ecologico JBC-1 (13).jpg See also *List of national parks of Venezuela *Botanical Garden of M√©rida References Category:Botanical gardens in Venezuela Category:Protected areas established in 1958 Category:Caracas ","title":"Caracas Botanical Garden"},{"id":"53558756","text":"Tony Day (born 14 April 1965) is a British swimmer.

The elections were noteworthy for a number of reasons. In the aftermath, peasants were moving closer to the government, accepting more of its policies as beneficial, the Jewish population gained more representation, and party purges were on the horizon.Daniel Thorniley and Kevin Gardiner, Rise And Fall Of The Soviet Rural Communist Party 1927-39, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 1988, p. 32-33.Benjamin Pinkus, The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 82. Campaign The elections were held under a one-party state, as \\"any party except the Communist party [was] illegal within the country\\" but campaigns still included unpleasantness, as the Trotskyists complained that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was losing \\"control of the legislative bodies,\\" which Stalin's dictatorship fervently denied, and there was \\"the disfranchising of 142,000 citizens...who were permitted to vote last year,\\" some of whom were peasants.Junius B. Wood, \\"Soviet Russia's Fourth General Election Quiet: Voting Progresses Without Political Speeches or Campaign Issues,\\" The Cornell Daily Sun, February 10, 1927. Around this time, some of the citizenry were engaging in anti-communist actions and voted against CPSU candidates, worrying the Soviet government deeply.Vladimir N. Brovkin, Russia After Lenin: Politics, Culture and Society, 1921-1929, New York: Routledge, 1988, p. 130-131, 165-166, 183-184. Some in rural areas tried to rouse public sentiment against the CPSU but this was unsuccessful as religious members, like priests and deacons, gained rights to vote in the elections, whilst certain individuals were disenfranchised for opposing the goals of Soviet ideology.Loren R.
