Founded in 1977, the firm focuses on individuals, municipalities, and entities harmed by environmental toxins, fraud, or disregard for safety,The History of Baron & Budd. and a variety of other areas. Their work has included representation of victims of the September 11 attacks and of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Opponents of mass tort litigation have criticized the firm for the zealousness with which it represents its clients, and for the political activities of some of its attorneys.  History  =Establishment and early practice= Baron & Budd began its practice in 1977. The firm's first major case involved a lead smelter adjacent to one of the largest public housing projects in Dallas. Baron & Budd represented more than 200 families in a lawsuit that eventually closed the smelter and provided sizable damage awards for court-supervised trusts that benefited several hundred children. For most of its existence, Baron & Budd has maintained a substantial presence in \\"litigation against former asbestos manufacturers and companies that used asbestos products\\", being one of the first law firms in the U.S. to successfully try mesothelioma cases. The firm's clients in this practice have included celebrities such as actor Paul Gleason,Daniel A. Austin, Stephen P. Parsons, Business Bankruptcy Law in Focus (2016), p. 469-470. who died from mesothelioma in 2006. The firm has also practiced widely in other areas of mass torts, including such matters as \\"Benzene exposure, Fen-Phen diet drug litigation and water contamination\\". In 1985, Baron & Budd filed suit on behalf of more than 1,600 Tucson-area residents against an aircraft manufacturer, the City of Tucson, and the Tucson Airport Authority over trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination of the community's groundwater.\\"Tucson-Area Water Contamination Victims Triumph in Arizona Appeals Court Ruling Against Insurer\\", Claims Journal, October 1, 2004. Accessed February 15, 2007. Throughout the ensuing 21-year legal battle, in which Baron & Budd ultimately prevailed, the law firm helped to define Arizona law on pollution coverage. The case is widely considered to be among the most important in U.S. history involving personal injuries caused by water pollution. In 2006, Baron & Budd attorneys were honored with the Trial Lawyer of the Year award by Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, \\"in recognition of their firms work in precedent-setting litigation involving groundwater contamination in Arizona\\". When a Halliburton subsidiary filed for bankruptcy reorganization in the late 1990s, Baron & Budd stepped in to protect the rights of the firm's asbestos victims. In 2002, Russell Budd, the firm's managing shareholder, negotiated with Halliburton and became a chief architect in establishing a trust fund that would protect current and future asbestos victims throughout the United States. The agreement reached between Halliburton and Baron & Budd created the largest asbestos trust fund of its kind anywhere in the world. Another key development for the firm occurred in 1997, when the United States Supreme Court decided Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor.Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 (1997). In that case, plaintiffs represented by various attorneys, including those from Baron & Budd, objected to the fairness of a class action settlement approved by the district court on behalf of injured parties not effectively represented before the court. The record for a successful appeal was developed \\"[t]hanks largely to lawyers at Baron & Budd, a firm representing some of the objectors\\" which insured that \\"there were more than 30 depositions, other discovery, and an 18-day fairness hearing\\". This outcome was reinforced within the next few years in a case also brought to fruition by Baron & Budd, Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp.Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 US. 815 (1999). The decisions in these cases \\"compel appellate courts to look skeptically at class action settlements that release defendants from claims by absent plaintiffs\\". During this period, the firm received both criticism and praise for the zealousness with which it represented its clients.See W. William Hodes, The Professional Duty To Horseshed Witnesses—Zealously, Within The Bounds Of the Law, 30 TEX. TECH L. REV. 1343 (1999). =Developments in the 2000s and 2010s= In 2003, Baron & Budd represented the City of Santa Monica in a landmark MTBE contamination settlement with the major oil companies. MTBE contaminated five of Santa Monica's 11 wells, forcing the city to begin importing water in 1996 for $3 million a year. In 2006, firm founder Russell Budd \\"helped secure a $3.9 billion settlement with the United States Gypsum Co. on behalf of the asbestos creditors committee in one of the largest bankruptcy settlements on record\\". Other notable cases by Baron & Budd in this time included \\"a 13.5 million- dollar verdict on behalf of the family of an East Texas man who died of mesothelioma as a result of asbestos exposure in his childhood, and a 15.5 million dollar jury verdict in a Mississippi lawsuit involving dioxide emissions\\". In 2008, Baron & Budd played a lead role in negotiations with major oil companies that had contaminated drinking water through the use of MTBE as a gasoline additive. Baron & Budd's efforts resulted in a landmark settlement, requiring the oil companies to pay a substantial cash settlement, nearly $1.5 billion, to 153 public water providers in 17 states, as well as a number of private well owners. In August 2010, environmental attorney and Baron & Budd shareholder Burton LeBlanc of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Baron & Budd were retained by the state of Louisiana to provide counsel to the state's designated trustees in connection with issues related to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and the resulting oil spill.\\"Environmental Attorney Burton LeBlanc of Baron & Budd, P.C. Hired by Louisiana Office of Coastal Protection and Restoration\\" MSNBC, August 13, 2010. Accessed April 5, 2011 In October 2010, Scott Summy, the head of Baron & Budd's water contamination team, was one of four attorneys nationwide chosen to serve on the Plaintiffs' Executive Committee for the Gulf Oil Spill Multi-District Litigation (MDL) and as a member of the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee (PSC). In 2011, Baron & Budd, along with co-counsel, represented the first Chinese drywall client to be remediated by the Chinese Sheetrock manufacturer Knauf. Several of the firm's attorneys developed political connections over time. Partner Russell Budd and his wife, Dorothy, hosted President Barack Obama at their home in August 2010. Partner Fred Baron served as co-chair of the Kerry Victory '04 committee, a joint effort of the Democratic National Committee and the Presidential campaign of John Kerry. The New York Times listed Baron & Budd as the sixth biggest source of contributions to state attorneys general campaigns from 2004 to 2014. Baron & Budd has also received numerous plaudits from legal organizations. In September 2014, the National Law Journal identified Baron & Budd as \\"Elite Trial Lawyers\\", noting that \\"Baron & Budd is best known for its asbestos work but its interests run much broader than that\\". Baron & Budd was named to \\"The Plaintiffs' Hot List\\" of the National Law Journal from 2003 to 2006, in 2008, and again in 2011 and 2012, and attorneys from the firm have repeatedly been named to the \\"Best Lawyers in America\\" list, receiving this honor for four years in a row, from 2013 to 2017. =Recent developments= In September 2017, Baron & Budd was one of two firms hired to represent Brunswick County, North Carolina in the investigation of chemical contamination of drinking water drawn from the Cape Fear River, alleged to involve the manufacture of perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) by Chemours, DuPont and Kuraray at a facility in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Baron & Budd has twice represented plaintiffs against Wells Fargo regarding practices by that company. In November 2016, Baron & Budd represented homeowners whose home appraisal fees had allegedly been marked up by the bank, and negotiated a $50 million settlement after winning certification of the claim as a class action. In July 2017, the firm filed a lawsuit alleging that the bank had charged auto loan customers for unnecessary insurance, causing some customers to have their cars repossessed. The firm is representing the cities of Louisville, Cincinnati, and Birmingham, among other counties and municipalities, in litigation against opioid distributors, in response to the crisis of opioid addiction. Their Environmental Litigation Group is representing public entities, including the cities of Spokane and Seattle, as well as the State of Washington, in litigation against Monsanto-related PCB contamination. In 2017 Baron & Budd investigated potential lawsuits that were related to allegations that pharmaceutical distributors \\"deliberately failed to monitor and report suspicious orders of opioids\\". This failed monitoring and reporting, the firm argued, potentially played a role in the opioid epidemic. The law firm had previously won a $177 million settlement against GlaxoSmithKline for the drug Avandia, arguing that the company misrepresented the drug by saying that it reduced adverse cardiac of events, when in actuality it did not. Philanthropy Baron & Budd has been described as \\"generous in giving back to the community\\", engaged in activities such as giving holiday presents to underprivileged children, supporting local food drives, and building Habitat for Humanity homes, and providing free legal services to assist the needy in drafting simple wills and contracts, and resolving landlord/tenant disputes and family law matters. Baron & Budd attorneys also provided representation of victims of the September 11 attacks as part of their philanthropic efforts. In support of mesothelioma victims, \\"[i]n 2005, Baron & Budd pledged up to three million dollars to the International Pleural Mesothelioma Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston in honor of victims of asbestos exposure\\".

The estate consists of a castle, an old granary renovated into a museum, a circular threshing machine, a neo- gothic chapel and the Jelačić family tomb.  History  = Estate from 17th to 19th century = During the process of disintegration of larger Susedgrad- Stubica feudal possession, Novi dvori (Curia Nova), are mentioned as independent entity as early as the beginning of 17th century.Jakaša-Borić, Bilušić-Dumbović, 109- 110 According to a document dated in 1852, the Novi Dvori manor was first constructed in 1611 as an ordinary one story manor house mostly made of wood. This initial 17th century concept of a manor, consisted of what is today a western part of the building and its shape has been preserved only in the cellar.Jakaša-Borić, Bilušić-Dumbović, 121 Throughout the history, the owners of this estate were Zrinski family, Čikulin family, Sermage family, Festetics family and Erdödy family. Almost each of these owners gradually expanded the manor to the east. In second half of 18th century Peter Troilo Sermage turned the manor house into a castle and added several economic buildings such as barns, granaries and circular threshing machine to the estate. By 19th century, castle became the property of Alexander Erdödy. The same family eventually sold the estate to ban Josip Jelačić in 1851. = Jelačić period = Although law of Triune Kingdom of Croatia, formally obliged each candidate for position of Ban, to possess its own estate on Croatian soil, this criterion was briefly ignored upon Jelačić's appointment due to Revolutions of 1848. This was subsequently commented by Jelačić using following words: > \\"I have always lived for my Homeland and everything I did, I did out of > loyalty and fidelity, not for those 400 000 forints that I spent for buying > the land estate in sense of our Constitution, which asks for Croatian ban to > also be the landowner in our Kingdom.\\"Mijatović, 119 Written agreement on sale of the estate was made on March 23, 1852, despite Jelačić de facto buying the estate a year earlier. The new owner had both estate and the castle reconstructed and annexed. He also further extended the castle 18 meters eastwards adding the east wing, while cellar, façade and the upper level were decorated. In 1855 construction of Neo-gothic chapel of St. Joseph started and it was finished after some two months of work. Following completion, the chapel was blessed on May 25, 1855. by an archbishop of Zagreb Juraj Haulik. The same year, on Christmas, Josip Jelačić's wife - countess Sofia, gave birth to their daughter Anica on the estate, for which occasion, the banner was raised on top of the manor.Mijatović, 116 However, little Anica soon died as an infant so Jelačić had her body buried Inside St. Joseph chapel.Mijatovć, 119-120 He also planned to build the family tomb on the estate, but died in 1859, before being able to execute this. In his last will, he expressed a wish to be buried next to his daughter in the estate chapel. After the death of Josip Jelačić, the estate became the property of his brother Đuro, who continued managing it and finally completed tomb wished by Josip in 1884. The design for this was made by prominent Austrian architect Hermann Bollé. The construction of the tomb was made out of unused stone, taken from reconstruction of Zagreb cathedral, which was badly damaged in 1880 Zagreb earthquake.Mijatović, 120 After Đuro's death, the castle was inherited by his daughters Anka and Vera. In 1919. countess Vera Jelačić donated the family collection of weapons and paintings from Novi dvori, to what was then Croatian People's Museum.Mijatović, 121 The daughters bequeathed the estate to the Croatian people in 1934. Although Đuro, Hermina, and much of the Jelačić family were initially buried in family arcade in Zagreb's Mirogoj cemetery, their remains were taken to the tomb in Novi Dvori in 1933, by the wish of countess Anka Jelačić. During the night on July 24, 1935, the tomb was looted by unknown vandals. = World War II and after = After the Yugoslav defeat in the April War of 1941, and formation of Nazi puppet state Independent State of Croatia, the castle became a residence of Ante Pavelić. In that period a terrace was added to the southern side of the manor.Jakaša-Borić, Bilušić- Dumbović, 120 After the end of war, the estate was turned into an Agricultural High School. The castle was renovated during the 1960s, while school continued to operate on this location until 1977., when it relocated to Zagreb leaving the estate empty. The tombs were looted again by vandals in 1987. who also, in this occasion desecrated the remains of Josip Jelačić, his brother Antun and his little daughter Anica.Mijatović, 121. Billboard showing the looks of Novi Dvori manor and other buildings after the restoration = Contemporary period = In May 2017, it was announced that City of Zaprešić secured 40 million HRK from European Union funds in order to completely renovate the manor.

Joseph Bonaparte, elder brother of Napoleon I, was installed in his stead: Joseph conferred the title \\"Prince of Naples\\" to be hereditary on his children and grandchildren. When Joseph became King of Spain in 1808, Napoleon appointed his brother-in-law Joachim Murat to take his place. Murat was later deposed by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after striking at Austria in the Neapolitan War, in which he was decisively defeated at the Battle of Tolentino. Although the Napoleonic kings were officially styled King of Naples and Sicily, British domination of the Mediterranean made it impossible for the French to gain control of Sicily, where Ferdinand had fled, and French power was confined to the mainland Kingdom of Naples alone while Ferdinand continued to reside in and rule the Kingdom of Sicily. Joseph Bonaparte as King of Naples, 1808 Joachim Murat as King of Naples, c.1812 In the modernising spirit of the French Revolution, the regimes of Joseph and Murat implemented a programme of sweeping reforms to the organisation and structure of the ancient feudal kingdom. On 2 August 1806 Feudalism was abolished and all the rights and privileges of the nobility suppressed.Procacci, 266. The practice of tax-farming was also ended and the collection of all taxes slowly brought under direct central control as the government brought-out the contractors and compensated those who had lost their feudal tax-collecting privileges with bonds.Connelly, 80. The first public street-lighting system, modelled on that of Paris, was also installed in the city of Naples during Joseph's reign. Continuing the anti-clerical sentiment of the Revolution, Church property was confiscated en masse and auctioned off as Biens nationaux (in compensation for the loss of feudal privileges, the nobles received a certificate which could be exchanged for such properties). However, not all church land was sold immediately, with some retained to support charitable and educational foundations.Connelly, 81. Most monastic orders were also suppressed and their funds transferred to the royal treasury, however, although both the Benedictines and Jesuits were dissolved, Joseph preserved the Franciscans.Connelly, 78. In 1808 Joachim Murat, husband of Napoleon's sister Caroline, was granted the crown of Naples by the Emperor after Joseph had reluctantly accepted the throne of Spain. Murat joined Napoleon in the disastrous campaign of 1812 and, as Napoleon's downfall unfolded, increasingly sought to save his own kingdom. Opening communications with the Austrians and British, Murat signed a treaty with the Austrians on January 11, 1814 in which, in return for renouncing his claims to Sicily and providing military support to the Allies in the war against his former Emperor, Austria would guarantee his continued possession of Naples.Connelly, 304. Marching his troops north, Murat's Neapolitans joined the Austrians against Napoleon's stepson, Eugene de Beauharnais, Viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy. After initially opening secret communications with Eugene to explore his options of switching sides again, Murat finally committed to the allied side and attacked Piacenza.Connelly, 310. Upon Napoleon's abdication on 11 April 1814 and Eugene's armistice, Murat returned to Naples, however his new allies trusted him little and he became convinced that they were about to depose him. Upon Napoleon's return in 1815, Murat struck out from Rimini at the Austrian forces in northern Italy, in what he considered a pre-emptive attack. The powers at the Congress of Vienna assumed he was in concert with Napoleon, but this was in fact the opposite of the truth, as Napoleon was then seeking to secure recognition of his return to France through promises of peace, not war. On 2 April Murat entered Bologna without a fight, but soon he was in headlong retreat as the Austrians crossed the Po at Occhiobello and his Neapolitan forces disintegrated at the first sign of a skirmish. Murat withdrew to Cesena, then Ancona, then Tolentino.Connelly, 323. At the Battle of Tolentino on 3 May 1815 the Neapolitan army was swept aside and, though Murat escaped to Naples, his position was irrecoverable and he soon continued his flight, leaving Naples for France. Ferdinand IV & VI was soon restored and the Napoleonic kingdom came to an end. The Congress of Vienna confirmed Ferdinand in possession of both his ancient kingdoms, Naples and Sicily, but under the new unified title of King of the Two Sicilies, which would survive until 1861.

The film had its premiere in Vienna on 11 May 2012, and was released online on 14 May 2012 as a contribution to the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia on 17 May 2012. The film stars Michael Glantschnig, Josef Mohamed, Günther Sturmlechner and Harald Bodingbauer. Homophobia is set in the 1990s during the winter solstice, and is about a young Austrian soldier, Michael (played by Glantschnig), who attempts suicide using a firearm, because of bullying over his homosexuality, during a watch on the Austrian-Hungarian border on the last night of his seven-week military service. Plot According to Vangardist, the film is set in the 1990s during the winter solstice and shows the \\"contrasts [of] the hyper-masculine world of military service\\". It begins with a scene at night, showing Raphael (played by Josef Mohamed) pushing a gun into Michael's mouth (played by Michael Glantschnig); both are wearing military uniforms. The film then introduces to Michael, a young, gay Austrian soldier, in a military camp, who wakes up, vomits into a toilet, and starts crying. Entering the bathroom for a shower, Jürgen (played by Günther Sturmlechner) holds him from behind while Raphael turns cold water on him. After throwing Jürgen to the floor, Michael disappears to the cloakroom. Jürgen approaches him again and claims to know \\"all about [his] little secret,\\" his homosexuality, while he touches Michael's body, and then throws him against a wall. When asked later by the commanding officer (played by Harald Bodingbauer) about the resulting wound on his eyebrow, Michael lies, telling him he slipped in the bathroom. Preparing for a watch on the Austrian- Hungarian border on the last night of a seven-week military service, Michael hears Jürgen joking about homosexuality with two fellow platoon mates. Michael finally arrives with his duty partner Raphael at a tent in a forest for their eight-hour watch. Later when they sit together on what appears to be a bank, Raphael starts talking about his girlfriend, but seems unsure about his sexual orientation. He also apologises for his bad behaviour towards Michael and offers him a cigarette. After smoking cannabis with Raphael, Michael, who experiences a rush from the drug, attempts to kiss him. Raphael fends him off aggressively. After this, Michael takes his gun and walks away, first pointing it at Raphael, and then wanting to commit suicide by shooting himself because of the bullying by his fellow soldiers. A desperate Raphael demands that Michael put the gun down, and finally manages to get the weapon out of his hands. Michael then falls to the ground and starts to cry. The film ends with Raphael hugging him. Background and production Prior to the release of Homophobia, Schmidinger released the gay-themed short film The Boy Next Door in 2008. One of his inspirations for Homophobia was the suicide of Jamey Rodemeyer in 2011, attributed to bullying due to his homosexuality, and a video Rodemeyer had submitted for the Internet-based 501(c)3 non-profit It Gets Better Project. A casting call for the film was issued online, with actors sending \\"motivational\\" videos stating why they wished to join the cast. Although the title of the film was deemed generic by the audience, Schmidinger defended it as it \\"provides a way of reaching a broader audience with a single word: search engine optimization meets art\\". For filming, a Canon EOS C300 was chosen for its ability to film low light scenes, and the camera's sharpness. Electric generator trucks were used for some low light sequences. With the local mayor's support, the film was shot at a former tobacco factory in Linz that had been repurposed to host film and other art productions, and the woods surrounding it. Several scenes have the actors' faces very near to the camera. For the filming of a bathroom scene, several male actors had to be nude. Money for the film's production was raised through crowdfunding on the Indiegogo website, where $10,100 was donated in 69 days. People who donated were invited to be a \\"dynamic\\" part of the project and to visit a Facebook forum, where they could review the ongoing production and make suggestions. The project was also supported financially by the Queeren Kleinprojektetopf organization in Vienna. The box office earnings were donated to the It Gets Better project. Homophobia was originally intended to have a happy ending, but it was removed by Schmidinger. In an interview, he confessed, \\"a cheesy ending was out of the question for me. ... The happy endings of feature movies never really happen in real life. Still, I think and hope that the audience will be left with a positive feeling at the end of the film.\\" During a behind-the-scenes video, it was revealed that the final scene was to have featured Michael and Raphael meeting as friends at a train station after their military service. Release Homophobia's premiere was a special event at the Gartenbaukino in Vienna on 11 May 2012 at around 21:00. The audience included the film's supporters and invited guests from politics, media and business. A meat market, \\"Homophobia Is Not Invited\\", was also launched supporting the release of the film. Homophobia was uploaded onto Schmidinger's YouTube channel on 14 May 2012 as a contribution to the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia on 17 May 2012. It was also intended to be shown in schools to \\"facilitate a dialogue about homophobia and self-acceptance,\\" and was handed both offline and online to other film festivals. For marketing purposes, Manuel Dünfründt was hired as a publicist. Response to the \\"abrupt\\" and \\"gloomy\\" ending was primarily negative. Controversy In February 2017, the bathroom scene sparked controversy for possibly featuring a 25-year-old man in the background, known as Harald Z. Under the alias of Harald Hitler, he had been arrested that month for glorifying Adolf Hitler, by impersonating him in Braunau am Inn, a punishable offense in Austria. When interviewed by Vice magazine, Schmidinger responded, \\"We think he is it. We do not really know him and had no contact with him after the [film's] premiere in 2012. At that time, we searched online for extras and he showed up. We are just a bit perplexed.\\" Harald Z. is credited as part of the film's cast.

The 106th episode overall of the series, it was directed by Tony Goldwyn and written by Matt Byrne and Mark Fish. The installment received mixed reviews from television criticism and was watched by 5.23 million Americans.  Plot  Picking up immediately after the events of the previous episode, Fitz and Olivia discuss the latter's decision to free her mother from custody. Despite being initially angry at each other, they have sex to celebrate Fitz's last day in office. The following morning, Maya manages to distract NSA agents and to remove the tracker which was implanted in her neck, thus narrowing further actions from Olivia and Jake. Mellie decides not to cancel the oath ceremony, to put Jake as chief of operations and to duplicate the protection of her and Luna's children. Fitz and Rowan get ready to restart B613 and put Fitz in charge. At the ceremony, everything goes perfectly well, though Olivia received a call from her mother, who was at the top of a building ready to shoot someone who was not Mellie. When Maya was about to tell Olivia who had contacted her, Rowan knocked her out. Meanwhile, at OPA, Huck discovers that one of the high-ranking people hired Maya to kill Mellie. Since everything went well, President Mellie continues with the ceremony and the parade. Afterwards, Olivia argues with Fitz about he ordering Rowan to overthrow Maya. Mellie, enraged by the argument, leaves the room to choose her dress. Fitz's assistant calls him, saying that David is on the phone, wanting to talk to him. Fitz leaves, leaving Olivia alone and willing to argue. Quinn asks Abby to take over OPA, saying that her baby needs a normal place to grow and live. Olivia goes to David's office and threatens him to tell her about what he and Fitz were talking about earlier. Soon after, Olivia is shown in the White House; she reveals to Fitz that she has already discovered about the reconstitution of B613. She asks him what made him decide to collaborate on Rowan's plan, and Fitz reveals that he will be the Command. Olivia is shocked, but still convinces him to give up the plan. They say goodbye since Fitz is leaving to Vermont to run his organization. He leaves and, shortly after, Olivia shows up in the backyard. They kiss in front of a crowd of photographers. Fitz gets on the Marine One helicopter, leaving a sad Olivia behind. Back at OPA, Olivia, Quinn, Huck and Charlie investigate on who was the high-ranking VIP who ordered Mellie's assassination. Olivia soon realizes that Luna Vargas is the one who was behind everything that happened to Francisco, to Mellie and to Cyrus. She runs to confront Luna, but the latter assumes that Olivia can't send her to jail since she's the Vice President and this could ruin Mellie's presidency. At the hospital, Olivia visits her mother, who convinces her not to let anyone stand between Olivia and the White House. The conversation between mother and daughter leaves Olivia eager to act. At night, Abby persuades Quinn to stay in Washington and run OPA, saying that she will help in every way to take care of the unborn child. Quinn cries as Charlie enters the room. She tells him that she's pregnant and they hug, as Huck blankly watches them. At the Oval, Mellie has an emotive moment in the renovated office and, following, goes to Cyrus's to invite him to go to the ball as her date. Olivia finishes her preparation to the ball and Jake knocks her door. She opens it to tell him that she knows how to handle Luna's situation. The two invite Luna to a private room and Olivia tells her that she's going to die right there. Luna call her agents, but Jake reveals that the agents are his, and that they're not going to do anything. Olivia presents her two forms of dying: committing suicide and being recognized as a saint, or being murdered and thrown somewhere by Jake and being investigated and then called a murderer for having ordered Francisco's death. Luna complains that she did not kill Francisco. She explains that she paid someone to make him lose since she did not want to be First Lady, but they ended up killing him. However, Olivia argues that it is a lie since Luna asked not to put her children onstage the night of the death of Frankie, since she already knew that something bad would happen. Luna takes the deadly pills after Olivia agrees that she isn't pure evil. Afterwards, Olivia asks Mellie to sign a paper while Cyrus silently observes. Unbeknownst to Mellie, she was signing the papers to fund a new B613, which Olivia is commanding. Olivia goes to her father's paleontology lab to tell him she's the new Command. She tells him that she loves him and that she wants Sunday dinners. Olivia repeats Rowan's words from before: family is a weakness. Rowan explains that Olivia is not a smart prey, she has always been the predator. Olivia and Cyrus meet on the staircase of the Lincoln Memorial. Olivia discovers that Cyrus persuaded Luna to take control after he repeated exactly the same sentences Luna said while explaining herself earlier. Cyrus, on the other hand, succeeds to understand that Olivia took over B613.

The table read for the season finale occurred on April 13, 2017, as revealed by Kerry Washington. Filming for the episode ended on April 29, 2017.

The grey regions are lower density fields. The four densest dune fields are shown in black. The prime meridian is at the bottom of the map. Siton Undae is shown on the southernmost black patch left, between longitude 291.38°E to 301.4°E (43.98°W – 57.08°W). Siton Undae is one of the largest and densest dune fields in the vicinity of Planum Boreum, the Martian northern polar ice-cap. It is named after one of the classical albedo features on Mars. Its name was officially approved by IAU on 20 March 2007. It extends from latitude 73.79°N to 77.5°N and from longitude 291.38°E to 301.4°E (43.98°W – 57.08°W). Its centre is located at latitude 75.55°N, longitude 297.28E (62.72°W), and has a diameter of . Siton Undae is part of a cluster of sand-seas (undae), which along with Hyperboreae, and Abalos Undae, overlay the lowlands of Vastitas Borealis. Siton Undae superposes the deepest basin of the northern region of Mars and contains amorphous silica-coated glass-rich dunes. It is theorised that the formation of Siton Undae may have occurred during early erosion incidents of the Planum Boreum cavi unit, and that Rupes Tenuis may also have been a sand source, although it is now depleted. Other dune fields sharing the same formation history include Olympia and Aspledon Undae. Siton Undae is the southernmost of the densest northern circumpolar dune fields and its presence indicates effective sand transport and accumulation from sand sources to the north and west. Siton Undae, along with Abalos, and Hyperboreae Undae, is also a tributary to less dense dune fields that continue all the way to the Martian prime meridian. Dune characteristics Siton Undae Spectral analysis of the dunes of the circumpolar ergs, including Siton Undae, using the OMEGA instrument on board the European Mars Express orbiter, indicates that 80 to 90 percent of these sands are composed of volcanic glass produced by eruptions of volcanoes situated in Martian glaciers. These ratios of glass and crystalline material are similar to those obtained in Iceland from eruptions of volcanoes below the ice. It is also theorised that significant amounts of granular glass may have been transferred to Vastitas Borealis, and Siton Undae, by catastrophic floods originating from Chryse Planitia, Valles Marineris, Juventae Chasma, and the southern Acidalia region of Mars. The dunes of Siton Undae contain amorphous silica-coated glass-rich sand. The lack of evidence for the presence of volcanoes in the region of Planum Boreum, as well as the absence of evidence of any large-scale melt deposits due to crater impact, suggests that these silica-coated deposits may have formed by alteration of the basaltic sands through acidic action. Further, it is theorised that acidic alteration of glassy deposits may have been a common conversion mechanism on Mars, especially at high latitudes.

It was built by business man Theodore Holdengarde in the 1920s. Construction Theodore Albert Edward Holdengarde (born Theodore Garde, 1878-1947) was a South African-born man of British descent who ran a successful construction business and was mayor of Bulawayo in 1938 and 1940. Arriving in Southern Rhodesia between 1908 and 1910, he bought 100 acres of land outside Bulawayo and constructed the castle over a period of time. Inspired by medieval romanticism, the owner worked on the castle at weekends with a small team, at times demolishing and rebuilding to follow his changing plans. After the death of Holdengarde in 1947, and his wife in 1967, the castle briefly fell into disrepair before being taken over by their son, Paul, an ex-WWII pilot, who renovated the premises. However, failing health and old age meant that he was unable to maintain the castle and protect it from squatters, satanists and arsonists, who burnt down the reception in 1974. Current use Soon before his death in 1988, Paul sold the castle to Chiredzi businessman Digby Nesbitt, who led renovation of the castle. The building reopened in 1990 as a luxury hotel.

Born to a French-Irish trapper and his Cree wife, she spent her early childhood moving frequently between fur trading stations in Manitoba. When her father was promoted to factor (i.e. manager) of Fort St. James in what would later become British Columbia, she met a mixed-race trapper of Scottish and Bajan Creole heritage, who would become her husband. As he progressed from clerk to Chief Factor and governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island and later the Colony of British Columbia, she served as a nurse and midwife at his various posts. She gave birth to thirteen children, raising six to adulthood. Her children were brought up in the Victorian European style, though she insured that they were schooled in the cultural heritage of their First Nations ancestors. Early life Amelia Connolly was born on 1 January 1812, probably near Thompson, Manitoba to Miyo Nipiy (also known as Susanna Pas de Nom, i.e. Susanna the Nameless) and William Connolly. Her father was a trapper who worked for the North West Company (NWC) from Lachine, Quebec and though he was partly of Irish heritage, the family spoke French (see Métis French). Her mother, a Cree woman, was the daughter of an influential tribal chief who lived along the Rat River. It was common in the North American fur trade for men of European ancestry to marry indigenous women à la façon du pays (\\"according to the custom of the country\\"). These common-law marriages helped solidify alliances and so formed \\"the basis for a fur trade society\\". In Amelia's youth, the family moved often, traveling between fur trading posts. In 1818, William was made a full partner in the NWC and relocated his family to Cumberland House near the identically named trading post in Saskatchewan operated by the Hudson Bay Company. The six siblings were multi-lingual, speaking Swampy Cree, and probably learned Saulteaux from their mother, and French with their father. In 1821, the Hudson Bay and North West Companies amalgamated and William became a chief trader. In 1825, he would become the Chief Factor of Fort St. James in the New Caledonia District and once again relocated his family. Soon after the family's arrival, James Douglas arrived at the post to serve as a clerk to William. James was the son of Martha Ann (née Ritchie, later Tefler) a free coloured woman from Barbados, and John Douglas, a Scottish merchant and planter from Glasgow. He was born in New Amsterdam in the Dutch colony (technically the Batavian Republic) of Berbice, which within a month of his birth would be occupied by the British and soon become part of British Guiana. On 27 April 1828 Connolly and Douglas married in a wikihtowin arrangement, or customary marriage, which was officiated by her father. In an often-told anecdote, which changes with retelling, the new bride saved her husband from an attack by an enraged Chief Kwah, who was avenging the death of a kinsman, by tossing trade goods to compensate for the chief's loss. Middle life In 1829, James was transferred to Fort Vancouver, the headquarters of the Columbia Department in what became Vancouver, Washington (i.e. the United States). Because Amelia Douglas had given birth to their first child on 10 November 1829 and the child was sick, she did not join him until the following year, after their child died. Over the next eighteen years, while the couple lived at the fort, she bore ten more children. She was described as shy and retiring, but friendly with the other mixed-marriage wives at the fort. In part because most of the mixed-race women were not fluent in English, but also because of the prejudices of the white wives at the fort, there was little mingling between the native-born and European-born wives. There was a custom prevalent in the fort that the officers and wives entertained separately, even to dining nightly in separate spaces. In between giving birth and caring for her own children, Douglas acted as a nurse and midwife and in that capacity, served both native and white women. In 1836, with the arrival of a group of clergymen and their wives, the situation became tense, because the clergy were outspoken in their disapproval of the many common-law marriages. To avoid difficulties, on 28 February 1837 the Douglas' marriage was solemnized, in a legal ceremony held at Fort Vancouver by Reverend Herbert Beaver, according to the rites of the Church of England. Douglas had learned to read and write, possibly from her father but more probably from James, and though she enjoyed reading, she wrote with difficulty. She taught her children until a school finally arrived at the fort in 1844, giving the girls lessons in beadwork, embroidery and sewing as well. She also told them the stories of her Cree ancestors. In 1848, the family received notice that James was to be transferred to Fort Victoria and made pro tempore governor of the new Colony of Vancouver Island. They were to depart in May 1849 and leaving their home and the burial place of the five children who had died during their tenure at Fort Vancouver was difficult for Douglas. Her most recent infant, Rebecca, was suffering from typhus and Douglas nursed her on the journey, though she would die within months of the family's arrival at their new home. They purchased land upon which they would build the first private residence on the island and Douglas befriended Josette Work, a métis of Nez Perce heritage and wife of the Chief Factor John Work. In 1851, she gave birth to her twelfth child, suffering what would later be diagnosed as consumption (tuberculosis). The following year she moved into their new home. As there had been at Fort Vancouver, racial prejudice as well as social biases caused tensions at Fort Victoria, which did not abate even when James was appointed as second governor of the colony in 1851. In 1854, Douglas gave birth to her thirteenth and last child, though like most of the other births, the baby did not survive. Of her thirteen children, only six survived beyond the age of four and only four outlived her. In 1858, James was made the first governor of the Colony of British Columbia. The promotion placed Douglas more in the public eye and increased her desire to leave the official duties to James. The attacks on both Douglases were unrelenting, and they were \\"criticized for entertaining too little, for entertaining too much, and for entertaining the wrong people\\". The charges were somewhat ironic, as the separation of officers and wives was as marked as it had been back at Fort Vancouver. As she had at their previous posts, she served as a nurse and was fond of gardening and preserving the harvest. In 1862, John Connolly, Amelia's older brother, instituted a lawsuit against Julia Woolrich, who had inherited William Connolly's estate as his widow, after Connolly abandoned his métis family and married her. In effect, the abandonment and remarriage of their father, had rendered his children by Miyo Nipiy illegitimate. He won his initial case, and Douglas began to participate more in society. James retired in 1864 and was knighted. Thereafter, Douglas became known as Lady Douglas and was feted at a dinner in her honor held separately from her husband's tribute. Later life Woolrich appealed the legitimacy case through the Canadian Courts of Appeals and Revision and finally to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Between 1867 and 1869 when the appeal on the lawsuit was pending, Douglas removed herself from public scrutiny and was involved in raising her recently deceased daughter Cecelia's children. The marriage of their parents was upheld and a settlement was finally reached. The outcome improved Douglas' health and increased her sociability. She had learned to be a proper Victorian wife, wore European fashions and participated in the customs traditional for ladies of the era, such as nursing, care of the poor, and even parlour games. Her youngest daughter, Martha was sent to England for schooling and when James died in 1877, Martha returned to live with her mother. Douglas retired from society and spent her remaining years in the company of her family, relating legends and stories of her Cree ancestry to her grandchildren. Death and legacy Douglas died on 8 January 1890 in the James Bay Community, British Columbia, Canada. Flags were flown at half-mast, the day following her death and her funeral, held on 15 January was widely attended. She was buried in the Ross Bay Cemetery. In 1992, Douglas College, in New Westminster opened an art gallery named in her honor. Douglas' life adds to the historical record as in many ways it is similar to the experiences of other mixed-blood women, while at the same time, it allows an evaluation of the societal and racial prejudices against métis women even at the upper levels of society.

Background Father Max Lowenthal counsels Senator Harry S. Truman (October 20, 1937) John Lowenthal was born on May 14, 1925, in New York City. His father was Max Lowenthal and mother Eleanor Mack, niece of Judge Julian Mack (for whom his father had clerked). He had two siblings David Lowenthal and Elizabeth (Betty) Lowenthal Levin. Lowenthal studied at Columbia College and the Columbia University School of Law, where he obtained his law degree in 1950. Career =Government service= Harry S. Truman, for whom Lowenthal worked briefly, with Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill at Potsdam (July 1945) In the 1940s, Lowenthal served in the U.S. Navy. In the late 1940s (overlapping with the Hiss Case), during the Truman administration, he worked in the White House, where his father also worked (unofficially–\\"in the basement\\" ), according to White House staff Stephen J. Spingarn. =Academia= By 1978, Lowenthal had become a professor of law at Rutgers University. Later, he taught at the New School for Social Research and CUNY Law School at Queens College. Hiss Case Alger Hiss (1950), lifelong friend of the Lowenthals In 1949, Lowenthal volunteered to the defense during Alger Hiss's two perjury trials. In the 1970s, after the release of suppressed FBI documents about the case, Lowenthal, by then a Rutgers University law professor, published an analysis of what this new evidence revealed. =Documentary= In 1978 while on sabbatical, Lowenthal made a documentary film called The Trials of Alger Hiss. =Volkogonov= In August 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Lowenthal asked General Dmitry Antonovich Volkogonov, who had become President Yeltsin's military advisor and the overseer of all the Soviet intelligence archives, to request the release of any Soviet files on the Hiss case. Both former President Nixon and the director of his presidential library, John H. Taylor, wrote similar letters, though their full contents are not yet publicly available. Russian archivists responded by reviewing their files, and in late 1992 reported back that they had found no evidence Hiss ever engaged in espionage for the Soviet Union nor that he was a member of the Communist Party. However, Volkogonov subsequently stated he spent only two days on the search and had mainly relied on the word of KGB archivists. \\"What I saw gave me no basis to claim a full clarification\\", he said. Referring to Hiss's lawyer, he added, \\"John Lowenthal pushed me to say things of which I was not fully convinced.\\" General- Lieutenant Vitaly Pavlov, who ran Soviet intelligence work in North America in the late 1930s and early 1940s for the NKVD said that Hiss never worked for the USSR as one of his agents. ; and: In 2003, retired Russian intelligence official General Julius Kobyakov disclosed that it was he who had actually searched the files for Volkogonov. Kobyakov stated that Hiss did not have a relationship with SVR predecessor organizations, although Hiss was accused of being with the GRU, a military intelligence organization separate from SVR predecessors. In 2007, Svetlana Chervonnaya, a Russian researcher who had been studying Soviet archives since the early 1990s, argued that based on documents she reviewed, Hiss was not implicated in spying. In May 2009, at a conference hosted by the Wilson Center, Mark Kramer, director of Cold War Studies at Harvard University at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, stated that he did not \\"trust a word [Kobyakov] says.\\"The Vassiliev Notebooks and Soviet Intelligence Operations in the U.S video transcript of day 1, at 2:24:42 Wilson Center On Demand May 20, 2009 At the same conference, historian Ronald Radosh reported that while researching the papers of Marshal Voroshilov in Moscow, he and Mary Habeck had encountered two GRU (Soviet military intelligence) files referring to Alger Hiss as \\"our agent\\".The Vassiliev Notebooks and Soviet Intelligence Operations in the U.S video transcript of day 2, Part I at 1:43:10 Wilson Center On Demand May 21, 2009 = Vassiliev= Alexander Vassiliev. In the Autumn 2000 issue of the journal Intelligence and National Security, Lowenthal published the article \\"Venona and Alger Hiss,\\" which \\"claimed not only to show that ALES was not Hiss, but that all the VENONA cables were unreliable.\\" (In 2003, U.S. Air Force historian Eduard Mark published a rebuttal, also in Intelligence and National Security that used VENONA 1822 to trace \\"ALES\\" as working for State (1945), with relatives (Donald Hiss, brother) also working in the federal government, had been a GRU agent since the mid-1930s (with Whittaker Chambers in the Ware Group, had attended the Yalta Conference, and had returned from travel to the US by 30 March 1945 – all descriptions which fit Alger Hiss. In his 2000 article, Lowenthal had accused Aleksandr Vassiliev, co-author of The Haunted Wood (1999) with Allen Weinstein, of sloppiness. In July 2001, Vassiliev sued Lowenthal indirectly for libel by suing Frank Cass & Co., publisher of Intelligence and National Security, in the High Court of Justice in London. In January 2003, Frank Cass's lawyers offered Alexander Vassiliev to settle the monetary claim for more than 2,000 British pounds and promised not to republish the John Lowenthal article. Vassiliev rejected the offer. In May 2003 Frank Cass proposed to settle the case for 7,500 pounds, but Vassiliev rejected that offer, too. The trial Vassiliev vs Frank Cass started 9 June 2003 and concluded on 13 June 2003, with Judge David Eady presiding. Frank Cass & Co. prevailed on the basis of \\"fair comment.\\" =Hiss Papers= By 2003, Lowenthal had helped son Tony Hiss prepare the Alger Hiss Papers before offering them to the Harvard Law School's library. Personal and death Oldest part of Chiswick, UK, where Lowenthal lived in later life (15th-century Old Burlington pub) Lowenthal was a cellist: he made his last appearance in the year of his death at the Salzburg Music Festival. Lowenthal married Anne Lowenthal of Manhattan and Bridgewater. They had two children: Anne Lowenthal Hermans and James Lowenthal. His later-life partner was Patricia Lousada. In 1999, he was living at The Tides, Chiswick Mall, London W4. He died of esophageal cancer age 78 on September 9, 2003, in London.

Biography  Di Bartolo was born in Palermo in 1900, and graduated as a sea captain at the Palermo Nautical Institute at age 17. World War I was ongoing at the time, and Di Bartolo immediately embarked as deck officer on Italian merchant ships; on 18 July 1918 his ship, the steamer Adria, was torpedoed and sunk off Tunisia by the German submarine UB 50. For his behaviour during the sinking, he was given a commendation by the Ministry of the Navy. After the end of World War I, Di Bartolo continued his career as a civilian sea captain, initially with the Navigazione Generale Italiana, then with the Società Italiana di Servizi Marittimi (SITMAR) and finally with Tirrenia di Navigazione. In April 1940, two months before Italy's entry into World War II, Di Bartolo became \\"complementary officer\\" of the Regia Marina (ufficiale di complemento, roughly comparable to an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve) with the rank of Lieutenant. In July 1940, after Italy had entered the war, Di Bartolo was called up for service and given command of the 7th Minesweeper Flotilla, based in Porto Empedocle and part of the 4th Minesweeper Group. In April 1942, Di Bartolo was given command of the 25th Minesweeper Flotilla, based in Tripoli, Libya. On 19 January 1943, a few days before Tripoli's fall to the Allies, the flotilla received order to evacuate Tripoli and reach Sicily. At 18:00 on that day, Di Bartolo left the Libyan port flying his flag on the minesweeper RD 36, leading a group of eleven minesweepers and small auxiliary vessels. About 20 miles east of Zuwarah, the flotilla was intercepted by the British destroyers Kelvin and Javelin. RD 36, whose size was about one tenth of the attacking destroyers' and whose only armament were a 76 mm gun and two 6,5 mm machine guns, headed towards the destroyers and opened fire on them, in an attempt to buy time for the other ships to retreat towards the coast. Massively outgunned, RD 36 was hit multiple times and sank; Di Bartolo perished with his ship and the entire crew. During the following hours, Kelvin and Javelin proceeded to hunt down and sink all the other vessels of the flotilla. For his sacrifice in the attempt to defend his flotilla against a fairly superior enemy, Di Bartolo was posthumously awarded a Gold Medal of Military Valor.

The piece ends with an image of the night sky at the edge of the earth, shimmering with distant lights and insects near to hand.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for five pianos and an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, two percussionists, harp, and strings. Reception Edge of the World has received modest praise from music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"Working within a jumpy, post-minimalist style, Muhly turns the five keyboards into a kind of hyper-piano: one or more pianists take the lead in interlocking patterns, the five functioning rather like members of a musical relay race. Much of the score is driven by percolating ostinatos that, in the second movement, give way to a folksy tune that could have been the main title of a 1950s Hollywood western.\\" He added, \\"Through it all, your ear is held by Muhly's knack for creating imaginative textures and fields of sun-dappled colors that are constantly shifting in ways you don't always expect. [It] was fun to hear.\\" Gerald Fisher of the Chicago Classical Review praised moments of the orchestration, despite noting, \\"The Edge of the World is not groundbreaking and shows influences from Philip Glass and, more to the point, the early Steve Reich of Music for 18 Musicians. Although there are moments of Muhly’s individual voice, the work overall feels like a minor effort with some nice touches of orchestration.\\" References Category:Compositions by Nico Muhly Category:2011 compositions Category:Piano concertos Category:Concertos for multiple instruments ","title":"Edge of the World (composition)"},{"id":"55051590","text":"The Ohio Drug Price Relief Act was a ballot initiative in Ohio that would have made the state pay no higher of a price for prescription drugs than the lowest price that the United States Department of Veterans Affairs pays for them.

His godfathers are Emmanuel Petit (Soccer champion 1998) and Olivier Lapidus (son of seamstress Ted Lapidus). For this brand, we are looking at : • A tee-shirt line with Braille writing for both the sighted and the non-sighted. At first, Mason Ewing, himself blind, was incensed by the fact that people sharing his disability were unable to recognize the clothing colours he had chosen, forced to ask assistance in order to dress themselves. Wanting people with disabilities to be self-reliant, he created Braille clothing, T-shirt, polos, etc... On that piece of clothing, baby Madison can be spotted in different situations (on a skateboard, on a BMX, with a guitar) Braille is appended on clothing describing the baby's activity. 5% of all proceeds are given to the Sos Madison International association. • An innovative line of haute couture. It was created by Mason Ewing to honour his mother Marie, herself a seamstress, stylist and model artist. Renown faces such as Legrain-Trapani (Miss France 2017) and Rebecca Ayoko (ex-spokesmodel of Yves Saint-Laurent) have worn these lines of clothing.

Kern and rancher John Sutter killed twenty California Indians. History =Background= In 1839 John Sutter, a Swiss immigrant of German origin, settled in Alta California and began building a fortified settlement on a land grant of 48,827 acres at the confluence of the Sacramento River and the American River. He had been given the land by the Mexican government, supposedly under the stipulation that it would help to keep Americans from occupying the territory. In order to build his fort and develop a large ranching/farming network in the area, Sutter relied on Indian labor. Observers accused him of using \\"kidnapping, food privation, and slavery\\" in order to force Indians to work for him, and generally stated that Sutter held the Indians under inhumane conditions. If Indians refused to work for him, Sutter responded with violence. Theodor Cordua, a German immigrant who leased land from Sutter, wrote: > When Sutter established himself in 1839 in the Sacramento Valley, new > misfortune came upon these peaceful natives of the country. Their services > were demanded immediately. Those who did not want to work were considered as > enemies. With other tribes the field was taken against the hostile Indian. > Declaration of war was not made. The villages were attacked usually before > daybreak when everybody was still asleep. Neither old nor young was spared > by the enemy, and often the Sacramento River was colored red by the blood of > the innocent Indians, for these villages usually were situated at the banks > of the rivers. During a campaign one section of the attackers fell upon the > village by way of land. All the Indians of the attacked village naturally > fled to find protection on the other bank of the river. But there they were > awaited by the other half of the enemy and thus the unhappy people were shot > and killed with rifles from both sides of the river. Seldom an Indian > escaped such an attack, and those who were not murdered were captured. All > children from six to fifteen years of age were usually taken by the greedy > white people. The village was burned down and the few Indians who had > escaped with their lives were left to their fate. In 1846, the American James Clyman wrote that Sutter \\"keeps 600 to 800 Indians in a complete state of Slavery.\\" Despite his promises to the Mexican government, Sutter was hospitable to American settlers entering the region, and provided an impetus for many of them to settle there. The hundreds of thousands of acres which these men took from the Native Americans had been an important source of food and resources. As the White settlers were ranching two million head of livestock, shooting wild game in enormous numbers, and replacing wilderness with wheat fields, available food for Indians in the region diminished. In response, some Indians took to raiding the cattle of White ranchers. In August 1846, an article in The Californian declared that in respect to California Indians, \\"The only effectual means of stopping inroads upon the property of the country, will be to attack them in their villages.\\" =Incident= On February 28, 1847, sixteen Mill Creek men petitioned US Army captain Edward M. Kern for assistance against local Indians so that they would not \\"be forced to abandon our farms and leave our property perhaps something worse.\\" Captain Kern quickly marched up the valley with twenty men to \\"chastise\\" the Indians. There he met up with Sutter, who had assembled thirty men of his own from among the local White settlers. On March 23, 1847, Captain Kern and Sutter took these men into the upper Sacramento Valley. From there the led three separate attacks in which twenty Indians were killed, while Kern and Sutter did not lose a single man. =Repercussions= None of the men faced any repercussions for their actions. Captain Kern claimed in a letter to Commander Joseph B. Hull that his attacks had convinced the Indians to stop taking cattle stock from the Americans. Aftermath On April 22, 1850, the fledgling California state legislature passed the \\"Act for the Government and Protection of Indians,\\" legalizing the kidnapping and forced servitude of Indians by White settlers. In 1851, the civilian governor of California declared, \\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged ... until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected.\\" This expectation soon found its way into law. An 1851 legislative measure not only gave settlers the right to organize lynch mobs to kill Indians, but allowed them to submit their expenses to the government. By 1852 the state had authorized over a million dollars in such claims. In 1856, a San Francisco Bulletin editorial stated, \\"Extermination is the quickest and cheapest remedy, and effectually prevents all other difficulties when an outbreak [of Indian violence] occurs.\\" In 1860 the legislature passed a law expanding the age and condition of Indians available for forced slavery. A Sacramento Daily Union article of the time accused high-pressure lobbyists interested in profiting off enslaved Indians of pushing the law through, gave examples of how wealthy individuals had abused the law to acquire Indian slaves from the reservations, and stated, \\"The Act authorizes as complete a system of slavery, without any of the checks and wholesome restraints of slavery, as ever was devised.\\" On April 27, 1863, five months after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, California outlawed the enslavement of Native Americans. However, slavery and forced labor continued under the name of \\"apprenticeship\\" and other euphemisms at least through 1874.

College Webster played for Indiana State from 1975 to 1978, where he was a roommate of Larry Bird. He is the schools all-time leader in blocked shots (168) and third in rebounds (862). Iceland Webster joined defending Icelandic national champions KR in September 1979. After a disappointing offensive performance in the annual Reykjavík tournament, he played one game for KR in the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup before leaving in November to join Division I club Skallagrímur as player-coach. In 1981, Webster joined Haukar and helped them win Division I in 1983 and achieve promotion to Úrvalsdeild karla. In 1983, foreign players where barred from playing in the Icelandic leagues. Even though Webster was married to an Icelandic woman, with whom he had a child, he did not have an Icelandic citizenship and thus could not play in domestic matches. He received his Icelandic citizenship in May 1984 and took up the Icelandic first name Ívar. In 1985, Webster was a key member of the Haukar team that won the Icelandic Basketball Cup for the first time in the club's history. He scored 26 points in Haukar's 73-71 victory over KR. Haukar defended the title in 1986 by defeating Njarðvík 93-92 in the cup finals, with Webster scoring a game high 28 points. After the season he was named the Úrvalsdeild Defensive Player of the Year. Webster spent the 1986–87 season as a player-coach with Division I club Þór Akureyri. For the season he averaged 21.7 points in 20 games. He rejoined Haukar in 1987 In February 1988, Webster was handed a seven-week suspension from the Icelandic Basketball Federation disciplinary court for punching Breiðablik's player Björn Hjörleifsson on December 12, 1987. Webster was upset with the length of the suspension and the fact that it took almost two months to reach a verdict and as a result, declined to play again for the national team, which is run by the federation. Haukar appealed the verdict to the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland which overturned it on March 11, allowing Webster to play again. A relieved Webster rescinded his decision to not play with the national team again. With Webster back, Haukar made it to the Úrvalsdeild finals against Njarðvík. Haukar won the series 3-0 after beating Njarðvík 92-91 in double overtime in the third game. Webster scored 6 points in the deciding game and blocked Friðrik Ragnarsson's potential game winning shot at the end of the first overtime. Webster joined KR again for the 1988–1989 season and helped them to the third best record in the Úrvalsdeild while leading the league in rebounds per game. In the playoffs KR surprised many by sweeping top seeded Njarðvík in the semi-finals, paving the way for Webster's second straight trip to the Úrvalsdeild finals. In the finals, KR met Keflavík. After splitting the first two games of the series, KR was no match for Keflavík in the third and deciding game, losing 89-72. In June, Webster left KR and rejoined Haukar once again. Icelandic national basketball team Between 1984 and 1987, Webster played 37 games for the Icelandic national basketball team. He was the first foreigner to play for the national team.

Geography  The Königsberg lies between the Lauter and Talbach streams and is part of the North Palatine Uplands. It is one of the highest hills in the county of Kusel. The Konigsberg massif measures about 5 kilometres from north to south and abou 4 kilometres from east to west. Its two main summits are the Leienberg (524 m) and Hahnenkopf (535 m). To the south is the 546-metre-high Selberg. The nearest villages are Wolfstein, Reckweilerhof, Aschbach, Hinzweiler, Oberweiler im Tal, Eßweiler and Rutsweiler an der Lauter. The Königsberg Bizarre tree landscape on the Leienberg The western hillside of the Königsberg  Flora and Fauna  The summit of the Konigsberg is almost entirely wooded; only on the lower slopes, especially in the west between Eßweiler and Oberweiler in the valley and in the northwest between Hinzweiler and Aschbach, are large areas turned over to agriculture. In Wolfstein, on a southern hillside below the castle of New Wolfstein, wine is grown. The woods are predominantly a mix of beech and oak, individual areas are covered in spruce. One unusual feature may be seen on the Leienberg: the hillside above the Taufenbach valley is almost entirely covered in scree. Apart from individual bushes, only crooked oak and pine trees grow, barely higher than a man. Due to the very varied landscape around the Konigsberg, there is a rich variety of fauna. Among the larger mammals are wild boar, roe deer, red fox and badger. Some time ago, mouflon lived here. There are sightings and clues of wildcats, but they are no longer clearly identifiable as resident. In the area around the Konigsberg are the usual, native birds, but they are not obviously limited by the boundaries of the Konigsberg region. The black woodpecker is resident in the Königsberg. There are indications of Eurasian eagle-owl, but they are not definitive. Along the Talbach stream live kingfishers and grey herons; the red kite is also seen here The Königsberg is designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC No. 6411-302, area 1,047 ha).  Leisure options and sights  There is a multitude of tracks in the Königsberg that are suitable for walking. That said, the routes are not straightforward, because the ascent from the valleys is very steep. There is a view of Wolfstein at the Dreimärker which stands almost 300 metres above the village and close to the summit of the Königsberg. There are several chalets on the Königsberg, some of which are managed by local hiking clubs: * The Hinzweiler Hut, by a pond in the Taufen valley between Königsberg and Leienberg. Managed in summer on Sundays and public holidays. * The Laufhauser Weiher (pond) with its barbecue hut. * The CJVM Hut, also a barbecue hut. * The Rutsweiler Hut of the Palatine Forest Club, managed on Sundays. * The hut of the Eßweiler Local History and Transport Society (Heimat- und Verkehrsverein Eßweiler), managed on Sundays. In addition there are simple refuge huts along the trails. In 2010 the Palatine Ridgeway opened, running from Winnweiler over the Donnersberg and the Königsberg to Wolfstein. Parts of the old West Palatinate Way ran through the Königsberg. By the youth hostel above Wolfstein begins the Nordic Walking trail of Königsland: 3 waymarked routes run over the Königsberg and Selberg. On the saddle between the Konigsberg and Selberg lies the airfield of the Luftsportvereins Eßweiler. = Sights = There are 3 castles on the Königsberg: in the west, on a spur above the Talbach, lie the ruins of the Sprengelburg. On the eastern hillside above the town of Wolfstein are the two castles of Old Wolfstein and New Wolfstein. Between Rutsweiler on the Lauter and Wolfstein stands the double church, the last remains of an abandoned village. In Wolfstein lies the entrance to the Kalkbergwerk am Königsberg. At the summit near the Kreuzfeld are the remains of the Schwerspat Mine.  History  A Roman road once ran over the heights of the Konigsberg from the area of Kaiserslautern to Lauterecken.

Their area was afflicted by diseases like smallpox and influenza which ravaged the coastal populations after the establishment of pearling stations on the coast, at Shark Bay and Cossack. Subsequently, 'nigger hunting' to cull hands to work the pearling trawlers, and a system of indentured labour imposed on the tribes found by pastoralists on their runs, effectively decimated people like the Maia by breaking up their kinship groups.

Strayer, which stars Joe E. Brown, Marguerite Chapman, and William Wright. Brown plays the dual roles of a failure turned champion bowler, Jonathan Peckinpaw, and his own grandmother. The original screenplay was written by Karen DeWolf and Connie Lee. Plot Jonathan Peckinpaw is a struggling proprietor of an air conditioning store. When his store is destroyed by an explosion in the shop next door, set off by Nazi spies, his failure is complete. He attempts to enlist in the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Corps. Due to his lack of physical stature, he is refused by each service. His friend, the newspaper reporter Ann Minter, attempts to help him build up his physique by taking up bowling. However, he is terrible at it. Peckinpaw's grandmother is a die-hard gambler, and introduces her grandson to Sam Long, another gambler. Unbeknownst to everyone, Long has developed a sure fire way to cheat at bowling: a radio- controlled bowling ball. He claims to be able to teach Peckinpaw how to bowl in an incredibly short period of time. Using the radio-controlled ball, Peckinpaw becomes an overnight bowling phenomenon, and Long cleans up on the gambling activity betting against him. The Nazi spies, Hans Mueller, Karl Rankin, and Marlene Frederick, who blew up the building next to Peckinpaw's store, are attempting to signal their counterparts offshore. However, something is interfering with their short wave signals. They discover that the interference is coming from the radio signals Long uses to control the bowling ball. They befriend Long and Peckinpaw, and utilize Long's radio to send coded messages to their comrades. The FBI tracks down the signals to the bowling alley, and attempt to capture the spies. In the confusion, the spies escape, but the radio-controlled ball is revealed. The FBI rushes off after the spies, and Long quietly slips away, leaving Peckinpaw alone to deal with a hostile crowd upset over the cheating scam. They attack him and send him to the hospital. Minter visits him in the hospital, and despises him for the cheating scam. However, Peckinpaw convinces her that he knew nothing about the radio- controlled ball, and simply thought he was bowling well. Minter eventually believes him, and helps him escape from the hospital.

Brown as the star and Frank Strayer as the director. By the end of June Marguerite Chapman was announced as the female lead in the film, and the title was changed to Daring Young Man. Filming on the picture took place from June 24 - July 24, 1942. Shortly after filming began, it was revealed that Claire Dodd had joined the cast, and Robert Sparks was producing. Eddie Laughton was added to the cast in early July, as the stooge to Brown's character. Laughton had made a name for himself as a mime on vaudeville, and so had never uttered a word on stage. During the filming of Daring Young Man although he appeared in 85 scenes, he once again never had a word to utter in public. The production ran into difficulty using local bowling alleys to film in, as they were kept busy by off-duty defense workers. To alleviate the problem, the studio built its own bowling alley for the production. By the end of August it was announced that the cast included Joe E. Brown, Marguerite Chapman, Roger Clark, William Wright, Don Douglas, Claire Dodd, Lloyd Bridges, William Forrest, Eddie Laughton, Frank Sully, Ben Carter, and Robert Middlemass. The crew of Strayer as director, Sparks as producer, Abby Berlin as assistant director, Planer as cinematographer, Clark as editor, and Lodge Cunningham in charge of sound was also announced. On September 19 the release date was announced as October 8, The picture was released on that date. The Legion of Decency gave the film an \\"A-1\\" rating, meaning that it was suitable for all audiences. Reception Harrison's Reports gave the film a good review, especially complimenting the performance of Joe E. Brown. They felt that while the film was \\"silly\\", it was very funny. The Motion Picture Herald did not like the film as much as Harrison's, feeling that only fans of Joe E. Brown would enjoy it. They felt the comedy routines were hackneyed, although they felt that the direction got as much out of the script and actors as it could.

He was the father of symphonic music executive Mary Seney Sheldon. Biography George Ingraham Seney was born in 1826 in Newtown (now called Elmhurst, Queens) in what was then Queens County, Long Island. After studying at Wesleyan University, he completed his baccalaureate education at New York University, graduating in 1846. He lived for much of his life in Brooklyn. After a career as a New York City banker, he died in 1893 in Manhattan. Seney married Phoebe A. Mosier in 1849, and fathered ten children. He is best remembered for amassing a substantial collection of pre- Impressionist 19th-century European and American paintings, some of which he gave to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The donation included works by George Inness and Francis Davis Millet. As president of the Metropolitan Bank (New York City), Seney was situated to become a financier of newly chartered railroads. Charters organized or financed by banker Seney and his Seney Syndicate included the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway and the Nickel Plate Road. Seney's financial career reached its height in October 1882 when the Seney Syndicate sold the Nickel Plate to New York Central interests for $7.2 million in gold. The Metropolitan Bank failed, however, in 1884. This permanently shadowed the remainder of Seney's life and career. He was forced to sell most of his art collection in auctions held in 1885 and in 1891. Legacy Seney's bank was a financial backer of the Detroit, Mackinac and Marquette Railroad, a developer of real estate in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan, and the railroad named one of its depots after the New Yorker. The depot became the logging town and resort village of Seney, Michigan, and the regional name gave birth to the Seney National Wildlife Refuge. Seney, in 1881, endowed the construction of what is now Seney Hall at Oxford College of Emory University. In the same year he was a key founder and backer of what became the NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital in Park Slope.

He later served as a judge at the controversial Gambier court- martial in 1809. Life Sutton was born in c. 1758, the son of Thomas Sutton of Moulsey and his wife Jane Hankey. He joined the Royal Navy during the American Revolutionary War as midshipman on board the ship of the line HMS Superb, flagship of Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in the Indian Ocean. He was wounded in an attack on the navy of Hyder Ali on 8 December 1780 at Mangalore, during the Second Anglo-Mysore War and rewarded with command of the sloop HMS Nymph. At the start of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 Sutton was promoted to post captain and took command of first the frigate HMS Romulus and then the ship of the line HMS Egmont, which was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1795 Egmont fought at the battles of Genoa and the Hyères Islands, suffering casualties on the latter when a cannon burst. The following year he served on an operation to attack a French squadron in the harbour of Tunis and Sutton was then particularly tasked with the orderly evacuation of the British base on Corsica following the Spanish entry into the war on the French side. In 1797, Egmont fought in line at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and was then transferred to the Channel Fleet. The same year he married Frances Hotham, daughter of Lord Hotham. Sutton moved to HMS Superb shortly afterwards, and in 1801 was appointed Captain of the Fleet under William Cornwallis. At the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Sutton was given command of HMS Mars before being promoted in 1804 to rear-admiral. He then served as superintendent of Plymouth Dockyard, and in that capacity was called to serve on the panel of judges at the court-martial of Lord Gambier following the chaotic Battle of Basque Roads in the summer of 1809, at which Gambier was controversially acquitted.Gurney, 1809 In October 1809 he was promoted to vice-admiral and shortly afterwards was appointed commander-in-chief of the Halifax station.

It features separate Document Type Definitions for books, serials, articles, and math. Derived from AAP DTD, it was first published in 1993, revised in 1994, and last confirmed in 2016.  History  In 1983, the Association of American Publishers (AAP), a coalition of book and journal publishers in North America, initiated efforts to create an SGML application named AAP DTD for academic publishing. In 1988, the AAP DTD became the American National Standards Institute's Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup (ANSI/NISO Z39.59) standard. Being based on the ASCII character encoding standard, it includes a large set of entity definitions for special characters. The AAP and EPSIG continued their collaboration and published a revised version of the specification in 1989, identifying three document types in the field of publishing: Book, Serial Publication, and Article, for each of which the revised specification offers a DTD. The AAP and the European Physical Society (EPS) further collaborated on a standard method for marking up tables and mathematical notation in scientific documents. Building on this work, Eric van Herwijnen, then head of the text processing section at CERN, edited the specification for adoption by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 12083, first published in 1993, revised in 1994 and last reconfirmed in 2016. ISO 12083 specifies four DTDs: Article, Book, Serial, and Math. In 1995, concurrent with the widthdrawal of ANSI/NISO Z39.59:1988, ANSI/ISO 12083 was adopted as U.S. standard ANSI/NISO/ISO 12083-1995 (R2009) Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup.

It serves as the seat of Huangyuan County, lying about upstream (west) from the provincial capital of Xining and approximately east of Qinghai Lake.. Chengguan has a 600-year history as a frontier trading post between the Chinese, Mongolian, and Tibetan cultural spheres. Names The city was first known as Tongkor. or Tongkhor, after a nearby lamasery established by the Tongkor reincarnation line. The name has been romanized in many different ways: Tang-keou-eul, Tang-kiuul,.. Tonkir, Tongor, Denger, Donkir, Dung kor, Tung kor,Rockhill (1891), p. 109, n. 2. and Tankar. The name is still used in Tibetan and Mongolian, although after the Xinhai Revolution the name was changed in Chinese to Xiancheng in 1913, then to Zhongshan in honor of Sun Yat-sen, then to Huangyang in 1938. During the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, it was finally renamed Chengguan. Following Chinese practice, it is also frequently known as Huangyuan from the county it administers. History The lamasery to the town's south was established in 1648 by Dogyu Gyatso, the 4th Tongkor, in remembrance of a visit to the area by Sonam Gyatso, the 3rd Dalai Lama.. It became an important religious center for the Mongolian tribes of the area. The town itself was formally recognized by the Qing Empire in 1727, the 5th year of the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor. It was walled and became an important border town and trading post on the route between China proper and Tibet.Rockhill (1891), pp. 133-134. The journey to Lhasa was usually reckoned as 60–70 days. Caravans from Lhasa brought Buddhist books, woolen cloth of various colors and qualities, incense sticks, disks of chank-shells and amber for ornaments, furs, the best quality saffron (\\"K'a ch'é shakama\\") from Kashmir, cowries, dried dates, and brown sugar from India, and a few other items. Among the most valuable items brought by Tibetans ormore frequentlyNepalese, were conch shells with their whorls turning to the right. They were highly valued for use as trumpets (\\"Yä-chyil dung-kar\\") in the monasteries, to the point where they were classed among the establishments' \\"jewels\\". One of them could sell for between four and five hundred taels. The Chinese also placed a high value on them. A few traders from Khotan and Kashgar visited each year, usually in the autumn, bringing Khotan rugs, Hami raisins, dried melons and a few other things of little value. The exports contain goods of much higher value, including mules and horses, satin, silks and gold brocades, and chinaware.Rockhill (1891), pp. 110-111. During the First Dungan Revolt, the town and surrounding countryside were the scene of a massacre of around 10,000 Muslims.Rockhill (1891), p. 109. At the time, the other Chinese and Tibetans in the town numbered less than 10,000 themselves and were protected by only a nominal force of 200 men under a \\"colonel\\". Following the massacre, Muslims were banned from entering the town for a time and the town lost importance as a trade center.Rockhill (1891), p. 110. After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Chengguan raised to district status. It was lowered to town status in 1953.

Although the kit is advertised at $500, like many tools, additional initial material and hardware costs are required. The kits are now sold by three re- sellers range in price from $400 to $500. Lumber and plywood are required to make the machine's frame along with an appropriate and compatible router. Lastly, a personal computer or tablet is needed with Windows, Mac OSX or Linux as its operating system. Overall initial material material costs approximately $800. The unique vertical design mimics a hanging plotter allowing it to have a 4' x 8' cutting area with a footprint 10' wide x 19\\" deep. Maslow CNC uses geared motors with encoders (8148 counts/rev) and a closed loop feedback system to achieve a resolution of ±0.4mm. To reduce cost, Maslow CNC comes in kit form, uses a commercial off-the-shelf handheld router provided by the user for the router spindle, uses an Arduino Mega microprocessor, and uses a large number of common hardware items rather than custom parts.

Modern Mapping shows the area as Scot Gate Ash. was the collective name for extensive quarry workings that were on the northern edge of Pateley Bridge, North Yorkshire, England. When the quarry was last in use, the area was in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and was described as being the largest quarry in West Yorkshire.Until the boundary changes in 1974, Pateley Bridge was in the historic county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Post 1974, it has been in North Yorkshire. After 1872, building stone from Scotgate Ash was exported from the quarry site firstly by incline into the town of Pateley Bridge and thence by train on the Nidd Valley Railway (NVR). Because of its durability and hard-wearing nature, Scotgate Ash stone was used in building the platforms at many mainline railway stations in the United Kingdom, as well as being in demand as a building stone, not only in the locality, but also at a national level with many significant buildings in London using Scotgate Ash stone. History Between the early 14th century and 1915, Scotgate Ash Quarry above the northern edge of Pateley Bridge, supplied Dimension stone (which was known commercially as Delph Stone) that was used in many buildings in Yorkshire and London. The stone was particularly prized as an edging stone for railway platforms and was used at , , , and railway stations. The Metcalfe family, who were landholders in the locality, had a major stake in Scot Gate Ash Quarry and by 1880, because of their influence, the quarry was the largest in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The Metcalfe's installed a standard gauge inclined tramway in 1872 to transport the stone down the hill to the goods sidings west of Pateley Bridge railway station. The incline lowered the stone over a height of and over a distance of . The incline had many escape routes and, like many inclines in Britain, the loaded wagons moving downhill forced empty wagons to ascend the incline on the other line. The incline bottom connected directly into the NVR sidings with an additional spur onto the Nidd Valley Light Railway. The incline crossed Corporation Road in the town before joining the branchline sidings at Millfield Street. The opening of the incline allowed stone to be transported into Pateley Bridge in a matter of minutes instead of several hours by horse and cart. The quarry produced flags and stone, which were from the Libishaw Sandstone bed. This stone was also used in the building of Scar House Reservoir further up the valley. Libishaw Sandstone is described as \\"fine to medium-grained, micaeous, feldspathic, thin bedded sandstone of variable colour (buff, brown, pale yellow, and grey) was quarried widely in the C19 on the north side of Pateley Bridge\\". Blocks and flags could be as large as and deep. Some of the stone was won by mining rather than surface quarrying and whilst spoil heaps are still in evidence, any mining shafts have been filled in. By 1889, seven distinct working areas were spread out across the hill above Pateley Bridge, all operating as Scotgate Ash Quarry. Incline at Pateley Bridge.jpgthumbIncline looking south at Pateley Bridge, North Yorkshire. This was the incline railway that served the former Scotgate Ash quarry workings The arrival of the railway in Pateley Bridge in 1862, afforded the quarry owners the ability to export the stone from the dale for the first time. Scotgate Ash stone was used in building the National Gallery, the National Safe Deposit Bank and Kensington Museum in London and the government works at Aldershot, Enfield, Plymouth, Portsmouth and York. It was also used extensively for many buildings in Harrogate, the Station Hotel in York, and for post offices in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham. Other uses included steps for public buildings and edging stones for dockyards and harbours because of its high resistance to crushing. At the height of the quarrying operations in the 1890s, the quarry workings stretched out along the northern flank of Pateley Bridge for over . Five steam cranes were in operation and the workings employed over 500 men and boys. In October 1892, the valley suffered from extreme rainfall which caused huge rockfalls in the quarry area and the resultant flooding destroyed the incline. English Heritage have described the site remains as \\"striking\\". The incline survives (and is shown on mapping) along with various buildings (the manager's office, drum house for the incline, etc.) and a reservoir at the eastern edge of the site. Access to the site is easily available as it, and the former incline course, are both on public footpaths.

Equestria hosts many intelligent and sapient creatures; the majority being ponies. Equestria resides on the Equestrian continent on a terrestrial planet, similar to Earth. Equestria serves as the backdrop for the adventures of Twilight Sparkle and her friends, in their quest to spread the magic of friendship throughout the land. Leading Equestria are four powerful regnant coregency princesses: Celestia, the Princess of the Day; Luna, the Princess of the Night and Dreams; Cadence, the Princess of Love and Family; and Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Magic and Friendship. Equestria's foundation is described as the result of the cooperation of unicorns, pegasi, and earth ponies, who came together in harmony to fight the Wendigos and stop an eternal blizzard; Hearth's Warming Day is an annual holiday that celebrates its founding. The \\"Bit\\" is the official currency of Equestria and its territories. Instead of English, it is mentioned that they call their language \\"Ponish\\"; however, due to the fact that written English is seen at several times during the series, it is generally understood that this is English under a different name. Although generally peaceful, Equestria had its share of wars and battles over the centuries, with recent conflicts involving the formerly hostile Changeling Hive, the invading Storm Empire, and the return of the Wendigos; all of which negatively impacting major settlements. Equestria was founded in the Age of Heroes by Princess Celestia and Princess Luna; two sisters ruled as equals until Luna fell to evil and became Nightmare Moon. After a thousand years of banishment, Luna returned and nearly took over the realm, but was soon defeated by that generations' Bearers of Harmony and brought back to her senses, becoming once again the benevolent co-ruler of the nation. After several years of ruling the land, both sisters agreed that their protege, Twilight Sparkle, would succeed them.

Starswirl creates more than two hundred spells and has a wing in the Canterlot Archives dedicated to him. Over time, he created dozens of portal mirrors linking to various worlds, and traveled throughout the multiverse, accumulating vast sums of knowledge. Before his self-imposed banishment, Star Swirl participated in many important events in Equestria's early history, and is stated to have lived, at minimum, one thousand years.Luna EclipsedIt's About Time =Old Equestria history= The Founding of Equestria The Fire of Friendship - The Age of Eternal Winter was a time of darkness and frozen ice that \\"topples the tribes' precarious peace.\\" It was caused by the Wendigos, who fed off of the hatred between the three pony tribes. Earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi tribes lived under extremely hostile conditions. The Pony tribe leaders set out to find a new land. When they all discover the same land at the same time, their feud starts over, attracting the windigos and causing another blizzard. As the tribe leaders freeze, their cohorts become friends, and the Fire of Friendship is created. The tribe leaders thaw out of the ice, make peace, and agree to share the land as one unified nation. \\"Hearth's Warming Eve\\" describes the founding of Equestria as the result of when the pegasi, unicorns and earth ponies united to defeat the Wendigos and prevent an eternal blizzard. *The First Summer Sun Celebration - Before the arrival of Celestia and Luna, Equestria was suffering terrible hardships.

Her plan backfired when Sunset witnessed a possible future of herself as an alicorn. At first, the projection was of a beautiful and powerful pony, but soon became into a dark, wrathful pony who sought only to control others. Sunset was mortified by the reflection within herself, but grew ever curious. Her obsession with the mirror grew as Sunset disobeyed Celestia's orders by repeatedly breaking into the Forbidden Dark Magic wing of the Royal Library of Equestria. After weeks, Sunset and Celestia blew up at each other, leading to Celestia to denounce Sunset as her protégé. Enraged, Sunset escaped into the mirror and entered the human world; the portal connecting the two worlds would not open again for another three years.My Little Pony: Equestria Girlshttps://sta.sh/22b71lxow6e3https://comicvine.gamespot.com/my-little-pony- annual-2013-1-equestria-girls- the-f/4000-431462/https://comicbook.com/category/equestria-girls-the-fall-of- sunset-shimmer-comicissue-1/ The Cutie Mark Chronicles *The First Sonic Rainboom - Approximately twenty years before Luna's Redemption.My Little Pony: IDW 20/20 Rainbow Dash broke the speed of sound and magic during a race, creating a phenomenon known as a sonic rainboom.

In modern times, Celestia continues to govern Equestria, adopts Cadence—the first new alicorn in centuries—as her niece, and mentors promising young ponies; her most gifted students were Sunset Shimmer and Twilight Sparkle. Due to the efforts of Twilight Sparkle and her friends, Equestria has been enjoying its longest period of prosperity and harmony in recorded history. Centuries of tension between the griffins, ponies, dragons, and changelings peacefully concluded, with all factions becoming unlikely allies. This is the era most detailed by the main comics, television series, and video games, and is therefore fully canon, according to the show writers. Year of Luna's Redemption This time period lasted approximately one year, during which events brought about positive developments: Buffalo and ponies gained an understanding, Dragons and ponies grew friendlier, the citizens of Equestria grew to love Princess Luna instead of fearing her, the Crystal Empire regained its former glory, and many ancient villains were defeated. *Return of Nightmare Moon - The pilot episode \\"Friendship is Magic\\" portrays the defeat of Nightmare Moon by the protagonists, using the Elements of Harmony, known as the Mane Six. Each pony is associated with one of the six Elements of Harmony: Applejack with honesty, Pinkie Pie with laughter, Rainbow Dash with loyalty, Fluttershy with kindness, Rarity with generosity, and Twilight Sparkle with magic.

As masters of psychological manipulation and infiltration tactics with the ability to shapeshift, the changelings are one of Equestria's oldest and greatest threats. Faced with such an asymmetrical enemy, Equestria was forced into fighting an unwinnable irregular warfare and could not bring its full might to bear upon the Queendom, as Chrysalis's throne nullified all magic not of changeling origin. *Changeling Invasion of Canterlot - \\"A Canterlot Wedding\\" depicts the marriage of Princess Cadance to Prince Shining Armor, the captain of the Royal Guard of Canterlot and Twilight's older brother. Queen Chrysalis, a changeling who imprisons and impersonates Cadance prior to her wedding in an attempt to invade Canterlot, the capital of Equestria. Chrysalis' strength arises from her ability to consume love, so she shapeshifted into Cadence to feed off of the love Shining Armor has for Cadance. However, Twilight Sparkle discovers this, frees Cadance, and reveals Cadance's impostor before the wedding. Cadance and Shining Armor defeat the changelings with the power of their love and with help from the Mane Six. *Changeling abduction of Equestrian leadership and Changeling Revolution - In the season six finale \\"To Where and Back Again\\", Starlight Glimmer discovers a changeling conspiracy in which all four Princesses and her friends have been replaced by doppelgangers and assembles an unlikely team of heroes to save her friends. It was at this point that the \\"reformed\\" changeling Thorax shows his fellow Changelings if they share friendship, they will no longer need to feed off of love. Subsequently, the Changelings turn against Chrysalis, accepting friendship and becoming reformed versions of themselves. *Chrysalis's Attempt at Revenge - Less than a year later, Queen Chrysalis attempted to seek vengeance against Starlight Glimmer and the Mane 6 and regain control of the Changeling Hive by creating clones of the Mane Six. However, her plan failed after the Tree of Harmony stopped the clones from stealing the Elements and subsequently killed them. Disregarding a few minor mishaps during their day, the Mane 6 and Starlight Glimmer were left completely unaware of Chrysalis's plan. =Season 3= *Return of the Crystal Empire - The Crystal Empire is introduced in season 3 as the home of the Crystal Ponies located in the far north of Equestria. Its despot ruler, King Sombra, first appears in the two- part episode \\"The Crystal Empire\\".

With the help of Cadance and Shining Armor, the Mane 6 venture to the Crystal Empire after it reappears.

Eventually, Twilight and Sunset are even able to keep in touch with each other via a magic journal. Ascension of Twilight Sparkle The era begins almost exactly a year after the return of Princess Luna; this era is notable for the coronation of Princess Twilight Sparkle and the opening of the School of Friendship.

Discovered and/or invented by Starswirl, it allowed him to manipulate time and remain ageless. Because using it irresponsible could lead to branches in time or time loops, Celestia outlawed time magic, and all knowledge pertaining to it is held within Starswirl the Bearded Wing of the Canterlot Archives.It's About Time In \\"The Cutie Re-Mark\\", several alternate versions of Equestria are depicted as a result of Starlight Glimmer changing history. In the first alternate timeline shown, King Sombra expands the Crystal Empire's borders to cover half of Equestria and the Griffon Kingdom. In the second, Queen Chrysalis and the changelings have conquered Canterlot and forced many ponies into hiding. In the third, Nightmare Moon rules Equestria in eternal night after banishing Celestia to the moon. Further alternate realities include one ruled by Discord, one in which Tirek ravages the land, one in which Flim and Flam bulldoze the Everfree Forest for development, and one in which Equestria is reduced to a barren wasteland. Thanks to Twilight Sparkle's actions, these alternate realities are undone. Inhabitants =Ponies= Ponies are sapient, quadrupedal, ungulate mammals. Distinguishable from other equine species by their facultative bipedalism, pastel coats/manes/tails, and the picturesque \\"cutie mark\\" that appears on their flanks when they find their \\"Special Talent\\"... their true purpose in life. The pony species can be further subdivided into six races: earth pony, pegasus pony, unicorn pony, crystal pony, thestral pony, and alicorn pony. Equestrian ponies are amongst of the most influential species in history—having established a powerful nation, Equestria, whose territories included much of the known world at the apex of their civilizations' existence. Other foreign nations known to have been established and/or inhabited by ponies include Saddle Arabia and Maretonia. Earth Ponies :Earth ponies possess an underlying connection to the earth, nature, and the environment that encourages the growth of plant life and a connection with wild animals. Earth pony based technology is purely mechanical and often is intended to replicate things they cannot do themselves. Earth ponies form the backbone of Equestria's economy, operating within most industries sectors involving natural resources, construction or extraction. Their natural talents in agriculture, forestry, and mining extends from plants to rock farms. Compared to pegasi and unicorns, earth ponies exhibit supernatural strength, stamina, fortitude, and durability. Pegasus Ponies :Pegasi have the unique ability to fly and magically control the weather. This ability is powered by a pair of feathered wings, which is the distinguishing anatomical feature of pegasi compared to other pony races. Pegasi make up the majority of ponies responsible for the postal service, patrolling Equestria's airspace, and controlling Equestria's weather. Pegasi are the only pony able to naturally interact with clouds as if they were tangible; this allows them to walk on and move clouds and, by extension, control the weather (although other pony types are able to due this through artificial means using magic). In the episode \\"Hurricane Fluttershy\\", a coordinated team of one hundred pegasi demonstrate their ability to generate hurricane-force winds to funnel water from a lake. Unicorn Ponies :Unicorns can directly absorb, wield, channel, create and manipulate magic; this ability is powered by a horn of variable length, texture, and color on their forehead. However, a unicorn's horn can be destroyed, taking away most of their magical capabilities. Unicorns are amongst the most educated and scholarly of Equestria's citizens. While other ponies' innate magical talents are \\"intuitive or instinctive\\", unicorns require decades of higher education to master any spell beyond the most basic fundamentals. Many spells and abilities are open to all unicorns, but many unicorn has a specialty, be it teleportation, transfiguration, or medicine. Generally, unicorns have a collection of various spells relating to their specialty, one being vastly more effective than the rest. Crystal Ponies :Crystal ponies are a glittery crystal version of the three tribes: earth ponies, pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies. Crystal ponies have the same magics as their non-crystal counterparts. They also have the ability to assume a glittery crystal appearance when they are in a good mood. When they are in a sad mood they assume a dull, and bland, appearance. They also have the ability to use crystal magic. This gives the ability to infuse their emotions into crystal. And thus, empower the Crystal Heart when it is needed. Thestral Ponies :Thestral ponies are a subset of ponies. They are easily recognizable by their bat-like wings, and their slit-pupil eyes. Alicorn Ponies :The novel \\"Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell\\" establishes that the Alicorn Princesses are \\"a special breed of pony able to harness the magical powers of the Unicorns, the flight abilities of the Pegasi, and the strength of a good, true heart of an Earth Pony.\\"Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell Faust states that Celestia \\"embodies the traits of all three [kinds of ponies]\\". Alicorns are a unique race of pony that possess all three distinguishing features of the other pony races: the horn of a unicorn, the wings of a pegasus, and the fortitude of an earth pony. As such, this also grants them access to the inherent magical abilities of all three races. They are taller and more slender than most ponies, and known for their unnaturally long lifespan and supernatural abilities. =Non-ponies= In addition to native ponies, Equestria is inhabited by a number of Non-ponies; while ponies make up the clear majority of the Equestrian population, several other sapient species, often ungulates like cattle or the Kirin, also live in Equestria. Zebras :Zebras are distinguishable by the unique black-and-white stripes that adorn their coats and the glyph-like Cutie Mark that adorns their haunch. Zebras are explicitly stated not to be a race of pony despite being the only other creature to feature a cutie mark. Zebras have been shown as naturally resistant to forms of mind control and cannot be detected by telepathic entities. There were a number of communities in Equestria that had zebras living and working among ponies, often as the minority. While zebra interaction with ponies was not uncommon, their strange mannerisms invited speculation and irrational fear among ponies in some areas. Dragons :Dragons are winged, serpentine omnivores and lithovores who possess strong armored scales and breathe magical fire as a form of attack. Aside from allegiance to the Dragon Lord, dragons had no real alignment nor organized society, and most merely roamed around the land, only occasionally being spotted within the borders of Equestria. Dragons are highly competitive and materialistic, known to grow in size as they collect or hoard things.Secret of My ExcessTriple ThreatShadow Play. Draconequus :Draconequus are beings of immense power, powerful enough to alter reality at a whim. Discord is the only example of a Draconequus within the main television series; however, he and others reference Draconequui as being a species, implying that there are more than one. The species is a dragon-like chimera made from the body parts of different animals. Government Equestria is originally depicted as a semi-constitutional coregency, principality, eventually becoming a singular monarchy with the abdication of Princesses Celestia and Luna in favor of Princess Twilight Sparkle. Equestrian government, as described in depth by the comic and video game series, has a legislative branch, an executive branch, headed by four monarchs, and a judiciary branch, with judges appointed by region by the monarchs. The main television series, however, rarely delves into political detail on the government of Equestria—despite many principal characters being government officials—beyond its executive branch and the various political officials of the Ponyville and Canterlot townships. Governance within Equestria's principalities demonstrate an exceptionally high level of stability, organization and communication, even across so sprawling a continent-size domain through the use of extensive ships, railroads and highways, and a postal system of quick supply storehouses, rest stops, and relay stations. Deployment of soldiers, distribution of workers, and transmission of messages could be achieved with tremendous speeds, preventing what might otherwise be a crippling disconnect and disunity throughout the nation. =Princesses of Equestria= The government is currently as of the series finale a matriarchy-monarchy: concentration of sovereignty resides with the current alicorn sovereign princess Twilight Sparkle. Royal linage has been showed to be gained in both meritocratic and hereditary means, whereby some princess have earned their position through \\"alicorn ascendency\\" (such as Twilight Sparkle), which has been depicted only once in show canon, and only achievable via an act of unprecedented heroism, or the creation of \\"new magic\\". Other princesses however have been shown to inherit royal status from parents (such as Flurry Heart). Celestia and Luna act as the Heads of State and Government. The exact extent of the Princesses' powers and influence is unknown—other than constitutional limitations Celestia placed upon herself—as the separation of powers distribution between the government branches are never specified. Princess Celestia :Princess Celestia, the Princess of the Day, originally being the eldest monarch before her abdication and only monarch during a 1,000 year period after Princess Luna's deposition and banishment, often handles the affairs of state and diplomacy. Supreme Commander of armed forces in wartime.\\"The Cutie Re-Mark\\" Celestia affected the role of the monarchy from her coronation to her abdication, and her history is inseparable and synonymous with Equestria's. From the beginning, Celestia despised tyranny and did not want to resemble a Queen or an Empress, nor be referred to as one. She preferred the title \\"Princess\\" as a sign of humility, which is how equestrian sovereigns are still addressed to this day. Celestia is the eldest of the two Royal Sisters, the longest-lived and longest-reigning Equestrian monarch—older than anyone would dare guess—acting as head ruler of Equestria for over one thousand years due to the timeless aging of alicorns. Additionally, she is responsible for the raising and lowering the sun, working in tandem with her sister Luna to ensure a night and day cycle. She is perhaps the most beloved creature in the world, being a staunch proponent for international peace, kindness and cooperation. Very little of her past before Celestia's victory over Discord is known, except that she and Luna discovered the Elements of Harmony. With these artifacts and their bearers, Princess Celestia has secured millennia-long, relative peace for a nation. Princess Luna :Princess Luna, the Princess of the Night and original diarch of Equestria before her abdication, utilizes her intimate knowledge of fear and the use of moon magic in her duties, monitoring the dreams of all creatures and protecting them from nightmares. Princess Cadance :Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, the Princess of Love, and her husband Prince consort Shining Armor jointly serve as the \\"Empress and Emperor of the Crystal Empire\\", which is a semi-autonomous territory of Equestria with its own military guard and unique culture. Cadence, young Pegasus mare and a distant relative of the lost Princess Amore, defeated a unicorn sorceress named Prismia. Her victory transported her to an unknown magical realm where she met Celestia, who adopted the newly ascended Alicorn as her niece. After the Crystal Empire returned and subsequent defeat of King Sombra, Cadence became the rightful ruler of the Empire. Princess Flurry Heart :Cadence gives birth to an alicorn filly named Flurry Heart. Celestia and Luna both stated that \\"the birth of an alicorn, is something Equestria has never seen\\", and that it was \\"even beyond their understanding\\".\\"The Crystalling\\" Princess Twilight Sparkle :Princess Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, plays a de facto role similar to that of a Foreign Minister or Secretary of State, often acting as a diplomatic figure to other nations. She had been groomed by Celestia for leadership so that she could rule after Celestia's and Luna's eventual retirement. With the aid of her friends and the Tree of Harmony, Twilight has made it her life's mission to spread the magic of friendship across the known world. :Celestia's prized pupil, Twilight Sparkle, successfully completed a number of impressive tasks with the aid of her friends, the new wielders of the Elements of Harmony. After she redeemed Nightmare Moon, thwarted the return of Discord, and helped thwart Queen Chrysalis' takeover of Canterlot, she was tasked with helping safeguard the newly returned Crystal Empire. Upon her success, Celestia and Luna agreed that she was ready to face another challenge: finishing an incomplete spell of Starswirl's. After accidentally switching her friends' cutie marks, Twilight was able to restore them to normal and complete the spell. As a result, she created \\"new magic\\" and became an Alicorn, with Celestia acknowledging her as a princess. :Twilight establishes the joint ruleship of Equestria with the Council of Friendship—currently consisting of the Mane Six—which effectively serves as her cabinet; they gather once a moon to consult issues ranging from friendship problems to national security, while in doing so, removing the risk of having time spent apart weaken their friendship. =Domestic defense= Equestria is depicted as being a mostly peaceful nation that hasn't experienced war for centuries; aside from a few judicial warships and a core defense force, there was with little need for a large professional military beyond the existing Wonderbolts, who patrols Equestria's air space, and the Royal Guards that protect the Princesses. The previous Changeling Hive conflicts were asymmetrical; a \\"cold war\\" where neither belligerents could achieve decisive victory for their side. This state of relaxed peacetime security and vulnerability were recently exploited by the invading Storm Empire, followed by a terrorist attack by villains, which forced Equestria to update their defenses in response.Twilight's Seven Equestria first and foremost line of defence falls upon Princess Twilight Sparkle and the Mane 6, who are often called upon to defend Equestria against magical threats. An alternate timeline of the main series showed that the rulers of Equestria may choose to retain command of the armed forces when they are raised. E.U.P. Guard E.U.P. (Earth, Unicorn, Pegasi) Guard of Equestria was formally established in response for Equestria need for a modernized gendarmerie professional standing army and law enforcement on a federal administrative level. The E.U.P. guard were active around the time that the Pony of Shadows abducted Princess Celestia and Princess Luna.Legends of Magic Annual 2018 Under Twilight's rule the E.U.P. guard now includes non-ponies amongst their ranks. Prior to the formal establishment of the E.U.P. Guard, forerunners were decentralized fiefdoms of militias or mercenaries. Known military forces that defended various populations in Equestria have included the Cloudsdale Royal Legion and the Mighty Helm. Pre-Equestrian rulers were seen to maintain forces of \\"guardsponies\\", with Commander Hurricane and Sable Spirit both maintaining forces of Pegasi and Unicorn guards, respectively. Royal Guards The Royal Guards are the pony protectors of Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, Princess Cadance, and Princess Twilight Sparkle. The royal guard were in operation by the time Nightmare Moon began invading the dreams of ponies after turning the enslaved Nyx into the Nightmare Forces.Fiendship is Magic issue 4 The Royal Guard themselves have largely proven ceremonial: as any threat that the Alicorn Princesses would have needed protection from have consistently ripped through them—with the Princesses somehow protecting them—and are thus relegated to law enforcement and other mundane matters. After Flash Magnus became a drill sergeant for the guard, these guards-including some mares specified as serving under Princess LunaMy Little Pony (Gameloft game)-were more commonly seen. The current Royal Guardcommander is Shining Armor, Royal Captain of the Guards; Gallus is later promoted to that rank. Crystal Guard The Crystal GuardFiendship is Magic issue 1—an E.U.P. guard subdivision—have defended the Crystal Empire for an unknown period of time, dating back at least as far as King Sombra's childhood. Members include Crystal Pegasi, Crystal Earth Ponies, and Crystal Unicorns.Friends Forever issue 30 Night Guard The Night Guard—consisting of \\"Bat Ponies\\" aka \\"Thestral Ponies\\" —serve as Princess Luna's guards, though they have also been seen in the company of Princess Celestia; in an alternate timeline, several Bat Ponies served as Nightmare Moon's royal guards. Wonderbolts The Wonderbolts are an elite unit of Pegasi and serves as the air force division of the Royal Guards of Equestria. The Wonderbolts have a proud military tradition: on the anniversary of the First Celestial year of peace following Nightmare Moon's banishment, General Firefly selected a group of fliers from among the E.U.P. guard to perform at the Summer Sun Celebration. This group would later come to be known as the Wonderbolts. Under Twilight's rule the Wonderbolts now includes non-ponies amongst their ranks. The current Wonderbolt commander is Spitfire, Air Chief Marshal; Rainbow Dash is later promoted to that rank. =National intelligence= Internal existential threats necessitate priority for covert counterintelligence, internal security and anti-monster agencies. Sweetie Drops (Bon Bon) is the only known pony associated with such organizations. =Foreign relations= Equestria successfully continues, through the diplomatic efforts of Princess Twilight and her friends, to use soft power in forging cultural, political, diplomatic, military and economic cooperation with Griffonstone, Yakyakistan, Hippogriffia/Seaquestria, Maretonia, Saddle Arabia, the reformed Changeling Hive, and the Dragonlands. Culture Culturally, Equestria is quite similar to the culture of the anglosphere, reflecting analogies with both the United States and Canada. The foundations of the culture were the principles of harmony, order and friendship; which helps maintain unity within the principalities through adherence culture and identity. Although Equestria encompasses several ethnic groups and cultures, the speedy means which information and orders can be moved throughout the principalities does demonstrate a high capability for maintaining peace and unity. =Holidays, observances and events= Specific events are depicted in the show. Some are regular annual occurrences; others happen more infrequently. Major events *Hearth's Warming and Hearth's Warming Eve: An annual holiday commemorating the Declaration of Hearth's Warming. The holiday tends to act as the national holiday of Equestria; however, the holiday's celebrations are nearly identical to Christmas, in that it is celebrated during winter and has similar traditions including decorating trees and exchanging gifts. *Crystal Faire: An annual public holiday held in honor of Princess Cadence within the Crystal Empire. It was established by the Crystal Ponies' first empress, Princess Amore, and became their most important tradition in \\"renew the spirit of love and unity in the Empire so the Crystal Ponies could protect Equestria from harm.\\" *Festival of the Two Sisters: A public holiday, formerly known as the Summer Sun Celebration, originally held in honor of Princess Celestia as the longest day of the year. It formerly commemorated the anniversary of Princess Celestia's first raising of the sun, Celestia's battle to restore the sun to Equestria by imprisoning Nightmare Moon, and the redemption of Princess Luna; but is now meant to honor the two sisters. The event itself mostly takes place in Canterlot, and ends with Celestia raising the sun behind her. *Nightmare Night: A Halloween-like holiday held in honor of Princess Luna, in which foals dress up in costumes and go door-to-door collecting candy. Festival activities include a carnival with various games, musical entertainment, and a tradition in which candy is offered to the effigy of Nightmare Moon. According to myth, this holiday was meant to appease Nightmare Moon, lest she visit nightmares upon the innocent and devour naughty children. In \\"Luna Eclipsed\\", though initially disgusted in the celebration of subjecting her own people to fear, Twilight helped Luna learned to understand and even embrace this dark aspect of her persona. *Friendship Festival: An annual holiday held in honor of Twilight Sparkle. It is first depicted in My Little Pony: The Movie, where ponies from all over Equestria gather in Canterlot. Minor events *Cute-ceañera: A coming of age event celebrated by those who have recently gotten their cutie marks, both males and females. *Crystalling: A special ceremony for Crystal Empire newborns that culminates in making the Crystal Heart stronger than before. *Equestria Games: A sporting event that first appears in the season four episode of the same name. Ms. Harshwhinny is the head of the Equestria Games as well as the Games Inspector. Different years' announced hosts of the Equestria Games include Fillydelphia and the Crystal Empire. *Grand Galloping Gala: An annual royal ball held to celebrate the completion of Canterlot after Equestria was founded. It is attended primarily by the upper class elite: to attend this event, one must possess a golden ticket. *Hearts and Hooves Day: a Valentine's Day-themed holiday. *Sisterhooves Social: An annual event in which \\"sister\\" teams of two compete in various contests. According to Granny Smith, the Sisterhooves Social has a loose definition of what constitutes a \\"sister\\". Because of this, non-sister teams and male ponies are allowed to participate. *Winter Wrap Up: An annual event that involves clearing winter in preparation for spring. All ponies are assigned to one of three teams: weather, plants, or animals. Because Ponyville was founded by earth ponies, they change the seasons from winter to spring without using magic. Even after unicorns and pegasi started settling there, the tradition has continued. =Economics and society= Equestria is an egalitarian society with an educated, literate labor pool that has a market economy through which a wide variety of goods and services are bought and sold, both through the use of currency and the barter. Many of the stories depicted across all media focus on the performance of economic tasks: crop harvesting, production of baked goods, and the maintenance of the town. =Technology and magic= Equestrian magic is tightly integrated with Equestrian technology, with the formal study of magic forming a fundamental scientific branch. It is a natural part of the Equestrian world that may be harnessed for useful applications, and continues to influence and shape everyday life in Equestria. Many creatures possess inherent abilities that are magical in nature. Ponies in particular have been shown as having natural magic, each species has a magical trait or quality that are mostly unique to them. Magic aids the pegasi in weather modification, the Earth ponies in resource extraction and agriculture, and aids unicorns with scientific research and in creating useful items that benefit all ponies. Overall, the level of technology in Equestria varies between early-to-mid 20th century, being chiefly dependent on the population density and economic prosperity of any given settlement. Firearms and other gunpowder-based weaponry are unheard of and is seen as magical. Metallurgy is limited to forging and blacksmiths. Electricity and internal combustion are readily available to all but the most isolated communities. Simple machines such as pulleys and levers are widely used. Warfare, when it occurs, is mostly composed of human wave attacks and close quarters combat. All aspects of life are through machinery that supplements the natural talents of ponykind. Ideas and concepts such as metallurgy, industrialization, mechanization, interchangeable parts, standardization of production, assembly lines, etc., are both known and depicted throughout every My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic media platform. Mass production on a large scale is available and inexpensive. Natural resources for production such as ores, lumber, textiles, petroleum and other sources, exist in abundance, with the methods of gathering and processing these resources being fast and efficient by Earth Ponies skilled in manual work. Postal service, travel, transport, and communication is relatively fast and efficient despite lacking advanced telecommunication; being limited to walking, flying, carriages, railroads, ships, and word of mouth. Teleportation, while widely known, is an advanced technique beyond most unicorns' ability to execute, and too physically exhausting to be viable. While the Princesses themselves, in effect, have access to \\"magical Email\\" (via Spike's flame) this ability is not depicted as readily available or widespread. Medical technology is advanced and sanitary, with modern hospital facilities—staffed by trained medical professionals—being further supplemented with healing magic. In terms of maritime technology, ships varies from oar and sail in terms of propulsion to advanced steamships with paddle-wheel or screw propellers. Advanced radar, sonar, or GPS are unknown; depiction of navigation is done by the stars and primitive maps and other navigational equipment. Advancements in the sciences Equestria have achieved has taken decades or even centuries to discover. Magic in Equestria is highly developed as science, causing many useful applications ranging from industries, to combat and civilian applications. Rural or isolated communities products' are hand- crafted by specialists and therefore time-consuming to create. Due to the huge gap in technology level when compared to Equestria, the military, economy and overall standard of living is exceedingly primitive for other nations depicted throughout the franchise. In comparison to Dragonkind's culture, for example, the resulting stagnation of technological advance is enormous. This abundance of magical technological progress is due largely in part to Equestria's compulsory education system and actual scientific research. By opening Equestria's schools, Twilight hopes to share in Equestria's prosperity gained through knowledge and friendship with the non-pony nations throughout the known world. Chancellor Neighsay and other decouncers cited unsegregated inclusiveness of non-pony creatures as a naive foolish act that inevitably threatens Equestria's national security. Infrastructure and Industrialization Equestria is depicted as being a heavily Tier 2 industrialization, with access to early-to-mid 20th century pre-digital technology. Commonly depicted technologies include hard fantasy/steampunk- style steam locomotive rapid transits, zeppelin airships, pegasi-powered commercial passenger aircraft, concrete-steel skyscrapers, analog computers and electric lighting. *Friendship Express is a transcontinental railroad used by Equestrians to travel between regions or continents within days, and is the main character's preferred method of traveling throughout Equestria. Steam- powered technology opened regions of Equestria to exploration and settlements that would not otherwise have been feasible, and forms the backbones of cross- country passenger and freight transportation networks. Since season two, the pink engine-powered train has appeared in the main title sequence; outside of the title sequence, the Friendship Express appears in dozens of episodes and the comics. *Airships - In \\"Apple Family Reunion\\", family members are seen using airships to travel. In \\"Once Upon a Zeppelin\\", Twilight Sparkle and her family win a free cruise, which turns out to be a themed vacation experience organized by Iron Will. However, airship technology is not exclusive to Equestria: the Storm King had a fleet of airships, and Capper mentions owning one to Twilight Sparkle. Sciences of Magic The limitations of magic are always explained even if the reason why is unexplained or impossible. Princess Twilight Sparkle frequently researches magic phenomena using the scientific method. *Cutie Marks - One distinctive form of natural magic shared by all ponies are Cutie Marks. Two marks appear, one on each flank, when a pony realizes their special talent or goal in life. *Spellcasting - Raw magic channeled by unicorns and alicorns can generate spells to cause specific effects, producing a colorful aura identical to the pony's eye color and/or cutie marks. Equestrian Artifacts Throughout Equestrian history, an unspecified number of magical objects have been imbued with quite the range of mystical powers by the greatest mages that came before. In the Equestria Girls franchise, some of these artifacts were discovered in the \\"Human World\\"; a recurring plot element involves Sunset Shimmer and their friends tracking them down and/or removing them from the possession of humans corrupted by their magic. *Elements of Harmony - Six magical artifacts created by the Tree of Harmony which, in turn, was created through the efforts of the Pillars of Old Equestria—and formerly wielded by Celestia and Luna—are the most powerful weapons in all of Equestria. They are gems that are depicted to be able to project rainbows powered by Friendship magic. They were used to defeat Nightmare Moon, and a thousand years later to restore her to her original form. The first five Elements were shaped like regular gems; a thousand years later, they all became shaped to resemble the cutie marks of their most recent bearers and placed in necklaces. The sixth Element, the Element of Magic, is shaped like a six-pointed star resembling the cutie mark of Twilight Sparkle, and a thousand years later is placed in a crown. The Elements of Harmony were returned to Tree of Harmony in \\"Princess Twilight Sparkle\\" so the Tree of Harmony could prevent the Everfree Forest from growing out of control. The Elements and the Tree of Harmony were destroyed in \\"The Beginning of the End\\", but it has been shown that the Mane Six are still able to harness their power despite them being destroyed. *Crystal Heart - A magical heart-shaped crystal that the Crystal Ponies use to protect the Crystal Empire. It is powered by Love magic and is featured in the cutie mark of Princess Cadance and Princess Amore. *Crystal Mirror - A mirror created by Star Swirl that acts as a portal to the human world. Twilight Sparkle, Sunset Shimmer, and Spike use it to travel between Equestria and the human world when necessary. *Alicorn Amulet - A magical amulet featured in the episode \\"Magic Duel\\". The amulet is designed to enhance an alicorn's magic; a non-alicorn who uses the amulet risks being corrupted. It has a built-in magical lock that prevents any pony other than the bearer from taking it off. *Cutie Map - A magical map of Equestria first seen in \\"The Cutie Map\\". Twilight Sparkle and her friends use it to solve friendship problems across Equestria. *Mirror Pool - An enchanted pool in the Everfree Forest that can duplicate whoever stands in front of it. *Time Twirler - A stopwatch artifact of Starswirl's invention seen in Equestria Girls; when activated, has the power to loop time. *Staff of Sacanas - A legendary staff first seen in My Little Pony: The Movie and used by Storm King and Princess Eris. The staff's primary function appears to be that of power absorption and amplify it to unprecedented heights. The Staff of Sacanas was wielded by the Storm King among several of his earlier conquests, using it to sack over a dozen kingdoms, and to destroy a dozen more. Under the Storm Kings ownership, it could control the weather, due to having absorbed the power of a member of Strife's species and could later control the sun and moon with the power of the Princesses of Equestria's magic. In an alternate universe, Princess Eris received the staff as well: she managed to absorb the powers of Princess Luna and claimed it could affect dreams as well and would sell the staff at an auction, allowing whatever villain who wanted it to do whatever they wished with it. *Grogar's Bell - A bewitching bell created by the evil ram Grogar. He was the emperor of the land before the founding of Equestia (the land as it's known today was only a mere field of land and pastures) until the renowned Gusty the Great stole his bewitching well, and securely placing it at the peak of Mount Everhoof. The mountain is protected by an ancient spell and magical winds to prevent the bell from being taken. The bell allows the user to cast a spell and take the magical power of any earth pony, unicorn or pegasi, and the bell stores this magic until it is released. The bell cannot be destroyed. *The Cloak of Clover the Clever - A magical artifact that was used to drain all of the magic out of Equestria, along with five other magical artifacts. =Flora and Fauna= Much of the flora and fauna of Equestria is similar or practically identical to those on Earth, among the species shown or referenced include cats, dogs, rabbits, snakes, vultures, and numerous plant species such as trees or grasses. In addition to those species similar to those on Earth, there are a number of typical \\"fantasy\\" species. Magical creatures Magical creatures in the show include but are not limited to: *Dragons - Dragons in the show exhibit varying levels of sapience and intelligence. Some, like Spike, integrated into pony culture, while others, like the oversized and more traditionally designed Razer resemble a more beastly creature. Dragons breathe fire, eat gemstones, and are generally speaking aggressive. *Griffons - a mythical creature with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion, depicted in the show as aggressive and, with few exceptions, as enemies to Equestria. They reside in Griffonstone. *Changelings - Changelings appear equine in nature and share many physical characteristics with ponies. The differences are drastic, however, in that they possess an exoskeleton similar to an insect and are capable via dark magic of changing their forms into any creature they desire at will. Up until the later seasons of the show, they were depicted as enemies of Equestria. They are the children of Queen Chrysalis, who acts as the hive mother. *Deer - Deer are depicted as mysterious residents of the Everfree Forest. Little is known about them other than that they share a connection to the forestry and surrounding wilderness. *Gargoyles - Creatures with a dragon-like body, bat- like wings, a long neck, and the ability to breathe fire. *Demon - Any creature that has allowed themselves to be consumed by dark magic, transforming them into a creature with reddened skin and horns. *Cyclops - Giant, bipedal goatmen with a large singular eye. *Chimera - a monstrous fire- breathing creature with the body and head of a sabertooth tiger, a goat's head rising from its back, and the front part of a snake as a tail. *Cerberus - A giant three-headed dog that guards Tartarus, a realm of eternal imprisonment. *Centaur - Demon-like creatures with a humanoid upper body and equine lower body. Centaurs are depicted in the show as being obsessed with consuming the magic of others. *Manticores - Monsters with the head and body of a lion, a pair of bat wings growing from their backs and the stinger of a scorpion. Geography Equestria is the largest equine nation, stretching across a peninsula-continent that touches both the northern arctic and subarctic poles; located on an Earth-like planet which, within the Friendship is Magic television series, has not been specifically named. Equestria reaches from the western Luna Ocean to the eastern Celestia Sea, bordering the northern Crystal Empire and the southern Queendom of Changlings. The Equestrian continent's diverse geography ranges, biomes, provinces and settlements are modeled after or based on North American cities and the nearctic realm. The full geography of the Equestria is currently unexplored and evolving to fit the needs of the show writers, and is currently limited to a part of the continent of Equus (the Equestrian continent), which is controlled mostly by the Equestrian nation. The Equestrian-explored portion of the continent is flanked by two vast oceans, bounded to the north by the mountainous Frozen North region and extends across the northern and southern hemispheres, ending with the Bone Dry Desert that borders the Mysterious South region. However, a map included in the Friendship Is Magic film indicates vast areas beyond these regions.My Little Pony: The Movie The exact size or chronology of the planet is unknown. Like Earth, Equestria's world has one moon, and is depicted as being part of a solar system that includes at least four more planets. Questions regarding heliocentrism or geocentrism are complicated by the fact that Celestia and Luna can move the Sun and Moon, respectively, at a mere whim. Similar constellations exist; with the caveat that most of them are also dangerous monsters, such as Canis Major and Ursa Minor. In relation to the \\"Human World\\"My Little Pony:Equestria Girls its not clear if Equestria is located in a parallel universe, or somewhere in the same universe as Earth. Uncertainty about this fact also makes it difficult to determine if the Equestrian events are occurring at the same time as events on Earth, or if the entire world exists in Earth's relative past or future, with the \\"Magic Mirror\\" acting as a portal through time, rather than just space. Notable settlements, territories, dependencies and major population centers in Equestria are identified throughout the series and used as the setting for one or more episodes. Most minor locations, or vaguely referenced areas outside Equestria, both in the television series and associated media aren't specified whether these locations are part of Equestria or not. The films, television series, and other franchise media take place in many locations and their exact affiliation with Equestria is not explored. As the creator of the show wrote, Lauren Faust explained on various social media pages, that the Everfree Forest is west of Ponyville, Sweet Apple Acres is southwest, and both Fluttershy's cottage and meadow are located north of the farm, presumably between Ponyville and the forest. Canterlot is northeast of Ponyville. However, in subsequent interviews, both Faust and Jayson Thiessen mentioned that the geography and continuity of the show are fluidly defined and are subject to change as necessary, and that the production team had no official map of Equestria at their disposal. =Capital Region= The Capital Region is Equestria's foundation and \\"ancestral lands\\", where the united cooperation between the unicorns, pegasi, and earth ponies brought an end to Eternal Winter. The Capital Region represents Equestria's original sovereign borders before the dynastic reign of Princess Celestia; all outlying territories represent subsequent thousand year expansion of the nation's imperialist interests. Much of the Capital Regions are \\"crown lands\\"; i.e. they are legally considered public land and is apart from the monarch's private estate.  Ponyville  Ponyville is the main setting of the entire My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic media franchise, and primary home to the Mane 6. The current elected administrator is Mayor Mare has been leading Ponyville for at least a decade. Ponyville is a young agrarian society settlement, founded a century ago by earth ponies of the Apple family on crown lands lands granted by Princess Celestia personally. A population exceeding a thousand, Ponyville's residents are mostly earth ponies with, though a fair number of pegasi (at least 100 approx.)Hurricane Fluttershy and several dozen unicorns, and some non-ponies call it home. Ponyville is known for its agricultural produce—apples, pears, carrots, etc.—and is home of \\"Sweet Apple Acres\\", Equestria's only source of domesticated zap apple jam. Ponyville has accommodations normally reserved for larger settlements; it is a school district, a diplomatic mission, a tourist destination and a rail center—being the first/last connecting stop between Canterlot and other principalities—but Ponyville has long prided itself on its earth pony culture and its avoidance of urbanization. Ponyville's \\"old- fashioned charm\\" atmosphere is misleading: the small town is home to a diverse cast of eccentric ponies—from grand parties hosted by Pinkie Pie, to Rarity's world renown fashions shows, too name a few—and not a single week passes without some grand adventure or crisis of sort requiring the immediate attention of its residences. Twilight's own first impression of Ponyville upon first arrival was \\"Everypony in this town is crazy!\\"Friendship is Magic Ponyville is portrayed on the world map as a small village near the center of Equestria, within visual distance of both Canterlot and Cloudsdale. The design of Ponyville is mostly Bavarian, with a minor influence of Americana. The season 4 finale, \\"Twilight's Kingdom\\", introduces the Castle of Friendship in Ponyville as the residence of Twilight Sparkle, her assistant Spike, and her pupil Starlight Glimmer. According to the book Art of Equestria, which describes the creation of Friendship is Magic, the creator of the series, Lauren Faust, originally proposed the name Fillydelphia (a pun on the city of Philadelphia) instead of Ponyville. The series later added Fillydelphia as a new, separate city. Faust wrote in a comment on her DeviantArt page that the Everfree Forest is west of Ponyville, Sweet Apple Acres is southwest, Canterlot is northeast, and Fluttershy's cottage and meadow are located north of the farm. However, in subsequent interviews, both Faust and the supervising director and executive producer of the series, Jayson Thiessen, mentioned that the geography and continuity of the show are loosely defined and may change as necessary, and a layout artist for the series stated on December 10, 2011, that the production team had no official map of Equestria for reference. Image archived. Upon the release of Art of Equestria, however, an official map was released. It suggests that the Everfree Forest is to the east of Ponyville, Sweet Apple Acres to the southeast, and Fluttershy's cottage and meadow are located north of the farm.  Canterlot  The Kingdom of Canterlot is the capital of Equestria, built on the side of the Foal Mountains. Canterlot is the setting of the royal court of Princess Celestia and Luna and the residence of Twilight Sparkle before Ponyville. Canterlot Castle is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the Equestrian people at times of national rejoicing and mourning. The name Canterlot is a portmanteau of Camelot and canter. Lauren Faust's inspiration for Canterlot, with its castle carved into the side of the mountain, was Minas Tirith from The Lord of the Rings. Ted Anderson and Agnes Garbowska's inspiration for ancient Canterlot was ancient Rome. According to Lauren Faust, Canterlot was originally called \\"Canterbury\\", after the historical English city, and the name \\"Canterlot\\" was suggested by her husband Craig McCracken. Cloudsdale Cloudsdale is a large floating city in Equestria first depicted in \\"Sonic Rainboom\\". Depicted as being within central capitol region proper, relatively near to Ponyville and Canterlot. Unlike other cities, Cloudsdale floats on a series of clouds, and is only accessible by winged creatures and creatures that have had a \\"cloud-walking spell\\" cast upon them. It is the largest known Pegasi settlement in the realm. Cloudsdale is said to be the original home and birthplace of Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy. Cloudsdale served as the backdrop in the episodes: \\"The Cutie Mark Chronicles\\", \\"The Return of Harmony\\", \\"Hurricane Fluttershy\\", \\"Tanks for the Memories\\", and \\"The End of the End\\". In Friendship Games, Cloudsdale appears in one of the dimensional rifts opened by Midnight Sparkle. Cloudsdale is a pun on Clydesdale, a breed of horse; according to Lauren Faust, the name \\"Cloudsdale\\" was originally suggested by her husband Craig McCracken.  Everfree Forest  The Everfree Forest is a large, enchanted forest grove in the boundaries adjacent of the Ponyville township; it is usually referred to simply as \\"the Forest\\". While technically part of Equestria, the Everfree Forest seasons have a will of their own there. The Forest is also home to an assortment of creatures, many of them dangerous; the animals take care of themselves and are truly wild; and terrible legendary monsters stalk the shadows. Among the plant species within the Forest are trees such as beech, oak, pine, sycamore, yew and knotgrass and thorn undergrowth. Though the Forest is vastly dense and wild, there are few paths and clearings due to the mutated vegetation that grow fast and wild. It is noted as being one of the few places in Equestria where magic behaves erratically for unicorns, the land cannot be tamed by the earth ponies, nor the weather be controlled by the pegasi, but instead moves on its own. The Pillars planted the Tree of Harmony here, both to keep the plethora of monsters and vegetations in check, and to utilize the hostile environment as natural protection from any who would seek out the Tree. The forest is considered uninhabitable and regarded by ponies as the most hostile region within Equestria's borders. Travel is strictly prohibited to all Equestrians for their personal safety. Only the native Everfree Deers seem capable of calling this environment home. It is the location of the Castle of Two Sisters, the Mirror Pool, and other enchanted phenomena. Due to the forest's rich biodiversity of flora and fauna, Zecora frequently travels into the Forest for various reasons; she built her hut within to more easily harvest ingredients for her potions. Thicket, a Deer village, is surrounded by Everfree's thick forests and steep hills which create an enclave that is cut off from its immediate hinterland. Thicket exercises tribal sovereignty—complete jurisdiction and control over the Everfree Forest territory—while recognizing that Equestria retains ultimate federal sovereignty. The episode \\"Stare Master\\" states that the forest is filled with \\"many strange creatures\\". Subsequent episodes show that creatures from the Everfree Forest include hydras, manticores, Cragadiles (crocodile-like creatures made of stone), Timber Wolves (huge wolves made of tree trunks), sea serpents, cockatrices, Parasprites (small bug-like creatures that are highly destructive, but regarded as cute), and Ursas (large bear-like creatures with enlarged teeth and blue or purple fur). =Frozen North= The Frozen North is dominated by the Yaket Mountain Range, north of Equestria, and characterized by an alpine climate, subarctic montane ecosystems, and polar climate. It is a setting in the IDW comic My Little Pony: Friends Forever issue 36. It has short cool summers and long cold winters, and biomes consisting of taiga, treeless tundra, glaciers, exotic medicinal plants, and permanent ice sheets.  Crystal Empire  The Crystal Empire is introduced in season three's premiere episode. It was founded Princess Amore, a female unicorn who appears in the IDW comics' \\"My Little Pony: FIENDship is Magic Issue #1\\" and whose name appears in Little, Brown and Company's \\"The Journal of the Two Sisters\\". The Crystal Empire is a non-sovereign monarchy and technically the oldest of Equestria's principalities; its existence predates it by centuries. After the conflict instigated by King Sombra, the capital vanished fom existence and the empire was annexed by Equestria. The Crystal Heart is the empire's most sacred magical artifact, which possesses the power to absorb, magnify, and deflect emotions. The crystal ponies used it in peacetime to exponentially amplify the power of love and project hope and love across Equestria. In times of conflict, it can be used as a weapon to demoralize the armies of would be aggressors. Celestia addresses the Crystal Empire as a sister nation that is part of Equestria, and the crystal ponies refer to themselves as Equestrian. In \\"The Ballad of the Crystal Empire\\", Twilight Sparkle mentions the Crystal Kingdom as part of the Crystal Ponies' history. It is also home to the Crystal Ponies as well as prince regent Shining Armor and princess regnant Mi Amore Cadenza, who took over the kingdom after King Sombra was defeated a second time by the Crystal Heart. Royal Magic Advisor Sunburst serves her majesty as \\"Royal Mentor and Foalsitter\\" to their daughter and royal heir, Princess Flurry Heart. The book \\"Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell\\" names the Crystal Empire as part of Equestria. =Celestial Coast= The Celestia Sea is located east of Equestria, and is analogous to the real world Atlantic Ocean. The region's biomes, climate, and geographic terrain are equally analogous to Eastern Canada and Eastern United States. The coastline is an emerging megaregion and the most heavily urbanized agglomeration of Equestria. Across the sea, to the far east lies the Griffon Continent; notable nations include Griffonstone, the Griffish Isles, Bug Bear Territory, the Lands of the Hippogriffs, and the Lands of the Dragon.  Manehattan  Manehattan is based on the archipelago of Manhattan and Long Island, portrayed as a large port metropolis, with many landmarks resembling those from New York City. It is first depicted in \\"The Cutie Mark Chronicles\\" and featured prominently in \\"Rarity Takes Manehattan\\". It features late 20th century technologies; including tall buildings and skyscrapers with asphalt streets decorated with electric jumbotrons, neon signs, and lampposts.\\"Shadow Play\\" Ponies' primary form of transportation are pony-drawn taxi carriages and underground metrorailway system. Manehattan is the most densely populated and ethnically diverse city in Equestria, hosting all manner of races and species, and is a major commercial, financial and cultural center. Its iconic landmarks include the Crystaller Building, Friendship Trade Center, neon-lit Bridleway Theater District, Madisoat Mare Garden, Maneway Grand Central Station, and Manehattan Park. A mirror of the Statue of Liberty, the \\"Mare Statue,\\" located on Friendship Island, has become a national symbol of Equestria's commitment of peace and goodwill towards all nations. Like Ponyville and Canterlot, Manehattan is depicted as the location of one of Rarity's boutiques, known as \\"Rarity for You\\". Notable features of the setting include conventions differing from Ponyville's, as seen in the episode, \\"Stranger Than Fan Fiction\\", and an elevated train. Starlight's Village, also called Our Town, is a community in the Manehattan region and is characterized by a semi-arid climate.  Hollow Shades  Hollow Shades was first mentioned in \\"Apple Family Reunion\\". The town first physically appeared in the Map of Equestria, a hand-drawn piece of artwork that lays out the canonical layout of Equestria, located east of Canterlot, tucked underneath a forest canopy, and hidden behind Foal Mountain.  Seaward Shoals  Seaward Shoals is portrayed as a small rocky coastal port town, similar to those of the New England region of the United States. Also called Silver Shoals or Rocky Shoals, the community is the setting of the episode \\"P.P.O.V. (Pony Point of View)\\". The former Princesses, Luna and Celestia, retired to this region upon abdicating the throne.The End of the End  Griffish Isles  Griffish Isles, an Equestrian archipelago commonwealth, located in the Celestia Sea off the north-western coast of continental \\"Griffon continent\\", and is analogous to the real world British Isles. On the official mapMy Little Pony: The Movie, it is also very close to the Bug Bear Territory. Equestrian settlements include Buckingham, Manechester, and Trottingham (a portmanteau of 'Nottingham', an English city, and 'trot', a jogging speed for horses) the regional capitol city of Griffish Isles. The Griffish Isles is first mentioned in \\"Stare Master\\"—where Rarity is making 20 gold-lined gowns for ponies there—and later mentioned in \\"Luna Eclipsed\\" My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Issue #15, \\"Simple Ways\\" My Little Pony: FIENDship is Magic Issue #3, and \\"Crusaders of the Lost Mark\\". It is also mentioned on Enterplay trading card series 2 #46, a card of Sir Lintsalot. Trottingham itself is said to be based on the British city of Birmingham and the ponies that inhabit it wear clothing inspired by British culture and have stereotype Cockney accents. Notable residents of Griffish Isles include Pipsqueak before a move, and Sassy Saddles before moving to the Equestrian mainland. =Luna Coast=  Las Pegasus  Las Pegasus is depicted as a floating cloud city, like Cloudsdale. Based on the cities of Las Vegas and Paradise, Nevada, Las Pegasus is portrayed as \\"one big party\\", with many hotels, resorts, nightlife, amusement parks, restaurants, arcades, and casinos. Las Pegasus was the setting of the episode \\"Viva Las Pegasus\\". Las Pegasus actively competes with Applewood and Manehatten for the title of \\"entertainment capitol of the world\\". =Mysterious South= This region is known for its arid deserts, temperate prairies and tropical rainforest biomes. Appleloosa Appleloosa is the most populous settlement in the region. Dodge Junction is based on the cities of the American Wild West, and is portrayed as a bustling township that mainly revolves around a cherry farm run by the earth pony Cherry Jubilee. Similar to Dodge Junction, Appleloosa, a pun of the Appaloosa horse breed, is a setting based on the cities of the American Wild West and mainly revolves around an apple orchard that is home to members of the \\"Apple Family\\". Appleloosa is depicted as bordering on the buffalo lands, home of the indigenous buffalo tribes.  The Badlands  The Badlands are in the remote desert backcountry, and are known to be populated by terrifying creatures, such as diamond dogs, giant worms, and rogue dragons.  Somnambula  Somnambula, roughly based on Egypt and North Africa, has an arid, desert climate, excluding a few oases. It is notable as a city that the pony adventurer Daring Do has saved twice. Somnambula, a heroic pegasus who rescued the prince of the Kingdom from a sphinx, is the city's namesake. The city is noted as once being ruled over by pharaohs, and is first mentioned in the episode \\"Stranger than Fan Fiction\\", and shown again in the episode \\"Daring Done?\\". = Other locations = Hope Hollow Hope Hollow is a township located in an unspecified region of Equestria. It was primarily lead by the Skies family, who served as the mayors for at least three generations. Petunia Petals runs at least two businesses in the town, and assists the Mayor in fulfilling seven government jobs in total, making her arguably the most important pony in the town.My Little Pony: Rainbow Roadtrip Mentioned locations The setting of San Franciscolt is based on the city of San Francisco, and is mentioned in the book Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell. In episodes throughout the series and in promotional material, other locations are mentioned, but not used as settings. A partial list includes Baltimare, based on the city of Baltimore; Fillydelphia, which is based on the city of Philadelphia and was the original name for Ponyville when the show was in development; and Vanhoover, which is based on Vancouver, Canada and is described as the former home of \\"Grand Pear\\", Applejack's grandfather. Lands beyond Equestria Most of these nations maintain some form of official diplomatic relations with Equestria. In Season 8 premier, Equestria's allied leadership sent their children to Princess Twilight's School of Friendship as part of a cultural exchange program; when the children went missing, their parents were prepared to declare war on Equestria. After the defeat of the Storm King, at the request of Twilight Sparkle, Equestria initiated economic assistance to help rebuild war-torn regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, and improve the prosperity of nations devastated by the Storm Empire. In \\"My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Issue #61-62\\" story Convocation of Creatures, Twilight Sparkle, Princess Celestia, and Raven Inkwell take part in the Convocation of Creatures, an assembly of delegates and leaders from all across the world. At the convocation reception, she meets Princess Cadance, Queen Novo, Princess Ember, Prince Rutherford, King Thorax, and hundreds of other leaders from other regions of the world. =Allied Nations of Equestria=  Saddle Arabia is mentioned in \\"Magic Duel\\", \\"Road to Friendship\\", and My Little Pony: The Movie. Princess Celestia has hosted diplomatic representatives from this region on several occasions. Hoo'Far, a Saddle Arabian unicorn, states that Saddle Arabia has \\"many fans\\" of Trixie. The name is a play on the country of Saudi Arabia.  The duke and duchess of Maretonia appear in attendance of the Equestria Games in the episode of the same name. They appear again in Twilight's Kingdom and visit the Crystal Empire for a summit with Celestia, Luna, and Cadance. Maretonia is also mentioned in Princess Celestia and the Summer of Royal Waves and by Cadance and Shining Armor in The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows. The name is a play on Macedonia.  The Hippogriffs/Hippocampus nation in My Little Pony The Movie and in The Official Movie Sourcebook, to which they fled after their original home of Hippogriffia was destroyed by the Storm King's forces. *: The location of the Hippogriff Kingdom, south of the Badlands, and located near Klugetown. Mount Aris also appears in \\"Surf and/or Turf\\" and is illustrated in \\"The Hearth's Warming Club\\" and \\"Father Knows Beast\\". *: The capital of the hippogriff kingdom, located atop Mount Aris. When Tempest Shadow infiltrates the city in an attempt to steal a magical pearl from Queen Novo, the city is destroyed in a battle between the Hippogriffs and the Storm King's forces, and is abandoned when the hippogriffs go into hiding. In the film, Twilight and her friends travel to the ruined city in search of the Hippogriffs. Hippogriffia also appears in \\"Surf and/or Turf\\", restored to its former glory.  The Changeling Hive is the home of the changelings. Here, Chrysalis is dethroned and Thorax succeeds her as changeling leader. The changelings fed on emotions, and their magic was built around them.  Dragon Lands are the home of dragons. Due to their egotistical nature, dragons do not have any formal borders or government by traditional definitions, functioning rather like adhocracy. Dragon's primary food source is that of gemstones, many of which are imported from Equestria. Since the rise of the new \\"Dragon Lord,\\" the leader of the dragons, the dragons have agreed to \\"stop being bullies\\" to the ponies, and have even sent some members of their species to study in Equestria.  The Griffon Kingdom is primarily populated by griffons, and has acted as close allies of Equestria. * is the capitol city populated by griffons. It has a rich history centered around an ancient treasure called the Idol of Boreas. As with dragons, Griffin culture is one of \\"every Griffon for themselves\\" that places value upon personal honor and wealth. Griffons are taught to bolster themselves against this hostile environments, and any display of feelings is interpreted as weakness deserving of ridicule or exploitation.  Yakyakistan is the yak kingdom. It is located north of the Crystal Empire and is ruled by the yak Prince Rutherford. Ambassador Pinkie Pie befriended the citizens, was made an \\"honorary yak-pony\\", and assimilated into their culture. Prince Blueblood and Shining Armor visit Yakyakistan for a diplomatic mission to set up a trade agreement between it and the Crystal Empire.  AbyssiniaTails of Equestria: The Official Movie Sourcebook is a kingdom located in the Mysterious South, south of Equestria by the Bone Dry Desert. A fairly industrious kingdom, Abyssinia has numerous cities within its borders, such as the capital city of Panthera, Tabbytown and Henry. It's a largely peaceful kingdom with kind monarchs and well-developed cities and appears to be in many ways, the cat \\"equivalent\\" of Equestria. Abyssinia is named after the real-life cat breed. The location was first mentioned in \\"Ponies of Dark Water\\" in 2016 and made its first true appearance in \\"Storm King\\". Ever since then, the location has become a consistent aspect of the My Little Pony mythos, with it being mentioned in Tails of Equestria: The Official Movie Sourcebook, Ponyville Mysteries and the Gameloft video game. The early history of Abyssinia is quite vague. The land was ruled by an absolute monarchy of King and Queen, rather than Equestria's principality-like constitutional monarchy. Its capital of Panthera was settled on the borders of a cat-like lake by the Cat lords. Applejack and the Mane Six apparently have a history of getting arrested in Abyssinia, with Applejack claiming it was \\"strangely litigious\\". The kingdom was annexed by the Storm Empire: its capital of Panthera was later destroyed by the Storm King \\"out of boredom\\".My Little Pony: The Movie Prequel #3 During the Reign of the Storm King, many cats who left Panthera moved to Klugetown and set up various merchant shop and smuggling rings. After the Storm King was destroyed by the Mane Six, the kingdom's fate was left unknown. Afterwards, the Royal family of Abyssinia attended the \\"Convocation of the Creatures\\" event at Mount Metazoa, and the Abyssinian Embassy was constructed in Ponyville. These events signified that the kingdom is recovering from the disaster and is in diplomatic relations with Equestria. In the original map of Abyssinia, the continent was shown to be huge and vaguely L-shaped with mountainous terrain. After the release of My Little Pony: The Movie, the official location of the kingdom is currently unknown, given the known geography is mismatched with the layout of the Mysterious South. The kingdom appears to be mostly an even- temperament with large bodies of water and a decent amount of vegetation, but nearby locations such as Klugetown and the Basalt Beach are almost completely barren and dry. =Other nations= *Klugetown is a diversely-populated desert town featured in My Little Pony: The Movie, The Stormy Road to Canterlot, My Little Pony: The Movie Prequel Issue #4, Gameloft's mobile game, The Official Movie Sourcebook, and IDW's Nightmare Knights issue 4. Economically, Klugetown is depicted as being very close to a laissez-faire guildocracy, with little discipline or regulation governing trade or government, with both benign and sinister consequences. Although Klugetown tends to be lopped in with Abyssinia, Chummer remarked that the Bone Dry Desert, which surrounds all of Klugetown, was outside of Abyssinia's sovereign borders.

Background Tandy-employee Steve Leininger had written the first draft of the NIBL (National Industrial Basic Language) BASIC interpreter for the SC/MP while employed at National Semiconductor . Unable to take that source code with him, he initially hired a consultant to write an interpreter. When that contractor failed to deliver, he adapted Li-Chen Wang's public domain version of Tiny BASIC for the original prototype of the TRS-80 Model I. This required only 2 KB of memory for the interpreter, leaving an average of another 2 KB free for user programs in common 4 KB memory layouts of early machines. During a demonstration to executives, Tandy Corporation's then-President Charles Tandy tried to enter his salary but was unable to do so. This was because Tiny BASIC used 2-byte signed integers with a maximum value of 32,767. The result was a request for floating-point math for the production version. This led to the replacement of the existing 16-bit integer code with a version using 32-bit single-precision floating-point numbers. Leininger further extended the language to support input/output routines (keyboard, CRT, and reading and writing from cassettes). The language fit within 4 KB of ROM. In a presentation announcing the TRS-80, Leininger said, \\"What we did, we went back through the Wang Basic and completely tore out about 60 per cent of it, the integer overhead and all that kind of stuff.\\" Further Development When the TRS-80 was introduced, three versions of BASIC were announced: * Level I BASIC * Level II BASIC - developed by Microsoft and using 12KB of ROM to add string handling, error handling, trigonometric and other dedicated functions * Level III BASIC - also developed by Microsoft, offering disk commands The Level I language was not available for the TRS-80 Model II but briefly re-surfaced as the baseline package for the TRS-80 Model III in 1981, selling for $699 compared to the $999 system with Model III BASIC (another Microsoft product). The language was identical to the Model I version but with the addition of commands to output to a printer. Language features Level I BASIC supported the following keywords: * Commands: \`NEW\`, \`RUN\`, \`LIST\`, \`CONT\` (to continue or resume a program from a breakpoint) * Statements: \`PRINT\`, \`INPUT\`, \`READ\`, \`DATA\`, \`RESTORE\`, \`LET\` * Structure: \`GOTO\`, \`GOSUB\`, \`ON-GOTO\`, \`ON-GOSUB\`, \`RETURN\`, \`IF-THEN\` (but no \`ELSE\`), \`FOR-TO-STEP/NEXT\`, \`STOP\`, \`END\` * Graphics: \`CLS\`, \`SET\`, \`RESET\`, \`POINT()\` * Functions: \`ABS()\`, \`INT()\`, \`RND()\`, \`MEM\` * Math: + - * / * Relational operators: < > = <= => <> * Logical operators: * [AND] + [OR] Like Palo Alto Tiny BASIC on which it was based, Level I BASIC did not tokenize keywords like Microsoft BASIC but used abbreviations to reduce the amount of memory used by keywords, such as \`F.\` for \`FOR\`, \`G.\` for \`GOTO\`, \`P.\` for \`PRINT\`, and \`T.\` for \`THEN\`. The language supported 26 single- precision variables A to Z, two strings A$ and B$ (limited to 16 characters each), and one pre-defined array A(). The language lacked a DIM statement for dimensioning the array, the size of which was determined by available memory not used by the program listing (4 bytes per item). As the language lacked many common math functions, the manual provided subroutine listings for square root, exponentiation, exponentials, logarithms, arithmetic sign, and trigonometry functions. Graphics support was as minimal a set as possible: , for CLear Screen; , which lighted a location on the display; , which turned it off; and , which returned 1 if a location was lit, 0 if it was not. The coordinates could be any expression and ranged from 0 to 127 for the X-axis and 0 to 47 for the Y-axis. Only black-and-white display was supported.

She won six of her eleven races in a racing career which lasted from October 2000 until May 2002. As a juvenile she won on her debut and then finished second to Vinnie Roe in the Eyrefield Stakes. In the following year she won the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial and the Pretty Polly Stakes as well as finishing third in the Prix de l'Opéra. She reached her peak as a four-year-old in 2002 when she was undefeated in three starts, taking the Gladness Stakes, Mooresbridge Stakes and Tattersalls Gold Cup. After her retirement from racing she had considerable success as a dam of winners. Background Rebelline is a bay mare with no white markings bred in Ireland by Peter Tellwright of the British-based Tyrley Castle Stud. As a foal in December 1999 the filly was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was sold for 28,000 guineas. She returned to the sales ring as a yearling at Goffs in October 1999 and was bought for IR£68,000 by Lady O'Reilly's Castlemartin Stud. She was sent into training with Kevin Prendergast and was ridden in all of her races by Declan McDonogh. She was sired by Robellino, a son of Roberto who won the Royal Lodge Stakes and sired several other good winners including Mister Baileys and Royal Rebel. Rebelline's dam Fleeting Rainbow showed little racing ability, failing to win in three races, but did better a broodmare, producing several other winners including the Blandford Stakes winner Quws. She was descended from the British broodmare Pelting (foaled 1958) who was the ancestor of several other major winners including Moon Ballad, Bassenthwaite, Braashee (Prix Royal-Oak) and Central Park (Italian Derby). Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Rebelline made her first appearance in a maiden race over one mile at Navan Racecourse on 18 October. Starting at odds of 7/1 in an eighteen-runner field she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from the Aidan O'Brien-trained Karsavina. The filly was then stepped up in class for the Listed Eyrefield Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse on 12 November and finished second of the twenty runners, beaten one and a half lengths by the Dermot Weld-trained colt Vinnie Roe. =2001: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old Rebelline contested the 1,000 Guineas Trial over seven furlongs at Leopardstown on 16 April and started 7/2 second favourite behind the highly rated Imagine. After tracking the leaders she went to the front a furlong and a half from the finish, accelerated away from the field and won \\"easily\\" by five and a half lengths from the favourite. On 27 May at the Curragh the filly was moved up to Group 1 class and started at odds of 8/1 in a sixteen-runner field for the Irish 1,000 Guineas. She stayed on in the straight without ever looking likely to win and finished fifth behind Imagine, Crystal Music, Toroca and Sequoyah. Five weeks after her defeat in the Guineas, Rebelline returned to the Curragh and was moved up in distance for the Group 2 Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs. She was the subject of a \\"massive gamble\\" in the betting market, being backed down from 9/2 to 2/1 favourite. She raced in second behind the British challenger Heavenly Whisper before going to the front approaching the final furlong and kept on well to win by two lengths from the four-year-old Molomo. After the race Prendergast said \\"I thought she would win because she was working so well\\". The filly started 11/2 third choice in the betting for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh in July, but never threatened the leaders and finished seventh of the twelve runners, six lengths behind the winner Lailani. Rebelline was off the course for more than two and a half months before returning in October when she was sent to France to contest the Group 1 Prix de l'Opéra over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. She finished strongly and took third place, beaten one and a half lengths and two lengths by Terre A Terre and Mot Juste. Two weeks later she started a 16/1 outsider for the Champion Stakes at Newmarket and came home eighth of the twelve runners behind Nayef. =2002: four-year- old season= On her four-year-old debut Rebelline was assigned a weight of 136 pounds for the Group 3 Gladness Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 7 April. She started second choice in the betting behind Johannesburg a three-year-old colt who had won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in November 2001 and been named champion juvenile in both Europe and the United States. Johannesburg took the lead in the final furlong but Rebelline, after briefly looking unlikely to get a clear run, came from well off the pace to catch the colt in the final strides and win by a short head. Kevin Prendergast commented \\"Rebelline always goes well fresh and I thought Johannesburg looked ring-rusty before the race. She had a back problem 10 weeks ago but she would have been an unlucky loser had she not got out in time\\". Rebelline was then sent to France for the Prix Ganay but was withdrawn from the race when she was found to be in season. On 6 May Rebelline was stepped back up in distance for the Mooresbridge Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh, in which she was matched against the St Leger winner Milan. Starting the 5/2 second favourite her task was made considerably easier when Milan was pulled up injured before the straight. She overhauled the front-running Shoal Creek a furlong from the finish and won by three quarters of a length. The Group 1 Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh on 26 May attracted a field of eight runners and saw Nayef start favourite ahead of Tobougg with Rebelline next in the betting on 7/1 alongside Bach (Royal Whip Stakes). The other four runners were Indian Creek (Earl of Sefton Stakes), Chancellor (Gordon Richards Stakes), Diamond Trim (Finale Stakes) and Chimes At Midnight (Curragh Cup). Bach set the pace with Rebelline settled behind the leaders before turning into the straight in fifth place. After struggling to obtain a clear run, McDonogh switched the filly to the inside and began to make rapid progress in the last quarter mile. Rebelline gained the advantage 75 yards from the finish and broke clear to win by two lengths from Bach with Nayef two and a half lengths back in third. After the race Prendergast described the mare as \\"a giant-killer\\". He also explained that Rebelline had suffered from arthritis throughout her racing career and that her fitness had to be maintained by regular swimming sessions rather that conventional training gallops. Despite hopes that she would return for an autumn campaign, Rebelline never raced again and was retired from racing at the end of the season. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Rebelline was retired to become a broodmare for her owner's Castlemartin Stud. She produced at least ten foals and six winners: *Regalline, a bay filly, foaled in 2004, sired by Green Desert. Won one race. *Rockcliffe, bay colt (late gelded), 2005, by King's Best. Failed to win in five races. *Recharge, bay colt, 2006, by Cape Cross.

The Society promotes the legacy of its eponym by holding an annual meeting of scholars and enthusiasts, publishing The Mailer Review, Project Mailer, and The NMS Podcast, awarding the Robert F. Lucid Award for the year's best scholarship, and encouraging continued interest in his work through all forms of media. History On July 11, 2002, J. Michael Lennon, Barry H. Leeds, and John Whalen-Bridge met Norman Mailer in Provincetown, Massachusetts to discuss the creation of the organization and gain Mailer's approval. Mailer's biographer Robert Lucid could not attend, but he was one of the original quartet planning the Society. Having received Mailer's blessing, the Norman Mailer Society was officially founded in 2003. During the American Literature Association's conference in Cambridge on May 22, 2003, there was a planning meeting and interim officers elected for the Norman Mailer Society. On November 1, 2003, the Society had its inaugural meeting in Brooklyn prompted in part as a reaction to Mailer's being dropped from the sixth edition of The Norton Anthology of American Literature because (according to the editors) \\"regular surveys of professors had shown declining use of Mr. Mailer's work\\". Ron Rosenbaum, a New York Observer columnist, commented about the creation of the Society: \\"It's good to recognize people for their service while they're still around to appreciate it\\". Non-profit incorporation papers were filed in the State of New York, July 21, 2004, and were approved on September 14, 2004. The Society was incorporated in Windham, Connecticut in 2008. At the 2017 conference, J. Michael Lennon and David Light stepped down as President and Treasurer respectively. The Board unanimously elected former-VP Maggie McKinley, chair of the English Department at Harper College, as President. Gerald Lucas (Professor of English at Middle Georgia State University) became VP and Jason Mosser (Professor of English at Georgia Gwinnett College) replaced Light as Treasurer.  Activities  Mailer and Lawrence Schiller at the 2006 conference Members meet annually for paper presentations, panel discussions, film viewings, and other activities centered around the life and work of Norman Mailer. In 2015, the Society reconvened in Provincetown, MA, for its annual conference, bringing together Society members, two of Mailer's daughters, and a reading of Tough Guys Don't Dance, Mailer's 1984 novel about his adopted hometown. In addition to an annual meeting, the Society undertakes the following activities: the maintaining of a website devoted to matters of interest to the membership, including a newsletter and bibliography updated semi-annually. Along with Provincetown and Brooklyn, conferences have been held in Washington (D.C.), Wilkes-Barre (PA), Long Branch (NJ), Sarasota (FL), and Macon (GA). Norman and Norris hosted Society members at post-conference parties, in 2003 at their house in Brooklyn Heights, and 2004 through 2007 at their Provincetown, MA residence. According to Lennon, the Mailers hosted keynote speakers at their house each year for lunch, including Neil Abercrombie and William Kennedy. At the 2006 conference in Provincetown, Mailer read from his new novel, The Castle in the Forest, at the Provincetown Arts Theatre to a packed house of conference attendees and the general public. The Society sponsored the 50th Anniversary March on the Pentagon that Mailer wrote about in his Pulitzer-Prize-winning book Armies of the Night. Organized by the Vietnam Peace Commemoration Committee, the events took place on October 24, 2017 in Washington D.C. Plaque in Long Branch, NJ. On May 23, 2018, the Society co-sponsored with the city of Long Branch the installation of a bronze memorial to Mailer and the Scarboro Hotel. The hotel was run and eventually owned by the Mailer family until it burned down in 1941. Members of the Society and the local community attended the unveiling ceremony where the beachside hotel used to stand. Publications During the fourth annual conference in Provincetown (October 12–14, 2006), the membership voted to establish the brainchild of Phillip Sipiora, The Mailer Review, co- sponsored by the University of South Florida and edited by Sipiora and co- edited by Gerald Lucas. The journal is published annually in the fall. In 2014 under the leadership of board member Gerald R. Lucas, the Society launched Project Mailer, a Digital Humanities initiative to \\"augment Mailer Studies for a digital age\\". Their first publication was an open-access, digital version of Mike Lennon's Norman Mailer: Works and Days that's \\"meant to be read and used on the screen\\". Created and hosted by Society member Justin Bozung, The Norman Mailer Society Podcast had its premiere episode in February 2015. The Podcast is released twice monthly and features rare audio, interviews, analysis, and discussions about, as James Wolcott put it, the \\"wooly-bully exploits\\" of Norman Mailer. In spring 2018, the Society sponsored the publication of Library of America's two-volume boxed set Norman Mailer: the Sixties edited by J. Michael Lennon. The set includes Four Books of the 1960s and Collected Essays of the 1960s. Robert F. Lucid Award In 2003, the Society established The Robert F. Lucid Award for Mailer Studies in recognition of Lucid's long and distinguished career as a Mailer scholar. The Lucid Award is given annually based on the recommendation of a Society committee. The winner receives a plaque and a $250 honorarium, and he or she is invited to speak at the conference. Recent winners include Maggie McKinley for Understanding Norman Mailer in 2018, Kevin Schultz for Buckley and Mailer: The Difficult Friendship that Shaped the Sixties in 2015, the Society's own president J. Michael Lennon for The Selected Letters of Norman Mailer in 2014, and again for Norman Mailer: A Double Life in 2013. Members Society membership is open to all who share an interest in the Society's eponym. The Society consists of officers, an Executive Board, and general members from diverse backgrounds. They range from enthusiasts, academics, creatives, and politicians to family members and contemporaries of Mailer's. As of 2017, the Society has approximately 300 international members.

It is based on the 1988 play by Rosenfeld. It is also Rosenfeld's directorial debut. A Brother's Kiss was based on a play by writer/director Seth Zvi Rosenfeld, who grew up in the same neighborhood as actor Michael Raynor; Raynor and Nick Chinlund were also friends as children. Plot Mick (Michael Raynor) and Lex (Nick Chinlund) are a pair of brothers who grew up in Harlem under circumstances that were difficult at best. Their mother Doreen (Cathy Moriarty) was a diabetic with a drinking problem and difficulty in saying no to men. While she wasn't a prostitute, she grew dependent on the little gifts her lovers would bring by, and as kids, Mick and Lex learned to accept this as the way things were. One night, Mick and Lex were taking a walk in the park when they were accosted by a cop who molested the younger Mick. Lex, older and strong as a grown man, attacked the cop, which led to a stay in a reform school. Years later, Mick is himself a policeman; while he's tried to bury the childhood incident in his past, he still shows emotional scars and is sexually dysfunctional. Lex, however, has taken the more dramatic slide. Since his stay in reform school, Lex has been in and out of trouble; today he has a combative relationship with Debbie (Rosie Perez), his girlfriend and the mother of his child and a going-nowhere job driving a bus. He also sells drugs for local dealer Lefty Louie (John Leguizamo), but has developed enough of a habit that his sales don't begin to compensate for the amount he uses himself.

He is the composer of Hollywood film soundtracks such as Screw Cupid, Truth About Kerry as well as the contemplative soundtrack for The Letters, based on the life of Mother Teresa of Calcutta. He has also worked extensively in contemporary music since graduating from Trinity College Dublin. He has written a violin concerto for Cora Venus Lunny, a clarinet quartet for the Czech Clarinet Quartet, and his vocal works have been performed internationally by choirs such as Pfizerphonics and Ireland's 2016 choir of the year, Voci Nuove. Life and career Growing up in the Meath village of Dunboyne, Hope was involved with music from early childhood: his mother Kitty played the violin and viola as well as teaching in the DIT College of Music (Chatham Row) and his sister Grainne is a professional cellist. He studied music from a young age and developed a keen interest in clarinet and composition during his teenage years. He attended school at Castleknock College before completing B.A. and B.A.I. degrees in Mathematics and Engineering at Trinity College Dublin. Hope continued his composition studies under the supervision of Ladislav Kubik at the Czech American Summer Music Institute in the Prague Conservatory throughout his college years. He later received a Master's Degree in Engineering and Music from Trinity College Dublin in 1998. After winning the IMRO Prize for composition at the RTÉ Musician of the Future competition for his solo clarinet piece Diptych, he moved to Los Angeles to attend the UCLA Film Scoring Program on a Fulbright Scholarship. In 1999, he worked as part of the orchestrating team on the score of the Hollywood feature film The Insider, which was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. In 2012, his scores for Truth About Kerry (2010) and End of the Innocents (2011) were both nominated for a Gold Medal for Excellence in their respective categories at the Park City Film Music Festival.

Having undertaken composer residencies at the Tyrone Guthrie artist's retreat in County Monaghan and the Cill Rialaig artist's retreat in County Kerry with the support of a 2011 Tyrone Guthrie Centre regional bursary award and a 2012 Cill Rialaig residency award, Hope spent four months as the 2013 Composer-in- residence at the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris, where he worked on several pieces including a suite of music for children's orchestras based on a cultural tour of Paris and an opera about revolutionary Robert Emmet's time in France. In 2013 he also began work on the orchestral score for the Hollywood film The Letters based on the life of Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Recorded with the Macedonian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Mother Teresa's home town of Skopje, Macedonia, and with New Dublin Voices choir in her spiritual birthplace of Dublin, Ireland, the score was completed in the summer of 2014 and the film went on release in the US on 4 December 2015. The score has also received many live performances, most notably in the Pantheon in Rome by PfizerPfonics.

History The building was designed as the headquarters of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and was probably completed in the late 19th century. The unit evolved to become the 5th Battalion, The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the Western Front. The battalion amalgamated with the 4th Battalion to form the 4th/5th Battalion, The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry at Truro in 1921. Although the two battalions operated separately during the Second World War, they amalgamated at Truro again in 1947. The presence in Bodmin was reduced to a single company, D Company, 4th/5th Battalion, The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, at that time. After the contingent in Bodmin relocated to the Territorial Army Centre in Castle Canyke Road, the Honey Street drill hall became surplus to requirements; it was subsequently decommissioned and is now used as a social club.

Who served as a link between \\"the Bank of England, the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt and the gilt-edged market in the London Stock Exchange\\". This was the official title established by William Pitt the Younger in 1786. The role involved an attendance at the Bank of England on a Thursday morning to be informed of any change in the Bank Rate, which the senior partner would then communicate to the Stock Exchange. The broker would be accompanied on his visit to the stock exchange by a junior member of the Mullens & Co. staff, that in the event he should be struck down on his journey, the junior member would be able to obtain the bank rate (written on a piece of paper inside his pocket) and present it to the stock exchange.

After appearing in promotional webisodes, the character made his game debut in Dishonored (2012), where he grants magical powers to the player character. He serves a similar role in the game's sequel, Dishonored 2 (2016), though he may be rejected. The Outsider reappears in Dishonored: Death of the Outsider (2017), which follows former-assassin Billie Lurk as she attempts to kill or otherwise neutralize him. Within the series' fiction, the Outsider is one of many representations of the Void that have existed, and was originally a street urchin before being sacrificed by a cult. Voiced by Billy Lush in the first game, the actor was replaced by Robin Lord Taylor for Dishonored 2 onwards. The character has often been viewed as a sort of trickster god, though director Harvey Smith has denied this interpretation. His sacrifice drew comparisons with the ancient Greek pharmakos by one writer, who would be brought to work on Death of the Outsider. Others commented on the Outsider and the Void as figures of choice, or related them to the open-ended gameplay of the series. The character has received a negative reception from some critics, though has been praised by others. Appearances =Dishonored (2012)= In the lead-up to Dishonoreds release, the Outsider was introduced in more detail in The Tales from Dunwall, a series of webisodes giving more information on the game's lore. \\"The Hand that Feeds\\", the second episode, tells of one character the Outsider gifted powers to. An unnamed boy is ostracized and beaten by the other boys he knows, his only friend a white rat. One night while the boy is hiding in an alley, the Outsider appears and grants the boy his mark. Emboldened by his new powers, the boy finds his \\"tormentors\\" and uses the mark to unleash a swarm of rats over them, but one of the rats bites him in the process and infects him with the plague. In his last days, succumbing to the sickness, the boy searches in vain for the Outsider to thank him, as he \\"would no longer have to live in fear, for what little life he had left\\". The Outsider then made his game debut in Dishonored, voiced by Billy Lush. In Dishonored, the player plays as Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress. After the Empress is murdered and her daughter kidnapped by Daud, an assassin marked by the Outsider, Corvo is framed for her murder by the new Lord Regent. Corvo escapes six months after and joins with the Loyalists, who wish to rescue the Empress's daughter, put her on the throne, and use Corvo to systematically eliminate the Lord Regent's core allies and then himself. The night after Corvo meets the Loyalists, the Outsider visits Corvo in a dream and marks him, granting him magical powers. He also gifts Corvo a living heart, which gives him the secrets of anyone it's pointed at. If the player finds shrines to the Outsider during the game's missions, the Outsider will discuss Corvo's current mission and his choices during it. The Outsider kickstarts the story of The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, the game's downloadable content, where he first informs Daud of \\"Delilah\\"; this leads Daud to begin investigating her and then work on thwarting her plans. Like in the main game, the player find his shrines across the levels, whereupon the Outsider will comment on Daud and the player's choices so far. =Dishonored 2 (2016)= Robin Lord Taylor voices the Outsider in Dishonored 2 and Death of the Outsider, replacing Billy Lush in the role. For Dishonored 2, artists looked again at the Outsider, making slight alterations to some details and giving him a more balanced silhouette. Robin Lord Taylor replaced Lush as the voice of the character. Lush appeared in the Dishonored 2 reveal trailer, but has said he did not receive any further calls about the role afterwards. The character was Taylor's first role in a video game, as well as his first outside of live-action. Taylor was not familiar with the game beforehand, but studied Lush's \\"amazing\\" performance in preparation of the role and was given detailed information on the character and the world by Arkane. In the game, the player can choose to play as Corvo Attano or Empress Emily Kaldwin. After the throne is usurped by the witch Delilah and Corvo's powers robbed of him, the Outsider appears again to offer the mark. The player may deny him and play the game without powers, if they wish. The Outsider appears a few more times, at shrines and at one point where he drags the player into the Void to give them more information on Delilah. During this time, he recounts how he was tied down and sacrificed against his will to become \\"a god\\". =Death of the Outsider (2017)= Death of the Outsider was intended to bring the initial story arc of the Dishonored games, following the Outsider and the aftereffects of the Empress's assassination, to a close. The game follows Billie Lurk on a quest to kill or otherwise neutralize the Outsider at the behest of an aged Daud, her former mentor. After rescuing Daud from the clutches a cult devoted to worshipping the Outsider, Daud tells Billie of his plan to kill the \\"black-eyed bastard\\". That night the Outsider visits her in a dream, forcibly replacing her arm and left-eye with Void- touched substitutes which grant her magical abilities. Billie searches for the knife used to originally sacrifice the Outsider, which is carefully guarded by the cult and may be used to kill him. After she finds it, the Outsider informs her that Daud has passed away. Billie tracks the cult to an isolated mountain that leaks physically into the Void. There she finds the Outsider's physical presence, carefully guarded by cultists and encased in stone, surrounded by Daud and other dead spirits wandering the Void. The player may choose to kill the Outsider here. Alternatively, they may discover that the Outsider's mark is actually his forgotten name, taken from him by the ritual and written in the language of the dead, and that if given back this name will undo the ritual and turn the Outsider human once more. The player may then instead convince Daud to forgive the Outsider and whisper the Outsider his name, setting him free to live a new life. In the epilogue, Billie muses that without the Outsider there is no one to choose who will or won't be touched by the Void's magic. Character and analysis Within the context of the Dishonored universe, the Outsider is a representation of the Void. The Void is eternal, though \\"every few thousands of years\\" it has an avatar that watches over it. The Outsider himself is not the first god to act as such a representation, nor may he necessarily be the last. He was originally a \\"vulnerable\\" street urchin, until he was found by a cult, kidnapped and ritually sacrificed to turn him into what he is now. As a god, he appears as a young man with iris-less, black eyes. A religious order known as the Abbey of the Everyman work to oppose the Outsider, magic and witchcraft. Gaming critic Robert Rath compared the Outsider to Satan in the Book of Job, considering the Outsider as a tempter figure who provides Corvo with the power that may ultimately \\"doom\\" both him and Dunwall. Rath notes the most violent powers the Outsider provides Corvo are the \\"most effective, visually striking and fun\\", and sees him as silently encouraging Corvo to give into his baser instincts. The Heart, meanwhile, often \\"spoonfeeds\\" Corvo the justifications for killing the people he comes across, easily leading to a slippery slope justified by faux-\\"righteousness\\". Rath supports this position with how other characters gifted by the Outsider—Daud, Granny Rags, Piero—all seem headed for \\"a bad end\\", destabilizing Dunwall in the progress. Jeff Howard considered the Outsider a \\"trickster figure\\" whose \\"moral Otherness\\" from the rest of Dunwall society allowed the magic of the franchise's world to be an \\"amoral force\\", whose uses are left up to the player. Frank G. Bosman sees the Outsider as a \\"morally neutral\\" figure whose ties to the Biblical Leviathan represent an association with the primal chaos before creation. With the Outsider as a figure of \\"chaos and anarchy\\" whose grace is \\"arbitrary\\", the Abbey in opposition to him fight for \\"order, discipline, separation and rationality\\", and more negatively \\"for the inclination of domination and control\\"—thereby themselves becoming complicit in the oppression of the common people by Dunwall's elite. Game director Harvey Smith, 2006 Harvey Smith denied interpretations that the Outsider was a trickster god, or that he was completely \\"amoral\\" or \\"indifferent\\". Dishonored 2 intended to detail more of his backstory, with Smith describing him as someone who \\"suffered great abuse\\" before becoming the Outsider and now \\"struggles to maintain some sort of human consciousness\\". Ricardo Bare, lead technical designer of the first Dishonored, acknowledged the Outsider had done things that reminded people of trickster gods, but preferred to related him to the Jungian shadow self. He commented that the Outsider had qualities \\"which represent the unconscious, mystery, secret or repressed desires, creativity, etc.\\" Elsewhere, Smith has called the Outsider an \\"observer character\\". Arkane had tried to make the character come across as sarcastic, though found difficulties where players would misread the character and take his lines as sincere endorsements. Hazel Monforton, writing for PC Gamer, used the Outsider's sacrifice to compare him to the ancient Greek social ritual, the pharmakos. For her comments on the character, Monforton was brought to work on Death of the Outsider. GamesRadar's Alex Avard considered the ending of Death of the Outsider to \\"shatter all of our preconceived notions\\" by revealing him to be an \\"incarcerated victim\\" rather than a \\"machiavellian villain\\". On the third game's ending, The A.V. Clubs Matt Gerardi commented: \\"[The Outsider]'s ultimate symbol of the abuse that Dishonoreds many monstrous characters perform and a reminder that [...] humanity's inclination to do evil to each other is a far greater threat than some unknowable agent\\". Bit-Techs Joe Martin, meanwhile, compared the Outsider to the design team and Corvo to the player: \\"It could be like giving a handgun to a toddler or a textbook to a genius—and Arkane/The Outsider are merchants of mischief, desperate to find out which.\\" Jim Rossignol of Rock, Paper, Shotgun echoed the comparison, calling Dishonored \\"an elegy to the art required to create it\\". In response to a comparison between the Outsider and the developer, director Harvey Smith did comment that the team \\"joked\\" that the Outsider's responses, though not fourth-wall breaking, were directed at the player themselves. Taylor described the character as \\"in many ways\\" \\"the narrator of this experience\\". Art director Sébastien Mitton called the Outsider a twisted projection of the player, giving this as a reason for the character's \\"androgynous\\" look. Javy Gwaltney, for Game Informer, wrote that the Outsider was \\"an embodiment of what Dishonored is all about: an intersection between our choices and our identity, a celebration of the flexible design of immersive sims themselves, and the responsibility that comes with great power\\". Eurogamer's Andreas Inderwildi felt that inherent in the act of playing the game, the player \\"align[ed]\\" themself with the Outsider and the Void: \\"Its openness, flexibility and emergent design mean that you cannot help but act like the Outsider who sees many paths where others see just one.\\" Reception The character has received criticism. In their reviews of the first game, Kill Screen called the character \\"severely undercharacterized\\" and called Billy Lush \\"half-asleep\\" in the role, and Giant Bomb felt the mystery behind him was never satisfyingly explained. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writers together criticized the character. Jim Rossignol praised the mythology behind him, but called the Outsider himself \\"a bit... teen vampire?\\" They speculated that other Outsider details were being saved for sequels, though Adam Smith felt the Outsider worked well \\"as a suggestion\\"; sentiments agreed by Alec Meer and Rossignol, though they wished the character was more something \\"implied\\" rather than someone the players met. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku contrasted him unfavorably to the Lutece Twins from BioShock Infinite, similar characters in a \\"mysterious stranger\\" role. For his appearance in Dishonored 2, Meer commented that the Outsider was even \\"worse\\", calling him \\"arguably the least convincing element of Dishonored 1\\". In the lead-up to Death of the Outsiders release, Rock, Paper, Shotguns Adam Smith criticized the character and wrote how he would be glad to kill him. Smith called the character \\"condescending and smug\\", and felt that the more fantastical elements of the Dishonored world were \\"a distraction\\" from the rest of the series' \\"grungy reality and messy class conflicts\\". Describing the character as a \\"returning favorite\\", however, Polygons Allegra Frank reported on a divide between fans on the character's recast, quoting comments supportive of the old voice that questioned how well the new take fit with the character. Jeremy Peel of PCGamesN defended Taylor's casting in response to fan complaints that the character sounded too young, with the argument that the Outsider was an \\"adolescent god\\"; Peel wrote that Lush had also not given the character \\"thespian gravity\\" and instead \\"also sounded young—and more than that, human\\". Brenna Hillier described the Outsider as their favourite part of the Dishonored universe, praising the game's ability to show off \\"real ambiguity\\" and the many ways the Outsider could react to the player. Hillier commented on fan depictions of the character. Gwaltney argued that the Outsider was \\"one of gaming's greatest characters\\". In his review for Death of the Outsider, however, Gwaltney criticized the Outsider's \\"habit\\" of popping up throughout Death \\"with frustratingly dull philosophy 101 questions\\".

Campaigning  Welsh Labour Students members are involved in election campaigning in Wales and across the UK, and the organisation mobilises its members to take part in campaigns in marginal seats across the country. In addition to this, for the first time in 2017 Welsh Labour Students ran its own issue-based priority campaign on access to Trans healthcare in Wales in memory of Welsh Labour Students committee member and trans activist Lily Summers. It criticised the current provisions for trans healthcare in Wales and pushed policy through Welsh Labour Conference in February 2017. The motion to Welsh Labour Conference passed unanimously and was adopted by the Executive Committee of Welsh Labour. On 25 August 2017, the Welsh Government announced the creation of a new trans healthcare service in Wales and the establishment of a Gender Identity Clinic in Cardiff, both aims of the motion passed by Welsh Labour Students earlier that year.

Singnificant studies  Professor Rasizade's academic contribution to Sovietology may be divided into 4 general categories: Caspian oil boom, Russia, Azerbaijan and Central Asia. His ideas and conclusions for each of these major studies are summarized in the following theses: 1) Having an insider knowledge of Caspian oil reserves, Rasizade precisely calculated and predicted in his writings the exact end of the second Baku oil boom of 2005-2014, notwithstanding the geopolitical euphoria of the 1990s in Western capitals based on exaggerated estimates by American academia, Azeri government and Caspian oil consortium.A.Rasizade.

Furthermore, Rasizade argues that demise of the USSR was only the first stage in the process of Russian Federation's own breakup or, as he put it bluntly, Russia is doomed to disintegrate as did all multinational empires in history.A.Rasizade.

Instead of direct Western intervention in the region, he recommends support for the local despots who are able to maintain peace in the region and order in their countries by brutally effective methods of the same Islam.A.Rasizade.

Algorithm of decline  The most outstanding work of A.Rasizade, which gained an international acclaim, was the eponymous algorithm of decline theory, described in his 2008 article at the peak of oil prices, when nothing foreshadowed their steep fall and the subsequent onset of global economic crisis with irreversible consequences for oil-exporting nations.A.Rasizade. The end of cheap oil. = Contemporary Review (Oxford), Autumn 2008, volume 290, number 1690, pages 273—284. Prior to that, the effect of rising oil prices, rendered to strengthen the national currencies and affect the economies of rentier states as a result of oil boom, was described only by the \\"Dutch disease\\" theory, first introduced in 1977.The Dutch disease. = The Economist (London), 26.XI.1977, pages 82-83. However, this theory could not foretell the further course of events after a drop in oil prices on the world market: what would have turned out for oil-dependent countries upon the end of their oil booms? And precisely that happened in 2008, when the price of oil collapsed from $147 per barrel in the middle of the year to $32 by its end, i.e. by 75 percent.World oil market chronology from 2003. = Wikipedia article. Exactly at that moment came out of press the aforementioned article, in which Rasizade explained the chain reaction of an unavoidable sequence of events in the process of impoverishment, degradation and decline in living standards of nations whose welfare depends on the export of natural resources, when one change inevitably entails another. Appearance of the article was so timely that the described algorithm, which was unfolding in real time, had been picked up in scholarly literature as a typological model by the name of its author.See, for example: K.M.Morrison. Oil, nontax revenue and the redistributional foundations of regime stability. = International Organization (Cambridge University Press), January 2009, volume 63, number 1, pages 107-138; O.J.Blanchard & J.Galí. The macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks. = International Dimensions of Monetary Policy (University of Chicago Press), Summer 2009, pages 182-203; J.D.Hamilton. Causes and consequences of the oil shock of 2007-2008. = University of California at San Diego, 2009, 69 pages; R.Torvik. Why do some resource-abundant countries succeed while others do not? = Oxford Review of Economic Policy, July 2009, volume 25, issue 2, pages 241–256. Rasizade's algorithm may be described succinctly as the following chain reaction: a decline in oil production or a drop in the price of oil translates into the synchronous fall in the inflow of petrodollars, which results in the collapse of treasury's revenues and expenditures, which leads to devaluation of the local currency, which ensues (in a free market) a tumble in prices of goods, services and real estate in dollar terms, which squeezes the tax base, which entails the redundancy of government bureaucracy, nationwide layoffs and bankruptcies in the private sector, which further squeezes the tax base, which results in cutting wages and social benefits, which causes mass unemployment and impoverishment of the populace, which triggers a growing dissatisfaction of power elite, which brings about a regime change with redistribution of wealth and property. Then the whole cycle repeats itself on a lower level of revenues and living standards until the final slump of this country into its historically legitimate and economically stable place among the Third world nations. This is the final stage of algorithm, after which an industrial development may (or may not, as the experience of backward countries shows) begin in a given state — such a prediction does not lend itself to political or economic calculations and depends on the mentality and traditions of each particular nation. Therefore, after adjusting to new standards of living, these nations can exist in the condition of entropy indefinitely.  Notes and citations   Notable publications  * Alec Rasizade.

Design and development The design of the SAM-13 followed similar principles to that of the Fokker D.XXIII: to build a lightweight twin-engined fighter with benign single-engined flying characteristics. Moskalyev's design could well have been influenced directly by the D.XXIII, which had been exhibited at the 1938 Paris Salon, differing mainly in size. The SAM-13 was built largely from wood, with steel fittings in high stress areas and welded steel-tube engine mounts. It was powered by two Voronezh MV-6 6-cylinder, air- cooled, inverted in-line engines mounted at the front and rear of the fuselage nacelle, driving 2-bladed, variable pitch propellers. The sharply tapered wings supported tail-booms which in turn supported the tailplane, elevators, fin and rudder. The wings also housed the retractable main undercarriage units which retracted inwards. The nose undercarriage was attached to the front engine mounting and retracted rearwards. Armament of the SAM-13 was intended to be 4x ShKAS machine-guns: two in the fuselage top decking firing through the propeller disc, and one at each end of the wing centre-section. Operational history First flown in 1940 by Nikolay D Fikson, the SAM-13 proved difficult to handle, requiring long runs to take off and land, with poor climb performance and low ceiling. After the first flight and subsequent tests, the poor flying qualities of the SAM-13 were being addressed when the Germans invaded during Operation Barbarossa. By Spring 1941 the SAM-13 was undergoing tests at LII, piloted by Mark L Gallai, even being entered for a summer air race. All flying ceased after the German invasion, which prompted destruction of the aircraft.

He is known for having founded ANT Software, and nCipher as well as more recently having been the chief security architect at Juniper Networks and is currently the chief technology officer of the Linux Foundation where he runs the Core Infrastructure Initiative.  Education and early life Van Someren attended King College Choir School in Cambridge, UK before receiving a scholarship to Oakham School in Rutland. He went on to study as an undergraduate in Computer Science at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he subsequently earned a PhD. Van Someren credits his interest in business to his father, who ran a business from their home when he was young. While still at school van Someren took summer jobs with Acorn Computers and acquired an interest in cryptography by reading about public key encryption in Scientific American. Businesses In 1992 Nicko van Someren and his brother Alex van Someren, along with two friends, founded ANT Software to build networking hardware. While with ANT, van Someren wrote the first version of the Fresco web browser which helped the company move from being primarily a hardware company to a software company. ANT went public on the London Alternative Investments Market in March 2005. In February 2013 ANT was acquired by Espial Group. In 1996 van Someren, along with his brother Alex co-founded nCipher to build high speed cryptographic accelerators and hardware security modules. nCipher went public on the London Stock Exchange on October 2000, at the time valuing the company at around £450 million. In October 2008 nCipher was acquired by Thales Group. In 2011 van Someren joined Good Technology as CTO. He remained with Good until its acquisition by BlackBerry Limited in 2015. Accomplishments In 2008 Dr. van Someren was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in the UK. Work in computer security Van Someren has published numerous papers in the field of computer security. In 1998 he co-authored a paper with Adi Shamir introducing the concept of key finding attacks. A statistical key finding attack was used by van Someren to locate the signature verification keys used by Microsoft to validate the signatures on MS-CAPI plug-ins. One of these key was later discovered to be referred to as the NSAKEY by Microsoft, sparking some controversy.

In 2016 he gained critical acclaim as the co-producer for Kyle's hit song iSpy Featuring Lil Yachty. His joint EP, \\"Tidal Graves\\" with frequent collaborator Khary released on July 28, 2017. In 2018, He worked with rising pop artist mastermind Still Woozy to create his new hit song \\"Habit\\", quickly amassing over 49 million streams on Spotify alone.  Early life  Malik Keith was born in Columbus, Ohio. From an early age he took an interest in music after his grandmother would play jazz and blues records throughout his home. At the age of twelve he joined his middle school's percussion music program, leading on into most of his high school experience. This would eventually lead him on his path to become a producer. He later attended Ohio University as a student before choosing to pursue music production full-time as a career.  Musical career  = 2014 - 2015: Emergence On Soundcloud & Colours Ep = Lege first gained prominence in January, 2014 while in his second semester of College at Ohio University. Recording and producing songs out of his college dorm room, he started to slowly gain the attention of other up incomers on the platform Soundcloud such as Oshi, Madbliss, Masego, Brasstracks & Medasin after releasing unique remixes and flips of popular songs. He slowly gained the attention of industry level artists such as Roy Wood$, who would commission him to do an official remix for his song \\"All Of You\\". After continuing to rise, Lege released his first ever project \\"The Colours Ep\\", which gained him recognition from collectives such as Soulection, who would use his music to launch their first show on Beats 1 Radio. = 2016 - Present: Singles Series & Tidal Graves Ep = In 2016, Lege would go on to join the art label As We Arrive. Afterwards he would go on to produce American rapper Khary's first hit song \\"Find Me\\", which after reaching success as an initial release, saw an equally successful remix release featuring Sylvan Lacue via The Fader, and an addition to the official soundtrack for NBA Live 2018. Spanning the whole of 2016 starting in the summer, he released a series of original works which he collectively dubbed the \\"2016 Singles Series\\" which gained him support from fans & blogs such as Huffington Post. In September 2016, he released an official remix for Amine's Hit Song \\"Caroline\\" to popular acclaim. In December 2016, he accumulated a lot of attention from the music industry after co- producing Kyle's hit song iSpy, which arose to Number 4 on the billboard charts, and currently is certified at six times platinum by the RIAA In 2017, he would go on to team up with American hip hop rapper Khary to release their joint Ep project \\"Tidal Graves\\" independently. Tidal Graves was released to major acclaim, and gained the attention of blogs such as XXL, Genius, Okayplayer, 2DopeBoyz, Mass Appeal & more. The project was produced entirely by Lege Kale, with Khary providing vocals for the majority of the project.  Influences  Growing up Lege was exposed to a lot of different sounds and genres, which ranged from the banging Hip Hop or smooth R&B; that his mother would play on car rides to school; to Jazz, Blues & Soul that his Grandmother would play while cooking meals when he was a child. Later on he came to be influenced heavily by even more diverse genres, delving in sounds from Bossa Nova Legends such as Stan Getz & Sergio Mendez, to Rock and even sometimes country artists. During his college years he would go on to discover more electronic artists and was introduced to what would become known as future beats, a newly emerging genre combining key elements of all of these things.

The associated Spring Mansion was built in the 1910s by East Bay developer John Hopkins Spring and designed by architect John Hudson Thomas. It later became the site of a school founded by educator Cora Lenore Williams. It has been a City of Berkeley Landmark since 2000. Location The estate currently occupies 3.25 acres in Berkeley in the Berkeley Hills. Formerly covering 20 acres, it was associated with three separate addresses: 639 Arlington Avenue, 1960 San Antonio Ave., and 1984 San Antonio Ave. The latter address was the carriage house, which was at some point sold off as a separate property. It faces west onto Arlington Avenue and at the time it was built had a sweeping view of San Francisco Bay. History  Designed by John Hudson Thomas, the two-story, 12,000-square-foot Spring Mansion was built in 1912-14. Though modeled after the Achilleion Palace in Corfu that was built by Empress Elisabeth of Austria in the 1890s, it was constructed entirely of steel- reinforced concrete. The Beaux Arts-influenced exterior conceals an eclectic interior with elements drawn from the American Arts and Crafts movement and the Vienna Secession. Balustraded terraces lead down into the grounds, which were originally designed by Mark Daniels and include a fountain and a reflecting pool. The house was built by East Bay developer John Hopkins Spring, best known for being one of the investors behind the Claremont Hotel. Spring didn't live there very long, moving out after his 1915 divorce. At that time, his financial difficulties caused him to sell off parts of the 20-acre property, leaving the mansion with less than 4 acres. In 1917, the property was sold to Cora Lenore Williams, who established a new school in the mansion called the Institute for Creative Development (later expanded into Williams College). The school remained there for five decades before closing in 1966. In 1975 the estate was purchased as a private residence and remained so until 2005, when it passed to a consortium of investors. It has been on the market intermittently since then. In 2000, the John Hopkins Spring Estate was designated a City of Berkeley Landmark. It is listed in the California State Historic Resources Inventory.

It was devised by Harold S. Vanderbilt, who had in 1925 devised the game itself. It was published by him in 1929. It was the first strong club system. An updated version was published in 1964. As of 2017, it has long been obsolete. Overview In the Vanderbilt Club system, an opening bid of 1 is artificial and forcing, and shows a good hand. A response of 1 is an artificial negative. Other bids are \\"regulation bids\\". The system was published by Harold S. Vanderbilt in his 1929 book Contract Bridge. It was the first strong club system. An updated version was published in 1964. Vanderbilt was a very early bridge theorist, because in his 1929 book he explained in detail the reasoning upon which his system was based: \\"In many Contract hands it is essential that an original bidder be assured of a second opportunity to bid\\". 1929 system The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge has called Vanderbilt's 1929 book one which \\"made a major contribution to the technical development of the game\\". =Uncontested auctions= Vanderbilt defines the potential of bridge hands in terms of quick tricks. In 1929, methods of hand evaluation such as Ely Culbertson's \\"honor tricks\\" had not yet been devised. In summary, Vanderbilt Club is: * 1artificial, at least 3 quick tricks :* 1 responseartificial, fewer than 2 quick tricks :* Other responses (including 2)regulation, at least 2 quick tricks * 1regulation, fewer than 3 quick tricks * 1Nat least Ax, Kx, Qx or J9xx in all suits * 2regulation; like 1, but displaced one level higher because 1 is artificial * 2Vanderbilt's examples have a 6- or 7-card suit with 2 high honors and 9-11 HCP * 2NVanderbilt's only example is a balanced hand with 20 HCP and stoppers in all suits * 3AKQJxx and some outside values, or AKQxxxx and few outside values * 3similar to 3, except that the suit need not be solid * 3Nnot recommended * 4long strong non-solid suit, outside values, inviting a raise to game =Contested auctions= Vanderbilt distinguishes between informatory doubles and business doubles, two expressions known from auction bridge.The usual modern expressions are respectively takeout double and penalty double, which have respectively very similar meanings to the two expressions used by Vanderbilt. Doubles should be informatory at the one-level;This definition would include the negative double. at the two-level if neither you nor your partner has previously bid; and perhaps at the three-level, depending on the player's judgment of the score and the bidding. Doubles should be made more freely in contract than in auction bridge, because the potential profit is greater. Vanderbilt does not otherwise discuss bidding in contested auctions. =Slam bidding= Vanderbilt describes three types of invitations to slam: bidding more than is needed to score game; bidding the opponents' suit; and introducing another strain after the partnership has agreed a strain. He also says that some slams should be bid on the first round of bidding, because of the risk that partner might pass any lower bid. =Bluff bidding= The expression psychic bidding is attached to Dorothy Rice Sims, who coined the expression in the 1930s. Vanderbilt described a similar type of maneuver as being known in 1929, but did not advocate it. =Goulashes= A goulash is a variant of bridge in which the cards are not properly shuffled and are dealt several at a time. Vanderbilt gave some advice on how to play this unusual form of the game. 1964 system In its essentials, the 1964 system is the same as the 1929 system. However: hands are evaluated using the modern HCP method; there is an additional artificial bid (2,recommended for experts only); and some later-devised but by then well-established artificial bids are added (Stayman, Gerber, and Blackwood). * 1about 16+, at least 5 offensive playing tricks ** 1 responseartificial, denying a hand which includes AA, KKK, AKQ or KKQQ anywhere, and any suit as good as AKxxxx :* Other responses (including 2)natural, having one of those holdings or better * 12natural, limited by the failure to open 1 * 1N16-18 balanced * 2(for experts only) artificial, FG, asking for specific aces; opener can subsequently ask for specific kings and queens * 2 (and in non-expert use, 2)weak two bids * 2N21-22 balanced * 3solid 7-card suit, inviting 3N * 37 playing tricks, the suit need not be solid * 3N8 or 9 probable tricks, most of them in the minor suits A 1966 edition of the Official Encyclopedia of Bridge named Vanderbilt's 1964 book as one of the \\"mandatory requirements for a modern technical bridge library\\".

The book originated as lecture notes that Jackson prepared for teaching graduate-level electromagnetism first at McGill University and then at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Intended for graduate students, and often known as Jackson for short, it has been a standard reference on its subject since its first publication in 1962. Some biographical details about Jackson in Mehra's review are inconsistent with Jackson's autobiography. See the article Jackson (1999). The book is notorious for the difficulty of its problems, and its tendency to treat non-obvious conclusions as self-evident. A 2006 survey by the American Physical Society (APS) revealed that 76 out of the 80 U.S. physics departments surveyed require all first-year graduate students to complete a course using the third edition of this book.  Overview  Advanced topics treated in the first edition include magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics, the vector form of Kirchhoff's diffraction theory, special relativity, and radiation emitted by moving and colliding charges. Jackson's choice of these topics is aimed at students interested in theoretical physics in general and nuclear and high-energy physics in particular. The necessary mathematical methods include vector calculus, ordinary and partial differential equations, Fourier series, and some special functions (the Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials). In the second edition, some new topics were added, including the Stokes parameters, the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations, and the Sommerfeld-Brillouin problem. The two chapters on special relativity were rewritten entirely, with the basic results of relativistic kinematics being moved to the problems and replaced by a discussion on the electromagnetic Lagrangian. Materials on transition and collision radiation and multipole fields were modified. 117 new problems were added. While the previous two editions use Gaussian units, the third uses SI units, albeit for the first ten chapters only. Jackson wrote that this is in acknowledgement of the fact virtually all undergraduate textbooks on electrodynamics employ SI units and admitted he had \\"betrayed\\" an agreement he had with Edward Purcell that they would support each other in the use of Gaussian units. In the third edition, some materials, such as those on magnetostatics and electromagnetic induction, were rearranged or rewritten, while others, such as discussions of plasma physics, were eliminated altogether. One major addition is the use of numerical techniques. More than 110 new problems were added.

D. Jackson, the book from which most current-generation physicists took their first course.\\" = First edition = L.C. Levitt, who worked at the Boeing Scientific Research Laboratory, commented that the first edition offers a lucid, comprehensive, and self-contained treatment of electromagnetism going from Coulomb's law of electrostatics all the way to self-fields and radiation reaction. However, it does not consider electrodynamics in media with spatial dispersion and radiation scattering in bulk matter. He recommended Electrodynamics of Continuous Media by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz as a supplement.See Course on Theoretical Physics, Volume 8. = Second edition = Reviewer Royce Zia from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute wrote that according to many students and professors, a major problem with the first edition of the book was how mathematically heavy the book was, which distracted students from the essential physics. In the second edition, many issues were addressed, more insightful discussions added and misleading diagrams removed. Extended chapters on the applications of electromagnetism brought students closer to research. = Third edition = Physicist Wayne Saslow from Texas A&M; University observed that some important new applications were added to the text, such as fiber optics and dielectric waveguides, which are crucial in modern communications technology, and synchrotron light sources, responsible for advances in condensed-matter physics, and that fragments of the excised chapter on magnetohydrodynamics and plasma physics were scattered throughout the text. Saslow argued that Jackson's broad background in electrical engineering, nuclear and high-energy physics served him well in writing this book. Ronald Fox, a professor of physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, opined that this book compares well with Classical Electricity and Magnetism by Melba Phillips and Wolfgang Panofsky, and The Classical Theory of Fields by Landau and Lifshitz.See Course of Theoretical Physics, Volume 2. Classical Electrodynamics is much broader and has many more problems for students to solve. Landau and Lifshitz is simply too dense to be used as a textbook for beginning graduate students. However, the problems in Jackson do not pertain to other branches of physics, such as condensed-matter physics and biophysics. For optimal results, one must fill in the steps between equations and solve a lot of practice problems. Suggested readings and references are valuable. The third edition retains the book's reputation for the difficulty of the exercises it contains, and for its tendency to treat non-obvious conclusions as self-evident. Fox stated that Jackson is the most popular text on classical electromagnetism in the post-war era and that the only other graduate book of comparable fame is Classical Mechanics by Herbert Goldstein. However, while Goldstein's text has been facing competition from Vladimir Arnold's Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics, Jackson remained unchallenged (as of 1999). Fox took an advanced course on electrodynamics in 1965 using the first edition of Jackson and taught graduate electrodynamics for the first time in 1978 using the second edition. Jagdish Mehra, a physicist and historian of science, wrote that Jackson's text is not as good as the book of the same name by Julian Schwinger et al. Whereas Jackson treats the subject as a branch of applied mathematics, Schwinger integrates the two, illuminating the properties of the mathematical objects used with physical phenomena. Unlike Jackson, Schwinger employs variational methods and Green's functions extensively. Mehra took issue with the use of SI units in the third edition, which he considered to be more appropriate for engineering than for theoretical physics. More specifically, he argued that electric and magnetic fields should not have different units because they are components of the electromagnetic field strength tensor. Andrew Zangwill, a physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, noted the mixed reviews of Jackson after surveying the literature and reviews on Amazon. He pointed out that Jackson often leaves out the details in going from one equation to the next, which is often quite difficult. He stated that four different instructors at his school had worked on an alternative to Jackson using lecture notes developed in roughly a decade with the goal of strengthening the student's understanding of electrodynamics rather than treating it as a topic of applied mathematics. Thomas Peters from the University of Zürich argued that while Jackson has historically been training students to perform difficult mathematical calculations, a task that is undoubtedly important, there is much more to electrodynamics than this. He wrote that Modern Electrodynamics by Andrew Zangwill offers a \\"stimulating fresh look\\" on this subject. James Russ, an experimental high-energy physicist at the Carnegie Mellon University, was of the opinion that examples are challenging, and the fine points of physics are often left as exercises. He added that Modern Electrodynamics by Andrew Zangwill is a better choice for beginning graduate students, but Jackson offers more comprehensive coverage and remains a fine reference. He recommended having both on the shelf. See also *Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J.

He has been the Chief Justice of Uganda since 20 August 2020. He served as the Acting Chief Justice of Uganda from 22 June 2020 and was a deputy Chief Justice from 30 September 2017. He had been appointed to that position in August 2017, replacing Steven Kavuma, who attained the mandatory retirement age of 70 years on 29 September 2017. Background and education He was born on 18 January 1956 in present-day Agago District. He holds a Bachelor of Laws from Makerere University, and a Diploma in Legal Practice, from the Law Development Centre in Kampala, Uganda's largest city and capital. His Master of Arts in conflict resolution, was obtained from the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom. He also has a certificate in advanced conflict mediation skills, obtained from the Center for Conflict Resolution, in Cape Town, South Africa. Career In 1988, Owiny-Dollo served as legal counsel in the peace talks between the then rebel outfit, Uganda People's Democratic Movement (UPDM), and the government of Uganda. In that capacity, he wrote the peace agreement executed between the government and UPDM, on 3 June 1988, at Pece Stadium, in Gulu. From 1994 until 1996, he was a member of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the 1995 Uganda Constitution. He also served as a member of parliament, representing Agago County in the 6th Parliament (1996–2001). During the talks between the Lord's Resistance Army and the National Resistance Movement government of Uganda, from 2006 until 2008, Owiny-Dollo served as legal counsel to Reik Machar, the Vice President of South Sudan, who mediated the talks. In 2008, he was appointed to the High Court of Uganda, serving in that capacity until 2015. In 2015, Owiny-Dollo, was promoted to the Court of Appeal of Uganda. However, he couldn't immediately take up his appointment because he was hearing a terrorism case in the High Court, in which 13 men were accused of killing 76 people in twin bombings in Kampala in 2010. He disposed of that case in May 2016. In August 2017, the president of Uganda, appointed Owiny-Dollo, as the Deputy Chief Justice and under Ugandan law, the head of Uganda's Court of Appeal and Uganda's Constitutional Court.

Nikolayev is best known for the cannibalism of his victims, and of distributing and selling their flesh to others in disguise of exotic animal meat.  Background  Prior to his murder convictions, Nikolayev had a long criminal history, first being convicted for theft and robbery in 1980. On his own account, the first murder happened \\"accidentally\\" when Nikolayev killed a drinking companion, (who also had a criminal history) during a fist fight. He then carried the victim upstairs to his apartment and attempted to revive him with cold water. When he realized that the man was dead he dismembered his body in the bathtub. Nikolaev has stated via later interview that it was not originally his intent to cannibalize his victims, but rather the idea occurred to him spontaneously while dismembering the first body. He stated that he had originally intended only to bury it. During this first dismemberment Nikolayev removed a portion of flesh from the victim's thigh, which he roasted. Finding the results of this culinary experiment satisfactory, he continued utilizing flesh from his victims as food. Nikolayev distributed the flesh to acquaintances, and even went so far as to sell five kilos (about 10 pounds) at an open market, telling buyers that it was kangaroo meat. He used the money from this venture to buy alcohol. The ruse was at last discovered when some people who ate the product Nikolayev procured as \\"Saiga trimmings\\" became suspicious of the taste and submitted it to a doctor. Upon analysis the meat was found to contain human blood. Vladimir Nikolayev was arrested and confessed shortly thereafter. Investigators searched his apartment, where they found human remains and a heavily blood stained bathtub.  Sentence  In 1997 Vladimir Nikolayev was convicted under articles 105, 152, 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. He was sentenced to death. In 1999, by presidential decree, the death penalty was suspended, being replaced by life imprisonment. He has stated that while he is generally against the idea of the death penalty, he would prefer it for himself, rather than continuing to live in prison for the duration of his life. In 2001 he was transferred to IK-6 Black Dolphin Prison. Vladimir Nikolayev was featured in the National Geographic documentary \\"Russia's Toughest Prisons\\".

Visitors reported ill effects after the appearance of a \\"mist\\", and 233 people were treated at Eastbourne General Hospital, initially with a full chemical decontamination. Witnesses reported stinging and dried-up eyes, regardless of repeated eyewashes. The identity of the gas was unclear, but chlorine was initially blamed. East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service stated that \\"due to the symptoms and situation described\\", the gas was unlikely to be chlorine. Previous chemical emission clouds had drifted across from industrial units in Northern France; however, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) stated that in this incident such a scenario was unlikely due to weather models. The MCA said that one line of investigation was a possible leak from a disturbed shipwreck, with the SS Mira, a 3,700-tonne First World War armed tanker sunk by a German mine on 11 October 1917, suggested as one potential source. Investigators from the MCA also looked at some 180 ships that passed through the area on 27 August 2017. In 2018 BBC Sussex requested police, fire and ambulance logs under a freedom of information request. The National Police Air Service and Ministry of Defence were asked to help but said their aircraft could not fly in the circumstances. Helicopters could not be used to investigate the haze in case the gas was explosive. East Sussex Fire Service used gas detection equipment, but could not detect anything as the cloud had dispersed. Reaction Caroline Lucas, the Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion. called for an urgent inquiry to determine the cause. Defra report A report conducted by Defra into the incident was inconclusive as to the precise source of the release due to the absence of samples to determine the chemicals involved. The report did rule out land-based sources in either England or France but suggested that the cloud most likely originated from a ship or its cargo in the English Channel.

These traditions have had a complex interrelationship, with the English influence most apparent in procedural aspects of the legal system and methods of adjudication, and the Roman-Dutch influence most visible in its substantive private law.Du Bois, F (ed) \\"Wille's Principles of South African Law\\" 9th ed. Cape Town, Juta & Co, 2007. As a general rule, Namibia follows English law in both criminal and civil procedure, company law, constitutional law and the law of evidence; while Roman-Dutch common law is followed in the Namibian contract law, law of delict (tort), law of persons, law of things, family law, etc. With the commencement in 1994 of the interim Constitution, and in 1997 its replacement, the final Constitution, another strand has been added to this weave. Namibian law, especially its civil law and common law elements, also forms the basis of the laws of Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, which were introduced during the process of colonisation. Basutoland (Lesotho) received the law of the Cape Colony in 1884, and Bechuanaland (Botswana) and Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) received it in 1891. Swaziland received the law of the Transvaal Colony in 1904, and South-West Africa (Namibia) received the law of the Cape Province in 1920, after its conquest by South Africa.  Court system in Namibia  The Namibian court system is organised hierarchically, and consists of (from lowest to highest legal authority): Magistrates' Courts; High Courts; a Supreme Court of Appeal, the highest authority in non-Constitutional matters; and a Constitutional Court, which is the highest authority in constitutional matters. The Constitutional Court has final authority to decide whether an issue is Constitutional or not. Certain specialised courts have also been provided for by the legislature, in order to avoid backlog in the main legal administration infrastructure. Among these is the Small Claims Court, which resolves disputes involving small monetary sums. In addition, African indigenous courts, which deal exclusively with indigenous law, also exist. The Constitutional Court is the highest court in the land and deals with all matters, today, this was an alteration made by the state when the question of, 'why is the constitution the highest law in the land but the constitutional court isn't the highest court' thus the evidential change.

The GW was produced by the last minutes of two neutron stars spiralling closer to each other and finally merging, and is the first GW observation which has been confirmed by non-gravitational means. Unlike the five previous GW detections, which were of merging black holes not expected to produce a detectable electromagnetic signal, the aftermath of this merger was also seen by 70 observatories on 7 continents and in space, across the electromagnetic spectrum, marking a significant breakthrough for multi-messenger astronomy. The discovery and subsequent observations of GW 170817 were given the Breakthrough of the Year award for 2017 by the journal Science. The gravitational wave signal, designated GW 170817, had a duration of approximately 100 seconds, and shows the characteristics in intensity and frequency expected of the inspiral of two neutron stars. Analysis of the slight variation in arrival time of the GW at the three detector locations (two LIGO and one Virgo) yielded an approximate angular direction to the source. Independently, a short (~2 seconds' duration) gamma-ray burst, designated GRB 170817A, was detected by the Fermi and INTEGRAL spacecraft beginning 1.7 seconds after the GW merger signal. These detectors have very limited directional sensitivity, but indicated a large area of the sky which overlapped the gravitational wave position. It has been a long-standing hypothesis that short gamma-ray bursts are caused by neutron star mergers. An intense observing campaign then took place to search for the expected emission at optical wavelengths. An astronomical transient designated AT 2017gfo (originally, SSS 17a) was found, 11 hours after the gravitational wave signal, in the galaxy during a search of the region indicated by the GW detection. It was observed by numerous telescopes, from radio to X-ray wavelengths, over the following days and weeks, and was shown to be a fast-moving, rapidly-cooling cloud of neutron-rich material, as expected of debris ejected from a neutron- star merger. In October 2018, astronomers reported that , a gamma-ray burst event detected in 2015, may be analogous to GW 170817\\\\. The similarities between the two events, in terms of gamma ray, optical, and x-ray emissions, as well as to the nature of the associated host galaxies, are considered \\"striking\\", and this remarkable resemblance suggests the two separate and independent events may both be the result of the merger of neutron stars, and both may be a hitherto-unknown class of kilonova transients. Kilonova events, therefore, may be more diverse and common in the universe than previously understood, according to the researchers. In retrospect, GRB 160821B, another gamma-ray burst event is now construed to be another kilonova, by its resemblance of its data to GRB 170817A, part of the multi-messenger now denoted GW170817. Announcement The observations were officially announced on 16 October 2017 at press conferences at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. and at the ESO headquarters in Garching bei München in Germany. Some information was leaked before the official announcement, beginning on 18 August 2017 when astronomer J. Craig Wheeler of the University of Texas at Austin tweeted \\"New LIGO. Source with optical counterpart. Blow your sox off!\\". He later deleted the tweet and apologized for scooping the official announcement protocol. Other people followed up on the rumor, and reported that the public logs of several major telescopes listed priority interruptions in order to observe , a galaxy away in the Hydra constellation. The collaboration had earlier declined to comment on the rumors, not adding to a previous announcement that there were several triggers under analysis. Gravitational wave detection Artist's impression of the collision of two neutron stars. This is a general illustration, not specific to GW170817. (00:23 video.) The gravitational wave signal lasted for approximately 100 seconds starting from a frequency of 24 hertz. It covered approximately 3,000 cycles, increasing in amplitude and frequency to a few hundred hertz in the typical inspiral chirp pattern, ending with the collision received at 12:41:04.4 UTC. It arrived first at the Virgo detector in Italy, then 22 milliseconds later at the LIGO-Livingston detector in Louisiana, USA, and another 3 milliseconds later at the LIGO-Hanford detector in the state of Washington, USA. The signal was detected and analyzed by a comparison with a prediction from general relativity defined from the post-Newtonian expansion. An automatic computer search of the LIGO-Hanford datastream triggered an alert to the LIGO team about 6 minutes after the event. The gamma-ray alert had already been issued at this point (16 seconds post-event), so the timing near- coincidence was automatically flagged. The LIGO/Virgo team issued a preliminary alert (with only the crude gamma-ray position) to astronomers in the follow-up teams at 40 minutes post-event. Sky localisation of the event requires combining data from the three interferometers; this was delayed by two problems. The Virgo data were delayed by a data transmission problem, and the LIGO Livingston data were contaminated by a brief burst of instrumental noise a few seconds prior to event peak, but persisting parallel to the rising transient signal in the lowest frequencies. These required manual analysis and interpolation before the sky location could be announced about 4.5 hours post- event. The three detections localized the source to an area of 31 square degrees in the southern sky at 90% probability. More detailed calculations later refined the localization to within 28 square degrees. In particular, the absence of a clear detection by the Virgo system implied that the source was in one of Virgo's blind spots; this absence of signal in Virgo data contributed to considerably reduce the source containment area. Gamma ray detection Artistic concept: two neutron stars merge The first electromagnetic signal detected was GRB 170817A, a short gamma-ray burst, detected after the merger time and lasting for about 2 seconds. GRB 170817A was discovered by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, with an automatic alert issued just 14 seconds after the GRB detection. After the LIGO/Virgo circular 40 minutes later, manual processing of data from the INTEGRAL gamma-ray telescope also detected the same GRB. The difference in arrival time between Fermi and INTEGRAL helped to improve the sky localization. This GRB was relatively faint given the proximity of the host galaxy , possibly due to its jets not being pointed directly toward Earth, but rather at an angle of about 30 degrees to the side. Electromagnetic follow-up Hubble picture of NGC 4993 with inset showing GRB 170817A over 6 days. Credit: NASA and ESA Optical lightcurves The change in optical and near-infrared spectra A series of alerts to other astronomers were issued, beginning with a report of the gamma-ray detection and single-detector LIGO trigger at 13:21 UTC, and a three-detector sky location at 17:54 UTC. These prompted a massive search by many survey and robotic telescopes. In addition to the expected large size of the search area (about 150 times the area of a full moon), this search was challenging because the search area was near the Sun in the sky and thus visible for at most a few hours after dusk for any given telescope. In total six teams (One-Meter, Two Hemispheres (1M2H), DLT40, VISTA, Master, DECam, Las Cumbres Observatory (Chile) imaged the same new source independently in a 90-minute interval. The first to detect optical light associated with the collision was the 1M2H team running the Swope Supernova Survey, which found it in an image of taken 10 hours and 52 minutes after the GW event by the Swope Telescope operating in the near infrared at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. They were also the first to announce it, naming their detection SSS 17a in a circular issued 1226 post- event. The new source was later given an official International Astronomical Union (IAU) designation of AT 2017gfo. The 1M2H team surveyed all galaxies in the region of space predicted by the gravitational wave observations, and identified a single new transient. By identifying the host galaxy of the merger, it is possible to provide an accurate distance consistent with that based on gravitational waves alone. The detection of the optical and near- infrared source provided a huge improvement in localisation, reducing the uncertainty from several degrees to 0.0001 degree; this enabled many large ground and space telescopes to follow up the source over the following days and weeks. Within hours after localization, many additional observations were made across the infrared and visible spectrum. Over the following days, the color of the optical source changed from blue to red as the source expanded and cooled. Numerous optical and infrared spectra were observed; early spectra were nearly featureless, but after a few days, broad features emerged indicative of material ejected at roughly 10 percent of light speed. There are multiple strong lines of evidence that AT 2017gfo is indeed the aftermath of GW 170817: The colour evolution and spectra are dramatically different from any known supernova. The distance of NGC 4993 is consistent with that independently estimated from the GW signal. No other transient has been found in the GW sky localisation region. Finally, various archive images pre-event show nothing at the location of AT 2017gfo, ruling out a foreground variable star in the Milky Way. The source was detected in the ultraviolet (but not in X-rays) 15.3 hours after the event by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission. After initial lack of X-ray and radio detections, the source was detected in X-rays 9 days later by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and 16 days later in the radio by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico. More than 70 observatories covering the electromagnetic spectrum observed the source. The radio and X-ray light continued to rise for several months after the merger, and have been represented to be diminishing. In September 2019, astronomers reported obtaining an optical image of GW170817 [putative] afterglow by the Hubble Space Telescope. In March 2020, continued X-ray emission at 5-sigma was observed by the Chandra Observatory 940 days after the merger, demanding further augmentation or refutation of prior models that had previously been supplemented with additional post-hoc interventions. Other detectors No neutrinos consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches by the IceCube and ANTARES neutrino observatories and the Pierre Auger Observatory. A possible explanation for the non-detection of neutrinos is because the event was observed at a large off-axis angle and thus the outflow jet was not directed towards Earth. Astrophysical origin and products The gravitational wave signal indicated that it was produced by the collision of two neutron stars with a total mass of times the mass of the sun (solar masses) If low spins are assumed, consistent with those observed in binary neutron stars that will merge within a Hubble time, the total mass is . The masses of the component stars have greater uncertainty. The larger () has a 90% chance of being between , and the smaller () has a 90% chance of being between . Under the low spin assumption, the ranges are for and for . The chirp mass, a directly observable parameter which may be very roughly equated to the geometric mean of the masses, is measured at . The neutron star merger event is thought to result in a kilonova, characterized by a short gamma-ray burst followed by a longer optical \\"afterglow\\" powered by the radioactive decay of heavy r-process nuclei. Kilonovae are candidates for the production of half the chemical elements heavier than iron in the Universe. A total of 16,000 times the mass of the Earth in heavy elements is believed to have formed, including approximately 10 Earth masses just of the two elements gold and platinum. A hypermassive neutron star was believed to have formed initially, as evidenced by the large amount of ejecta (much of which would have been swallowed by an immediately forming black hole). The lack of evidence for emissions being powered by neutron star spin-down, which would occur for longer-surviving neutron stars, suggest it collapsed into a black hole within milliseconds. Later searches did find evidence of spin-down in the gravitational signal, suggesting a longer-lived neutron star. Scientific importance Artist’s impression of strontium emerging from a neutron star merger. Scientific interest in the event was enormous, with dozens of preliminary papers (and almost 100 preprints) published the day of the announcement, including 8 letters in Science, 6 in Nature, and 32 in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters devoted to the subject. The interest and effort was global: The paper describing the multi-messenger observations is coauthored by almost 4,000 astronomers (about one-third of the worldwide astronomical community) from more than 900 institutions, using more than 70 observatories on all 7 continents and in space. This may not be the first observed event that is due to a neutron star merger; GRB 130603B was the first plausible kilonova suggested based on follow-up observations of short- hard gamma-ray bursts. It is, however, by far the best observation, making this the strongest evidence to date to confirm the hypothesis that some mergers of binary stars are the cause of short gamma-ray bursts. The event also provides a limit on the difference between the speed of light and that of gravity. Assuming the first photons were emitted between zero and ten seconds after peak gravitational wave emission, the difference between the speeds of gravitational and electromagnetic waves, vGW − vEM, is constrained to between −3×10−15 and +7×10−16 times the speed of light, which improves on the previous estimate by about 14 orders of magnitude. In addition, it allowed investigation of the equivalence principle (through Shapiro delay measurement) and Lorentz invariance. The limits of possible violations of Lorentz invariance (values of 'gravity sector coefficients') are reduced by the new observations, by up to ten orders of magnitude. GW 170817 also excluded some alternatives to general relativity, including variants of scalar–tensor theory, Hořava–Lifshitz gravity, Dark Matter Emulators and bimetric gravity. Gravitational wave signals such as GW 170817 may be used as a standard siren to provide an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. An initial estimate of the constant derived from the observation is (km/s)/Mpc, broadly consistent with current best estimates. Further studies improved the measurement to (km/s)/Mpc. Together with the observation of future events of this kind the uncertainty is expected to reach two percent within five years and one percent within ten years. Electromagnetic observations helped to support the theory that the mergers of neutron stars contribute to rapid neutron capture r-process nucleosynthesis and are significant sources of r-process elements heavier than iron, including gold and platinum, which was previously attributed exclusively to supernova explosions. In October 2017, Stephen Hawking, in his last broadcast interview, presented the overall scientific importance of GW 170817. In September 2018, astronomers reported related studies about possible mergers of neutron stars (NS) and white dwarfs (WD): including NS-NS, NS-WD, and WD-WD mergers. The first identification of r-process elements in a neutron star merger was obtained during a re-analysis of GW170817 spectra. The spectra provided direct proof of strontium production during a neutron star merger. This also provided a direct proof that neutron stars are made of neutron-rich matter.

In 1977, apostle Boyd K. Packer publicly stated that \\"[w]e've always counseled in the Church for our Mexican members to marry Mexicans, our Japanese members to marry Japanese, our Caucasians to marry Caucasians, our Polynesian members to marry Polynesians. ... The counsel has been wise.\\" Nearly every decade for over a century—beginning with the church's formation in the 1830s until the 1970s—has seen some denunciations of miscegenation, with most of them focusing on black- white marriages. Though interracial marriage is no longer considered a sin, until at least the 1960s, the church penalized white members who married black individuals by prohibiting both spouses from entering temples. Church president Brigham Young even taught on multiple occasions that black-white marriage merited death for the couple and their children. Until the 2000s, the church also discouraged interracial marriages in its official publications. The teachings of church leaders on race and interracial marriage have stemmed from biological and social ideas of the time and have garnered criticism and controversy. The church made an exception to its interracial marriage stance by allowing white LDS men to marry Native American women, because Native Americans were viewed as being descended from the Israelites; however, it did not sanction white LDS women marrying Native American men. In 2013, the LDS Church disavowed previous teachings which stated that interracial marriage is a sin. Utah's legislation on interracial relationships The church's attitude was reflected by past laws in Utah, where its members held a notable amount of political influence. In 1852, the Act in Relation to Service which allowed the enslavement of black people in Utah Territory was passed, and it also banned sexual intercourse between a white person and \\"any of the African race.\\" That same day the Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners which allowed white Utah residents to enslave Native Americans was passed, however, it did not contain any provisions on sexual intercourse. In 1888, the government of Utah Territory, whose population was about 80% Mormon in 1880, passed an anti-miscegenation law. The law prohibited marriages between a \\"negro\\" and a \\"mongolian\\" (i.e. Asian person) and a \\"white person\\". In 1890, black individuals made up less than 0.3% of Utah's population of 210,000 people, Chinese individuals made up less than 0.4%, and Native Americans made up 1.6%. In 1939, the two-thirds-Mormon majority majority in the Utah State Legislature expanded the law so it would prohibit a white person from marrying a \\"Mongolian, a member of the malay race or a mulatto, quadroon, or octoroon.\\" However, unlike laws which existed in other states, Utah's law did not prohibit marriages between white people and Native American people. The laws which banned interracial marriages remained in place until they were repealed by the Utah State Legislature in 1963. Interracial marriages with Native Americans Mormons considered Native Americans to be a higher race than black people, based on their belief that Native Americans were descendants of the Israelites, and they also believed that through intermarriage, the skin color of Native Americans could be restored to a \\"white and delightsome\\" state. On July 17, 1831, church founder Joseph Smith said he received a revelation in which God wanted several early elders of the church to eventually marry Native American women in a polygamous relationship so their posterity may become \\"white, delightsome, and just.\\" Though he believed that Native American peoples were \\"degraded\\", and \\"fallen in every respect, in habits, custom, flesh, spirit, blood, desire\\", Smith's successor Brigham Young also allowed Mormon men to marry Native American women as part of a process that would make their people white and delightsome and restore them to their \\"pristine beauty\\" within a few generations, However, a Native American man was prohibited from marrying a white woman in Mormon communities. Young performed the first recorded sealing ceremony between a \\"Lamanite\\" and a white member in October 1845 when an Oneida man Lewis Dana and Mary Gont were sealed in the Nauvoo Temple. There is evidence that Young may have married his Bannock servant Sally (who later married Ute chief Kanosh). Relevant sections quoted at mormonmatters.org. By 1870 only about 30 Mormon men had Native American wives, and few further interracial marriages with Native Americans occurred. Later Mormons believed that Native American skins would be lightened through some other method. Under the presidency of Spencer W. Kimball, the church began discouraging interracial marriages with Native Americans. In canonized scripture =The Book of Mormon= In The Book of Mormon one group of lighter-skinned people was commanded by God not to intermarry with a darker- skinned group. In the Book of Mormon, the Lord cursed the Lamanites and their skin (Jacob 3:5) in a form of a mark of blackness so that the Nephites would not find the Lamanites \\"enticing\\", (2 Nephi 5:21) \\"that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions\\" (Alma 3:8) and so that the Nephites and the Lamanites would be a separate people (Alma 3:14). If someone intermarried and had children with the Lamanites, the Lord also marked and cursed them (Alma 3:15) and cursed their descendants (2 Nephi 5:23 and Alma 3:9). Hugh Nibley, a prominent Mormon apologist, argues that the curse could be thought of as a culture with traditions that were inconsistent with God's commandments. He argues the curse did not spread through intermarriage alone, but that the Nephites had to participate in the Lamanite culture. He argues that Lord put the mark on the Lamanites to prevent the spread of Lamanite culture among the Nephites. However, the Book of Mormon Seminary Teacher Manual, which is currently used to teach seminary students about the Book of Mormon, quotes apostle Joseph Fielding Smith as stating that the skin color was changed to \\"keep the two peoples from mixing\\". =The Pearl of Great Price= In the Book of Abraham in the Pearl of Great Price, the name of Ham's wife is Egyptus, which is given the meaning of forbidden. It teaches that their grandson, Pharaoh, was a descendant of the Canaanites (Abraham 1:22), a race of people who had been cursed with black skin for committing genocide against \\"the people of Shum\\". (Moses 7:8). W. W. Phelps, an early church leader, taught that Ham himself was cursed because he had married a black wife. In The Way to Perfection, apostle Joseph Fielding Smith quoted B. H. Roberts in pointing out that Egyptus means forbidden, and suggests that might be because she was \\"of a race with which those who held the priesthood were forbidden to intermarry.\\" The Old Testament Student Manual, which is the manual currently used to study the Old Testament in church Institutes of Religion, teaches that Ham's sons were denied the priesthood because he had married Egyptus. =The Bible= In Genesis 28:1, Isaac commands Jacob not to marry the Canaanites. The Old Testament Seminary Teacher Manual, which is the manual currently used to teach the Old Testament to seminary students, teaches that it is because \\"a daughter of Canaan would not be worthy to join Jacob in entering into a marriage covenant with the Lord.\\" In Deuteronomy 7, the Israelites were commanded not to marry the Canaanites. In 1954, apostle Mark E. Petersen used this as an example of why the church did not allow interracial marriages. In Judges 14, Samson marries a Philistine woman. The Old Testament Seminary Teacher Manual teaches that marrying a Philistine was against the will of God. 19th-century teachings on black–white marriages =Joseph Smith= Joseph Smith expressed opposition to white-black marriages, but endorsed polygamous marriage between white Mormon men and Native American women. In January 1843 church founder Joseph Smith wrote, \\"Had I [anything] to do with the Negro I would confine them by strict [l]aw to their own species,\\" in reference to interracial marriage. A year later as mayor of Nauvoo, Illinois, he held a trial and fined two black men the modern equivalent of thousands of dollars for trying to marry white women. However, a decade earlier hundreds of non-Mormon citizens of Jackson County, Missouri, stated that the Mormons were inviting black people to live among them, thus, creating the risk of interracial marriage, citing this as one of the reasons for requesting the removal of the Mormon people from the state. The apostle Parley P. Pratt denied this invitation had taken place, however. There are other records of Smith's teaching on interracial marriage. For example, in 1897 First Presidency member George Q. Cannon stated in his journal that Joseph Smith had taught a later president of the church, John Taylor, that a white man married to a woman with black ancestry could not receive the priesthood and they both would be killed along with any of their children if the penalty of the law were executed. See also 'Council Minutes, 16 Dec. 1897,' in George A. Smith Family Papers, MS 36, Box 78, Fd. 7, Special Collections and Archives, University of Utah, J. Willard Marriott Library, Salt Lake City, Utah Three years later Cannon also stated that Smith had taught Taylor the doctrine that any male child born with any black heritage from one or more parents could not receive the priesthood as he was \\"tainted with Negro blood.\\" See also 18 Aug 1900 Council minutes in the Adam S. Bennion papers, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. In 1908, church president Joseph F. Smith stated that the church founder had declared that the priesthood ordination was void for Elijah Abel who only had one black great-grandparent (Abel was referred to as an octoroon man at the time for his one-eighth black heritage) from a mixed-race marriage long ago. Abel's petitions for temple ordinances were also denied by the next two church presidents Brigham Young and John Taylor because of his mixed heritage. =Brigham Young= On at least three occasions (1847, 1852, and 1865) Smith's successor Brigham Young publicly taught that the punishment for black–white interracial marriages was death, and the killing of a black-white interracial couple and their children as part of a blood atonement would be a blessing to them. He further stated his belief by stating that interracial children should remain childless \\"like a mule\\". Young taught that the moment the church consents to white members having children with black individuals the church would go to destruction, and that, \\"Any man having one drop of the seed of Cane in him cannot hold the priesthood.\\" Young also taught that people who had children with a black person would be cursed to the priesthood. Similar to honor killings as well as a form of human sacrifice, blood atonement is the belief that Jesus' atonement for humanity's sins does not apply to some sins, such as miscegenation, because they are so heinous. To atone for these sins, their perpetrators should be killed in a way that allows their blood to be shed upon the ground as a sacrificial offering. This doctrine was most widely taught during the Mormon Reformation. Examples of how Young applied his teaching of it with regard to interracial relationships are as follows: Brigham Young publicly taught several times that the punishment for black and white interracial marriages was death. * 1847 — Young heard of a Mormon family composed of a black man Enoch Lovejoy Lewis (son of ordained priesthood holder Kwaku Walker Lewis), a white woman Mary Matilda Webster, and their interracial child living in Massachusetts and responded that if the family wasn't living so close to non-Mormons \\"they would all have to be killed\\" since the law is that black and white seed should not be \\"amalgamated\\". * 1852 — As territory governor, Young stated before the territory legislature that if a white man had children with a black woman, he should request to have his head chopped off. He continued saying that if someone were to kill the man, woman and any children of such a union, that it would be a blessing to them and \\"it would do a great deal towards atoning for the sin\\". * 1865 — In a speech in the Salt Lake Tabernacle Young repeated the teaching of death as punishment for black and white individuals producing interracial offspring, stating that this penalty would always be in place. In regards to the 1865 statement, the LDS apologist organization FairMormon argues that \\"Brigham Young's comments were a condemnation of abuse and rape of helpless black women, and not an overtly racist statement condemning interracial marriage.\\" Interracial marriages of William McCary In 1847, former slave and Mormon convert William McCary drew the ire of Brigham Young and others in Nauvoo for his marriage to the white Mormon Lucy Stanton, and his later alleged mixed-race polygamous sealings to other white women without authorization. McCary claimed Native American heritage in order to marry Stanton and avoid the greater stigma that the few black people in Nauvoo faced. The most common interpretation of the interracial events around McCary and his excommunication is that they contributed to or precipitated the subsequent ban of black members from temple ordinances and priesthood authority. McCary elicited the first recorded general authority statement connecting race and the priesthood when the apostle Parley Pratt referred to him as the \\"black man who has got the blood of Ham in him which linege [sic] was cursed as regards the priesthood.\\" Lynching of Thomas Coleman In 1866, Thomas Coleman, a black member of the LDS Church, was murdered in Salt Lake City after it was discovered that he was courting a white woman. His throat was slit so deeply from ear to ear that he was nearly decapitated, and his right breast was slit open, similar to the penalties illustrated in the temple endowment and taught by Brigham Young. He was castrated and a note warning black men to stay away from white women was pinned to his chest. Historian D. Michael Quinn states that this murder was a fulfillment of Young's 1852 teaching that the penalty for miscegenation was decapitation. FairMormon argues that Coleman's death may have been unrelated to Young's teachings or temple penalties, since Coleman was not an endowed member. =Under Wilford Woodruff= In the late 1800s at least two white members were denied church ordinances after they had married a black person. In 1895, a white woman was denied a temple sealing to her white husband because she had previously married a black man, even though she had divorced him. First Presidency member George Q. Cannon argued that allowing her access to the temple would not be fair to her two daughters, whom she'd had with her former husband. Another white man was denied the priesthood in 1897 because he had married a black woman, though, then senior apostle Lorenzo Snow stated that the man would be eligible if he divorced his wife and married a white woman. Additionally, Cannon recorded in his journal having stated in 1881 that when it came to the important question of interracial marriage, Mormons believed against \\"intermarriage with inferior races, particularly the negro.\\" 1900–1950 teachings =George Q. Cannon= In 1900, George Q. Cannon, first counselor in the First Presidency under Lorenzo Snow, repeated Brigham Young's teachings that if a man who had the priesthood married a black woman, then according to the law of the Lord, the man and any offspring should be killed so that the seed of Cain did not receive the priesthood. =Rudger Clawson= In 1903 the apostle Rudger Clawson recorded that the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency decided that a young male member who had requested to marry his fiance in the temple was \\"tainted with negro blood\\" through one black great-grandparent and, thus, could not marry in the temple. A few days after the decision he stated in a stake conference that the white members should be glad to be \\"wellborn\\" so they can have the blessings of the temple and referenced the young man who was denied a temple marriage as he was one-eighth black or \\"tainted with the blood of Cain\\". Clawson later lamented in a meeting that the man's white father of \\"pure parentage\\" had brought a curse upon his posterity by marrying a woman with one black grandparent. =B. H. Roberts= Some other early-20th-century teachings on the subject include the highly influential 1907 Deseret News five-volume book series The Seventy's Course in Theology by church seventy and prominent Mormon theologian B. H. Roberts. In it Roberts dedicates an entire lesson of the first volume to the \\"Negro Race Problem\\", and approvingly quoted a Southern author who stated that a social divide between white and black people should be maintained at all costs as socializing would lead to mixed-race marriages with an inferior race and no disaster would compare to this as it would doom the Caucasian race. It cited multiple biological justifications such as craniology (phrenology) to defend banning black-white \\"commingling\\". Additionally, a 1913 church publication in the church's Young Woman's Journal encouraged young women to maintain white racial purity and health by avoiding \\"race disintegration\\" and \\"race suicide\\". =J. Reuben Clark= The apostle Reuben Clark spoke against mixed-race marriage several times in the 1940s, once calling it a \\"wicked virus.\\" First Presidency member J. Reuben Clark told Young Women general leaders in 1946 that, \\"It is sought today in certain quarters to break down all race prejudice, and at the end of the road ... is intermarriage. ...[D]o not ever let that wicked virus get into your systems that brotherhood either permits or entitles you to mix races which are inconsistent. Biologically, it is wrong; spiritually, it is wrong.\\" The quote was reprinted in the church's official Improvement Era magazine. Three years later as senior vice-president of the church-owned Hotel Utah which then banned black people, Clark stated that the ban was in place to prevent interracial socializing that could hurt church leaders' efforts \\"to preserve the purity of the race that is entitled to hold the priesthood\\" and that the church taught white members to avoid social interaction with black people. =Under George Albert Smith= In 1947, the First Presidency, headed by George Albert Smith, sent a response letter to a California stake president inquiring on the subject stating, \\"Social intercourse between the Whites and the Negroes should certainly not be encouraged because of leading to intermarriage, which the Lord has forbidden. ... [T]rying to break down social barriers between the Whites and the Blacks is [a move] that should not be encouraged because inevitably it means the mixing of the races if carried to its logical conclusion.\\" Two months later in a letter to another member Utah State sociology professor Lowry Nelson, the First Presidency stated that marriage between a white person and a black person is \\"most repugnant\\" and \\"does not have the sanction of the Church and is contrary to church doctrine\\". 1950–1978 teachings =Under David O. McKay= The latter half of the 20th century saw many changes in American legal and social views of interracial marriage, and many changes in top church leaders' teachings on the topic. For instance, church apostle Mark E. Petersen said in a 1954 address that church doctrine barred black people and white people from marrying each other. The speech was circulated among BYU religion faculty, much to the embarrassment of fellow LDS scholars, and over twenty years later Petersen denied knowing if the copies of his speech being passed around were authentic or not, apparently out of embarrassment.Petersen, Mark E.Race Problems — As They Affect The Church, Convention of Teachers of Religion on the College Level, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, August 27, 1954 McConkie's popular Mormon Doctrine was in print for over 50 years and taught non-black Mormons not to marry black people. In 1958, church apostle Bruce R. McConkie published Mormon Doctrine, in which he stated that \\"the whole negro race have been cursed with a black skin, the mark of Cain, so they can be identified as a caste apart, a people with whom the other descendants of Adam should not intermarry.\\" The quote remained, despite many other revisions, until the church's Deseret Book ceased printing the book in 2010. The apostle Delbert L. Stapley wrote in a 1964 letter to George W. Romney that black people should not be entitled to \\"inter-marriage privileges with the Whites.\\" In 1960 at the church-run flagship school Brigham Young University leaders were \\"very much concerned\\" when a male black student received a large number of votes for student vice president, and, subsequently, apostle Harold Lee told BYU's president Ernest Wilkinson he would hold him responsible if one of his granddaughters ever went to \\"BYU and bec[a]me engaged to a colored boy\\". A few months later in February 1961 the BYU Board of Trustees decided to officially encourage black students to attend other universities for the first time. By 1965 administrators were sending a rejection letter to black applicants which cited BYU's discouragement of interracial courtship and marriage as the motive behind the decision, and by 1968 there was only one black American student on campus. In 1966, a white woman who had received her endowment was banned by local leaders from returning to the temple and was told her endowment was invalid because she had since married a black man. Church president David O. McKay upheld the ban on her going to the temple, but ruled that her endowment was still valid. =Spencer W. Kimball= Kimball gave several addresses in the 50s, 60s, and 70s discouraging interracial marriage. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball gave several speeches addressing the subject. In a June 1958 address at Brigham Young University, he stated that \\"[w]hen I said you must teach your people to overcome their prejudices and accept the Indians, I did not mean that you would encourage intermarriage ... we must discourage intermarriage ... it is not expedient.\\" He clarified, however, that interracial marriage was not considered a sin. In a January 1959 address Kimball taught that church leaders were unanimous in teachings that Caucasians should marry Caucasians, stating that interracial marriage was selfish because the background differences could pose challenges to the marriage and children. He also told BYU students in 1965 that \\"the brethren feel that it is not the wisest thing to cross racial lines in dating and marrying\\", something he repeated to them as church president over a decade later in 1976. Teachings from 1978–present Church publications have also contained statements discouraging interracial marriage. In the same June 1978 issue announcing that black members were now eligible for temple ordinances, missionary service, and priesthood ordination, the official newspaper of the LDS Church also printed an article entitled \\"Interracial marriage discouraged\\". The same day, a church spokesman stated \\"interracial marriages generally have been discouraged in the past, ... that remains our position\\" and that \\"the Church does not prohibit ... interracial marriages but it does discourage them.\\" In 2003, author Jon Krakauer stated in his Under the Banner of Heaven that \\"official LDS policy has continued to strongly admonish white saints not to marry blacks\\". In response, the church's public affairs released a statement from BYU Dean of Religious Education Robert L. Millet that \\"[t]here is, in fact, no mention whatsoever in [the church] handbook concerning interracial marriages. In addition, having served as a Church leader for almost 30 years, I can also certify that I have never received official verbal instructions condemning marriages between black and white members.\\"Robert L. Millet, \\"Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven\\", June 27, 2003. Though, denying any condemnation of interracial marriage, there was no comment on whether it was still discouraged. The most recent statement came in 2008 when spokesperson Mark Tuttle stated that the church has no policy against interracial marriage. The discouragement of marriage between those of different ethnicities by church leaders continued being taught to youth during Sunday meetings until 2013, when the use of the 1996 version of the church Sunday meeting manual for adolescent boys was discontinued. The manual had used a 1976 quote from past church president Kimball that said, \\"We recommend that people marry those who are of the same racial background generally\\". The quote is still in use, however, in the 2003 institute Eternal Marriage Student Manual. Additionally, a footnote to a 1995 general conference talk by the apostle Russell M. Nelson notes that loving without racial discrimination is a general commandment, but not one to apply to specific marriage partner criteria since it states that being united in ethnic background increases the probability of a successful marriage. In 2013, the LDS Church published an essay entitled \\"Race and the Priesthood\\" on its official website. The essay disavowed teachings in the past that interracial marriage was a sin, indicating that it was influenced by the racism of the era. Notable LDS members in interracial marriages * Gerrit W.

Fire ants are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as one of the world's most invasive species. Fire ants were first detected in Australia in Queensland in 2001. The Australian government has listed Fire ants as a Key Threatening Process in recognition of the ant’s potential to severely impact on Australia’s biodiversity.  Appearance  Fire ants have a copper brown head and body with a darker abdomen. The worker ants are blackish to reddish and vary in size from 2-6 mm.  Distribution  There have been seven separate incursions of fire ants in Australia - six in Queensland and one in New South Wales (NSW). In Queensland, the first two incursions were discovered in 2001 - one in suburban Brisbane and the other at the Port of Brisbane. The pathway of entry is unknown but the ant was probably accidentally introduced in a shipping container from southern USA, where the ant is well established. The third and fourth incursions were in Yarwun, Central Queensland in 2006 and 2013. The fifth incursion to Queensland was found at Brisbane Airport in 2015, and the sixth at Port of Brisbane in 2016. The NSW incursion was discovered in 2014 in Port Botany. According to the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Port of Brisbane, Yarwun and Port Botany incursions have been eradicated. However, the initial Brisbane infestation has spread to around 300,000 hectares of south-east Queensland, and experts warn that the ant could soon spread to adjacent areas of NSW. Nevertheless, according to an Independent Review of the National Red Imported Fire Ant Eradication Program, it is still considered technically feasible to eradicate red fire ants from south-east Queensland. Impacts Fire ants are a serious problem because they can cause major environmental, social and economic damage. =Environmental= Fire ants have the potential to invade most of the coastal areas of Australia, and large areas of Australia’s tropical north, including world heritage areas and national parks. Fire ants are very aggressive and feed voraciously on ground dwelling animals, such as insects, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals. As a result, they could displace or eliminate some of Australia’s native animals, including endangered birds such as the southern cassowary and Gouldian finch,Australian Department of the Environment and Energy. Species Profile and Threats Database. Listed Key Threatening Processes. http://www.environment.gov.au. and threatened turtles such as the hawksbill turtle and the green turtle. Fire ants are also a threat to native plants because they eat and damage seeds and seedlings, as well as some of the insects and animals that pollinate native plants. These impacts can cause major disruptions to ecosystems over time. =Social= Fire ants are a serious threat to human health because of their sting which causes a painful, burning sensation. They swarm to attack and sting repeatedly. Stings may be lethal if a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs and experts predict that fire ants could be responsible for up to 3,000 anaphylactic reactions in Australia each year if they spread. There is also a risk of secondary infection if the blisters or pustules that result from the stings are broken.Solley G; Vanderwoude C; Kinght G. 2002. Anaphalaxis due to red imported fire ant sting. The Medical Journal of Australia. 176(11): 521-523 . Fire ants could also seriously disrupt Australia’s outdoor lifestyle, as has been the case in the USA where fire ants have been responsible for 85 deaths. Everyday activities, such as barbecues, picnics and sporting events may no longer be possible in highly infested areas. Pets and domestic animals can also be stung and injured, and may have allergic reactions or be blinded by exposure to venom. =Economic= Modelling by the Queensland government shows that fire ants have the potential to cost the state an estimated $45 billion Australian dollars in south-east Queensland alone.Antony G, Scanlan J, Francis A, Kloessing K, Nguyen Y. 2009. Revised benefits and costs of eradicating the red fire ant, Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Brisbane. Costs include impacts on agriculture, machinery and infrastructure. According to the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, fire ants kill farm animals and crops, with newborn animals being particularly vulnerable. Fire ants sting in and around the eyes, mouth and nose which can cause blindness, swelling and suffocation. Fire ants also invade the food and water supplies of animals and deter them from feeding and drinking, leading to starvation and dehydration. Fire ants also damage crops by eating seeds and tunnelling through roots and stems. They protect some species of pest insects that produce 'honeydew'. The increased presence of these pests may affect the quality of produce and assist the spread of disease. In the USA, fire ant mounds have destroyed equipment such as irrigation systems and damaged machinery during harvesting operations. The mounds have also been a problem in lawns, sporting fields and golf courses. The ants have also damaged roads, footpaths and expensive electrical equipment, often seriously.Vinson S. 2013. Impact of the invasion of the imported fire ant. Insect Science 20: 439–55. Control costs are also significant, and it is estimated that up to June 2016 federal, state and territory governments have already spent more than $329 million in total attempting to eradicate the ants. In the USA, fire ants have cost the economy an estimated $7 billion American dollars.Lard, CF, Schmidt, J, Morris, B, Estes, L, Ryan, C, Bergquist, D. August 2006. An Economic Impact of Imported Fire Ants in the United States of America. Texas A & M University, College Station, Texas. Biosecurity The Australian government responded rapidly to the detection of fire ants in Brisbane in 2001, with the injection of significant initial funds. However, more recent incursions show that the fire ant continues to breach Australia’s borders, despite a reportedly strong quarantine focus.Magee, B, Parkes J, Adamson D, Hyne N, Langford D, Holtkamp R, Lawson S. 2016.

Pest Report Date: 24 Feb 2010. Web: https://www.ippc.int/countries/australia. For example, it is probable that the 2014 incursion was not detected for two to three years after arrival.Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. 2014.

Experts argue that funding for effective national surveillance and eradication programs are required while a brief window of opportunity to efficiently eradicate the fire ant still exists.Magee, B, Parkes J, Adamson D, Hyne N, Langford D, Holtkamp R, Lawson S. 2016.

Cells grow as tight colonies thanks to their cell-cell junctions, a hallmark of cells of epithelial origin. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells are a model mammalian cell line used in biomedical research. MDCK cells are used for a wide variety of cell biology studies including cell polarity, cell-cell adhesions (termed adherens junctions), collective cell motility, as well as responses to growth factors. It is one of few cell culture models that is suited for 3D cell culture and multicellular rearrangements known as branching morphogenesis.  History  Following the initial isolation in 1958 of epithelial cells from the kidney tubule of an adult Cocker Spaniel dog by S. H. Madin and N. B. Darby, the cell line bearing their name was employed primarily as a model for viral infection of mammalian cells. Indeed, they chose to isolate kidney tubules with precisely this goal in mind, as they had previously succeeded with viral infection of cells derived from kidney tubules from other mammals.Karl Matlin, PhD, personal communication Thus the initial goal in isolating and culturing cells from this tissue was not to generate a new model system for epithelial cell biology. It was not until 1970 that the laboratory of Zbynek Brada published work describing MDCK cells as a representative cell line bearing hallmarks of kidney tubule epithelial cells. They based this conclusion on the fluid transport activities of monolayers formed of MDCK cells, the presence of microvilli on their apical (upper) surface, and their ability to self- organize, when grown in 3D, into hollow spheres. In their report, the authors speculated that the \\"histotypic expression\\" by which MDCK cells formed structures reminiscent of their tissue of origin might be fruitfully applied to the study of other tissues. The following decades have proved them largely right, although the repertoire for studying the organization and behavior of cells within tissues has vastly expanded. Through the 1970s, the MDCK cell line found new use as a model for mammalian epithelial tissue. In 1982 Mina Bissell and colleagues showed that MDCK monolayers responded to the addition of a collagen overlay (dubbed a \\"sandwich culture\\") by proliferating and forming hollow tubules. This hinted for the first time that the cell line would respond to 3D environments by self-organizing into the appropriate 3D structure reminiscent of kidney tubules. In the following years, the culture of MDCK cells embedded fully in collagen was shown to yield hollow spheres, or acini. These were simple epithelial monolayers with a defined interior and exterior. However, the fact that MDCK cells did not form tubules under these conditions remained unexplained until later. Over the same period in the 1980s, biologists studying cell motility had hit upon an interesting and reproducible behavior of cells in culture: the scattering response. Epithelial cells in culture grow normally as tight clusters. However, they could be induced to break cell-cell contacts and become elongated and motile after exposure to a \\"scatter factor\\" that was secreted by mesenchymal cells such as Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. This was best described by Julia Gray's group in 1987. During the same period in the mid 1980s, a monoclonal antibody was reported by the group of Walter Birchmeier to disrupt cell-cell contacts and alter the front-rear polarity of cells in culture. The target of this antibody was later identified as a component of cell-cell junctions, E-cadherin. These disparate observations eventually coalesced into a resilient paradigm for cell motility and cell polarity. Epithelial cells are typically nonmotile, but can become motile by inhibiting cell-cell junctions or by addition of growth factors that induce scattering. Both of these are reversible, and both involve the rupture of cell-cell junctions. In 1991, the response of MDCK acini in 3D culture to the scatter factor was first reported by Lelio Orci and colleagues. They cultured acini of MDCK cells in collagen gels with or without Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, in which media could exchange but the cell types were not in direct contact. This cell culture strategy, termed coculture, induced MDCK acini to undergo branching morphogenesis, in which cells rearrange into a network of interconnected tubules that resembles the development of many tissues. In the same year, the \\"scatter factor\\" was shown to be a previously described protein secreted by fibroblasts, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). This work solved an outstanding mystery of MDCK culture, as the tissue from which these cells were derived is tubular, yet they had previously only developed into spherical acini in 3D culture. Beyond that immediate paradox, a crucial connection was forged between the acute induction of cell motility in 2D culture by the \\"scatter factor\\", and its impact on the spatial organization adopted by tissues in 3D. This connection remains significant as a link between precisely defined mechanisms of cell motility in 2D and complex rearrangements in 3D whose regulation is yet to be understood fully.  Branching morphogenesis  Branching morphogenesis over 2 days by Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells in response to Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). Images were acquired by fluorescence confocal microscopy, showing the structural protein actin, which highlights cell borders. Left: multicellular hollow spheres of cells, termed acini, were grown in 3D culture. Right: after 2 days of treatment with HGF cells have formed multiple branches. In the last 20 years, understanding of MDCK cell biology in 3D culture has been advanced most notably by the laboratory of Keith Mostov. This group has focused on the regulation of cell polarity and its downstream effects on branching morphogenesis. Indeed, the body of work generated by the Mostov group has successfully synthesized decades of knowledge about the spatial segregation of cellular functions, and their molecular markers, into a remarkable model for the generation and homeostasis of cellular polarity in tissues. In 2003 the Mostov group reported the first comprehensive account linking branching morphogenesis with hallmarks of apical-basal polarity. This work established that MDCK cells do not lose contacts with neighbors during the onset of branching morphogenesis, but that canonical markers of cell polarity are transiently lost. One outcome of this shift in polarity is the reorientation of cell division along a newly growing branch of cells, in order to correctly position daughter cells to continue branch extension. Cell motility by which MDCK cells produce and elongate branches was linked with these polarity changes. These findings were integrated into a model for branching morphogenesis focused on the transient rearrangement of cell polarity signaling. This allows normally nonmotile cells to generate protrusions and migrate collectively, followed by redifferentiation and formation of hollow tubules. In support of this model, Mostov and colleagues have identified the effects of HGF on MDCK acini as eliciting a partial transition from epithelial to mesenchymal cell phenotypes. This argument marshals an established signaling program termed the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), by which sessile epithelial cells become motile and break cell-cell contacts. EMT has been proposed as the transcriptional signaling cascade that drives cell scattering, although previously researchers did not conflate the two. Given the distinction that, for acini in 3D, cell-cell junctions do not rupture, it is unclear how to precisely relate the EMT concept with branching morphogenesis. The Mostov group has also investigated the means by which HGF activates cell motility during MDCK branching morphogenesis. Their studies have shown that branching morphogenesis requires the Erk transcription factor, downstream of the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade, a well-defined signal transduction pathway implicated in cell motility and proliferation. The precise cell motility machinery responsible for MDCK branching morphogenesis has not been specified by the Mostov group, beyond the requirement for a signaling protein involved in regulating the small GTPase Rho. Moreover, the Gardel lab has shown that invasive motility of MDCK cells in acini requires Dia1, which regulates cell adhesions to individual collagen fibrils. Meanwhile, other groups have demonstrated the requirement for cell-ECM adhesion proteins or their regulators in MDCK branching morphogenesis. Using a modified protocol for MDCK cell culture and branching morphogenesis, Gierke and Wittman established the requirement for microtubule dynamics in regulating the early steps in branching. They observed deficient cell adhesive coupling to the collagen matrix when microtubules were deregulated. This phenotype indicated the importance of trafficking the appropriate cell adhesion and protrusion proteins to the cell front as branching morphogenesis was initiated. Combined with observations from the Mostov group, this work confirmed that cell polarity is indispensable for MDCK acinar homeostasis as well as migratory behaviors during branching morphogenesis.

The date and location of Hewett's birth is unknown; it has been posited that she was a native of Penicuik. Also unknown is the origin of her unusual forename, though it has been suggested that it was chosen to placate her grandfather, Admiral John Norris, after her mother remarried against his wishes. Her father was Robert Fisher of Sandieford, a member of the Royal Company of Scottish Archers. She married three times. In 1764 she married Captain John Gordon of the 50th Foot of Ireland, who later divorced her for adultery. In 1773 she married Admiral John Storr, acquiring from him a house in Bedford Square and a life interest in a number of Yorkshire estates. Soon after his death she married once again; her third husband was John Hewett, né Thornhaugh, MP and Sheriff of Nottinghamshire. Norris Hewett died at home in Richmond, her age given variously as 45 and 47 in contemporary sources. Thanks to an ambiguity in her will, her heirs took up litigation against one another, settling it in 1791. Two posthumous sales of her art collection were held by Christie's in 1792. Among the works available were pieces by Hubert Robert, John Russell, and Jean Christophe Dietsch, as well as a large number of pieces by her own hand. These were largely copies, after such painters as Angelika Kauffmann, John Reynolds, Guido Reni, William Peters, and Russell. Their medium is unknown, though it is suspected many may have been pastels.

He was known for acting in league with the pirate-friendly Governor of St. Thomas, Adolph Esmit. History Bond had been master of the ship Summer Island out of London. On arriving in St. Thomas he purchased a Dutch ship from Governor Esmit, renaming it Fortune’s Adventure. In 1683 aboard his new 100-man ship he seized the English merchant vessel Gideon; he presented it to Esmit, who protected the pirates, outfitted their ship, and rewarded each of them with an ounce of gold dust. After Bond brought him a Dutch prize in December, Esmit maintained it had been salvaged as a shipwreck in order to deter an English party from reclaiming it. The Dutch vessel was later recovered but had been emptied of its cargo by Esmit. Governor William Stapleton sent the warship HMS Frances under Captain Carlile in August 1683 to bring in Bond, but by that October Bond was still at large: “There is now no pirate abroad but Bond with a small ship and one hundred men. He is expected at St. Thomas where Captain Carlisle is ready for him.” Carlile was unable to capture Bond, and a frustrated Stapleton minced no words when speaking of Esmit’s support of Bond, Jean Hamlin, and other pirates: “My lords, there is no safe trading to or from these parts until that receptacle of thieves and sea-robbers be reduced or that Governor hanged who so openly protects them.” Bond also spent a brief time sailing alongside English buccaneer John Eaton. Around June 1684 Bond captured the formerly French sloop Fox and again brought it to Esmit, who refused the pleas from a Jamaican representative to return it. Bond’s ultimate fate is unknown, though he reportedly sailed as a Spanish Guarda Costa privateer for a time.

She credits him for the desensitization of her claustrophobia. When she and her husband, Mark, return home, they are attacked by clowns and trapped in coffins. Ally is wracked with guilt for killing Pedro. Detective Samuels assures her that she was well within her rights given that Michigan has a stand-your-ground law. Ally is deemed the “lesbian George Zimmerman” by picketers who protest Pedro's death in front of the Butchery. Kai, admiring Ally’s \\"courage\\", comes to her aid and offers his protection. Harrison and Meadow berate Ally for her actions, labeling her as a racist. Ally and Ivy witness a truck dispersing an unknown chemical and the next day dozens of dead birds are sprawled across their lawn. Later, Ally and Ivy's address is posted online in a sex ad inviting strangers to walk in unannounced to their home. Ally instantly believes the Wiltons to be responsible. Oz is gifted a guinea pig, which he names Mr. Guinea, as a so-called peace offering by Harrison and Meadow. Ally believes this to be an attempt to drive a wedge between her and Oz as she does not allow pets. Ally ultimately allows Oz to keep Mr. Guinea after a family dinner at the Butchery. Ally, Ivy, and Oz return home from dinner to discover a red smiley face painted on their door, a mark of the clowns. Inside, they happen upon Mr. Guinea being microwaved and subsequently exploding. Ally confronts and threatens the Wiltons. They deny their involvement. Afterwards, Ally and Ivy discover the Wiltons' home has been branded with a smiley face as well, but Ally neglects to warn them. Next, Ally confronts the operators of the chemical truck and discovers that they wear smiley face masks. Kai unlocks the Wiltons' dark secrets in individual interrogative sessions. Meadow feels neglected and lonely while Harrison secretly wishes she was dead. Ally and Ivy try to convince Detective Samuels that the Wiltons are responsible for their recent troubles. Unbeknownst to them, Samuels is a close friend of the Wiltons. Meanwhile, Oz watches video footage posted online of Ally being seduced by Winter. Ivy sees the footage and decides to leave with Oz. Outside, Harrison claims to the police that he woke up and found himself covered in blood and Meadow missing. He singles out Ally as responsible for Meadow's disappearance.

The plane of vibration, containing both electric vectors (E & D) and both propagation vectors, is sometimes called the \\"plane of polarization\\" by modern authors. Fresnel's \\"plane of polarization\\", traditionally used in optics, is the plane containing the magnetic vectors (B & H) and the wave-normal. Malus's original \\"plane of polarization\\" was the plane containing the magnetic vectors and the ray. (In an isotropic medium, and Malus's plane merges with Fresnel's.) The term plane of polarization refers to the direction of polarization of linearly-polarized light or other electromagnetic radiation. Unfortunately the term is used with two contradictory meanings. As originally defined by Étienne-Louis Malus in 1811,Buchwald, 1989, p.54. the plane of polarization coincided (although this was not known at the time) with the plane containing the direction of propagation and the magnetic vector.Stratton, 1941, p.280; Born & Wolf, 1970, pp.43,681. In modern literature, the term plane of polarization, if it is used at all, is likely to mean the plane containing the direction of propagation and the electric vector, because the electric field has the greater propensity to interact with matter.Born & Wolf, 1970, p.28. For waves in a birefringent (doubly-refractive) crystal, under the old definition, one must also specify whether the direction of propagation means the ray direction or the wave- normal direction, because these directions generally differ and are both perpendicular to the magnetic vector (Fig.1). Malus, as an adherent of the corpuscular theory of light, could only choose the ray direction. But Augustin-Jean Fresnel, in his successful effort to explain double refraction under the wave theory (1822 onward), found it more useful to choose the wave- normal direction, with the result that the supposed vibrations of the medium were then consistently perpendicular to the plane of polarization.Fresnel, 1827, tr. Hobson, p.318. In an isotropic medium such as air, the ray and wave- normal directions are the same, and Fresnel's modification makes no difference. Fresnel also admitted that, had he not felt constrained by the received terminology, it would have been more natural to define the plane of polarization as the plane containing the vibrations and the direction of propagation.Fresnel, 1822, tr. Young, part 7, p.406. That plane, which became known as the plane of vibration, is perpendicular to Fresnel's \\"plane of polarization\\" but identical with the plane that modern writers tend to call by that name! It has been argued that the term plane of polarization, because of its historical ambiguity, should be avoided in original writing. One can easily specify the orientation of a particular field vector; and even the term plane of vibration carries less risk of confusion than plane of polarization.Born & Wolf, 1970, pp.28,43.  Physics of the term  sinusoidal electromagnetic wave in an isotropic medium, propagating in the x direction (the ray direction and wave-normal direction), with the electric field vectors E and D in the y direction, and the magnetic field vectors B and H in the z direction. (The situation in a medium is more complicated; cf. Fig.1.) For electromagnetic (EM) waves in an isotropic medium (that is, a medium whose properties are independent of direction), the electric field vectors (E and D) are in one direction, and the magnetic field vectors (B and H) are in another direction, perpendicular to the first, and the direction of propagation is perpendicular to both the electric and the magnetic vectors. In this case the direction of propagation is both the ray direction and the wave-normal direction (the direction perpendicular to the wavefront). For a linearly- polarized wave (also called a plane-polarized wave), the orientations of the field vectors are fixed (Fig.2). Because innumerable materials are dielectrics or conductors while comparatively few are ferromagnets, the reflection or refraction of EM waves (including light) is more often due to differences in the electric properties of media than to differences in their magnetic properties. That circumstance tends to draw attention to the electric vectors, so that we tend to think of the direction of polarization as the direction of the electric vectors, and the \\"plane of polarization\\" as the plane containing the electric vectors and the direction of propagation. Fig.3:Vertically- polarized parabolic-grid microwave antenna. In this case the stated polarization refers to the alignment of the electric (E) field, hence the alignment of the closely spaced metal ribs in the reflector. Indeed, that is the convention used in the online Encyclopædia Britannica, and in Feynman's lecture on polarization. In the latter case one must infer the convention from the context: Feynman keeps emphasizing the direction of the electric (E) vector and leaves the reader to presume that the \\"plane of polarization\\" contains that vector — and this interpretation indeed fits the examples he gives. The same vector is used to describe the polarization of radio signals and antennas (Fig.3).Stratton, 1941, p.280. If the medium is magnetically isotropic but electrically non-isotopic (like a doubly-refracting crystal), the magnetic vectors B and H are still parallel, and the electric vectors E and D are still perpendicular to both, and the ray direction is still perpendicular to E and the magnetic vectors, and the wave-normal direction is still perpendicular to D and the magnetic vectors; but there is generally a small angle between the electric vectors E and D, hence the same angle between the ray direction and the wave-normal direction (Fig.1).Born & Wolf, 1970, p.668. Hence D, E, the wave-normal direction, and the ray direction are all in the same plane, and it is all the more natural to define that plane as the \\"plane of polarization\\". This \\"natural\\" definition, however, depends on the theory of EM waves developed by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s — whereas the word polarization was coined about 50 years earlier, and the associated mystery dates back even further.  History of the term  = Three candidates = Whether by accident or by design, the plane of polarization has always been defined as the plane containing a field vector and a direction of propagation. In Fig.1, there are three such planes, to which we may assign numbers for ease of reference: :(1) the plane containing both electric vectors and both propagation directions (i.e., the plane normal to the magnetic vectors); :(2a) the plane containing the magnetic vectors and the wave-normal (i.e., the plane normal to D); :(2b) the plane containing the magnetic vectors and the ray (i.e., the plane normal to E). In an isotropic medium, E and D have the same direction,This conclusion does not follow if the medium is optically rotating (see e.g. Darrigol, 2012, pp.253n,257n); however, throughout this article, the existence of a stable plane of polarization requires the absence of optical rotation. so that the ray and wave-normal directions merge, and the planes (2a) and (2b) become one: :(2) the plane containing both magnetic vectors and both propagation directions (i.e., the plane normal to the electric vectors). = Malus's choice = Fig.4:Printed label seen through a doubly-refracting calcite crystal and a modern polarizing filter (rotated to show the different polarizations of the two images). Polarization was discovered — but not named or understood — by Christiaan Huygens, as he investigated the double refraction of \\"Iceland crystal\\" (transparent calcite, now called Iceland spar). The essence of his discovery, published in his Treatise on Light (1690), was as follows. When a ray (meaning a narrow beam of light) passes through two similarly oriented calcite crystals at normal incidence, the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the ordinary refraction in the second, while the extraordinary ray emerging from the first suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second. But when the second crystal is rotated 90° about the incident rays, the roles are interchanged, so that the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second, and vice versa. At intermediate positions of the second crystal, each ray emerging from the first is doubly refracted by the second, giving four rays in total; and as the crystal is rotated from the initial orientation to the perpendicular one, the brightnesses of the rays vary, giving a smooth transition between the extreme cases in which there are only two final rays.Huygens, 1690, tr. Thompson, pp.92–4. Huygens defined a principal section of a calcite crystal as a plane normal to a natural surface and parallel to the axis of the obtuse solid angle.Huygens, 1690, tr. Thompson, pp.55–6. This axis was parallel to the axes of the spheroidal secondary waves by which he (correctly) explained the directions of the extraordinary refraction. Étienne-Louis Malus (1775–1812). The term polarization was coined by Étienne-Louis Malus in 1811. In 1808, in the midst of confirming Huygens' geometric description of double refraction (while disputing his physical explanation), Malus had discovered that when a ray of light is reflected off a non-metallic surface at the appropriate angle, it behaves like one of the two rays emerging from a calcite crystal.Buchwald, 1989, pp.31–43; Darrigol, 2012, pp.191–2.The angle of reflection at which this modification occurs became known as Brewster's angle, after its dependence on the refractive index was determined experimentally by David Brewster in 1815. As this behavior had previously been known only in connection with double refraction, Malus described it in that context. In particular, he defined the plane of polarization of a polarized ray as the plane, containing the ray, in which a principal section of a calcite crystal must lie in order to cause only ordinary refraction.Buchwald, 1989, p.45. This definition was all the more reasonable because it meant that when a ray was polarized by reflection (off an isotopic medium), the plane of polarization was the plane of incidence and reflection — that is, the plane containing the incident ray, the normal to the reflective surface, and the polarized reflected ray. But, as we now know, this plane happens to contain the magnetic vectors of the polarized ray, not the electric vectors.Born & Wolf, 1970, pp.43,681. The plane of the ray and the magnetic vectors is the one numbered (2b) above. The implication that the plane of polarization contains the magnetic vectors is still found in the definition given in the online Merriam-Webster dictionary. Even Julius Adams Stratton, having said that \\"It is customary to define the polarization in terms of E\\", promptly adds: \\"In optics, however, the orientation of the vectors is specified traditionally by the 'plane of polarization,' by which is meant the plane normal to E containing both H and the axis of propagation.\\" That definition is identical with Malus's. = Fresnel's choice = Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788–1827). In 1821, Augustin-Jean Fresnel announced his hypothesis that light waves are exclusively transverse and therefore always polarized in the sense of having a particular transverse orientation, and that what we call unpolarized light is in fact light whose orientation is rapidly and randomly changing.Buchwald, 1989, pp.227–9. Supposing that light waves were analogous to shear waves in elastic solids, and that a higher refractive index corresponded to a higher density of the luminiferous aether, he found that he could account for the partial reflection (including polarization by reflection) at the interface between two transparent isotropic media, provided that the vibrations of the aether were perpendicular to the plane of polarization.Darrigol, 2012, p.212. Thus the polarization, according to the received definition, was \\"in\\" a certain plane if the vibrations were perpendicular to that plane! Fresnel himself found this implication inconvenient; later that year he wrote: ::Adopting this hypothesis, it would have been more natural to have called the plane of polarisation that in which the oscillations are supposed to be made: but I wished to avoid making any change in the received appellations.The actual writing of this treatise (Fresnel, 1822) was apparently completed by mid 1821; see I. Grattan-Guinness, Convolutions in French Mathematics, 1800–1840, Basel: Birkhäuser, 1990, vol.2, p.884. But he soon felt obliged to make a less radical change. In his successful model of double refraction, the displacement of the medium was constrained to be tangential to the wavefront, while the force was allowed to deviate from the displacement and from the wavefront.Aldis, 1879, pp.8–9. Hence, if the vibrations were perpendicular to the plane of polarization, then the plane of polarization contained the wave- normal but not necessarily the ray.Aldis, 1879, pp.9,20. In his \\"Second Memoir\\" on double refraction, Fresnel formally adopted this new definition, acknowledging that it agreed with the old definition in an isotropic medium such as air, but not in a birefringent crystal. The vibrations normal to Malus's plane of polarization are electric, and the electric vibration tangential to the wavefront is D (Fig.1). Thus, in terms of the above numbering, Fresnel changed the \\"plane of polarization\\" from (2b) to (2a). Fresnel's definition remains compatible with the Merriam-Webster definition, which fails to specify the propagation direction. And it remains compatible with Stratton's definition, because that is given in the context of an isotropic medium, in which planes (2a) and (2b) merge into (2). What Fresnel called the \\"more natural\\" choice was a plane containing D and a direction of propagation. In Fig.1, the only plane meeting that specification is the one labeled \\"Plane of vibration\\" and later numbered (1) — that is, the one that modern authors tend to identify with the \\"plane of polarization\\". We might therefore wish that Fresnel had been less deferential to his predecessors. That scenario, however, is less realistic than it may seem, because even after Fresnel's transverse-wave theory was generally accepted, the direction of the vibrations was the subject of continuing debate. = \\"Plane of vibration\\" = The principle that refractive index depended on the density of the aether was essential to Fresnel's aether drag hypothesis.Darrigol, 2012, pp.258–60. But it could not be extended to birefringent crystals — in which at least one refractive index varies with direction — because density is not directional. Hence his explanation of refraction required a directional variation in stiffness of the aether within a birefringent medium, plus a variation in density between media.Whittaker, 1910, pp.127,132–5. James MacCullagh and Franz Ernst Neumann avoided this complication by supposing that a higher refractive index corresponded always to the same density but a greater elastic compliance (lower stiffness). To obtain results that agreed with observations on partial reflection, they had to suppose, contrary to Fresnel, that the vibrations were within the plane of polarization.Powell, 1856, pp.4–5; Whittaker, 1910, p.149. George Gabriel Stokes (1819–1903). The question called for an experimental determination of the direction of vibration, and the challenge was answered by George Gabriel Stokes. He defined the plane of vibration as \\"the plane passing through the ray and the direction of vibration\\" (in agreement with Fig.1). Now suppose that a fine diffraction grating is illuminated at normal incidence. At large angles of diffraction, the grating will appear somewhat edge-on, so that the directions of vibration will be crowded towards the direction parallel to the plane of the grating. If the planes of polarization coincide with the planes of vibration (as MacCullagh and Neumann said), they will be crowded in the same direction; and if the planes of polarization are normal to the planes of vibration (as Fresnel said), the planes of polarization will be crowded in the normal direction. To find the direction of the crowding, one could vary the polarization of the incident light in equal steps, and determine the planes of polarization of the diffracted light in the usual manner. Stokes performed such an experiment in 1849, and it found in favor of Fresnel.Powell, 1856, pp.19–20; Whittaker, 1910, pp.168–9. In 1852, Stokes noted a much simpler experiment that leads to the same conclusion. Sunlight scattered from a patch of blue sky 90° from the sun is found, by the methods of Malus, to be polarized in the plane containing the line of sight and the sun. But it is obvious from the geometry that the vibrations of that light can only be perpendicular to that plane.Whittaker, 1910, pp.169–70. There was, however, a sense in which MacCullagh and Neumann were correct. If we attempt an analogy between shear waves in a non-isotropic elastic solid, and EM waves in a magnetically isotropic but electrically non-isotropic crystal, the density must correspond to the magnetic permeability (both being non-directional), and the compliance must correspond to the electric permittivity (both being directional). The result is that the velocity of the solid corresponds to the H field, so that the mechanical vibrations of the shear wave are in the direction of the magnetic vibrations of the EM wave. But Stokes's experiments were bound to detect the electric vibrations, because those have the greater propensity to interact with matter. In short, the MacCullagh-Neumann vibrations were the ones that had a mechanical analog, but Fresnel's vibrations were the ones that were more likely to be detected in experiments.Concerning the limitations of elastic-electromagnetic analogies, see (e.g.) Born & Wolf, 1970, pp.xxiv–xxv; Darrigol, 2012, pp.227–32. = Modern practice = The electromagnetic theory of light further emphasized the electric vibrations because of their interactions with matter, whereas the old \\"plane of polarization\\" contained the magnetic vectors. Hence the electromagnetic theory would have reinforced the convention that the vibrations were normal to the plane of polarization — provided, of course, that one was familiar with the historical definition of the plane of polarization. But if one was influenced by physical considerations alone, then, as Feynman and the Britannica illustrate, one would pay attention to the electric vectors and assume that the \\"plane\\" of polarization (if one needed such a concept) contained those vectors. However, it is not clear that a \\"plane of polarization\\" is needed at all: knowing what field vectors are involved, one can specify the polarization by specifying the orientation of a particular vector, or, as Born and Wolf suggest, by specifying the \\"plane of vibration\\" of that vector. Hecht also prefers the term plane of vibration (or, more usually, plane-of-vibration), which he defines as the plane of E and the wave-normal, in agreement with Fig.1 above.Hecht, 2017, p.338.  Remaining uses  In an optically chiral medium — that is, one in which the direction of polarization gradually rotates as the wave propagates — the choice of definition of the \\"plane of polarization\\" does not affect the existence or direction (\\"handedness\\") of the rotation. This is one context in which the ambiguity of the term plane of polarization causes no further confusion.Indeed this is the only context in which Hecht (5th Ed., 2017) uses the term plane of polarization (pp.386,392). There is also a context in which the original definition might still suggest itself. In a non-magnetic non- chiral crystal of the biaxial class (in which there is no ordinary refraction, but both refractions violate Snell's law), there are three mutually perpendicular planes for which the speed of light is isotropic within the plane provided that the electric vectors are normal to the plane. This situation naturally draws attention to a plane normal to the vibrations as envisaged by Fresnel, and that plane is indeed the plane of polarization as defined by Fresnel or Malus. In most contexts, however, the concept of a \\"plane of polarization\\" distinct from a plane containing the electric \\"vibrations\\" has arguably become redundant, and has certainly become a source of confusion. In the words of Born & Wolf, \\"it is… better not to use this term.\\"Born & Wolf, 1970, p.43. Notes  References   Bibliography  * W.S.

The following year, the US government acquired a parcel of land for the new center from the estate of Frederick Smyth, a former New Hampshire governor. The land included Smyth Tower, built by Frederick Smyth in 1888 and a designated National Historic Site. Construction began in 1948, and the hospital was officially opened on 2 July 1950. Over the next ten years it treated over 23,000 patients.Sununu, John E. (20 June 2000). \\"50th Birthday of the Manchester, NH Veterans Administration Medical Center\\". Congressional Record, Vol. 146, Part 8, pp. 11585–11586 In the late 1960s, the center joined with Harvard Medical School to provide surgical training and also provided residencies for graduates of Dartmouth Medical School. The aging veteran population in New Hampshire led to the addition of a residential nursing home and an ambulatory care wing in the late 1970s. Over the years several medical research centers were established, including one for post-traumatic stress disorder. The center originally had a 28-bed full-service hospital. Starting in 1999 the center eliminated its inpatient care services, and the center concentrated on urgent and primary care and on ambulatory and outpatient services. Following the closure, patients requiring a full-service hospital were sent to VA hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, and White River Junction, Vermont. The center also established in-patient treatment contracts with non-VA hospitals in New Hampshire such as Concord Hospital.Shea-Porter, Carol (6 January 2009). \\"Introduction of the Veterans Health Equity Act of 2009\\". Congressional Record, Vol. 115, Part 1, p. 218. Around that time administrative problems began to arise at the hospital, similar to problems throughout the VA healthcare system that emerged in 2014. The problems included outdated and sometimes inadequately sterilized surgical instruments; failures to maintain the building, which led to a fly infestation and an inability to use a nuclear camera that was needed to monitor heart and bone health; failure to diagnose and treat a common spine condition called cervical myelopathy which left veterans in severe pain; and one man left paralyzed after suffering two strokes, which could have been prevented.

They also alerted journalists at the Boston Globe, which published a lengthy article on July 15, 2017, outlining the problems which had existed for several years despite the fact that the center had been upgraded to a four-star rating by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016.

It was discovered on 26 March 1789 by William Herschel and is a member of the NGC 4993 Group. NGC 4993 is the site of GW170817, the first astronomical event detected in both electromagnetic and gravitational radiation, the collision of two neutron stars, a discovery given the Breakthrough of the Year award for 2017 by the journal Science. Detecting a gravitational wave event associated with the gamma-ray burst provided direct confirmation that binary neutron star collisions produce short gamma-ray bursts. Physical characteristics NGC 4993 has several concentric shells of stars and large dust lane with diameter of approximately a few kiloparsecs which surrounds the nucleus and is stretched out into an \\"s\\" shape. The dust lane appears to be connected to a small dust ring with a diameter of ~. These features in NGC 4993 may be the result of a recent merger with a gaseous late-type galaxy that occurred about 400 million years ago. However, Palmese et al. suggested that the galaxy involved in the merger was a gas-poor galaxy. =Dark matter content= NGC 4993 has a dark matter halo with an estimated mass of . =Globular clusters= NGC 4993 has an estimated population of 250 globular clusters. The luminosity of NGC 4993 indicates that the globular cluster system surrounding the galaxy may be dominated by metal-poor globular clusters. Supermassive black hole NGC 4993 has a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of roughly 80 to 100 million solar masses (). Galactic nucleus activity The presence of weak O III, NII and SII emission lines in the nucleus of NGC 4993 and the relatively high ratio of [NII]λ6583/Hα suggest that NGC 4993 is a low- luminosity AGN (LLAGN). The activity may have been triggered by gas from the late-type galaxy as it merged with NGC 4993. Neutron star merger observations In August 2017, rumors circulated regarding a short gamma-ray burst designated GRB 170817A, of the type conjectured to be emitted in the collision of two neutron stars. On 16 October 2017, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations announced that they had detected a gravitational wave event, designated GW170817. The gravitational wave signal matched prediction for the merger of two neutron stars, two seconds before the gamma-ray burst. The gravitational wave signal, which had a duration of about 100 seconds, was the first gravitational wave detection of the merger of two neutron stars. An optical transient, (also known as SSS 17a), was detected in NGC 4993 11 hours after the gravitational wave and gamma-ray signals, allowing the location of the merger to be determined. The optical emission is thought to be due to a kilonova. The discovery of AT 2017gfo was the first observation (and first localisation) of an electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave source. GRB 170817A was a gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by NASA's Fermi and ESA's INTEGRAL on 17 August 2017. Although only localized to a large area of the sky, it is believed to correspond to the other two observations, in part due to its arrival time 1.7 seconds after the GW event.

Qahtan is composed of three main tribes: Sanhan, Junb, and Rufaida. Today, members of the tribe and its sub-tribes are based in Yemen (where most of the tribe is congregated), Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The Madh'hiji Qahtan tribe is different from the Qahtanite peoples, because while all members of the Qahtan identify as Qahtanite through their ancestry to Qahtan son of Hud which the tribe is named after, not all Qahtanite tribes (such as Shammar, Sharhan, Harb, etc.) trace their ancestry back to the modern tribe known as Qahtan. Qahtan's sheikhdom was unanimously agreed by Western historians to be in the hands of the 'Al Qarmalah' family of the Jahader clan in the 19th century, and as early as 1961, the paramount sheikh of Qahtan was reported to be 'Khalil ibn Nasir ibn Qarmalah' (a descendant of Hadi ibn Qarmalah). However today, this subject of whether the Al Qarmalah family or the Ibn Dulaim family of the Sharif clan are the rightful sheikhs of Qahtan is highly controversial and has led to physical confrontations in high-profile tribal Qahtan congregations. Regardless, Abdullah ibn Fahad ibn Dulaim, sheikh of the Ibn Dulaim family, is recognized by the Saudi state as the appointed paramount sheikh of Qahtan and its allied tribe of Wadi'a. History =Rule of Al Qarmalah= The Qahtan tribe enjoyed priority rights and control to southern Najd for a period generally agreed to have spanned 90 years, paying suzerainty only to Ibn Saud. Tribes who migrated to Najd during spring or winter to herd their cattle were required to pay taxation in order for them to be allowed to graze their livestock in the Qahtani diyar (territory) in Najd.^ جامعة الملك سعود / قسم التاريخ - كلية الاداب Several historians have described Qahtan as \\"the most powerful\\" tribe or \\"nobody dared to challenge them\\" during this era.Alexei Vassiliev The History of Saudi Arabia The Jahader branch of the Sanhan sub- tribe of Qahtan migrated to southern Najd from their homelands in Asir Region during the late 18th century and early 19th century under the leadership of Athfar al-Amaaj, driving out the Mutair tribe from Najd after refusing to pay taxation to Mutair in exercising their rights to herding camels and cattle in Najd.المصدر : كتاب تاريخ نجد – لابن غنام – صفحة 82 After Qahtan's victory over Mutair, a previously unknown member of the Jahader known as Hadi ibn Qurmula visited Ibn Saud whom he convinced to grant him the sheikhdom of Qahtan. This began the 90 year rule of Al Qurmula over Najd, beginning with Hadi ibn Qurmula and culminating with his son Muhammad ibn Hadi ibn Qurmula.ج.ج لويمر ج 1 ص 499-500. . =Migration of Bani Hajer= Branches The Qahtan tribe is subdivided into three major branches: Sanhan سنحان, Junb جنب and Rufaida رفيدة each major branch is divided into many clans, each clan is divided into various families. رفيدة قحطان ( رفيدة الحكّام ) نسب القبيلة : نسب رفيدة هو رفيدة بن عامر بن عوف بن بكر بن عوف بن رفيدة الأكبر بن ثور بن كلب بن وبرة بن تغلب بن حلون بن عمران بن الحافي ( وتنطق لحاف بدون ياء )بن قضاعة بن مالك بن عمرو بن مرة بن زيد بن مالك بن حمير بن سبأ بن يشجب...') *Sanhan The Sanhan tribe are as follows: ** al-Habab ** al-Jahader ** Al al-Sari ** Al Umar *Junb The Junb tribe are as follows: ** Bani Hajer (al-Hajri) ** Sharif ** Bani Beshr ** al-Zubaidi ** Obaida (al-Obaidi) *Rufaida The Rufaida are as follows: *رفيدة الحكام ** **ال حلامي **ال جحل **ال شواط **ال سواد **ال ميسرد **وقشه **جارمه    * * =Iraq= Most Qahtanite tribes in Iraq (such as Shemmar, Dulaim, Juboor, etc.) do not belong to the Madh'hiji tribe of Qahtan. However, few tribes belonging to the aforementioned Madh'hiji tribe of Qahtan are present in Iraq, a prominent example being the Kobaisat tribal confederation. The Kobaisat (al-Kobaisi) migrated from Tathlith, modern southern Saudi Arabia in the 16th century and settled in Iraq. By the 18th century, many of the Kobaisat migrated to the growing pearl towns of northern Qatar and are a prominent tribe today in that country. The Kobaisat today in Iraq are a large tribal confederation that was also joined by non-Kobaisat tribes such as al-Buhaidar and al-Durai'at, and have formed their own town known as Kobaisa. It must be noted that the Kobaisat are entirely independent from Qahtan and the only aspect linking the two tribes together today is ancestry. Some well known members of the Kobaisat tribe are Iraqi religious scholar Mohammed Alkobaisi and Ahmed al-Kobaisi, the latter whom is most famous for participating in anti-Salafist debate shows. =Kuwait= In Kuwait, Qahtan and its sub-tribe Bani Hajir have formed a well known alliance in National Assembly elections, being a part of the tribal bloc. The Bani Hajir are among the largest tribal blocs to participate in the Kuwait National Assembly elections, consisting of 8150 voters in the 2016 election. =Qatar= Qahtan, specifically the Bani Hajer tribe, has taken a very prominent role in the Qatar peninsula ever since their migration to that country in the 18th century. The Bani Hajers were infamous in the 19th century for their nomadic lifestyle, political and tribal alliances, and piratical activities in the Persian Gulf.دليل الخليج. الجزء الأول. المواد التاريخية والسياسية. In fact, the vast majority of Bani Hajer inhabited the Qatar peninsula until around 1900 when most of the tribe migrated west to modern day Saudi Arabia in Al-Ahsa and Jubail after a dispute with the ruling Qatari Al Thani family. As a result of their loyalty and military service to Al Saud, in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia, the Bani Hajers were awarded settlement rights in an area known today as \\"Jawf Bani Hajer\\".Bedouin Ethnobotany: Plant Concepts and Uses in a Desert Pastoral World page 48 and 49 Branches of Qahtan such as al-Habab (known as al-Ehbabi in Qatar) also have a presence in that country but their fame is not nearly as recognized as that of Bani Hajer. One prominent Hajri personality in Qatar is Mozah Al Mesned, the mother of the current Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who belongs to the Al Muhannada branch of the Bani Hajer. =Bahrain= Bahrain is a Gulf country that houses the tiniest number of Qahtanis compared to other Gulf countries, however, some members of the tribe have taken a relatively prominent role in the country. For example, the head of the Sunni Waqf Endowment Directorate is Rashid al-Hajri, a member of the Bani Hajer. Offshoot Hajri families such Almuhannada also take a public role such as former Member of Parliament Hamad Almuhannadi. =United Arab Emirates= Qahtan takes a noteworthy role in the United Arab Emirates, which however is not as large as Kuwait or Qatar. For example, a member of the Advisory Council to the Government of Sharjah is Abdulqader al-Hajri, a member of Bani Hajer. The Bani Hajer were also historically allied with the al-Manasir tribe, which sometimes may claim descent from Bani Hajer based on their historical alliance.Bedouin Ethnobotany: Plant Concepts and Uses in a Desert Pastoral World Smaller families of Qahtan such as \\"al-Ehbabi\\" are also present in the country.

Early life and career Karić was born in the Belgrade municipality of Obrenovac, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Member of the National Assembly Karić was first elected to the National Assembly of Serbia in the 2012 Serbian parliamentary election. The Greens of Serbia contested this election as part of the Choice for a Better Life coalition led by Boris Tadić's Democratic Party, and Karić received the fifty-second position on its electoral list.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине, 6. мај 2012. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (ИЗБОР ЗА БОЉИ ЖИВОТ- БОРИС ТАДИЋ) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 26 January 2017. The list won sixty- seven mandates, and Karić was duly elected as the sole parliamentary representative of his party. The election was won by the Serbian Progressive Party and its allies, and Karić served in opposition. Karić urged the Serbian government to extend the country's moratorium on nuclear power in late 2012, after the president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts said that the moratorium would be reviewed in three years' time. Karić was quoted as saying on the matter, \\"Japan has perhaps the most advanced technology [in the world], but even this technology could not stand up to the earthquake and the tsunami. Nuclear power plants in Europe go through rigorous tests and most of them would not withstand a serious earthquake.\\"\\"Analysts urge \\"geostrategic balance\\" if Serbia ends moratorium on nuclear energy,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 6 October 2012 (Source: Politika website, Belgrade, in Serbian 4 Oct 12).

In January 1878 he secured a permanent post as a clerk in the Public Works Department, where he was promoted to First Clerk in 1882. In January 1885 he was transferred to the position of Chief records Clerk at the Crown Lands Office being promoted in July 1889 to first class clerk at the Department of Agriculture attaining the post of acting chief clerk there in November 1897. Prior to this he had taken and passed his Civil Service Law examinations and he also served with the Duke of Edinburgh's Own Volunteer Rifles in the Transkei during the 9th Frontier War in February to May 1879 and in Basutoland in September 1880 to March 1881 during the Basuto Gun War. Thompson was appointed to the Cape Colony's Fisheries Board in October 1897. In 1905 he vacated his clerical post to take up the position of the assistant of the Scots zoologist John D.F. Gilchrist, who was the government biologist of the Cape Colony and the honorary curator of marine invertebrates at the South African Museum. Over the next decade he contributed to a number of important publications as Gilchrist's co-author. They had jointly completed a study of the local Klip fishes of the family Blenniidae in 1907. This was based on the large collection of specimens gained mainly by the South African Museum's aquarium at St James, Cape Town. This results of the study were published as \\"The Blenniidae of South Africa\\" 1908 in Part 2 of Volume 6 of the Annals of the South African Museum and two years after that Gilchrist and Thompson jointly presented a paper on \\"The Cape Klipfishes\\" at the annual congress of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science. Also in 1907 Gilchrist and Thompson had commenced compiling a descriptive catalogue of the marine fishes of Natal and this was published as \\"Descriptions of fishes from the Natal coast\\", over four parts, also in the Annals of the South African Museum between 1908 and 1914 and ran to 190 pages. They also published the descriptions in the Annals of the Durban Museum between 1914 and 1917 entitled \\"A catalogue of the sea fishes recorded from Natal\\". In 1916 they also described four new species of South African fishes in the Marine Biological Report (No. 3) compiled by Gilchrist. Gilchrist and Thompson were the first South African zoologists to study the freshwater fish fauna of South Africa and to draw up a comprehensive catalogue. In 1911 they described three new species of freshwater fish in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, and their catalogue, The Freshwater Fishes of South Africa included some 200 engravings, was published in three parts in Volume 11 parts 5-7 of the Annals of the South African Museum between 1913 and 1918. Thompson wrote a book called The sea fisheries of the Cape Colony from Van Riebeeck's days to the eve of the Union which was published in 1913, this included chapters on the whale and seal fisheries, trout and other freshwater fishes, and oysters.

Formed in 2003, RRG's initial mission was to rehabilitate detained members of the regional terrorist group, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). Soon, RRG's focus was expanded to provide counselling and financial support for families of the detainees to prevent further radicalisation. Over the years, RRG has extended its outreach to the wider community in efforts to dispel misinterpretations of Islamic concepts and prevent them from falling under the influence of extremist terrorist ideology. The work of RRG has received domestic and international praise. Among the aspects of RRG's work that were lauded include the counselling and care of families of detainees, and its implementation of rehabilitation in an academic environment where it is willing to study and adapt.  History  The RRG was founded in April 2003 following the arrest and detention of Jemaah Islamiyah members in December 2001 and August 2002. In RRG's early beginnings, several Islamic teachers viewed RRG with suspicion, perceiving it to be merely a tool of the Government. Dr Mohamed Fatris Bakaram, Mufti of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS), said that this was a psychological challenge that the Muslim community has to face, and that preachers and teachers must stand up and develop self-confidence in order to guide the community.  Efforts  = Counselling and outreach efforts = Since its formation, RRG has performed more than 1,500 counselling sessions, which also extend to the family members of detainees. In collaboration with other agencies, RRG conducts workshops and seminars at schools, madrasahs, and mosques. Since its inception, RRG has written and published a series public education material, which include two counselling manuals and information booklets. On 1 June 2016, RRG launched a mobile app. = Welfare of family members = RRG makes it a priority to maintain the social welfare of family members of detainees. The counselling and care of family members ensure that rehabilitation continues at home even after the release of a detainee. Ustazah Kalthom Md Isa, an RRG counsellor, said: \\"We want the family members to be on the same page in terms of religious understanding. They play a key part in rehabilitating the detainees back into life after they are released.\\" = Contemporary challenges = A contemporary focus is now turned to young Muslims and education. In light of terror-related propaganda online, the RRG is also turning its attention to cyberspace.

Family and inheritance John Corbet was born into the wealthy Corbet family, who trace their ancestry to a Roger Corbet, a Norman who accompanied William I in his conquest of England. Corbet's father, also John Corbet, had inherited Sundorne Estate from his brother Andrew, who died unmarried in 1741. John Corbet's mother, Barbara Letitia Mytton, daughter of John Mytton of Halston, was his father's second wife. Corbet had a brother Andrew Corbet, who rose to Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Horse Guards, and a sister Mary Elizabeth Corbet, who married Sir John Kynaston Powell, 1st Baronet. Corbet inherited Sundorne Estate after the death of his father in 1759. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford on 7 January 1770 aged 18. Public life John Corbet led an active public life in Shrewsbury and throughout Shropshire. In 1775 he was Treasurer of the Royal Salop Infirmary, he served as Lieutenant Colonel of the Shropshire Militia and in 1793 he was High Sheriff of Shropshire. Corbet's estate at Sundorne was within several miles of Shrewsbury, which gave him an interest in the constituency. On 17 March 1775, following the death of Lord Clive, he was returned unopposed at a by-election as Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury. There is no record of his having spoken in Parliament and he did not stand again at the 1780 general election. Warwickshire Hunt Corbet and the Warwickshire Foxhounds John Corbet was a keen fox hunter and in 1791 he founded the Warwickshire Hunt, with which he hunted almost the whole county of Warwickshire. Corbet personally covered almost all of the hunt's expenses, requesting only a ₤5 contribution from each member towards earth stopping. He established a Hunt Club at the White Lion Inn, Stratford-upon-Avon, where once a fortnight the club's members would meet for a dinner. During the dinner the first toast was always to \\"the King\\" and the second to \\"the blood of the Trojans\\", Trojan being a favourite hound from which most of the hunt's hounds descended. During the hunting season, the pack was kept at the White Lion, in the summer it returned to Sundorne. In John Corbet's time, the Warwickshire hunt was very well supported by the nobility of Warwickshire. On the first Monday of November of every year, John Peyto-Verney, 14th Baron Willoughby de Broke of Compton Verney would host a dinner for the club's members at the White Lion to mark the beginning of the hunting season. Other staunch supporters of the hunt included Heneage Finch, 4th Earl of Aylesford, Thomas Scott, 2nd Earl of Clonmell and Henry Greville, 3rd Earl of Warwick. Corbet, Sir Robert Leighton and John Kynaston with their horses and hounds. In 1810, John Corbet's health began to fail and following the entreaties of his family, he agreed to give away his prized pack of hounds. In 1811, he sold the pack, at the time consisting of over 70 couples of hounds (140 hounds), for 1,200 guineas to Henry Willoughby, 6th Baron Middleton. With the cheque for the money, Lord Middleton included a note to Corbet in which he stated he saw the transaction as more of a gift than a purchase. John Corbet was extremely popular throughout Warwickshire, particularly with the farmers whose country he hunted over and to whom he was renowned for his generosity. For many years after his death a print of him, mounted on a white horse with hounds at foot, was found in many houses throughout the county. Family and estate Corbet, 1773. John Corbet married twice and had ten children from the two marriages. His first wife was Emma Elizabeth Leighton, daughter of Sir Charlton Leighton, 3rd Baronet, they married in 1774 and she died in 1797. His second wife was Anne Pigott, daughter of the Reverend William Pigott, Rector of Edgmond and Chetwynd, they married in 1800. With his first wife Emma, Corbet had five children: * Emma Elizabeth Corbet, born 1776, who married Sir Richard Puleton, 1st Baronet in 1798. * Louisa Corbet, who died in infancy. * Matilda Corbet, who died in infancy. * John Kynaston Corbet, born 1790, who died aged 15 on 22 April 1806. * Jane Elizabeth Corbet, born 1790. With his second wife Anne, Corbet had another five children: * Andrew William Corbet, born 1801, who succeeded his father to Sundorne Estate in 1817. Andrew married Mary Emma Hill in 1823 and died without children in 1856. * Annabella Corbet, born 1803, who married Sir Theodore Brinckman, 1st Baronet in 1841. Arrabella succeeded her brother Dryden to Sundorne Estate in 1859 and died without children in 1864. * Dryden Robert Corbet, born 1804, who succeeded his brother Andrew to Sundorne Estate in 1856. Dryden died unmarried in August 1859. * Vincent Corbet, born 1806, who died unmarried in 1843. * Kynaston Corbet, born 1808, who died unmarried in May 1859. Upon the death of Annabella, Sundorne Estate passed to her cousin the Reverend John Dryden Pigott, the son of her mother Anne's brother, who subsequently adopted the surname Pigott-Corbet. Death On 19 May 1817 John Corbet died at Mudeford surrounded by his family, having suffered a brain hemorrhage the previous day. His body was returned to Sundorne on 31 May, and on 2 June 1817 he was interned in the family vault in St Mary Magdalene's Church, Battlefield. A gothic monument, designed by Hugh Owen, Archdeacon of Salop, was erected in the east end of the church bearing his arms together with the arms of his two wives, it bears the inscription: An obituary to John Corbet in The Gentleman's Magazine in June 1817 stated of him: > Mr Corbet was a gentleman well known beyond the precincts of his own county, > particularly in Warwickshire, where, at his sole expense, he kept a pack of > fox hounds for nearly 30 years and where, by his liberal and gentlemanly > conduct, he conciliated the respect and esteem of all ranks.

This airport rail link was built to cut travel time from the Jakarta city center to the airport, as roads connecting the Soekarno–Hatta International Airport (SHIA) and Jakarta city center are frequently affected by traffic congestion. At present commuter service is operational between SHIA and Manggarai railway station, while express service is still at planning stage. The Soekarno–Hatta ARS is the second airport rail link in Indonesia connecting passenger between city centre and airport after Kualanamu ARS. Background The idea of developing the airport railway system reportedly came up in the 1990s. However, the project plan was officially solidified only in 2011 with the issuing of a presidential regulation, Keppres No. 83 Year 2011, which assigned PT Angkasa Pura II and PT Kereta Api Indonesia to jointly carry out the project. The project suffered long setbacks due to disputed land requisition issue for construction of the new rail track and also frequent plan changes. The railway was opened between SHIA and BNI City on 26 December 2017 and officially inaugurated on 2 January 2018. Services were extended to Manggarai on 5 September 2019.https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/10/07/passengers-welcome- airport-trains-new-manggarai-stop-for-improving-accessibility.html At first this project was planned to only connect between Manggarai station at South Jakarta and SHIA station at Tangerang. An expansion to connect to Jakarta Kota station at West Jakarta was announced in 2017, but is not operational as of March 2019. The plan is to operate Jakarta Kota services via Kampung Bandan and Duri on existing track. Route There were 24 kilometers of existing train line from Manggarai to Batuceper and 12 kilometers of new track were built from Batuceper to SHIA station. At Duri, the trains reverse direction. At present passengers can board the train from Manggarai, BNI City, Duri, Batuceper and SHIA stations. Two new railway stations, SHIA and BNI City, were newly constructed, while others were renovated to serve airport passengers. Starting 19 June 2018, a limited number of trains were extended to Bekasi Station, serving Bekasi in West Java, a satellite town within Greater Jakarta,. Services to Bekasi were discontinued in September 2019. Stations The boarding stations for Soekarno–Hatta ARS are: * Manggarai * BNI City (Sudirman Baru) * Duri * Batuceper * SHIA When Manggarai station was still under renovation, BNI City station was used as the temporary terminus for the city center. At Manggarai station, there is separate entrance gate for airport train, and the train operates from platforms 9 and 10. Operations and schedule The airport rail link services connect Jakarta city center with Soekarno–Hatta International Airport. The journey takes approximately 46 minutes from BNI City station (previously known as Sudirman Baru station) to station. Each train has the capacity to carry up to 272 passengers and has the capacity to serve about 5,000 passengers with 80 trips a day. However, as of January 2019 ridership has not met expectations, with the service operating at only approximately 30% of capacity. As of March 2019, the airport train operates every 30 minutes in both directions, with services between 4:51 AM and 9:51 PM from BNI City and 6:20 AM to 11:20 PM from SHIA. The trip takes approximately 48 minutes, and there were also three daily round trips to Bekasi.. Ticket price for each journey is IDR70,000 (equivalent to approximately US$5). Although initially the price point for each journey was set at IDR 100,000, government analysis recommended for a lower price point due to concern that that price would have been too expensive for consumers. Passengers can only book train tickets using credit and debit cards, as well as electronic money via Railink app available for smartphones or vending machines at stations. Skytrain Automated People Mover Skytrain shuttle service connects SHIA Railink station with Soekarno-Hatta International Airport Terminals The airport shuttle, Skytrain () is the 3.05 kilometres Automated People Mover System (APMS) serves to connect Soekarno-Hatta Airport Terminals 1, 2, 3 and SHIA railway station free of charge. Skytrain takes 5 minutes from one terminal to another, with 7 minutes needed to get from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. The airport Skytrain shuttle is integrated to SHIA railway station, from where passengers can conveniently travel to–and from–Jakarta city center by train. Skytrain operating schedule is accessible online and through the Indonesia Airport website and smartphone application. Skytrain has been operational since 17 September 2017.  Proposed SHIA–HPIA express airport rail link  An express train service is now under planning stage to connect Soekarno–Hatta International Airport with Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. Completion of this line is expected to be completed at the very earliest in 2019. At first this project was solely planned to be built as an express line between Manggarai Station at South Jakarta and Soekarno–Hatta International Airport via Angke and Pluit, which would be a public–private partnership project. Later the route was extended from Manggarai to Halim Perdanakusuma Airport, which is in East Jakarta. The 33 kilometer project, proposed as Halim-Cawang-Manggarai-Tanah Abang-Sudirman-Pluit Terminal 2 and 3 SHIA stretch route, has been proposed to include a combination of surface- underground-elevated tracks. The express train is projected to take 30 minutes to connect the two main airports that serve the Greater Jakarta area.

It grows in the understory of tropical forests at high altitudes. This species has highly variable traits depending on its geographic location and several subspecies exist as a result.  Taxonomy  Geonoma undata is a neotropical species most closely related to G. lehmannii, G. orbignyana, G. talamancana, and G. trigona. In fact, G. undata is nearly indistinguishable from the species G. lehmannii and G. orbignyana. The epithet name undata comes from the Latin term for \\"wavy\\" or \\"wave-like\\".  Description  Geonoma undata fruiting inflorescence This plant is a medium sized, solitary palm that reaches a maximum height of 9-10 meters and has a trunk 10 cm wide in diameter at maturity. The leaves are approximately 2.5 m long and can be divided or undivided. If leaves are divided, they tend to be irregularly pinnate with the base of pinnate leaflets being diagonal to the stem rachis. The protective leaf sheath that surrounds leaf bases has a notable reddish tint. One key feature that distinguishes this species from its relatives is the morphology of its prophylls. In palms, a prophyll refers to the first bract, or leaf-like structure, holding the inflorescence. Geonoma undata has a prophyll with unequally spaced ridges and a densely matted surface which is unique to the species. The prophyll margins typically have irregular spiny projections. Prophyll length is highly variable and can be up to 50 cm long. This species has a highly branching inflorescence below the plant leaves. There can be second and third order branching. As seen in other species of the genus Geonoma, the flowers of G. undata are imperfect and very small. They are located in pits which are organized in a spiral arrangement on rachillae. Staminate and pistillate flowers occur in clusters of three with one pistillate flower, and two staminate flowers in each cluster. Staminate flowers fall off after maturity while the pistillate flowers remain on the plant. The staminate flowers have six stamen with short anthers curling at maturity. The perianth of both staminate and pistillate flowers is composed of three sepals and three petals. However, there is a difference between male and female flowers. In staminate flowers, the sepals are distinct, narrow and rounded at the apex. The petals are basally connate and the anthers have valvular dehiscence. Meanwhile, pistillate flowers exhibit basal connation in both sepals and petals. The pistil is composed of three carpels, an elongate style, and three stigmas. Neither pistillate nor staminate flowers emerge very far out from the pit in which they are located. The pistillate receptacle is anywhere between 12 to 47 cm long and has a reddish tone when the flower is developing fruit. The fruit of G. undata is classified as a drupe, and a single inflorescence bears many drupes. The fruit size is 5 to 15 mm long and about 12 mm in diameter. The surface of the fruit is bumpy and black when ripe. It has an ovoid shape with a pointed apex.  Distribution and habitat  Geonoma undata is native throughout Central and South America, ranging from the southern tropics of Mexico to Bolivia. It is prevalent in mountainous cloud forests at high elevations. As an understory species of palm, Geonoma undata can withstand low amounts of light and prefers a humid environment.  Cultivation and use  Certain parts of Geonoma undata are edible, and this species is often cultivated for heart of palm in Central America. Other uses of G. undata include utilizing leaves for roof thatching and palm trunks for poles in primitive construction. The palm wood is also used by indigenous groups to make various tools and utensils. Traditionally, the fruits are useful in making a dark dye. It is occasionally used in landscaping and horticulture as well.  Conservation  This plant species is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" in Venezuela but its status in other countries is not specified by the IUCN. One of the major threats to G. undata is habitat disturbance via deforestation and urbanization. Because this is a solitary species, it tends to naturally occur in small numbers making the effects of habitat disturbance acute to the overall population. Although G. undata is cultivated in Central America for its edible heart of palm, some harvest the palm illegally in protected areas which also threatens the native population.

There are various types of drawer slide in the market to apply on different usage. For instance, kitchen cabinets, oven slides, rail for door sliding, and fridge slides etc. Names of drawer slides vary, but they all perform the same purpose on sliding movement, such as telescopic channel slide, concealed slides, drawer runners, steel ball slides, ball bearing slide, undermount slide rail, and so on. The basic production flow of drawer slide machine is roll forming, punching, and cut off to length. A good slide rail defined by smoothness, tight tolerance, and loading capacity. Process of Slides roll forming Processes of drawer slides roll forming is a continuous cold rolled steel strip passing through a plurality set of upper and lower shaped rollers, and then punching, embossing, straightening, and cut off to length. Straightening is an important part to avoid material twisting or curling. A roll forming line is often provided with straightening mechanism to make sure the material is nicely formed in a predetermined shape to meet the original design. Types of Product Two major types of drawer slides are 2-section and 3-section, which consist of outer, middle, and inner rail. Names of drawer slides vary such as, telescopic channel slides, drawer runner, under mount slide rail, steel ball slide, and ball bearing drawer slides etc. They are widely used in kitchen cabinet, home furniture hardware, office appliance, and industrial equipment. The smoothness and loading capacity must be considered when one choose these furniture fittings. Customized roll forming lines Every slide rail varies in some detailed design, which requires a customized production line to meet the expected profile. The development takes time and costs, especially for undermount drawer slides. The profile is not as easy as contoured profile like roofing; in other words, slides roll forming requires advanced technology in manufacturing. One disadvantage of drawer slides roll forming equipment is rollers can be only used to roll form one kind of profile design, which rollers must be changed when making different types or model of drawer slides profile.

Biography  Lieberson was born in Odessa to Achilles Lieberson and Sophie Herzberg. He received a medical degree from the University of Odessa in 1907 but then left for Berlin to study music at the Master School for Composition under Friedrich Gernsheim until 1909 when he was awarded the prestigious Mendelssohn Scholarship for his Concerto for Violin and Orchestra. Leiberson then spent 1910 at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig as student of Arthur Nikisch in conducting. He returned to Berlin in 1911 as conductor at the Vienna Volksoper opera house and joined faculty at the Stern Conservatory where he taught the class \\"Elementarlehre und Harmonielehre\\" in Russian language for students who only spoke Russian. He married Anna Pressman in February, 1916. During World War I, he served as a medical officer on the Turkish front with rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Imperial Russian Army. Lieberson returned to Berlin after the war and was appointed director of the New Conservatory in 1920 where he was a professor of composition. He also contributed to music periodicals including Die Musik and Allgemeine Musikzeitung. Lieberson immigrated to the United States with his wife in August, 1930, and settled in Chicago. He was already well-established in the local music community by 1933 as a guest conductor with Eric DeLamarter and the Chicago Civic Orchestra, the training orchestra established by Frederick Stock and sponsored by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Lieberson enjoyed success with his symphony In a Winter Garden that was performed multiple times in 1935 and 1936 by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with Stock conducting. In June, 1935, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music from Sherwood Music School in Chicago. He was on faculty at DePaul University School of Music as Professor of Composition and appointed Chairman of the Department of Theory by 1936. Lieberson was also naturalized as a United States citizen in 1936. He continued teaching for many years with colleagues including Sergei Tarnowsky and Richard Czerwonky. Lieberson was selected as a judge for the 1941 Sigma Alpha Iota music fraternity String Awards Competition along with Leo Sowerby and Czerwonky. For the closing concert of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's 50th season in 1941, Frederick Stock invited 12 local composers, including Lieberson, to contribute a variation of the folk theme El-A-Noy, derived from \\"Illinois,\\" appearing in Carl Sandburg's The American Songbag. Dr. Leiberson and his wife moved to California in 1947.  In a Winter Garden  In a Winter Garden is Lieberson's most successful composition. It is a \\"description in sound of a vaudeville show\\" in four movements starting with \\"Backstage,\\" a fugue; \\"The Musical Clown,\\" a theme with variation; \\"The Dancing Prima Ballerina,\\" a rondo; and \\"The Juggler,\\" a scherzo. A complete performance runs about 25 minutes and is scored for 4 flutes, 3 oboes, 3 clarinets, 3 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, timpani, celesta, 2 harps, piano and a full complement of strings including violin I, violin II, viola, cello, and bass. The work was originally commissioned in 1932 by Patricia Gordon, co- founder of the Chicago-based cosmetic company, Princess Pat and was awarded first place at the 1934 Hollywood Bowl composers' competition. Frederick Stock was a judge at the 1934 Hollywood bowl competition and brought the work back to Chicago for a premiere with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1935. In the program notes accompanying the first Chicago performance, Lieberson wrote that during \\"a musical evening at the Gordon home my hostess described her idea of a composition that would give the high-lights of vaudeville. The idea appealed to me, and, at my request, Mrs. Gordon jotted down her conception of the material to be embodied in the music.\\"Program for Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Chicago. March 14, 1935. Page 16. This anecdote was repeated in Radio Mirror, a popular magazine at that time. The piece was very well received. A review of the 1935 Chicago premiere was published in the weekly Musical Courier: Other reviews of the suite were equally supportive with another critic noting that in its \\"suggestion of the joys of de luxe vaudeville it classifies as excellent descriptive music.\\" The work was also called \\"a brilliant piece of musical writing…\\" The second movement has been described as a clumsy fellow on stage \\"trying many kinds of musical instruments. He pretends complete ignorance of music. Then he takes the flute and plays a simple, naïve tune. Variations on this tune follow - first a sentimental waltz and then a comic march to close the clown's musical act.\\" Two of the four movements were broadcast on the radio as part of the General Motors Concerts series under the direction of Ernö Rapée in 1936. The last documented performance was in 1941 by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. There are no known recordings. In a Winter Garden was dedicated to Mrs. Gordon.

It took place on 7 April, the first day of the invasion, between the Italian invaders and the Albanian defenders and resulted in an Italian victory. Opposing forces The Italian Armed Forces committed 22,000 troops under General Alfredo Guzzoni to the invasion of Albania.Bernard J. Fischer, Albania at War, 1939-1945, Purdue University Press, 1999, p. 22 The main force, tasked with capturing the capital Tirana, was placed under the command of General Alfredo Guzzoni and was to be landed at Durrës; it consisted of two battalions of the 3rd Regiment \\"Grenadiers of Sardinia\\", one battalion of the 47th Infantry Regiment, five Bersaglieri battalions (two belonging to the 2nd Bersaglieri Regiment and one each from the 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment, 7th Bersaglieri Regiment, and 11th Bersaglieri Regiment), two battalions of L3/35 tankettes, one 65/17 mm battery and one 20/65 anti-aircraft battery, all under the command of General Giovanni Messe. The force, numbering about 4,700 men, was carried by ten transport ships (the requisitioned merchants Adriatico, Argentario, Barletta, Palatino, Toscana and Valsavoia, the repair ship Quarnaro, the seaplane carrier Giuseppe Miraglia, used in this instance to carry tankettes, and the tankers Adige and Tirso, that could also operate as landing ships), and the landing was supported by a naval force commanded by Admiral Ettore Sportiello and consisting of the heavy cruisers Zara, Pola, Fiume, and Gorizia, the destroyers Alfieri, Oriani, Gioberti, and Carducci, and the torpedo boats Lupo, Lince, Libra and Lira. The Albanian defenders consisted of one Frontier Guard battalion, one Albanian Army battalion, a platoon of marines of the Royal Albanian Navy, and Engineer company, a mountain battery with two 75/13 mm guns (overall, 360 soldiers and 140 marines according to Albanian sources) as well as numerous volunteers armed only with small arms. The defenders were led by the commander of the Durrës Gendarmerie, Major Abaz Kupi, and Major Alibali of the Albanian Army. The \\"Prandaj\\" coastal battery (commanded by Major Gaqe Jorgo), armed with four 75/27 mm Skoda guns, supported the defenders, whose main armament otherwise consisted of rifles and three Schwarzlose machine guns.Owen Pearson, Albania in the Twentieth Century, A History, Volume I - Albania and King Zog, I. B. Tauris Publishing, 2004, p. 444Charles D. Pettibone, THE ORGANIZATION AND ORDER OF BATTLE OF MILITARIES IN WORLD WAR II, Trafford Publishing, 2014, p. 15 The four patrol boats which made up the Royal Albanian Navy were armed mainly with one 76 mm gun apiece when they were commissioned in 1926. However, at the time of the Italian invasion, their armament was reduced to one obsolete machine gun,Moikom Zeqo, Mujo Ulqinaku, Nëntori Publishing House, 1980, p. 78 as their main guns were landed to form a coastal battery on a nearby hill, overlooking Durrës.Moikom Zeqo, Mujo Ulqinaku, Nëntori Publishing House, 1980, p. 156 Battle The Italian warships arrived near Durrës in the afternoon of 6 April, whereas the transports carrying the landing forces arrived at 4:50 in the morning of April 7, with a 30-minute delay caused by the fog. Before the attack, a boat with twenty Italian officers was sent ashore, but the Albanians refused to grant them passage. An exchange of fire followed, and thus the battle ensued; the landing of the Italian force commenced at 5:25. Italian marines and troops disembarked and advanced in close formation, not expecting any resistance, as the town was illuminated and there seemed to be no sign of reaction. However, when the troops disembarked on the piers they were greeted by a barrage of rifle and machine gun fire by the defenders, lying in wait among the nearby harbour buildings, causing many casualties. A second Italian landing was carried out soon afterwards, with a greater number of troops. The Albanian defenders, however, took positions closer to the concrete breakwater of the harbor and waited for all Italians to disembark, then again opened fire with the machine guns. The third attack was successful, being supported by naval gunfire from the Italian warships; overall, fighting went on for a few hours, including in some cases hand-to- hand combat, and in the end the Albanian defenders began to fall back. By nine o'clock in the morning, all of Durrës was in Italian hands, after the Italians landed numerous small tanks and armored cars from one of their warships.Owen Pearson, Albania in the Twentieth Century, A History, Volume I - Albania and King Zog, I. B. Tauris Publishing, 2004, pp. 444-445 The Albanian coastal battery was also active during the battle, shelling Italian positions.Moikom Zeqo, Mujo Ulqinaku, Nëntori Publishing House, 1980, p. 168 In the last hour of the battle, naval sergeant Mujo Ulqinaku, one of the three Albanian machine gunners, was killed by a shell from an Italian warship.Moikom Zeqo, Mujo Ulqinaku, Nëntori Publishing House, 1980, p. 171 Aftermath The Albanians lost 51 men in the battle; Italian casualties are recorded as 25 killed and 97 wounded, although the Albanian side claims that Italian casualties were higher (up to 400 according to some claims).Owen Pearson, Albania in the Twentieth Century, A History, Volume I - Albania and King Zog, I. B. Tauris Publishing, 2004, p. 445 The four patrol boats of the Royal Albanian Navy were captured by the Italians, as was the coastal battery. The fighting in Durrës saw the heaviest resistance encountered by any of the Italian landing forces in Albania. From Durrës, the Italian force marched towards Tirana, that was captured on the following day.

His ancestor was Liu Fei, the eldest son of the Han dynasty's founder, Liu Bang (Emperor Gao). His father, Liu Yao, was a minor warlord who served as the Governor of Yang Province from 194 to 198. When Liu Yao died in 198 in Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi), Liu Ji, then 13 years old, presided over his father's funeral. He received many condolence gifts from those who attended the funeral but he declined all of them.(繇長子基，字敬輿，年十四，居繇喪盡禮，故吏餽餉，皆無所受。) Sanguozhi vol. 49. A year later, when the warlord Sun Ce passed by Yuzhang Commandery, he collected Liu Yao's remains, arranged a proper memorial service for Liu Yao, and treated Liu Yao's family kindly.(後策西伐江夏，還過豫章，收載繇喪，善遇其家。) Sanguozhi vol. 49. Wang Lang also advised Sun Ce to treat Liu Ji well: \\"[...] The eldest son of Zhengli (Liu Yao) has great ambition. I believe there is something extraordinary about him. [...] Wouldn't it be good to treat him with kindness?\\"(王朗遺策書曰：「劉正禮昔初臨州， ... 正禮元子，致有志操，想必有以殊異。威盛刑行，施之以恩，不亦優哉！」) Sanguozhi vol. 49. Liu Ji grew up in poverty and hardship with his two younger brothers, Liu Shuo (劉鑠) and Liu Shang (劉尚).(基二弟，鑠、尚， ...) Sanguozhi vol. 49. The environment trained him to be sensible and empathetic. He often slept late and woke up early. Even his wife and concubine(s) hardly saw him. His brothers respected and feared him, and treated him like their father. He also refrained from having a wide social network, and rarely hosted guests at home.(吳書曰：基遭多難，嬰丁困苦，潛處味道，不以為戚。與羣弟居，常夜卧早起，妻妾希見其面。諸弟敬憚，事之猶父。不妄交游，門無雜賔。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 49. Liu Ji had a good-looking appearance. Sun Ce's younger brother and successor, Sun Quan, highly respected and favoured him. In 219, when Sun Quan was appointed General of Agile Cavalry (驃騎將軍) by the Han imperial court, he recruited Liu Ji to serve as an Assistant in the East Bureau (東曹掾) and subsequently promoted him to Colonel Who Upholds Righteousness (輔義校尉) and Palace Gentleman Who Builds Loyalty (建忠中郎).(姿容美好，孫權愛敬之。權為驃騎將軍，辟東曹掾，拜輔義校尉、建忠中郎。) Sanguozhi vol. 49. In 221, after Sun Quan received the nominal vassal title \\"King of Wu\\" (吳王) from the Wei emperor Cao Pi, he appointed Liu Ji as Grand Prefect of Agriculture (大農令). He threw a feast to celebrate with his subjects. During the feast, Yu Fan, an official under Sun Quan, showed disrespect towards his lord. When an enraged Sun Quan drew his sword and wanted to kill Yu Fan, Liu Ji stood up, grabbed Sun Quan and pleaded with him to spare Yu Fan. He told Sun Quan, \\"If Your Majesty kills a good man when you're drunk, even if Yu Fan is in the wrong, who would understand the truth? Your Majesty is famous and respected because you showed acceptance and tolerance towards virtuous and talented people over the years. Is it worth ruining your good reputation in just one day?\\" Sun Quan said, \\"If Cao Mengde can kill Kong Wenju, why can't I do the same to Yu Fan?\\" Liu Ji replied, \\"Mengde killed virtuous people recklessly, hence he didn't win over people's hearts. Your Majesty promotes moral values and righteousness, and wishes to be compared to Yao and Shun. Why are you comparing yourself to him?\\" Sun Quan then spared Yu Fan and instructed his men to ignore his orders in the future if he was not sober when he ordered someone to be executed.(權旣為吳王，歡宴之末，自起行酒，翻伏地陽醉，不持。權去，翻起坐。權於是大怒，手劒欲擊之，侍坐者莫不惶遽，惟大司農劉基起抱權諫曰：「大王以三爵之後，手殺善士，雖翻有罪，天下孰知之？且大王以能容賢畜衆，故海內望風，今一朝棄之，可乎？」權曰：「曹孟德尚殺孔文舉，孤於虞翻何有哉？」基曰：「孟德輕害士人，天下非之。大王躬行德義，欲與堯、舜比隆，何得自喻於彼乎？」翻由是得免。權因勑左右，自今酒後言殺，皆不得殺。) Sanguozhi vol. 57.(權為吳王，遷基大農。權嘗宴飲，騎都尉虞翻醉酒犯忤，權欲殺之，威怒甚盛，由基諫爭，翻以得免。) Sanguozhi vol. 49. On one hot summer day, when Sun Quan was feasting on board a ship, a thunderstorm suddenly broke out.

Wilson, Professor of Modern History at King's College, London. Background and synopsis India Conquered is a comprehensive history of British colonial rule in India. The book aims to lay bare that \\"beneath the veneer of pomp and splendour, British rule in India was anxious, fragile and fostered chaos.\\" It demonstrates that while British colonial rulers projected themselves as heroes and nation-builders, the reality for those under occupation was \\"a precarious regime that provided Indian society with no leadership, and which oscillated between paranoid paralysis and occasional moments of extreme violence.\\" India Conquered is critical of the idea that British rule was a coherent and powerful force of control in India, noting the chaotic violence of authorities and the lack of development in India during the Raj. The British innovations brought to India, civil services, education, and railways had beneficial side effects according to Wilson, but were not designed for development of India, but rather to maintain political power. The book explores infrastructure programmes built by British authorities, such as the railways, and contends they were constructed late by global standards and in the face of \\"colonial indifference\\" - with an insistence that construction follow British military priorities rather than local economic priorities. Literacy rates in India rose from an estimated 3.2% in 1872, to 16.1% in 1941. By the time the 155,000 British citizens living in the Raj left India in 1947, only 12% of the 390 million people living in India was literate. Wilson challenges the assumption, made by many on the left, that British rule in India was an efficient structure of profit- making, arguing instead that the Raj's power was piecemeal and unsystematic. Reception In The Financial Express (India) India Conquered is described as an \\"extensively researched\\" work which \\"proves how the British rule was not beneficial for India and how the British never assimilated themselves with the society, systems and culture of this country,\\" and that the book \\"lacks proper analysis of the period prior to the British\\". India Conquered was praised by the British Financial Times as a \\"virtuoso takedown of cherished shibboleths of Raj mythology.\\" The reviewer wrote that the book exposed \\"an arrogant, racist and disdainful attitude towards Indians, and also a belief that British power in India had to be absolute.\\" In the British Literary Review, David Gilmour notes that \\"Wilson damages his argument by his insistence on generalisation: the British thought this or felt that...far too many Britons became linguists, historians and other scholars of India to justify the description ‘rarely interested’....There is predictably little room in this narrative for the concept of altruism.\\" Gilmour finds that nuance distracts from Wilson's overall thesis that \\"‘They were interested merely in defending themselves and maintaining the trappings of authority.’\\" References Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:Books about the British Empire Category:Books about British India Category:Books about imperialism Category:Simon & Schuster books ","title":"India Conquered"},{"id":"55057121","text":"Cebularz, originating from Jewish cuisine, is a wheat dough pancake, with a diameter of 15-20 cm, topped with diced onion and poppy seed (15-20%), characteristic for Lublin cuisine.

The Museum started with the archaeological findings dated in 1903, in the Iberian settlement of the Guíxols. It is considered that in 1919 it was the year of the constitution of the Museum, but it was consolidated in 1920 as a result of the donation of Dr. Ignasi Melé of archaeological objects. In 1914 the first exhibition of the material was organized in the annexed room of the School of Arts and Crafts of the Monastery and, in the following years, it received small donations that expanded its purely archaeological collections to receive artistic, traditional and labor pieces. The museum resisted the Civil War without there being any mention and it was not until 1951 that it began to dynamise with a relocation within the Monastery. From this moment on, a period of sustained growth begins, with renovations, restorations and gaining space with the transfer of annexed premises, the incorporation of new collections and the decentralization of the collection to the case of The Maritime Rescue Museum, which allows the Museum to grow up to the present.  Permanent spaces  The museum has an extensive collection of articles related to the town's history, from archaeology, to the cork industry and the town's relationship with the sea. Exhibits also include paintings by local artists, such as Josep Albertí, as well as an area devoted to health.

She is a lecturer at the National College of Art and Design and she is known for her public artworks which are located in Belfast, Limerick, Dublin and Heathrow Airport in London.  Life  Walsh's 1992 work, Monument to the Unknown Woman Worker, Belfast. Walsh was born in Cork in 1963 and is currently based in Dublin.

Currently working in the Sculpture Department at National College of Art and Design, Dublin.  Artistic work  She is well known for her work of life-size energetic figures, which can attracting controversy as they challenge conventional depictions of women. Her considerable technical skill and use of informal objects is commended by some commentators. She has exhibited extensively in Ireland and the UK with notable exhibitions at; the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin with ‘Sounding the Depths Phase Two,’ and also in Graz, Austria, the Temple Bar Gallery, Dublin, the Arts Council Gallery, Belfast and the Belltable Arts Centre, Limerick. She has substantial experience in the field of public art with commissions including; Installation work at Heathrow Airport, London, sculpture within the integrated artworks project at the Royal Victoria Hospitals and work in Dublin, Cavan and Limerick. = Derry project = In 2006 she was commissioned by the Department for Social Development to create a sculpture to commemorate the 300-year history of women factory workers in Derry. Over the following years the project was delayed as planning permission for the erection of the sculpture was denied and therefore its location had to be shifted, causing Walsh to re-design and re-make the sculpture. In 2013 she walked away from the project due to the financial loss she had sustained during the process. = Monument to the unknown woman worker = In the late 1980s, her design for a public artwork in Belfast to commemorate women's work was accepted by the project's selection panel. The official brief was to reflect Amelia Street's history as a former red-light district. with \\"two colourful life-size ‘cartoon’ female figures’’. Walsh considered it to be offensive to portray women in that way, and instead submitted her proposal for two bronze female figures, addressing the underlying issues of women's low-paid jobs and unpaid housework. This theme is articulated by the use of objects and utensils symbolic of women's work, such as household items, telephones, shopping baskets and cash registers, which are imbedded in the fabric of the figures. Due to this controversy, regarding its purpose it was dropped by the selection panel. A private developer later recommissioned the work, titled Monument to the Unknown Woman Worker, and it was erected in 1992.

Her work serves as a commentary on Native identity, stereotypes and fashion. Her baskets may be seen in the collections of The Oregon Historical Society, Hallie Ford Museum of Art, the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, the Heard Museum, the Portland Art Museum, the Burke Museum and at Stonington Gallery.  Training  Telford comes from a long line of weavers including her grandmother, mother, aunt and cousins. Despite her Indiana upbringing, she grew up connected to her culture, visiting Alaska for traditional gatherings and potlatches and participating in traditional dance. For 16 years Telford worked as a carpenter. In 1996, she took a position as a job developer with a nonprofit organization called ANEW — Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Employment for Women and Men. At the age of 35, she began learning to weave traditional Haida baskets from her aunt, Delores Churchill, and traditional cedar garments from her cousin, Holly Churchill.  Creative process  Telford stuck strictly to the tradition of form follows function until 2004 when she went into contemporary cedar clothing, cedar shoes, cowboy boots and neckties. Telford tells of her work: > I harvest and prepare my own material, using red & yellow cedar bark and > spruce root in my work. Harvesting cedar bark takes me hundreds of miles > from home and many hours of preparation time. Materials are prepared > differently depending on the final product. The bark is traditionally stored > for one year and then further processing is required before weaving may > start. After that, baskets can take Telford five to 200 hours to make. As a young weaver she once sat down and counted every stitch on one of her grandmother's old baskets. \\"At first my basketry had to be perfect, and then I let it all go and that's when I found true joy\\". The artist compares making baskets to therapy, saying it helps her relax from the stresses of life. She also called basketry her thread to sanity.  Collaborations  In 2011, Telford worked with glass artist Preston Singletary on an exhibition of women's forms in glass. In 2011, Telford received in the National Native Artist Exchange Grant to work with Kelly Church. She taught Kelly how to find and choose the proper cedar tree for harvesting, how to split and prepare the bark to be stored.

He was born in Busan, South Korea and studied creative writing at Chugye University for the Arts. He made his literary debut when six of his poems including \\"Hanggu\\" (항구 Port) appeared in the Fall 1992 issue of the journal Modern Poetry World. He was a lead vocalist for Chimso Band and a member of the band THE ASK.  Life  Kang Jeong debuted as a poet in 1992 at the age of 21, the youngest South Korean born in 1970 to have done so. In 1996, he completed his compulsory military service and published a poetry collection entitled Cheohyeonggeukjang (처형극장 Execution Theater). The collection was a critical and popular success, making Kang one of the most lauded young poets in the country. Literary critic and writer Ko Jong-seok praised the collection, saying: \\"To see a true work of aestheticism that risks being ridiculed, to meet a true believer in aestheticism who pleases his god not just by the purity of his faith but by the elegance of his rituals, the South Korean literary world had to wait for Kang's Cheohyeonggeukjang to arrive.\\" After Kang published his first poetry collection at the age of 26, he wrote various genres, including his 2004 collection of interviews, reviews, and essays in cultural criticism, entitled Ruteuwa kodeu (루트와 코드 Route and Code). Following this publication, Kang became better known as an essayist than as a poet. In his essays, as seen in Ruteuwa kodeu and many other works, Kang discusses a range of material from literature and art to film and music with perceptiveness and poetic sentiment. Kang formed a literary coterie named Talsedae (\\"transcending generations\\") with writers Kim Yeonsu and Lee Eung Jun, and even dabbled in writing fiction. Kang, along with other South Korean poets born in the seventies who rose to prominence in the 2000s, was identified as a futurist. His reputation as a poet grew as he published a total of six poetry collections: Deulyeojureoni marira hetjiman (들려주려니 말이라 했지만, I’ve Called It Speech to Tell You about It But,) in 2006; Kis (키스 Kiss) in 2008; Hwal (활 Bow) in 2011; Gwisin (귀신 Ghost) in 2014; and Baekchiui sansu (백치의 산수 The Idiot’s Arithmetic) in 2016. He won the 16th Weolgan Contemporary Poetry Award in 2015.  Writing  In Kang's poems, there is often a tension between obsessive passion and the longing for absolute dispassion. The poet takes on human, animal, or ghostly personas and explores paradoxical themes of life and death, reality and fantasy, and chaos and civilization. These themes are conveyed through imagery such as “a silence bathed in blood” or “the words of Death.” Kang's first poetry collection Cheohyeonggeukjang (처형극장 Execution Theater) portrays a world of death and depravity, while his second collection Deulyeojureoni marira hetjiman (들려주려니 말이라 했지만, I’ve Called It Speech to Tell You about It But,) is filled with a sense of anticipation for new life. His third collection Kis (키스 Kiss) shows the poet maturing in his writing style, and his next work Hwal (활 Bow) compares language to an arrow aimed towards the silent world. Gwisin (귀신 Ghost) and Baekchiui sansu (백치의 산수 The Idiot's Arithmetic) are notable for their dynamic and unrestrained energy. The poet Lee Jun-kyu has described Kang as \\"one who is cursed and sorrowful, who spits blood and cries and can’t help but love.\\"  Works  = Poetry collections = 1\\\\. 『처형극장』(문학과지성사, 1996) {Execution Theatre.

The door is narrow but the world inside the door is wide, Entering your door, I touch your heart, and the world my tongue touches bears pictures meandering like the traces of a snake. While I muse on the next shape of humanity, rain gradually mixes blue and yellow. The scene with trees opening hidden eyes is a moment when a fairy tale I read long ago becomes real. The future does not come by a shifting of time, it is a temporary conclusion by extinction of time, so inside your door, I compose a prophecy of the end everyone experiences. From my tongue, you try to absorb the laws of music and poetry. By you, I try to establish a prototype of beautiful breasts and a type of psychological incest. Therefore, this kiss is a contact of high-level play and strict secrecy unrelated to drug addiction. Your door is opened by my kiss and is eternally closed by my kiss. I am your last man. But for you I am the first man. Inside your door, finality is connected to the experience of extreme near-death. On your projecting teeth foregrounding an aesthetics of bloodsucking, a poetic line, 'the taste of a closing coffin-lid' had been written then erased. As the tongue shrinks slightly, an unhappy family history is drawn on my tongue. \\\\- Translated by Chung Eun-Gwi and Brother Anthony of Taize, 2014 Seoul International Writers' Festival Anthology  Awards  2015: 16th Weolgan Contemporary Poetry Award  Further reading  1\\\\. 송승환, ｢카메라의 언어와 인간의 밖｣, 『문학과사회』 봄호, 2009. {Song, Seung-hwan. \\"The Language of Cameras and What’s Outside People.\\" Literature and Society, Spring 2009 Issue.} 2\\\\. 김영희, ｢몸의 말, 말의 춤｣, 『문학과사회』 봄호, 2012. {Kim, Yeong-hui. \\"Language of the Body, Dance of Language.\\" Literature and Society, Spring 2012 Issue.}  External links  1\\\\.

It was originally a Facebook page created by Fida al-Sayed, a Swedish activist living in Eskilstuna, during the Arab Spring in the beginning of 2011. By May 2011, it was considered the most influential Syrian activist organization in the mobilization of protesters against the Syrian government during the Syrian uprising. History =Creation= In January 2011, during the Arab Spring and the Egyptian Revolution, Fida al- Sayed, together with his two younger brothers Mustafa and Yasir, created the page \\"Syrian Revolution\\" on Facebook. By February, the page gained more than 16,000 followers. It began to call for a \\"day of rage\\" in Syria against the government of Bashar al-Assad, but was initially not able to mobilize protests in Syria. In an interview on Nyhetsmorgon at TV4, Fida explained that when he started the page before the \\"revolution,\\" people laughed at him and said that there will never be an uprising in Syria, while others supported the initiative. He pointed several times that it is a peaceful movement for freedom and democracy. He said that they did not have to do any marketing for the page, as the situation in Syria was marketing itself. He said he no longer administrated the page alone, he only founded it, and he now has the help of hundreds of young people in Syria. =Beginning of the Syrian uprising= On 15 March 2011, around 200 protesters gathered in Damascus to demand reforms and the end to the state of emergency in Syria. The Syrian Revolution 2011 Facebook page, then with more than 41,000 followers, called for the protest. On 18 March 2011, the Syrian Revolution 2011 Facebook page called for a \\"Day of Dignity\\" in Syria. After Islamic Friday prayers, thousands of protesters gathered in 4 cities, notably in Daraa, and called for freedom and democracy and against corruption. Government forces violently suppressed all of the protests. In April 2011, the Syrian Revolution 2011 Facebook page had more than 120,000 followers. It once again called for Syrians to take to the streets for Friday protests in Syria. By May, the Facebook page, which had more than 180,000 followers, transformed into a wider network with more than 250,000 members in more than 8 social media sites. The Syrian Revolution Network became the most influential Syrian opposition organization, influencing and mobilizing thousands of protesters against the Syrian government. In July 2011, BBC Arabic showed in a special report how Fida run the page from his apartment in Eskilstuna. Fida explained that 75% of the administrators who ran the site were from within Syria. Fida also told that it is a difficult process before a video is approved and posted on the site: the event must have been filmed and sent by various independent sources, even sometimes needed to be confirmed by filming the date on a local newspaper, or that some of the protesters show big signs where you can clearly see the week's campaign name. =Escalation and civil war= One of the key media activists affiliated with the Syrian Revolution Network is Moaz al-Shami. Moaz al-Shami was from Damascus, and during the first 3 years of the Syrian Civil War, he mainly operated in and around Damascus. Battles of the war he covered in Damascus included the Damascus offensive of November 2012 and the Damascus offensive of February 2013, In March 2013, Reuters considered Moaz al-Shami to be one of the leading opposition activists in Damascus. Some time later in the war, Moaz al-Shami moved to the Idlib Governorate in northwestern Syria, where he currently operates. Since September 2015, he covered the Russian military intervention in Syria, including the bombing of Aleppo and Idlib by the Russian Air Force. On 7 March 2016, while he was covering protests in rebel- held towns in Idlib, Moaz was arrested by al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front, part of the Army of Conquest. On 5 December 2016, he was once again arrested by the Army of Conquest after disputes with an Army of Conquest Sharia judge in Idlib, but was soon released after. In the beginning of 2017, Moaz al-Shami covered the rise of Tahrir al-Sham in Idlib. On 4 April 2017, he recorded photographs and videos of the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack and its aftermath.

He is noted for his pamphlet The Fight at Dame Europa's School on the Franco-Prussian War. Life Born at Little Gidding, then in Huntingdonshire, on 29 February 1836, he was the elder son of the four children of William Pullen, rector there, and his wife Amelia, daughter of Henry Wright. From February 1845 to Christmas 1848 he was at Marlborough College under its first headmaster Matthew Wilkinson. In 1848 his father, in poor health, moved with the family to Babbacombe, Devon. Pullen matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge in 1855, where he graduated B.A. in 1859, proceeding M.A. in 1862. In 1859 he was ordained deacon on appointment to an assistant-mastership at Bradfield College, and became priest next year. He was elected vicar-choral of York Minster in 1862, and was transferred in 1863 to a similar post at Salisbury Cathedral. He passed the next 12 years of his life there, the period in which he did most of his writing. In 1875 Pullen retired from Salisbury. During 1875–6 he served in Sir George Nares's British Arctic Expedition as chaplain on HMS Alert, receiving on his return the Arctic medal. Mount Pullen, on northern Ellesmere Island, would be named for him. For 12 years he travelled widely in Europe, based at Perugia his headquarters. The publisher John Murray appointed him editor of Murray's Handbooks for Travellers, and he revised the series. Back in England in 1898, Pullen held successively the curacy of Rockbeare, Devon (1898–9) and several locum-tenancies. In May 1903 he became rector of Thorpe Mandeville, Northamptonshire, where was a brass tablet to his memory on the chancel wall. He died unmarried in a Birmingham nursing-home seven months later, on 15 December 1903; and was buried at Birdingbury, Warwickshire. Works Near the end of 1870, a month into the Siege of Paris (1870–71), Pullen found fame with a pamphlet The Fight at Dame Europa's School. A parable on the European situation, it made John, the head of the school, who refuses to separate Louis and William in a fight, though he sees that Louis is beaten and that the prolongation of the fight is mere cruelty. John is reproached by Dame Europa for cowardice, is told that he has grown \\"a sloven and a screw\\", and is threatened with loss of his position. It was a runaway success, and earned Pullen £3000.The first edition of 500 copies was printed at Salisbury on 21 October. Twenty-nine thousand copies had been issued by 1 February 1871. Messrs. Spottiswoode of London printed 50,000 copies (1–9 Feb.). The 192nd thousand appeared on 18 April. The 193rd and final thousand was printed in April 1874. The pamphlet was translated into French, German, Italian, Danish, Dutch, Frisian, Swedish, Portuguese and Jersey-French. A dramatised version by George T. Ferneyhough was acted on 17 March 1871 by amateurs at Derby. in aid of a fund for French sufferers. There were many replies, among them the anonymous John Justified, by Charles William Grant In 1872 Pullen again attacked on Gladstone's administration in The Radical Member. A later pamphlet was Dr. Bull's Academy' (1886). He did not repeat his success. Several pamphlets (1869–72) on reform of cathedral organisation and clerical unbelief were combative, and Pullen was active in controversy until nearly the end of his life. In stories of school life, Tom Pippin's Wedding (1871), The Ground Ash (1874), and Pueris Reverentia (1892), he tackled issues in the English educational system. Other works were: * Our Choral Services, 1865. * The Psalms and Canticles Pointed for Chanting, 1867. * The House that Baby built, 1874. * Clerical Errors, 1874. * A Handbook of Ancient Roman Marbles, 1894. * Venus and Cupid, 1896. Many of his books were at his own expense and loss-making. In 1848 his father had published a volume of verse by Pullen, called Affection's Offering..

It was built in the 19th century and it is protected as a Bé Cultural d'Interès Local, a cultural asset of local interest. As of 2017, it is a branch of the Museum of History of Sant Feliu de Guíxols, dedicated to marine rescue. Description The building was inaugurated in 1890 and it is located 13 meters above sea level. This rescue includes the Dawson cable launcher (1890), the Miquel Boera lifeboat with its transport carriage (blessed in 1898) and a whole range of their items. Externally, the combination of backup columns stands out on the ground floor. History The house is located at the point of Els Guíxols, also called Fortim or Salvament, a spur that divides the bay into two natural ports and it is a historical site linked to the defense and protection of the city. There are Iberian settlements from the 5th century BC. In the 7th century, the legend of Saint Felix the African was formed, according to which the martyr was thrown into the sea from the top of Els Guíxols. In 1354, Sant Feliu was a port and avenue of Girona, and in 1443 a Consulate of the Sea was established. At the end of the 19th century, a Local Shipment Rescue Board was created based on volunteering to help sailors and fishermen. In 1886, it was constituted as a subsidiary of the \\"Sociedad Española de Salvamento de Náufragos\\" and promoted the construction of the rescue station with boats and rescue equipment. In 1940 the rescue of wrecked ships was in the hands of the Navy, and in 1971 it was part of the Creu Roja del Mar. The rescue station was no longer used due to its height above sea level.

He was born in Chungju, South Korea and studied Korean literature at Korea University, where he also received his doctoral degree. He has been teaching creative writing at Hanyang Women's University since 2003.  Life  Kwon Hyeok-ung was born in Chungju, South Korea. He began his literary career when he won the Joongang Ilbo New Writer's Contest in 1996 for criticism and the Munye Joongang Literary Award in 1997 for poetry. As a critic, he was closely involved in a heated controversy over South Korean Futurist literature in the mid-2000s. Experimental works by young South Korean poets in that decade were attracting criticism for their abstruseness, but Kwon defended them arguing that they simply used “a different style of communication” from conventional poetry. He was in fact the first one to call them “Futurist” poetry, and despite the controversy surrounding the subject, the name stuck. It became an important term to explain South Korean poetry in the 2000s and sparked various other discussions on new poetics. Kwon's own poetry, however, was not the kind of work he praised as a critic. He preferred to write lyrical and romantic poetry. He earned a number of accolades for his work, including the 6th Modern Poetry Coterie Award in 2000, the 4th Yushim Award for Best Criticism in 2006, the 2nd Society of Korean Poets Award for Emerging Poets in 2006, the 15th Contemporary Poetry Award in 2010, and the 12th Midang Literary Award in 2012. He served on the editorial board of literary journals Munye Joongang and Hyeondaesihak. He currently teaches creative writing at Hanyang Women's University.  Writing  Kwon Hyeok-ung's poetry has a lyricism that subtly balances emotion with logic. His first poetry collection Hwanggeumnamu areseo (황금나무 아래서 Beneath the Golden Tree) (2001) observes the interior and exterior of objects. His second collection Majingga gyebohak (마징가 계보학 A Genealogy of Mazinger) (2005) nostalgically portrays the hardships of the 1970s and 80s in South Korea by alluding to comic books, erotica, and other cultural memes that were popular among the lower middle class during that time. Geu eolgure ipsureul daeda (그 얼굴에 입술을 대다 I Pressed My Lips on That Face) (2007) is a collection of love poems set in a fantastical universe, featuring mythical creatures from around the world such as centaurs, werewolves, unicorns, and jiangshi. Kwon captures everyday scenes using different motifs for each collection. From his fourth collection Somundeul (소문들 Rumors), his poems start taking on a more subversive character. In particular, they advocate a type of semantics where signifiers resist and gain independence from the “tyranny” of meaning, explore the meaning of resisting meaning, and seek a counterpower to cause power to implode. Such satirical poetry allowed him to perceive the world in a new light and experience the constant tension between language and reality. From parodies and love poems through political satires to poems about everyday life, Kwon's poems have diversified in their sensibility and expression. Literary critic Shin Hyeong-cheol argues that Kwon is “an intelligent poet” who takes easy-to- miss “people and objects and turns them into protagonists of his stories, then casually nudges them toward us.” Kwon has also been noted for his lyricism, experimental style, ability to create images from mundane subjects, imagination, and extensive knowledge of poetry.

Construction of an 8 km part of the sea wall along the coast was officially launched on Oct. 9, 2014. Background Jakarta is prone to flooding, especially during the monsoon season. In 2007, the city suffered from catastrophic flooding that resulted in 76 deaths and half a million flood victims displaced or otherwise impacted. Jakarta lies on a low flat basin 23 feet above sea level. 40 percent of that, particularly the northern areas, is below sea level. Given the continuous groundwater extraction and the pressure of skyscraper developments, besides flooding Jakarta is also sinking at 5 to 10 centimeters per year, up to 20 centimeters. From 2000 to 2050 the potential coastal flood extent is estimated to increase by 110.5 km2 due to both land subsidence and sea-level rise; it is estimated that the city will be entirely submerged by 2050. Furthermore, it is estimated that the city's population of over 10.6 million people will be displaced, especially those communities closest to water bodies. To solve it,a feasibility study to build a dike on Jakarta Bay was undertaken. The project is known as National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD) master plan or Giant Sea Wall Jakarta. The project, which also has the task of revitalizing the coastline and most importantly offering a vision of the future for the Indonesian capital, was designed by the architecture firm KuiperCompagnons of Rotterdam and with a collaboration between Indonesia, and a consortium of Dutch companies (Witteveen+Bosa and Grontmij), which formed National Capital Integrated Coastal Development and were all involved in the creation of the master plan that started in 2008. The National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD) Masterplan The NCICD includes the construction of a giant sea wall just northern of the bay in Jakarta as a measure to protect the city against floods from sea. Inside this wall large lagoons will be constructed to buffer outflow from the 13 rivers in Jakarta. This giant sea wall will be built in the form of a Garuda (the large mythical bird which is Indonesia's national symbol) and expected to become an iconic structure modelled after Singapore's Sentosa Island. It will take 10 to 15 years before construction of this wall is realized. Existing dikes will be strengthened in between the times. After completion of the project, Jakarta Bay would become a water reservoir enclosed in the Giant Sea Wall and would eventually become a source for clean water for the entire city. Cost of the project is estimated about US$ 40 billion, and will be an international collaboration between the governments of Indonesia and the Netherlands, paving the way for further bilateral trade between the two countries. Two phases of this mega-project are: *Strengthening and enhancing the existing coastal dikes along 30 kilometers, and construction of 17 artificial islands in the bay of Jakarta. The groundbreaking of this first phase was conducted in October 2014. *Building the Giant Sea Wall; this will be a giant dike (32 kilometers-wide) that includes an airport, harbor, toll road, reidential area, industrial area, waste treatment, water reservoir, and green areas, on a space of about 4000 hectares. The giant sea wall will also become a center of urban development, which will be built by private partnership investments. Urban development includes upmarket offices and housing as well as low-cost housing, green areas and beaches. The new integrated waterfront city will also involve 17 artificial islands, complete with toll roads, a railway, and seaport, and should be able to absorb approximately two million people. The length of the giant sea wall may reach 32 kilometers from Tangerang to Port of Tanjung Priok. Controversy The project is not without negative environmental impacts and social consequences: one study by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of Indonesia found that the project, once underway, could erode the islands in the western part of the bay of Jakarta, destroy the coral reef and lead to the stagnation of polluted water behind the sea wall. The possibility of this last point is rejected by the Dutch experts who, on the contrary, assure that because the city’s water will be treated, the rivers will dump clean water into the bay. The reclamation program was also met with opposition from several environmental groups and fisher-folk. Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI) and the People’s Coalition for Fisheries Justice Indonesia (Kiara) submitted an appeal to halt construction work on Islet G, one of 17 islets to be created but the Supreme Court rejected the appeal. Construction work on the Jakarta reclamation project was temporarily banned by central government in 2016 asking for the fulfillment of several requirements. However the ban was lifted in October, 2017. If the great seawalls fail to shut out seawater or the project is suspended or postponed due to economic turmoil, engineering difficulties, environmental impact, or political decisions, and assuming that efforts to reduce land subsidence are not carried out, downtown Jakarta would eventually become submerged. Critics of the project have also argued that while investors and the government will be footing the cost of the project, it is Jakarta's people that will be paying the price of this infrastructure. While the state has implied that the poor ultimately stand to gain from these projects, the reality is that Jakarta’s poor are the most negatively impacted. In 2010, Jakarta’s City Government voiced concerns over the effect of climate change over the city’s poor and promised to reduce their vulnerability to climate shocksSurbakti, I. M., Firman, T., Idroes, I. C., & Simarmata, H. A. (2010). Jakarta City Report. 24.. However, when it came time to expand Jakarta’s current sea wall as part of the Sea Wall project, many kampung settlements (i.e. informal slums) were cleared and their residents forcibly evicted. Those communities are some of the Jakarta’s poorest and most vulnerable and were unable to relocate to more permanent inland estatesLeitner, H., Colven, E., Sheppard, E., Colven, E., & Sheppard, E.

Further, many of these residents relied on their proximity to the sea and their community to earn a living; their lives were unequivocally changed when they were displaced.

The congress defined boundaries between the peoples, but also resulted in the United States appropriating much of the land of the Santee, Sauk and Meskwaki.

Solar viewer (also known as solar viewing glasses or solar eclipse glasses) are special eyewear designed for direct viewing of the Sun. Standard sunglasses are unable to filter out eye damaging radiation. Solar viewers are required for safe viewing of solar events such as eclipses. The recommended optical density of this eyewear is 5. They can only allow 1/100000 of the sunlight to pass through. Safety According to the American Astronomical Society (AAS) products meeting the ISO 12312-2 standard avoids risk damage, and issued a list of reputable vendors of eclipse glasses. The organization warned against products claiming ISO certification, or even citing the exact standard number, but not tested by an accredited laboratory, or those bearing incomplete certification information. Another problem was counterfeits of reputable vendors' products, some even claiming the company's name (such as with American Paper Optics which published information detailing the differences between its glasses and counterfeits). Eyewear made prior to 2015, may have a 3 year use limit before they can no longer effectively filter out UV radiation. Starting in 2015, products made with ISO 12312-2 can be used indefinitely as long as they have not been damaged by scratch or tear. =Counterfeit eclipse glasses= In the months leading to the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, counterfeits of light- filtering glasses for solar eclipses began proliferating, leading to public health issues. Effective eclipse glasses filter visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. The eye's retina lacks pain receptors, and thus damage could occur without one's awareness. Includes photos of genuine and fake eclipse glasses. The AAS said determining whether an eclipse viewer was safe required a spectrophotometer and lab equipment, but often the user should see nothing through the filter except for the Sun, sunlight reflecting off of shiny metal, or intense light sources such as an LED flashlight. Andrew Lund, the owner of a vendor of eclipse glasses, noted that not all counterfeit glasses were necessarily unsafe. He stated to Quartz that the counterfeits he tested blocked the majority of harmful light, concluding that \\"the IP is getting ripped off, but the good news is there are no long-term harmful effects.\\" On July 27, 2017, Amazon required all eclipse viewing products sold on its website have a submission of origin and safety information, and proof of an accredited ISO certification. In mid-August 2017, Amazon recalled and pulled listings for eclipse viewing glasses that \\"may not comply with industry standards\\", and gave refunds to customers who had purchased them.

The MVT also operates the Music Venues Alliance, a network of venues and other groups that aid the MVT, and the Trade Association of the Music Venues Alliance, which offers services that help venues that are members of the MVA. Paul McCartney has spoken out in support of the MVT, saying that \\"If we don’t support live music at this level then the future of music in general is in danger\\". Issues One of the key reasons for the foundation of the MVT was the closure of many music venues, such as Brighton's Blind Tiger Club, due to noise complaints; this is especially important as noise complaints are becoming more frequent, as new laws have been introduced that make it easier to convert offices into housing. Another key concern that the MVT claims is facing venues is Arts Council England's lack of funding for venues; Beverley Whitrick, Strategic Director of the MVT, said in 2017 she could not estimate how many clubs would close in the next five years. Initiatives The MVA founded an international affiliate organisation in Austin, Texas in 2016, targeting state taxes that are seen as punitive towards local venues as well as the MVA New Zealand where they are fighting to have Agent of Change recognised and adopted. To clarify its political aims ahead of the 2017 general election, the MVT launched a \\"Manifesto for Music 2017\\" in May of that year. Two months after the launch of the manifesto, in order to help fight the issues and closures that music venues in the UK were facing, the MVT announced that they would cooperate with Ticketweb, part of Live Nation Entertainment, to sell \\"Grassroots Venues Tickets\\", which help fund the MVT's efforts, as part of the service charge is donated to the MVT.

She is known for her researches into the social history of ancient India, especially the evolution of the caste system and the development and absorption of regional deities into the Hindu pantheon. Biography Suvira Jaiswal obtained a master's degree in history from Allahabad University. She received her doctorate under at the guidance of Ram Sharan Sharma at Patna University. Jaiswal taught at Patna University from 1962. She was a professor at the Centre for Historical Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University from 1971 until her retirement in 1999. In 2007, Jaiswal was the General President of the Indian History Congress. Research Jaiswal has researched the evolution of the caste system in India, its origins and functions. She showed that in the period of the Rig Veda, the caste system hadn't yet become the complex hierarchy of later periods. She showed that the grihapati, previously thought to be a head of a family, was in fact the leader of an extended kin-group, and that the transition from a pastoral to a sedentary mode of production led to increased social stratification with the grihapati becoming an archetype of the patriarchal principle. Jaiswal showed that neither skin colour and notions of race were the basis of caste (varna) differentiation. Rather, it was the unequal access to economic and political power that entrenched status distinctions and crystallised the hierarchy. She also determined that there were consequences to specialist economic roles, endogamy and hierarchical society: the systematic suppression of women as a class. In particular, she pointed out that there was insufficient surplus production of goods in the Rig Vedic period to allow any section of society to withdraw from economic activity. This meant that women were more or less autonomous in their agency, having access to education and free movement.

He had a 52 hectare garden. He would order rare trees from merchants traveling to the city. Foreign guests would also bring him different trees and flowers. Part of the garden went to Ganja Fortress that Turkish warlord Serdar Ferhad Pasha erected in 1588. Actually it was assumed that the garden was also made by Serdar Ferhad Pasha in 1582. The battle of Javad Khan's squad for Russians was also there. Therefore, Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov decided to eradicate the garden from the earth along with the Ganja Fortress. In 1847 on the initiative of Vorontsov, in the lower part of the Khan's garden, about six hectares the foundation of the city park named after Sardar was laid. Khan's Garden where was historically a resting- place for khans in Ganja, was abolished after the Russian invasion and some of the trees there were relocated to Sardar Garden. After the reconstruction works, the garden was given the previous name and called Khan's Garden again. The garden is currently one of the main rest places of the people in Ganja.

Biography  Born in Morges, the son of abstract painter , Gilles trained in ballet at the Ecole supérieure de danse de Cannes Rosella Hightower and at the Ballet Junior in Geneva, at the time directed by Beatriz Consuelo. He then danced for Fabienne Berger and Philippe Saire in Lausanne, as well as with Catalan choreographer .  1990s  In 1993, Jobin was appointed director of the Theatre de l'Usine in Geneva where he met María Ribot, also known as La Ribot, a Madrid-born choreographer and dancer who would soon become his partner. In 1995, the couple moved to Madrid and Jobin produced his first three solos, which focused on identity issues: Bloody Mary (1995), Middle Suisse and Only You (1996). In 1997, they left for London since both were drawn to performance art and the Institute of Contemporary Arts’ dynamic programme. There, Jobin received a grant by Artsadmin and was welcomed into that organisation. He then became resident choreographer at Arsenic in Lausanne, where he established his own company Cie Gilles Jobin, producing his first group performance, the trio A+B=X for Les Urbaines, at Arsenic theater. The performance was also presented at Festival Montpellier Danse in 1999 and Jobin was subsequently recognised for the radical nature of his work, acting as a \\"leader for a new generation of independent Swiss choreographers\\".Le Dictionnaire de la danse, under the direction of Philippe Le Moal, Larousse, 2008, p.227 In 1998, he produced the duo Macrocosm in London's The Place, relying on choreographic language outside of established aesthetic frameworks that included forays into visual arts and performance art, as in the project Blinded by Love (1998), produced jointly with British performer Franko B. The quintet Braindance was then produced in 1999 and performed at Théâtre de la Ville in Paris, and several international tours followed in Europe and Brazil.  2000s  In 2001 Jobin produced a major performance in his repertoire, the quintet The Moebius Strip, based on perpetual motion, which enabled him to radicalise his work on horizontality. Unlike his previous works which developed underlying themes of sex, nudity, violence and war, this performance is based on nothing but lines and geometry – echoing the compositions of his father which fluctuate between geometric rigour and the intense vibration of juxtaposed colours. He then followed with the septet Under Construction in 2002 which was described by Marie-Christine Vernay (Libération Next, 2002) as \\"doubtless one of the most majestic of Gilles Jobin's performances\\".\\"En étoiles de mer\\", in Libération.fr (in French) Two-Thousand-and-Three, created in 2003 for the 22 dancers of the Ballet of the Grand Théâtre de Genève, itself a uniquely contemporary performance that \\"transcends both classical and contemporary dance\\"\\"Jobin, génie de mêlée\\", in Libération.fr (in French) (Marie-Christine Vernay, Libération Next, 12 September 2003) was the last episode in this acclaimed trilogy based on a system of \\"organically organised movement\\". In 2004, Jobin produced Delicado for Lisbon's Ballet Gulbenkian. That same year he moved to Geneva with his family and produced the sextet Steak House in 2005. The following year, the choreographer became associate artist at Bonlieu Scène Nationale in Annecy and produced Double Deux (2006), Text to Speech (2008), a performance which points to his growing interest in new technologies, and Black Swan (2009).  2010s  In 2010, Jobin produced The Missing Link with the dancers of the Donko Seko Dance Centre in Bamako, Mali. In 2011, he delved deeper into the concept of movement stripped of all narrative structure with Spider Galaxies. In 2012, he was awarded the Collide@CERN prize and thus became the first resident choreographer at CERN (the European Organisation for Nuclear Research). He ended his residency in November 2012 with a conference at CERN's Globe. In 2013, following his residency, he produced QUANTUM within the context of the CMS experiment, in association with German visual artist Julius von Bismarck (winner of the Ars Electronica Prize), American composer Carla Scaletti and Belgian fashion designer Jean-Paul Lespagnard. For QUANTUM, Gilles Jobin and Julius von Bismarck received the support of the Fondation d'entreprise Hermès in the framework of its New Settings programme. In 2015 Jobin produced the duo FORÇA FORTE inspired by the laws of quantum physics, with his troupe's iconic dancer Susana Panadés Diaz. For that performance, the choreographer did his first ever motion capture at Artanim, a Geneva research centre that carries out orthopaedics, sport medicine, 3D animation, virtual reality and enhanced reality projects. That same year he shot the acclaimed 3D film WOMB which premiered in the autumn of 2016 at the 22@th Geneva International Film Festival (GIFF). In 2017 he produced the ground-breaking contemporary dance show in immersive virtual reality VR_I, in association with Artanim, in which five viewers at a time, equipped with VR headsets and on-board computers, are immersed in a virtual environment where they can interact with each other while navigating freely to observe the dancers. The show earned Gilles Jobin the Innovation Award for the most innovative work for new platforms at the 46@th Festival du Nouveau Cinema in Montreal, where it premiered internationally in October 2017. He also earned the FNC EXPLORE Performances/Installations People's Choice Award for the best virtual reality performance. In 2017 his 3D film WOMB wins the award for art and experimental film at San Francisco Dance Film Festival.

Since 1943, Pinchas Gutter has repeatedly journeyed from his home in Toronto, Canada to Poland to share his experiences at Madjanek. Brought to the camp at age eleven, he has spent a lifetime educating teachers from all over the world on the horrors of last century. Gutter subjects himself to painful memories so that others might learn from his wisdom. Pinchas, now 85 years old, is both physically and emotionally exhausted. Unable to continue traversing the world, he has in recent years sought new methods of sharing his experiences. The Last Goodbye, co-created by Gabo Arora and Ari Palitz, is a co-production by the Shoah Foundation, Here Be Dragons, MPC VR and OTOY.

Life Isaac Edgard Milhaud was born on 14 April 1873 in Nîmes, Gard, France. His parents were Jassuda Léon Milhaud (1839–1901) and Marie Victoire dite Sarah Cerf (1850–1901). From 1892 to 1896 he studied in Pars at the Sorbonne, Collège de France and Faculté de Droit, studying philosophy, sociology and political economy. He received his agrégation in philosophy in 1895. He studied in Germany in 1896–99, inquiring into the workers' movement the basis for his book La démocratie socialiste allemande (1902). He was an economist and a militant socialist. From 1899 to 1902 Milhaud was an economic adviser in the office in the Minister of Commerce and Industry. He married Berthe Louise Marquinot (1880–1978) on 14 April 1901. Their children were Maurice Edgard, born in 1899, and Germaine Sarah, born in 1901. In 1902 he was appointed Professor of Political Economy at the University of Geneva. In 1908 he founded the journal Annales de la Regie directe, an international journal which in 1925 became the \\"Annales de l'Economie collective\\". He was Director and Editor-in-Chief. In 1914–18 he was the first doyen of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences. In 1920 Milhaud was asked by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to direct the Survey of Production (1920–24). In the early 1920s Albert Thomas and Edgard Milhaud proposed to develop expertise in the ILO on the links between social and economic problems. As the delegate representing the French employers at the ILO, Robert Pinot despised the proposal, which he called \\"social control of the economy.\\" In 1923 Milhaud became a member of the Honorary Committee of the International Co-operative Alliance. In 1924 he was a member of the Higher Consultative Committee of Commerce and Industry of France. From 1925 to 1933 Milhaud was Chief of the General Investigations Section of the ILO. In 1926 he gave a course at the Academy of International Law of The Hague. In 1926–29 he was President of the Belgian-Luxembourg Mixed Arbitral Tribunal, set up to decide economic questions arising from the Belgo-Luxemburg Economic Convention. He was called to this presidency by the Council of the League of Nations. From 1928 to 1936 he was a member of the National Economic Council of France. On 20 June 1940 Edgard Milhaud, Adrien Tixier and Jean-Amédée Weber sent a telegram to Marshal Petain in protest against the request for an armistice, asking for the continuation of the war alongside the British. In 1947, while teaching at the University of Geneva, Milhaud founded the International Centre of Research and Information on the Collective Economy, now known as CIRIEC, to ensure continuity of the Annals of Collective Economy. In 1948 Milhaud was a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1957 the headquarters of CIRIEC were moved to Liège, Belgium, and Professor Paul Lambert became director. Edgard Milhaud died on 4 September 1964 in Barcelona, Spain. In 2010 CIRIEC started to award the €5,000 Edgard Milhaud Prize annually to young doctoral students.

Generally these are secondary, tertiary and other subsequent immune responses to the same antigen. Immunological memory is responsible for the adaptive component of the immune system, special T and B cells -- the so-called memory T and B cells. Immunological memory is the basis of vaccination.Travers, Paul, et al. Janeway's immunobiology. Garland Science, 2008.Hammarlund, Erika, et al. \\"Duration of antiviral immunity after smallpox vaccination.\\" Nature medicine 9.9 (2003): 1131. Development of immunological memory The time course of an immune response. Due to the formation of immunological memory, reinfection at later time points leads to a rapid increase in antibody production and effector T cell activity. These later infections can be mild or even unapparent. Immunological memory occurs after a primary immune response against the antigen. Immunological memory is thus created by each individual, after a previous initial exposure, to a potentially dangerous agent. The course of secondary immune response is similar to primary immune response. After the memory B cell recognizes the antigen it presents the peptide: MHC II complex to nearby effector T cells. That leads to activation of these cells and rapid proliferation of cells. After the primary immune response has disappeared, the effector cells of the immune response are eliminated.Sprent, Jonathan, and Susan R. Webb. \\"Intrathymic and extrathymic clonal deletion of T cells.\\" Current opinion in immunology 7.2 (1995): 196-205. However, there remain antibodies previously created in the body that represent the humoral component of immunological memory and comprise an important defensive mechanism in subsequent infections. In addition to the formed antibodies in the body there remains a small number of memory T and B cells that make up the cellular component of the immunological memory. They stay in the body in a resting state and at the second or next encounter with the same antigen these cells are able to respond immediately and eliminate the antigen. Memory cells have a long life and last up to several decades in the body.Crotty, Shane, et al. \\"Cutting edge: long-term B cell memory in humans after smallpox vaccination.\\" The Journal of Immunology 171.10 (2003): 4969-4973. Immunity to chickenpox, measles, and some other diseases lasts a lifetime. Immunity to many diseases eventually wears off. The immune system's response to a few diseases, such as dengue, counterproductively makes the next infection worse (antibody-dependent enhancement). Ed Yong. \\"Immunology Is Where Intuition Goes to Die\\". 2020\\\\. quote: \\"Immunity lasts a lifetime for some diseases—chickenpox, measles—but eventually wears off for many others.\\" quote: \\"For some diseases, like dengue, an antibody response to one infection can counterintuitively make the next infection more severe.\\" As of 2019, researchers are still trying to find out why some vaccines produce life-long immunity, while the effectiveness of other vaccines drops to zero in less than 30 years (for mumps) or less than six months (for H3N2 influenza). Jon Cohen. \\"How long do vaccines last?\\". 2019\\\\. Memory B cells Memory B cells are plasma cells that are able to produce antibodies for a long time. Unlike the naive B cells involved in the primary immune response the memory B cell response is slightly different. The memory B cell has already undergone clonal expansion and differentiation and affinity maturation, so it is able to divide multiple times faster and produce antibodies with much higher affinity (especially IgG).Travers, Paul, et al. Janeway's immunobiology. Garland Science, 2008 In contrast, the naive plasma cell is fully differentiated and can not be further stimulated by antigen to divide or increase antibody production. Memory B cell activity in secondary lymphatic organs is highest during the first 2 weeks after infection. Subsequently, after 2 to 4 weeks its response declines. After the germinal center reaction the memory plasma cells are located in the bone marrow which is the main site of antibody production within the immunological memory.Slifka, Mark K., Mehrdad Matloubian, and Rafi Ahmed. \\"Bone marrow is a major site of long-term antibody production after acute viral infection.\\" Journal of Virology 69.3 (1995): 1895-1902. Memory T cells Memory T cells can be both CD4+ and CD8+. These memory T cells do not require further antigen stimulation to proliferate; therefore, they do not need a signal via MHC.Kassiotis, George, et al. \\"Impairment of immunological memory in the absence of MHC despite survival of memory T cells.\\" Nature immunology 3.3 (2002): 244. Memory T cells can be divided into two functionally distinct groups based on the expression of the CCR7 chemokine receptor. This chemokine indicates the direction of migration into secondary lymphatic organs. Those memory T cells that do not express CCR7 (these are CCR7-) have receptors to migrate to the site of inflammation in the tissue and represent an immediate effector cell population. These cells were named memory effector T cells (TEM). After repeated stimulation they produce large amounts of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-5. In contrast, CCR7 + memory T cells lack proinflammatory and cytotoxic function but have receptors for lymph node migration. These cells were named central memory T cells (TCM). They effectively stimulate dendritic cells, and after repeated stimulation they are able to differentiate in CCR7- effector memory T cells. Both populations of these memory cells originate from naive T cells and remain in the body for several years after initial immunization.Sallusto, Federica, et al. \\"Two subsets of memory T lymphocytes with distinct homing potentials and effector functions.\\" Nature 401.6754 (1999): 708.

Acheson (February 20, 1844 – January 16, 1899) was an American temperance activist, born in Washington, Pennsylvania, on 20 February 1844. Biography Sarah Cooke Acheson was born in Washington, Pennsylvania on February 20, 1844. She was descended on the paternal side from English and Dutch families that settled in Virginia in 1600, and on the maternal side from Col. George Morgan, who had charge of Indian affairs under Washington, with headquarters at Fort Pitt, and of whom Jefferson, in a letter she possessed said, \\"He first gave me notice of the mad project of that day,\\" meaning the Aaron Burr treason. Among her ancestors were Col. William-Duane, of Philadelphia, editor of the Philadelphia Aurora during the American Revolution. She married, in 1863, Capt. Acheson, of Washington, Pennsylvania, then on Gen. Miles's staff, the marriage taking place while the Captain was on furlough with a gunshot wound in the face. He left for the front ten days after, encouraged by his young wife. Dr and Mrs. Acheson moved to Texas in 1872. During their residence in Texas Acheson was active in charitable and temperance work throughout the State. When a cyclone struck the village of Savoy, many of its inhabitants were badly wounded, some were killed, others made homeless. Mrs. Acheson reached them as speedily as a train could take her, doing duty as nurse and special provider for the suffering. She gave three years of active service to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She was state president at a time when a strong leader was greatly needed, guiding them into financial safety. Acheson was well read in all the thought of the day including social, scientific and religious reform. She lived in Denison, Texas. She died in Denison, January 16, 1899, and was buried in Fairview Cemetery.

He is the president of Òmnium Cultural, a non-profit cultural organisation founded in 1961 with more than 160,000 members and 40 local branches in Catalonia. As part of his role in the pro- independence demonstrations prior to the Catalan independence referendum of 2017, he has been imprisoned since October 2017 under charges of sedition and violent rebellion brought by the Spanish prosecutor's office. Cuixart was sentenced to nine years of prison for sedition. Amnesty International believes his detention and sentence constitutes a disproportionate restriction on his rights to free speech and peaceful assembly, and urges Spain to free him.  Biography  Cuixart was born in 1975 in Santa Perpètua de Mogoda. His mother hailed from Murcia and his father from Badalona. He lived in Santa Perpètua de Mogoda for 30 years before moving to Sabadell, where he remained until his imprisonment in 2017. As a teenager, he studied mechanics in the vocational education centre Institut Escola Industrial i d'Arts i Oficis in Sabadell. He joined Òmnium Cultural in 1996. In addition, he is a member of different social organisations, such as Can Capablanca, a pro-Catalan independence social centre in Sabadell, the cooperative financial institution Coop 57, and Amnesty International. He was an objector to Spanish military service. As a businessman, Cuixart is the founder and president of Aranow, a company that exports packaging machinery. He is co-founder and chairman of FemCAT, a private foundation of Catalan businesspeople.  Activism in Òmnium Cultural  He became the treasurer and later vice-president of Òmnium Cultural as an associate to Muriel Casals, who first became Òmnium's president in 2010 and was re-elected to the post in 2014. Under Casals' leadership, Òmnium Cultural's original focus in Catalan culture broadened to include the promotion of self-determination and Catalan independence. Jordi Cuixart succeeded Muriel Casals as president of Òmnium in December 2015, after she stepped down in July of that year to stand in the forthcoming Catalan election (in the meantime, the organisation was headed by Quim Torra as interim president). As president of Òmnium Cultural, he focused on widening the sovereignist social majority, while maintaining a program where the Catalan language and culture vertebrate social cohesion. He promoted, among others, the Lluites compartides (Shared fights) campaign, with which he wanted to promote the shared historical memory of social mobilization processes that, in different areas and moments of time, have been decisive in shaping what is today Catalonia. Cuixart also continued the organisation's involvement in the political developments leading to the Catalan independence referendum of 2017. During this period, Spanish police have searched Òmnium's main headquarters twice, and shut down websites promoting mobilization.  Imprisonment  On 16 October 2017, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sànchez were preventively jailed after the state attorney's accusation of sedition, a felony regulated by the article 544 and subsequents of the Spanish Criminal Code. This sedition was allegedly committed when they organized a protest on 20 September 2017 during Operation Anubis police raids to dismantle the framework of the 1 October Catalan independence referendum performed by the Spanish Civil Guard. They were accused of leading the protest of tens of thousands of people in front of the Catalan economy department heeding a call made by Òmnium Cultural and ANC. The investigating judge stated that the leaders did not call for \\"peaceful demonstration but to the protection of Catalan officials through 'massive citizens' mobilisations\\", even though Cuixart and Sànchez made several public calls asking for \\"peaceful\\" and \\"civic\\" protests in social networks, in a public statement in front of the media at noon and in a speech in front of the demonstrators in the evening. According to the judge, Sànchez encouraged the demonstrators with expressions such as \\"no one goes home, it will be a long and intense night\\", on top of a police vehicle. But footage from that night contradicts that and shows Cuixart and Sànchez calling off the protests on top of the car at 11pm: \\"We are asking you, to the extent possible and in a peaceful way, to dissolve today's gathering\\". After those calls, most demonstrators left the place and only a few hundred remained. Those were dispersed by crowd-controls units of the autonomous police force of Catalonia, Mossos d'Esquadra. Mossos recognized that there was a risk situation and denounced Spanish Civil Guard did not notify them in advance of the searches, making it impossible to prepare a police operation to keep demonstrators far from the building. A sentence of sedition can carry up to 15 years in prison. In July 2018, Cuixart was transferred to a prison in Catalonia. On 1 February 2019 he was transferred back to a prison in Madrid, expecting trial that started on 12 February and was remitted to decision on 12 June 2019.Trial of Catalan Independence Leaders Ends in Spain In February 2019 he published the book \\"Tres dies a la presó: un diàleg sense murs\\", (Three days at jail: a dialogue without walls), a talk with the journalist Gemma Nierga . In July 2019 he published his second book \\"Ho tornarem a fer\\" (We'll do it again), a manifesto to deffend the struggle for the fundamental rights. On 14 October 2019 Cuixart was found guilty of sedition and given a nine-year sentence.Catalan separatist leaders handed jail terms for independence bidSentencia del ‘procés’: penas de 9 a 13 años para Junqueras y los otros líderes por sedición y malversación = Reactions =  In Catalonia and Spain  Exiled Catalan former President Carles Puigdemont and the European Free Alliance referred to Sànchez and Cuixart as \\"political prisoners\\". The Spanish Justice Minister Rafael Catalá argued that they were not \\"political prisoners\\" but \\"imprisoned politicians\\". Since then, there have been several demonstrations and concentrations asking for their release. On 19 October, 200,000 people with candles gathered in Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona and on 21 October, 450,000 joined in Passeig de Gràcia to protest against their imprisonment. Another demonstration took place on 11 November, after the imprisonment of some members of the Catalan government, and 750,000 people congregated according to Barcelona city police. After his detention, activists launched a “yellow-ribbon” campaign in support of Jordi Cuixart and other Catalan activists and leaders who are being prosecuted by Spanish justice.  International  Amnesty International issued an official statement considering the charge of sedition and the preventive imprisonment \\"excessive\\" and called for their immediate release. On 7 March 2018 the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reminded Spanish authorities that \\"pre-trial detention should be considered a measure of last resort\\" referring to Catalan politicians and activists arrested after the independence referendum. On 8 August 2018, PEN International made another statement asking Spanish authorities to release Cuixart and Sànchez and considered their detentions to be \\"an excessive and disproportionate restriction on their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly\\". The World Organisation Against Torture sent an open letter to the President of the Government of Spain Pedro Sánchez as well as the Spanish Attorney General and Spanish Ombudsman on 22 November 2018 demanding the end of the \\"arbitrary pre-trial detention and judicial harassment of Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sànchez\\" and concluded \\"OMCT considers that the charges against them are unfounded and must therefore be dropped.\\" The day after, the NGO Front Line Defenders also issued a statement calling for the release of Cuixart. In December 2018, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers issued a statement requesting the release of Catalan political prisoners. The day before the beginning of the trial, the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization expressed their support to \\"those Catalan activists being trialled\\" and added \\"perhaps one of the biggest deficit of justice and deliberate confusion between law and justice, is seen in Catalonia.\\" On the same day, the European Democratic Lawyers association requested the immediate release of the Catalan leaders and expressed their concern because of the \\"lack of procedural guarantees during the trial\\". On 29 May 2019, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention urged Spain to release Cuixart, Sànchez and Junqueras and to investigate their \\"arbitrary\\" detention and the violation of theirs rights, as well as compensating them for the time spent in jail. The Spanish government criticised the report, arguing that the reasoning for their opinion did not take into account some of the alleged crimes. Spain's government issued a statement that raised doubts about the group's \\"independence and impartiality\\" and called on the U.N. to make sure that its semi-independent working groups are not used \\"for spurious purposes\\". After Cuixart was sentenced to a nine- year sentence, Amnesty International reiterated its petition to immediately release Cuixart and Sànchez and denounced that the \\"vague\\" and \\"overly broad\\" interpretation of sedition done by the Spanish Supreme Court could have negative effects on the freedom of protest in Spain.

Hundreds of Commoners as well as nobles came to her call of arms, however the Gujarati army still greatly outnumbered the Mewari's. After a valiant fight the Mewari resistance started to fall and the Gujarati artillery under Rumi Khan succeeded in breaking through the fort defenses.

Under the ownership of Cubbon and Lightfoot, the editorial standpoint of the Manx Sun became nationalist in orientation, and in addition to his newspaper proprietorship Cubbon also became heavily involved in the promotion of Manx history and culture. The Manx Sun and its business were taken over by the Isle of Man Examiner in 1906, with Cubbon rejoining the title in the capacity of manager of the stationery business. Leaving the Examiner in 1912, Cubbon became Borough Librarian of Douglas; in this period he published A Manx Book of Poetry (1913), which was particularly aimed at young people with a view to getting them involved in the culture of the Isle of Man. He also published a set of maps illustrating the ancient treens (divisions of parishes) and land divisions in the island's six sheadings, along with the names of the principal early land owners. During the First World War Cubbon became manager of the Labour Exchange. =Manx Museum= In 1922 the Manx Museum was established on the former site of Noble's Hospital in Douglas.

During his time at the Manx Museum, Cubbon compiled the Bibliography of the Literature of the Isle of Man, published in two editions in 1933 and 1939; he also conducted numerous explorations for the Antiquarian Society and gave lecture on various subjects. Cubbon celebrated the centenary of the publication of Archibald Cregeen's dictionary in Peel in 1938 stating that \\"we students would be poor without his precious book\\".

He was Chairman of the Royal Thames Yacht Club, and a founder in 1894 of the British Empire League. He was awarded an OBE in 1948. Early life He was the son of Aratoon Malcolm, of Bushehr in Qajar Persia, whose family had lived in Persia \\"since before Elizabethan days\\", in shipping and commerce, having acted as treasurers to British Missions to the Shah of Persia.Malcolm, 1944, p.1-3 They had numerous contacts with significant financial families in the region such as that of David Sassoon. He came to England at the age of 13 years old in 1881, for his education, under the guardianship of Albert Sassoon. As a boy he was friends with Albert Goldsmid. He was educated at the private Herne House School in Margate, Kent, before attending Balliol College, Oxford between 1886-9. Journalism After leaving university, he published a political- financial newspaper in London. He later became one of the founders and editors of the Hayastan Daily during the Armenian resistance during the Armenian Genocide. Arms Dealing His arms dealing career began with making the first offer to provide 1,000 sharpshooters for service in Southern Africa, and he fitted out Major Albert Gybbon Spilsbury's Tourmaline yacht for its controversial 1897 expedition to Mogador, Morocco.For further details of the expedition, see Spilsbury's Tourmaline Expedition (1906), summarized at http://gibraltar-intro.blogspot.co.uk/2016/11/1898-tourmaline-expedition- major.html Financing Activities As a contractor for public works he proposed to finance the Baku aqueduct, the longest water conduit in Europe which was ultimately financed by Zeynalabdin Taghiyev, the extensions to the London Docks, and the Canadian Trent–Severn Waterway.

Outside Japan, anime generally refers to a specific Japanese-style of animation, but the word anime is used by the Japanese themselves to broadly describe all forms of animated media there. According to Harry Benshoff and Sean Griffin, the fluid state of animation allows flexibility of animated characters to perform multiple roles at once. Manga genres that focus on same-sex intimacy and relationships resulted from fan work that depicted relationships between two same-sex characters. This includes characters who express their gender and sexuality outside of hetero- normative boundaries. There are also multiple sub genres that target specific consumers and themes: yaoi, yuri, shoujo-ai, shonen-ai, bara, etc. LGBT- related manga found its origins from fans who created an \\"alternative universe\\" in which they paired their favorite characters together. Many of the earliest works that contained LGBT themes were found in works by dōjinshi who has specifically written content outside the regular industry. The rise of yaoi and yuri was also slowed due to censorship laws in Japan that make it extremely hard for Japanese manga artists (\\"mangakas\\") and others to create work that is LGBT themed. Anime that contained adult-only content was changed to meet international standards. However, publishing companies continued to expand their repertoire to include yuri and yaoi, and conventions were created to form a community and culture for fans of this work. History = Pre-1970s = Scholars and manga artists generally agree that Osamu Tezuka greatly influenced manga. Yukari Fujimoto mentioned how in Tezuka's work, Princess Knight, the main character fluctuated between feminine and masculine identities. Sapphire, the main character of Princess Knight, was born female but was raised as a male to prevent the antagonist, Duke Durlamin, from inheriting the throne. Tezuka was inspired by Takarazuka Revue, a Japanese all-female musical troupe that performs both feminine and masculine roles. Osamu Tezuka grew up in Takarazuka where the troupe is based. = 1960s–today = Media and related materials depicting young men in same-sex relationships started to materialize in the 1970s. These stories were primarily created and consumed by adolescent girls and women reading shoujo genre tales. Over time work that focused primarily on male to male intimacy was referred to as \\"shonen ai\\", \\"yaoi\\" and \\"boy's love\\" (BL). In the 1960s, a group of women mangaka called the Magnificent 24 or the Year 24 group heavily influenced the genre of shoujo manga by introducing philosophical and radical ideas, including themes focusing on gender and sexuality. The Magnificent 24 group referred to women mangaka who were born in the Year 24 Shōwa (1949) according to numerous scholars, and the exact membership is not defined. A few artists who were associated this group were Moto Hagio, Yumiko Oshima and Keiko Takemiya. The mangaka in this period transformed the writing and drawing style within the genre, thereby creating a space for women artists in manga. The artists broadened the content of shoujo manga, adding science fiction, historical, and dramatic elements that changed how readers consumed the genre. Works from these groups contained the earliest examples of same-sex intimacy and relationships found in manga. Ryoko Yamagishi’s Shiroi Heya no Futari (白い部屋のふたり) was credited as the first manga to portray a lesbian couple. Conversely, Keiko Takemiya's work, In the Sunroom (サンルームにて) is said to depict the first male-to-male kiss in shojo manga. The popularity of Year 24's works spurred interest in male-male romance narratives from the 1960s onward. Amateurs as well as professional manga artists shared their works in a public hall called Comic Market (コミックマーケット Komikku Māketto), a channel for distributing and sharing work outside publisher restrictions. The market primarily focused on buying and selling of doujinshi (self-published works), and in its early years some artists from the shoujo circle displayed work containing fictionalized same-sex relationships between their favorite musicians. In the 1980s the term yaoi was primarily used to describe homoerotic works. The word is a shortening of \\"yama nashi ochi nashi imi nashi,” or “no climax, no ending, no meaning” and was primarily focused on male-to-male relationships between two favorite characters. It is now an umbrella term in Japan that describes male to male homoeroticism. Conversely, the term yuri described Japanese works featuring female-to-female intimacy. The actual term yuri is translated to \\"lily\\" which was symbolized as spiritual beauty and sexual purity. Yuri was first used to describe female-to-female intimacy by one of Japan's first gay magazines, Barazoku. The magazine featured a regular column called Yurizoku no heya (Room for the lily tribe) to address lesbian readership. Within the artist circles, the term Yurizoku was shortened to yuri to describe female to female intimacy.  Anime distribution, censorship and changes  The Japanese government uses censorship laws to regulate published content in the country. Article 175 of the Criminal Code (1907) prohibits the distribution, sale, or possession of materials that contain \\"obscene\\" (waisetsu) content. This included any depiction of pubic hair, adult genitalia, and sexual acts. However, manga creators developed ways to depict naked bodies and sex without showing pubic hair. Works that contained erotic content obscured character's genitals with blurring or black dots. The law was only sparingly applied and the number of creators and publishers fined were minimal. Sharon Kinsella states, \\"In general pornography has not been strongly compartmentalized in post-war Japan\\" and pornographic content has appeared throughout Japanese media and in pornographic productions. BL (Boy's Love) comics can often be found in large bookstores in Japan, and there is a large commercial market for same-sex intimacy. In 1998, manga and anime received negative attention following the arrest of Tsutomu Miyazaki the so-called “Otaku Serial Killer.” Miyazaki possessed large amounts of sexually explicit anime and was a frequent participant of Comic Market. In the aftermath of the killings thousands of doujinshis were confiscated and several shop owners were arrested. = Censorship in the United States = Anime reached the United States in the 1960s on the back of strong interest from fans and college students. Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy (1963) and Speed Racer were the earliest anime series shown to American audiences. Accordingly collaborations among American and Japanese companies to market titles to American consumers increased. In order to broadcast anime on American television, production companies had to cut scenes that were deemed too \\"violent.\\" Plot lines and direct translations of dubbing were also modified for Western audiences. Scholars have noted several anime that were edited specifically to fit Western sensibilities. When Sailor Moon was released in the United States, elements of the story were removed because Optimum Productions, the Canadian company in charge of the English language product, claimed that some of the content “is not suitable for children.”Hoskin, Rhea Ashley. “Westernization and The Transmogrification of Sailor Moon.” (2016). Under standards set by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, Sailor Moon was altered to fit within those guidelines. Following are examples of material censored to fit North American requisites. * Zoisite, a heterosexual man finds himself in a homosexual relationship with Malachite in the series. In the English dubbed version, Zoisite turns into a woman, thereby making the relationship heterosexual. * The relationship between Sailor Uranus/Haruka and Neptune/Michiru was depicted as ‘cousins’ who are simply ‘very close.’ In the original Japanese version, they are lovers. * Fisheye who presented as feminine is changed into a woman in the English version of the anime. Scenes that highlighted Fisheye's masculinity were deleted. When Cardcaptor Sakura broadcast in North America, many scenes featuring same-sex intimacy and/or relationships were removed or altered. Rejected material included Tomoya's crush on Sakura and same-sex intimacy between Touyo, Sakura's older brother, and Yukito.  Mainstream anime and manga  = Revolutionary Girl Utena = The approach to gender in the Revolutionary Girl Utena series is flexible, and according to Catherine Bailey, \\"The categorical definition of masculinity and femininity are limiting and unnecessary.\\" Utena is a character who subverts assumptions about her sex. She should be \\"jumping\\" at the chance of marrying a prince, but she looks up to him as a role model. At school, she wears a quasi male uniform and competes alongside male peers in a variety of athletic activities. According to Bailey, Utena does not want to \\"become\\" a prince literally, and when she claims that she wants to become a prince she is actually referring to princely qualities like courage, compassion, and strength. = Sailor Moon = Lesbian characters are introduced halfway through the series Sailor Moon, and their relationships are treated the same way as other heterosexual relationships. Haruka and Michiru, who are Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, are a couple who live with each other. The author has confirmed that they are a couple. The character Haruka displays masculine characteristics and she is portrayed in the video wearing the male version of her school's uniform. She is often mistaken for a man, but she does not mind. However, Haruka becomes more feminized when she transforms into her Sailor Uranus character. Her partner, Michiru, is meant to be the more feminine of the two and they are often seen with each other. = CLAMP = Numerous works of CLAMP, a Japanese manga artists group, explore relationships with no regard for gender or sex. Many of their manga consequently explore same-sex relationships. Works such as Miyuki-chan in Wonderland and Tokyo Babylon feature same-sex intimacy as central themes. In Cardcaptor Sakura, the main protagonist Sakura and Syaoran share a mutual infatuation with androgynous-looking Yukito. Tomoyo, who is best friends with Sakura, is also shown to hold sexual feelings for Sakura. Cardcaptor also depicts same-sex intimacy between Touyo, Sakura's older brother and Yukito. In episode 65, when Yukito's health is weakening due to a weakening in Yue's power (his alter-form), Touyo decides to give up his power to save Yukito from disappearing. = Fandom culture and demographics =  Motivations for consuming Yaoi and Yuri anime  Pagliassotti conducted the first research Anglophone readers' motivations for consuming yaoi. According to her research, she found 10 distinct motivations: “Pure” love without gender focus, pro-gay attitude/ forbidden and transgressive love, identification (self-analysis), melodramatic (emotional elements), dislike for standard shoujo romances, a female-oriented romantic/erotic genre, pure escapism/lack of reality, art/ aesthetics, pure entertainment, and arousing, sexually titillating content. However, there are other motivations for consuming yaoi manga complicated by cultural and legal differences. For instance, yaoi manga is media that challenges patriarchal norms and gender binarism. Accessibility to yaoi and yuri material is also dependent on international laws. For example, introduction of BL (Boy's Love) to the United States market was less likely to happen because depictions of male-to-male eroticism and sex would be considered contrary to children's material there. Many yaoi readers are teenage girls or young women. Fujoshi is a term often used to describe fans of works depicting romantic relationships among men. In Japanese, the term translates to \\"rotten girls.\\" Japanese women who read yaoi manga are most often heterosexual, and they consume the content for entertainment rather than for political or social reasons. Women also form the majority of yaoi readers in the West, accounting for 89% of total readership, with 55% of those falling into the 18-24 age range. Among yuri readers in the West, about 46% identify themselves as heterosexual women. Among yuri readers, there is a divide between men and women according to intended target audience. In 2010, the yaoi industry had an estimated annual value of 21.3 billion yen (over 180 million USD).

The initial working group represented many academic groups engaged in international surgical delivery, and included Haile Debas, MD (surgery), Skip Burkle, MD (public health), Dean Jamison, PhD (economist), Steve Bickler, MD (surgery), Richard Gosselin, MD (orthopedic surgery), Charlie Mock, MD (trauma surgery), John Meara, MD (surgery), and Robert Riviello, MD, MPH (surgery). Central to the initial mission of the group was autonomy from any one university or organization and collaboration with international groups and individuals representing the great unmet need of surgery and anesthesia in low and middle income countries. The working group has collaborated with global health institutions such as the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, World Health Organization's Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care, The World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists, The President and Fellows of Harvard College, The American College of Surgeons, Operation Giving Back , the Disease Control Priorities Network, and the International Surgical Society. The World Journal of Surgery became the official journal of the working group early in the group’s tenure, and has published an abundance of data and reports on rural and international surgery. The inaugural meeting of the Burden of Surgical Disease Working Group was hosted by the University of Washington in 2008. Subsequent meetings were hosted by The American College of Surgeons, Operation Giving Back in 2009 and Vanderbilt University in 2010. During the 2010 Burden of Surgical Disease Working Group meeting in Nashville, TN, the group was renamed as the Alliance of Surgery and Anesthesia Presence Today with the support of Bob Isherwood.

Trump (1:17-cv-02459-MJG) is a lawsuit filed on August 28, 2017 in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit alleges that President Donald Trump's ban on transgender personnel joining the U.S. military violates their equal protection and due process rights. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Maryland filed the suit on behalf of Petty Officer First Class Brock Stone, an 11-year veteran of the U.S. Navy, and several other transgender service members. In addition to President Trump, the suit names as defendants the Secretaries of Defense (James Mattis), the Army (Ryan McCarthy, acting), the Navy (Richard Spencer), and the Air Force (Heather Wilson). Background Trump first announced a policy banning transgender people from serving in the military in \\"any capacity\\" in a series of tweets on July 26, 2017, stating that allowing such service members would incur \\"tremendous medical costs and disruption\\".. The decision reversed Obama administration policy to allow the enlistment of transgender personnel, which was initially approved by the Department of Defense to begin July 1, but was delayed by Defense Secretary Mattis. Trump issued formal guidance on the ban to the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security in a memorandum on August 25, 2017. History The initial complaint was filed on August 28, 2017 in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on behalf of five named and one anonymous transgender personnel either currently serving on active duty or in the National Guard. The complaint cited news articles that \\"indicate that President Trump's motivations in abruptly announcing a transgender ban were largely political, reflecting a desire to placate legislators and advisers who bear animus and moral disapproval toward men and women who are transgender\\" and further stated there was \\"no evidence that this about-face in policy was supported by any study of the issue or any consultation with military officers, DoD [Department of Defense] officials, other military experts, or medical or legal experts\\". An amended complaint was filed on September 14, noting that one of the named plaintiffs, Staff Sergeant Kate Cole, had been denied medically-indicated surgery on September 8. That same day, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. In the attached memorandum in support, the Plaintiffs noted that \\"President Trump’s asserted military justifications have already been studied at length and rejected by the military itself. The Ban reflects a decision to single out a disfavored group and withdraw legal protection based not on evidence but animus, moral disapproval, and crass political calculation.\\" The memorandum also argued that \\"each day that President Trump’s unconstitutional directive remains in effect, Plaintiffs and their families continue to grapple with the stress and uncertainty of having their careers, their livelihoods, and their medical care jeopardized by a Commander-in-Chief who rejects their service and their sacrifice.\\" The United States Department of Justice Civil Division (USDOJ) filed a motion to dismiss on October 12, 2017, calling the request for a preliminary injunction \\"premature several times over\\" as Secretary Mattis's Interim Guidance of September 14, 2017 would prevent involuntary discharge, separation, or denied re-enlistment at least until March 2018. Senior medical and commanding officers provided sworn statements that they would comply with the Interim Guidance, in support of USDOJ's arguments. In response, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed an opposing motion on October 27, 2017 which noted the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, 2017 prohibited the accession (enlistment and commissioning) of transgender people into the military as of January 1, 2018, the funding of \\"sex-reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel\\" would cease on March 23, 2018, and the Secretary of Defense was directed to \\"return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service\\" which required involuntary discharge of personnel solely on the basis of their transgender status, also on March 23. Three separate amici briefs were filed in support of the complaint, by The Trevor Project (October 26), retired military officers (October 27/corrected October 30), and the same fourteen states and the District of Columbia which had collectively filed an earlier, similar brief in Doe v. Trump (October 30). On November 3, the government filed a motion in support of their earlier motion to dismiss, stating the Presidential Memorandum of August 25 \\"specifically directs the Secretary of Defense to study how to address transgender individuals who are currently serving in the military and does not predetermine the outcome of that study\\" and the \\"reliance on statements that the President made on Twitter several weeks before issuing his Presidential Memorandum is misplaced.\\" During this time, Judge Kollar-Kotelly issued a partial preliminary injunction to the proposed ban in Doe v. Trump on October 30. For Stone v. Trump, the Plaintiffs filed a memorandum on October 31, asking to continue consideration of the preliminary injunction as several of the plaintiffs in this case were affected by the ban on medically necessary surgeries implemented by the Presidential Memorandum of August 25. USDOJ argued on November 7 the preliminary injunction in Doe v. Trump \\"has, in large measure, provided Plaintiffs with the remedy that they seek at this stage\\" and \\"[t]his Court should therefore stay all proceedings\\". =Preliminary injunction= On November 21, 2017, Judge Marvin J. Garbis issued a preliminary injunction to the entire Presidential Memorandum of August 25. Judge Garbis's order also blocks the prohibition on gender reassignment surgery, going further than Judge Kollar-Kotelly's October 2017 injunction in the related case Doe v. Trump. In the order, Judge Garbis wrote \\"A capricious, arbitrary, and unqualified tweet of new policy does not trump the methodical and systematic review by military stakeholders qualified to understand the ramifications of policy changes\\", referring to the July tweets by President Trump announcing the reinstatement of the ban, which had caught Pentagon leadership by surprise and drew swift condemnation from senior retired officers. =Appeals= USDOJ filed a notice of appeal on December 5. USDOJ also asked the Court to clarify on December 12 if Secretary Mattis retained independent authority to further delay the accession (the process of entering military service, whether through enlistment, Service Academy, ROTC, or similar programs) of transgender candidates. Under the status quo enforced by the preliminary injunction, accession of transgender candidates was set to start on January 1, 2018. This date resulted from the postponement by Secretary Mattis of six months after the initial deadline of July 1, 2017 under the accession plan proposed by Secretary Carter in 2016. USDOJ asked for the clarification to be issued by noon, December 14. The parties had a conference on December 13, confirming that discovery should conclude by April 24, 2018, and the trial or hearing would be held in July 2018. On December 14, USDOJ filed an emergency motion for a stay on Judge Garbis's order with the Fourth Circuit. The emergency motion used similar language to the emergency motion filed on December 11 with the D.C. Circuit in Doe v. Trump. Both appeal court motions asked for a stay that would allow Secretary Mattis to issue a second delay for accession of transgender candidates to military service. Alternatively, the stay could act to narrowly constrain the preliminary injunction to allow the accession of only Seven Ero George, the single Plaintiff in Stone v. Trump that Judge Garbis ruled had standing to challenge the ban on accessions. Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the emergency motion on December 18, stating \\"[i]t was the President's unconstitutional actions that ended an orderly process [of planned accession]\\" and \\"[defendants did] not explain why the months of training that have already occurred are insufficient, or offer an explanation of what training they believe remains necessary and how long it would take.\\" In support, USDOJ stated \\"that implementation [of accession] was put on hold on August 25, 2017\\" and \\"the military will still have to take significant steps in order to meet an unexpected January 1 deadline\\". Plaintiffs followed up with a memorandum of supplemental authority on December 19 after the Pentagon memorandum of December 8 outlining guidance for accession of transgender candidates was introduced in Karnoski v. Trump. USDOJ argued \\"Secretary Mattis cannot, without risking contempt, exercise his independent authority to give the military more time to consider a momentous change to its accession standards\\" and produced a follow-up memorandum, dated December 19. On December 21, 2017, a panel of three judges on the Fourth Circuit denied USDOJ's emergency motion for a stay on Judge Garbis's order. Judge Garbis also denied the Motion for Clarification and Partial Stay on December 28, noting the defendants were \\"request[ing] judicial advice as to what can be done to delay transgender accesstion to the military that will not risk a contempt finding\\" and they also had \\"not met their burden to establish irreparable harm if they must implement the accessions provision by January 1, 2018\\". USDOJ filed a motion to withdraw the appeal, which was granted on February 2, 2018. =Discovery= On January 26, 2018, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel initial disclosures, which was granted on February 6. In their motion, the Plaintiffs stated the \\"Defendants’ two-sentence “initial disclosure” contains none of the required identifications, and is tantamount to no disclosure at all\\" instead of identifying the individuals, documents, and information that may be used to support their defense. Both sides entered into an agreement to enable confidential documents to be designated as privileged and protected from public disclosure on February 12. As in Doe v. Trump, USDOJ moved to dismiss the claims against the President and partially dissolve the preliminary injunction on March 1, 2018, arguing \\"the President is not a proper defendant in this case\\" as separation of powers dictates \\"the non-ministerial conduct of the President when he acts in his official capacity cannot be enjoined.\\" In their response, counsel for the Plaintiffs characterized the motion as a \\"startling proposition [that] should be rejected\\" and the \\"President is no king, but he too may be sued. This court has the power to determine whether the President has acted within the law, and to declare that the President violated the law.\\" They added the \\"Defendants’ argument that the President has absolute immunity from a lawsuit challenging his own unconstitutional actions is based on little more than sleight-of-hand\\", noting the USDOJ arguments relied on citing cases where injunctive relief was applied, instead of declaratory relief. USDOJ replied that declaratory and injunctive relief were equivalent. =New Trump memorandum= After President Trump issued a new memorandum on March 23, 2018, revoking the prior Memorandum of August 25, USDOJ moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction and asked for a protective order. The motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction noted the new policy was not \\"a categorical ban based on transgender status, [but instead] this new policy, like the Carter policy before it, would turn on the medical condition of gender dysphoria and contain a nuanced set of exceptions allowing some transgender individuals, including every individual Plaintiff here, to serve.\\" Since the new policy of March 2018 establishes gender dysphoria as a disqualifying medical condition, USDOJ argued \\"the military's new policy is constitutional\\", especially since the basis for the new policy asserted \\"that retaining the Carter policy would pose risks to military readiness\\". The proposed protective order asked that discovery should be halted, or the scope of discovery should be \\"significantly narrow[ed]\\" in light of the new policy. On April 23, 2018, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint addressing the new Memorandum. The defendants filed a new motion to dismiss the amended complaint on May 11, arguing that the Department of Defense issued the new policy only after a \\"methodical and systematic review by military stakeholders qualified to understand the ramifications of policy changes.\\" On August 14, the court denied the defendants' motion for a protective order, and simultaneously granted the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the defendants to disclose documents in response to discovery.

It blankets many different forms of theatre methods and expressions, including plays, dance, music, puppetry, circus, physical theatre, and many others. It is globally practiced, takes many forms, both traditional and non-traditional, and explores a wide variety of themes ranging from fairy tales to parental abuse. Originating in the 20th century, TYA is a recent branch of Theatre Arts. It takes on many functions in different settings and places around the world. In the US, for instance, it is often entertainment-centered, although its roots lie in education. Many writers and production companies have started catering specifically to TYA audiences, causing a continuous increase in theatrical material for children. In the present day, TYA production companies or groups can be found in most regions of the US and around the world. History Theatre performed by or for children dates back hundreds of years. The first mention is seen in a 1784 entry in Madame de Genlis’s Memoirs, in which she describes a performance by her two daughters to the Duke of Chartres. TYA became its own branch of theatre in the 20th century, first appearing in Moscow, when Russian actress Natalia Satz founded the Moscow Theatre for Children in 1918. In its early stages, the Moscow Theatre for Children viewed its goal as representing childhood needs, separating the struggles of childhood from those of adult life. Similar TYA groups were established in England, the US, France, and Czechoslovakia between World War I and World War II . TYA in the United States Education was the main purpose of TYA when it first arrived to the US. In 1903, Alice Minnie Herts founded The Children’s Educational Theatre, which was the first US company to produce theatrical work both with and for children. Although it did not last long, The Children’s Educational Theatre inspired both the birth of other companies around the country, as well as continuous growth in the writing and production of plays for younger audiences . The Drama League of America was another big influence in TYA within the US: children’s leagues were established in cities across the country, and material for younger audiences was both presented at these establishments and distributed to any interested groups. The Drama League was responsible for changing theatre for children from its originally purely educational intent into the broader Theatre for Young Audiences known today. Once the TYA movement started to gain traction, many different companies and playwrights chose to partake in this new branch of theatre. Some include early TYA playwright Constance Mackay, the Chicago company The Junior League, New York producer Clare Tree Major, The Children’s Theatre of Evanston, and many others. Today, TYA continues to thrive, with an increasing number of playwrights, performers, producers, and companies taking part in it. Types of Theatre for Young Audiences Most TYA productions in the US are plays, with a fast-growing number of musicals taking second place. However, most performing arts forms have been adapted and incorporated into Theatre for Young Audiences, including physical theatre, operas, puppetry, dance, street performance, and many others. Some companies specifically cater to non- traditional theatre forms, such as the MainStreet Theatre Company and the Center for Pupetry Arts, Atlanta. Several major companies performing Theatre for Young Audiences exist across the US, including but not limited to Minneapolis Children’s Theatre Company, Seattle Children’s Theatre, Lexington Children’s Theatre, Adventure State Chicago, and Boston Children’s Theatre, all producing work specifically for younger audiences throughout the year, offering performances both of new work and TYA classics . Techniques Most Theatre for Young Audiences plays are written by adult playwrights, although occasional projects are led and constructed by the younger audiences themselves. Different schools of thought within TYA argue whether or not younger characters should be portrayed by children or by adult actors. At the present, most TYA productions in children’s companies around the country count on casts of professional adult actors to portray all roles. For instance, the Arvada Center’s 2016 production of an adaptation of the novel Junie B. Jones was produced with adult actors, including Melissa Morris, Katie Jackson, and Rachelle Wood, portraying characters who are around the age of 12. A number children’s companies in the US have designated programs, in which the children engage with workshops and experimental rehearsals in order to create a TYA production with child actors. Those are rarely, however, part of the companies’ main stage season. Many Theatre for Young Audiences productions still revolve around traditional child-friendly topics, such as fairy tales and magical quests. A number of theatre companies, such as Seattle Children’s Theatre and the Minneapolis Children’s Theatre Company, have been working to create and produce plays and musicals for young audiences that are more intelligent and diverse. Recent work has explored themes that include parental abuse (e.g. An Afternoon of the Elves by Janet Taylor Lisle), divorce (e.g. Doors, by Suzan Zeder), death (e.g. Afflicted, by Laurie Brooks), and social barriers such as racism, xenophobia, and homophobia (e.g. The Transition of Doodle Pequeño, by Gabriel Jason Dean).

Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., vol.5, pp.340-2 of Groby in Leicestershire (a significant figure in the Second Barons' War between King Henry III and Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester), the younger son of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby, by his second wife Margaret de Quincy, daughter and heiress of Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester (c.1195-1264).G.

By 1295, Ferrers was abroad on royal service, and acting as Edward I's agent at the Duke of Brabant's court in Hainault. Although he was short of money at the time (having had to mortgage the Newbottle manor for £200), this did not prevent him taking part in the King's military campaign.Beardwood, A,. 'The Trial of Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield, 1307-1312' Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 54 (1964), 14. Other royal service included on the Scottish Marches under both King Edwards in their various campaigns there. In 1296, under the King's instruction, the Keeper of Scotland, John de Warenne restored Ferrers to his Scottish estates that the King still held. He fought at the Battle of Falkirk on 22 July 1298 and at the Siege of Caerlaverock two years later. Following the siege, the Keeper of Galloway also by order of King Edward, restored to Ferrers those estates in that region that the King had still held. In 1301 William Ferrers was signatory to the (eventually unsent) Barons' Letter of 1301 to Pope Boniface VIII, in which Ferrers and 95 other English barons and five English earls repudiated the Pope's claim to overlordship of the Kingdom of Scotland.and defended the aggressive policy of King Edward I.Cokayne, G.E., The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant V, eds V. Gibbs & H.A. Doubleday (2nd ed., London 1916), 343. The barony was created by writ on 29 December 1299, and William was summoned to parliament. Financial problems in the early fourteenth-century led him into conflict with his cousin John Ferrers which centred over a disputed claim to the Newbottle manor. The feud was periodically suspended when both parties fought alongside the King in Scotland, specifically when William was there again in 1303, 1306, 1308, and 1311. In 1317 Edward II appointed him Constable of Somerton Castle in Lincolnshire. His final summons to military service was on 1 May 1325. He was buried in the St Philip and St James Church, Hinckley and Bosworth Borough, Leicestershire.  Marriage  William Ferrers married to Ellen de Menteith, daughter of Alexander, Earl of Menteith. They had five children, his heir, Henry, four younger sons, and a daughter.

Early life Goodricke was the son of Sir Henry Goodricke, 4th Baronet of Ribston Hall and his wife Mary Jenkyns daughter of Tobias Jenkyns of Grimston and was born on 20 May 1708. In 1725, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He married Mary Benson, illegitimate daughter of Robert Benson, 1st Baron Bingley on 28 September 1731. He succeeded his father in the baronetcy on 21 July 1738. Diplomatic career Goodricke became a diplomat. He was resident at the court of Brussels in 1750 although he did not go there. In 1758 he was appointed minister to Sweden, but remained at Copenhagen until he was admitted to Sweden in April 1764, and was there as envoy from 1764 to 1773. He relinquished his Stockholm appointment in 1773 when he inherited a life interest in the Bramham Park estate from his wife's brother in law George Fox Lane. Political career In the 1774 general election Goodricke was returned as Member of Parliament for Pontefract but did not stand again in 1780. In a by-election in 1787 he was elected MP for Ripon which he held until his death in 1789. Fraud victim Shortly before his death, Goodricke was the victim of a fraudulent transaction at his bank Hoare's Bank. A young man tendered a Bill of Exchange signed “J Goodricke”. The clerk was suspicious, but the drawer was familiar and it was thought possible that Goodricke's signature may have been affected by gout. The bill was subsequently proved to be a forgery and in the meantime a couple had opened an account using the money at another bank. When a woman arrived at that bank with a draft on the new account she was detained and her partner was discovered by the Bow Street Runners in a waiting carriage. The young man was quickly brought before the Bow Street magistrate, but Goodricke was surprised to discover he was the son of one of his gardeners in Yorkshire for whom he had procured a post at India House and given a sum of money. The felon became insane and died in Newgate Prison while awaiting trial on 2 August 1789. Later life and legacy Goodricke died on 3 August 1789 the day after the felon who tried to cheat him. He had one son and two daughters. His son Henry was MP for Lymington, but predeceased him. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his grandson Henry.

Estimates of Högel's alleged victim count have increased since his first conviction. In 2017 a police investigation concluded that he was responsible for at least 90 deaths, and later that year German prosecutors stated there were at least 106 victims. In October 2018, Högel confessed to murdering 43 patients. By May 2019, he was believed to be the most prolific serial killer in peacetime Germany, with up to 300 victims over fifteen years. Background = Early life and education = Niels Högel was raised in the coastal town of Wilhelmshaven, Lower Saxony in northern Germany. Both a grandmother and his father worked as nurses, his father formerly being employed at the of Wilhelmshaven. His mother worked as a paralegal. He has an older sister. According to Högel, he had a sheltered or \\"protected\\" childhood and was not exposed to violence at home. On completing his vocational training in 1997 at the Sankt-Willehad-Hospital, Högel became a nurse and continued working there. = Employment at Klinikum Oldenburg = From 1999 onwards, he was employed at the \\"Klinikum Oldenburg\\", stationed in its cardiac surgery intensive care unit. In August 2001, doctors and medical orderlies of the hospital's ward 211 began discussing an unusual spike in both resuscitations and deaths during the preceding months. Högel himself attended the aforementioned meeting. Most of the attempted resuscitations and deaths were found to have occurred while Högel was on duty. Years later, after having been apprehended by authorities, Högel admitted to the police that, at the time of the meeting, he had thought he had been found out. After the meeting, he called in sick for the duration of three weeks. During that time, only two patients in ward 211 died, significantly fewer than had prior to his sick leave. Statistically, 58% of all deaths at the hospital occurred while Högel was on duty. Under pressure by the cardiac surgery's head physician, Högel was transferred to the anaesthesiology ward in 2001. The ward's head physician allegedly also became suspicious of him, as Högel was frequently present in emergency situations. In September 2002, the Oldenburg Clinic's head physician pressured Högel to resign from his position at the hospital, after multiple patients under Högel's care had been found in life-threatening condition, for, at the time, inexplicable reasons. It was suggested, he either resign and continue to receive full wages for another three months, or transfer to the hospital's logistics unit, where he would assist moving patients throughout the hospital.Such patient transportation services are usually jobs performed by assistant staff without a degree. On 10 October 2002, he received a reference letter, issued by the Oldenburg Clinic's Director of Nursing. Therein, she testifies to Högel's \\"circumspect, diligent and autonomous\\" work ethic, as well as to him having acted \\"prudently and in an objectively correct manner in critical situations\\". She also praises his \\"devotedness\\" and \\"cooperative conduct\\". The letter concludes with an overall assessment of Högel having completed assigned tasks \\"to the utmost satisfaction\\". = Employment at Klinikum Delmenhorst = In December 2002, Högel transferred to Klinikum Delmenhorst. Emergencies and fatalities occurred there, too, when Högel was on duty, mostly due to arrythmia or sudden decreases in blood pressure. This led to some of his coworkers distancing themselves from Högel. Off duty, Högel rode along in an ambulance, operated by the German Red Cross (DRK) station in Ganderkesee-Bookhorn. In later court proceedings, it was reported that Högel had initially been held in high regard in Delmenhorst, which changed when suspicions against him began to arise. His superiors allegedly did not act on these suspicions, even when four empty vials of Gilurytmal (Ajmaline) surfaced in Högel's ward, in spite of no doctor having prescribed any such medication at the time. = Marriage and birth of daughter = Högel married in 2004, the year of his daughter's birth.  Investigation and convictions 2006 and 2008  On 22 June 2005, colleagues caught Högel intentionally manipulating a patient's syringe pump, administering the anti- arrhythmic Gilurytmal (Ajmaline) without medical indication. The incident prompted the Delmenhorst police inspectorate to initiate an investigation into Högel. In the course of the investigation, multiple Klinikum Delmenhorst employees independently came forward to voice their concerns, suspecting Högel's possible responsibility for numerous complications, resuscitations and further unexplained deaths at the hospital. The extensive police investigation that followed these allegations examined all deaths at the hospital between 2003 and 2005. The investigation uncovered the number of deaths at Klinikum Delmenhorst had doubled during Högel's employment there. In 2005, 73% of deaths could be connected to Högel's working hours. In multiple statements and reports of investigation, these investigatory insights were subsequently officially communicated to the Oldenburg district attorney's office. In December 2006, adjudicating the 22 June 2005 incident, the Landgericht Oldenburg (German regional court) sentenced Högel to five years in prison and an employment ban of equal length for attempted voluntary manslaughter. A joint plaintiff appealed the verdict and a higher court subsequently reversed it. In June 2008 Högel was then given a seven and a half year prison sentence as well as a life-long employment ban.  2015 trial and confession  From January 2014 onward, the Oldenburg district attorney's office initiated another investigation into the incidents at Klinikum Delmenhorst. In September 2014 he was charged with three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. After confessing to the charges, Högel stated he had committed 30 additional murders. The patient's deaths were caused by Högel's administering 90 unauthorized injections. 60 patients were successfully resuscitated. On 28 February 2015, the Landgericht Oldenburg (German regional court) sentenced Högel to life in prison. The sentence became final in March 2015. Prosecutors claim Högel acted out of boredom and the desire to show off his resuscitation skills.  Further investigations  Amidst mounting suspicion that Högel may be responsible for further deaths, police launched a major investigation in October 2014, after which 200 suspicious deaths were identified. From November 2014 onward, the special commission \\"Kardio\\" examined further deaths during Högel's tenure as nurse at various places of employment. A total of 134 bodies in Germany, Poland and Turkey were exhumed and autopsied. During the three- year investigation, more than 200 cases were reevaluated. The 134 exhumed bodies were distributed across 67 different cemeteries. In many cases decomposition had progressed too far to be able to detect any traces of medication. 101 patients from Delmenhorst, who died during Högel's tenure, could not be autopsied, as their remains had been cremated. In 2015, suspected victims were exhumed in Ganderkesee and Delmenhorst. The bodies' autopsies revealed traces of heart medication. In November 2016, authorities said they were able to prove 37 homicides attributed to Högel in Delmenhorst between December 2002 and June 2005. According to an August 2017 statement by the director of the special commission \\"Kardio\\", the \\"provable Oldenburg and Delmenhorst homicides [...] were only the tip of the iceberg\\". As Högel had been sentenced to life in prison without eligibility for parole at the time, further court cases would not alter Högel's sentence, but either find him innocent or guilty of further charges. As capital punishment is constitutionally prohibited in Germany, Högel's prior conviction had already entailed the maximum punishment of life without parole. On 28 August 2017, police announced they had concluded that Högel was responsible for the deaths of at least 90 patients, including 6 for which he had already been convicted. Högel admitted to an undisclosed number of deaths but in most cases was unable to remember specific details, although he did not deny possibly being responsible. In November 2017, the total number of victims attributed to Högel was revised and increased to 106, with some suspicious deaths still under investigation. In January 2018, German prosecutors charged Högel with the murder of 97 patients and announced their intention to file charges against other hospital staff who failed to act. Prosecutors again claimed Högel wanted to impress colleagues by reviving the patients he had previously attacked. On 28 August 2017, police said that Högel had used five different drugs, including ajmaline, sotalol, lidocaine, amiodarone and calcium chloride. Overdoses can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia and a drop in blood pressure, causing rapid physiological deterioration in patients already ill. On 7 March 2018, the Oldenburg labour court sentenced Högel to a compensatory payment of 47,000 Euro, for two medical opinions and various lawyers' fees.  2018-2019 trial, life sentence and appeal  In January 2018, the Oldenburg state's attorney's office pressed charges against Högel, accusing him of having murdered 100 patients between 7 February 2000 and 24 June 2005 (four separate charges that were jointly tried). The deceased were aged between 34 and 96 years. The indictment stated that, in his position as a nurse, Högel had killed patients by administering the following substances or medication without medical indication: Potassium, Gilurytmal (Ajmaline), Sotalex (Sotalol), Xylocain (Lidocaine) and Cordarex (Amiodarone). The main trial at Landgericht Oldenburg commenced on 30 October 2018. Due to the high number of people involved in the trial (there were 120 joint plaintiffs), it was held in the Weser-Ems-Hallen ballrooms. The 2018-2019 court proceedings spanned a total of 24 days of trial. Out of the 100 murder charges, Högel confessed to 43 on the first day of trial, stated he could not recall 52 and denied his involvement in the five remaining deaths. = Witness and expert testimonies = Out of the 32 witnesses present at the trial, eight testified under oath. Three testimonies were heard in camera. Four medical experts presented the court with detailed information on the courses of the patients' diseases as well as the effects of the medication administered by Högel. Prof. Staller, a forensic expert in testimony psychology, examined the truthfulness of Högel's testimony. He concluded that Högel, although in principle both capable and willing to lie or provide false testimony, had provided the court with truthful confessions. Staller saw no indications for a false confession. = End of evidentiary hearing and final charges = The state's attorney's office moved for convictions in 97 and acquittals in three cases. The defense saw the state of evidence to be too insufficient to convict in far more instances and moved for acquittals in 31, murder convictions in 55 and attempted murder convictions in 14 cases. = Sentencing and appeal = On 6 June 2019, the court in Oldenburg sentenced Högel to life imprisonment. Taking prior convictions into account, the court determined Högel's \\"severe gravity of guilt\\", a German legal term which significantly increases the respective sentence's severity and precludes a chance of early release after serving 15 years. He was found guilty on 85 separate murder charges and not guilty on 15 further murder charges. Högel and a joint plaintiff appealed the verdict. It became final on 11 September 2020 when the Federal Court of Justice dismissed both appeals. = Media and public access = A total of 80 seats were provided to media representatives and an additional 118 seats for the general public. Contrary to prior trials under high public and media attention, public interest did not decline, but rose as the trial progressed. On the first day of trial, numerous seats had remained empty. The number of attendees increased significantly throughout the trial, peaking at approximately 190 spectators and 25 media representatives. = Prospective further trials = The court decided that a further, currently pending, indictment against four Klinikum Delmenhorst employees will be tried once Högel's verdict is final. Only then would he be obligated to testify at the trial against the Klinikum Delmenhorst employees, as he currently still has the right to refuse testimony and has stated he wishes to exert that right.  Aftermath, criticism and legislative changes  = Scrutinizing investigatory vigour = Following Högel's conviction in April 2015, the Oldenburg state's attorney's office pressed obstruction of justice charges against a former Oldenburg chief prosecutor. He had allegedly not acted on conclusive evidence incriminating Högel, thereby protracting investigations. The district court dismissed the case. The Oldenburg state's attorney's office's official objection to the court's decision to dismiss was subsequently finally dismissed by the Oberlandesgericht Oldenburg at a higher judicial level. = Affected clinics react = After the 2015 sentence became valid, both the Delmenhorst Clinic (now Josef-Hospital Delmenhorst) and the Oldenburg Clinic stated their intention to compensate the victims' relatives. In July 2015, both clinics announced their plans of being the first clinics in Germany to introduce a process termed 'qualified necropsy', involving an additional coroner. The introduction of this two-man-rule aims at preventing unnatural causes of death owing to criminal actions going unnoticed.

He was known for creating plans that incorporated existing natural features in order to preserve a sense of local character. He worked on master plans for the development of neighborhoods in San Francisco and the East Bay, on the Monterey Peninsula, in Los Angeles, and elsewhere. In the years immediately preceding the formation of the National Park System, he was briefly the general superintendent and landscape engineer for the entire system of national parks. Education and family Daniels was born in Spring Arbor, Michigan. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, graduating with a B.S. degree in civil engineering in 1905. He went on to do graduate work in city planning and architecture at Harvard University. Daniels was married four times. His first wife, Frances “Dolly” Trost (1888–1941) was a singer and artist. He served as an army captain during World War I. Master planning Daniels began his career as a civil engineer, working in a range of positions from placer mine superintendent to railroad engineer. He eventually opened an office in San Francisco, and in 1908 East Bay real estate developer John Hopkins Spring became his first important landscape design client. Spring had acquired 100 acres in the largely undeveloped Thousand Oaks area of Berkeley and proposed to turn it into a residential area with a small park. Daniels planned the entire subdivision, deliberately working around existing natural features, especially major rock outcroppings. Daniels also landscaped Spring's own estate in the East Bay, now a designated City of Berkeley Landmark. Daniels also developed the master plans for the Forest Hill and Sea Cliff neighborhoods of San Francisco. Elsewhere in California, Daniels was involved with master planning on the Monterey Peninsula, especially Pebble Beach and the 17-Mile Drive; the designer Chesley Bonestell worked as his assistant on these designs. He moved to Los Angeles, where he designed the Villa Aurora and worked on the master plan for Bel Air. In the 1920s, Daniels expanded into architecture as well as landscape design and city planning. He was a great admirer of Chinese architecture and landscape design, and when he moved back to San Francisco, the projects he worked on included the Chinese Village at the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939–40 and a public housing project in Chinatown. =Major projects= * 17-Mile Drive on the Monterey Peninsula (ca. 1916) * Bel Air, Los Angeles * Chinese Village at Golden Gate International Exposition (1939–40) * Crocker-Amazon, San Francisco * Forest Hill, San Francisco (ca. 1912) * John Hopkins Spring Estate, Kensington (1912–14) * Pebble Beach, California (ca. 1916) * Ping Yuen public housing project, Chinatown (1939–42) * Sea Cliff, San Francisco (ca. 1914) * St. Mary's Park, San Francisco (1920s) * Thousand Oaks, Berkeley, California * Villa Aurora, Pacific Palisades (1927–28) Park superintendent In 1914, Daniels took up the post of landscape engineer for Yosemite National Park, where the existing buildings were in poor condition and there were issues with sanitation and water supply. He was tasked with developing a \\"comprehensive general plan for the development of the floor of the Yosemite Valley\\". Two months later, he was appointed general superintendent and landscape engineer of all the national parks. He spent the summers of 1914 and 1915 touring parks in the system to understand their problems but kept his private practice going during the winters. It proved an impossible job, not solely because he was working at it part-time, but because, as he himself pointed out, \\"it is not humanly possible\\" for one man to combine the very different duties of general superintendent and landscape engineer for the national parks. These difficulties were exacerbated by struggles with other administrators over centralization of planning, with the result that Daniels was pushed to resign after only a year and a half. During his brief tenure, he designed the first uniforms for civilian park rangers and (in 1915) offered the first comprehensive statement of principles for the establishment and management of national parks. In addition, foreseeing a major expansion of visitors to national parks, he drew up plans for \\"park villages\\" in such high-profile parks as Yosemite, Glacier National Park, and Mount Rainier National Park. None of these were carried out in their original form — though elements were incorporated into later plans — but as in all his other design work, Daniels stressed the importance of taking the local topography and environment into account so as to create visual congruity with the surrounding landscape. Photo of the Kern River near Funston Meadows in Sequoia National Park by Mark Daniels, 1916. Writing After leaving his position as park superintendent, Daniels continued to promote the national parks through a long series of articles in American Forestry magazine. Many of his glowing accounts of specific parks were illustrated with his own photographs and drawings. =Selected publications= * \\"The Tree of Legend and Romance\\" (American Forestry, February 1916) * \\"Mesa Verde and Casa Grande National Parks\\" (American Forestry, February 1916) * \\"The Grand Canyon of the Colorado\\" (American Forestry, April 1916) * \\"Yosemite National Park\\" (American Forestry, June 1916) * \\"Glacier National Park\\" (American Forestry, July 1916) * \\"Yellowstone National Park\\" (American Forestry, August 1916) * \\"Mount Rainier National Park\\" (American Forestry, September 1916) * \\"Crater Lake National Park\\" (American Forestry, October 1916) * \\"The Peak of Mount Russell\\" (American Forestry, November 1916) * \\"Across the High Sierras\\" (American Forestry, November 1916) * \\"Rocky Mountain National Park\\" (American Forestry, December 1916) References External links * Finding Aid for the Ernest Mitchell Pratt Photographs of Mark Daniels' Architecture, ca. 1915-1929 * American Forestry issues from 1916 with Mark Daniels' articles Category:1881 births Category:1952 deaths Category:American landscape architects Category:Architects from California Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Harvard Graduate School of Design alumni Category:National park administrators Category:American civil engineers ","title":"Mark Daniels"},{"id":"55060782","text":"Gurcharan Das Mehta, also known as Param Guru Mehta Ji Maharaj, was the sixth Revered Sant SatguruMark Juergensmeyer, 1995, eality: The Logic of a Modern Faith Page 51. of the Radhasoami Satsang Dayalbagh.
