She is known for her correspondence with her spouse, Lieutenant Colonel Jon St√•lhammar, during his absence in the Great Northern War, and as the Frun p√• Salshult (The lady of Salshult) in the 1886 poem by Carl Snoilsky of the same name. Life Sofia Drake was born to Colonel Johan Christersson Drake of Torp and Hamra and Margareta Klingspor. She married Lieutenant Colonel Jon St√•lhammar (1659-1708) in 1689, and became the mother of seven children. As was the custom in Sweden until the late 18th- century, she kept her birth name after marriage. Their families both belonged to the lesser nobility, but were well off. In 1700, her spouse was called away to serve in the Great Northern War: except for a brief meeting in 1702, they were never to see each other again. Their correspondence is famous in Swedish history. Judging from their correspondence, their marriage did not seem to be an arranged marriage of the time. On one occasion, her spouse assures her that he is faithful, apparently after she had expressed concern for it. During the absence of her husband, Drake was given the responsibility of the family affairs, children and household and the estate Salshult. She is described as a respected, forceful and effective business person, who did not only managed the estate successfully, but also expanded it. She continued in this role after having been widowed in 1708: her eldest son died in war service in 1711, when her remaining son was not yet an adult. In 1726, Sofia Drake, as a family matriarch, gave refuge to her niece Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar, who asked for her help after she was exposed as a woman while serving in the Army. She had also married a woman posing as a man, which was a serious crime in contemporary law. Drake arranged for St√•lhammar to be sent to her son's widowed mother-in-law in V√§rmland, to adjust to wearing women's clothes and then apply for leniency.Larsson, Olle, Stormaktens sista krig: Sverige och stora nordiska kriget 1700-1721, Historiska media, Lund, 2009 Drake made a \\"powerful intervention\\" on her behalf, which is estimated to have contributed to her light sentence in 1729, after which Drake gave Maria L√∂nman, the wife of St√•lhammar, employment as a housekeeper at Salshult, and Ulrika Eleonora herself sent back to V√§rmland.Harrison, Dick, Jourhavande historiker, Norstedt, Stockholm, 2013 Her eldest son and heir Otto Fredrik St√•lhammar settled with his family at Salshult in 1732, by which time she would have renounced the management of the estate to him. She had her own household on Salshult, but in 1738, the management of her affairs were taken over by her children, possibly because of her declining health.

Its members were Senators Ra√∫l Ampuero and Tom√°s Chadwick Vald√©s with Deputies Ram√≥n Silva Ulloa, Eduardo Osorio Pardo, √ìscar Naranjo, Andr√©s Aravena and Ernesto Guajardo. The parliamentary elections of 1969 elected Senator Silva Ulloa Tarapaca and Antofagasta. It supported the candidacy of Salvador Allende in the presidential election of 1970, but did not join the Popular Unity, although they supported it. Once elected Tarapaca did not assume government positions, but participated in social fronts. Following the coup d'√©tat of September 11, 1973 decided to dissolve in exile. Many of its former militants then worked for the unity of Socialist Party. It was rebuilt in 1983, with Silva Ulloa as Secretary General, participating in the Democratic Alliance and later becoming one of the founders of Concertaci√≥n.

Like his predecessors Jazzar Pasha and Sulayman Pasha, Abdullah Pasha ruled from the port city of Acre. During his reign, all of Palestine and the Syrian coastline came under his jurisdiction. Among his major military victories was his survival of an imperial-backed siege of Acre in 1822 instigated by the Farhi family in retaliation for Abdullah's execution of his mentor Haim Farhi, the suppression of revolts in Mount Lebanon and Jerusalem in 1824 and 1826, respectively, and the 1831 capture of the Sanur fortress. While Abdullah oversaw a period of relative stability in Syria, during his reign the region also experienced economic reversals and increasing poverty, while Acre's key role as an export center of Levantine cotton and olive oil increasingly diminished. Abdullah was the last governor of Sidon to rule from Acre and his defeat to the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1832 marked the end of Acre as a political and economic power. Following his defeat, he lived in exile in Egypt and then the Hejaz, where he died. Early life and career Abdullah Bey (as he was known before becoming governor) was born in Acre in 1801 to Ali Pasha Khazindar, a Circassian Muslim mamluk of Jazzar Pasha (r. 1776‚Äì1804) and later the katkhuda (deputy) of Sulayman Pasha al-Adil (1805‚Äì1819). Abdullah's mother was from the coastal city of Jableh and belonged to a family of ashraf (descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad). Ali Pasha died in 1814, but while on his deathbed he asked Haim Farhi, Sulayman's chief adviser, to look after Abdullah, then 13. Farhi gladly accepted the responsibility and from then on lobbied for Abdullah to succeed Sulayman, who had no male heirs. Abdullah's mother also played a role in lobbying both Farhi and Sulayman to elevate her son. Farhi sought to groom Abdullah for leadership and had him educated in Islamic law. According to Druze sheikh Bashir Jumblatt, Farhi \\"turned him over for his education to the fanatical shaykhs\\" and Abdullah \\"turned out more fanatical than they\\".Mishaqah, 1988, p. 125. Farhi, who contemporaries described as Sulayman's unofficial \\"partner in power\\", did not view young Abdullah as a threat to his influence and sought to promote him over more powerful potential successors to Sulayman such as the latter's nephew Mustafa Bey or Muhammad Abu-Nabbut of Jaffa.Philipp, 2013, p. 86. Sulayman looked favorably to Abdullah's potential succession and appointed him katkhuda in his father's place, an appointment which surprised many in Sulayman's administration due to Abdullah's young age. Nonetheless, Sulayman sought to publicly downplay Abdullah's political rise by imposing certain rules on him. Among these were that Abdullah was to sit among government employees and administrators instead of having his own office like Ali Pasha had. He was forbidden from eating or drinking coffee with Sulayman and his hand was not to be kissed by anyone. Rule =Appointment= The residence of Abdullah Pasha in Acre, 2006 Sulayman died in August 1819. The principal domestic obstacle to Abdullah's succession had been the original mamluks of Jazzar Pasha, chief among them Abu-Nabbut. However, under Farhi's direction, Abu-Nabbut was ousted from Jaffa in 1818.Philipp, 2013, p. 88. According to historian Mikhail Mishaqah, \\"those who had loved Sulayman\\" beckoned Farhi to lobby the Sublime Porte (imperial Ottoman government) to appoint Mustafa Bey as successor, but Farhi retorted that Abdullah \\"was born in this country and we took great pains to teach him Arabic, nice handwriting and the legal sciences\\" and that as katkhuda he gained \\"experience in governing\\" and it would not be \\"right to promote over him someone whose Arabic is weak and who neither knows the legal system nor has experience in governing.\\"Mishaqah, 1988, p. 105. Through his Constantinople-based contact Hesekiel al-Baghdadi, a fellow Jew and a banker with close ties to the powerful Jannisary corps, Farhi lobbied the Sublime Porte for five months before it agreed to appoint Abdullah Pasha as Wali of Sidon and assign him the rank of vizier. Bribes to various imperial officials and influential figures in Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, amounted to about 11 million piastres. On 27 January 1820, Abdullah was confirmed as governor of Sidon. In the interim period, Emir Bashir Shihab II of Mount Lebanon maintained order throughout the province. The jurisdiction of the Sidon Eyalet at the time of Abdullah Pasha's appointment included the districts of Sidon, Tripoli, Latakia, Gaza, Ramla and Jaffa (essentially the Galilee, the coastal areas of Syria and Mount Lebanon.Philipp, 2013, p. 90. People in the province welcomed Abdullah's succession because of the perception that he would follow Sulayman's model, which had been generally positive for both the inhabitants and local leaders.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 106. =Tensions with Farhi= Abdullah continued to maintain his trustful relationship with Farhi, to the point where he stored the treasury in Farhi's home. Farhi continued to wield great influence over Acre-based administration. According to Mishaqah, Abdullah often spent his time with local, lower-class Muslims and joined them in dhikr sessions (Sufi ritual of remembrance involving dancing). Farhi disapproved of Abdullah's behavior and advised him to instead participate in dhikrs with men of higher social rank, such as the qadi, the mufti, the naqib al-ashraf or members of the ulema. Abdullah ignored Farhi's advice and informed his friends of Farhi's statements. His friends included Sheikh Mas'ud al-Madi, the Arab mutasallim (tax enforcer) of the Atlit coast who had a sour relationship with Farhi, Sheikh Mustafa, Abdullah's personal imam, Muhammad Effendi Abu al-Huda, Acre's newly appointed qadi.Philipp, 2013, p. 89. They feared Farhi could displace them from their new-found positions of influence with the governor. According to Mishaqah, They accused Farhi of being an \\"arrogant Jew\\" who manipulated his way into power, controlled the province's wealth from his own home, and questioned how a Jew could be allowed to govern in the interests of Muslims. Moreover, they told Abdullah that Sulayman could be forgiven for allowing Farhi to become influential because Sulayman was not versed in Islamic law, but that Abdullah did not have that excuse, claiming that the imams of Islam's four main schools of jurisprudence forbade a Jew from holding office in charge of Muslims. Abdullah Pasha adhered to the concerns of his newly formed inner circle and subsequently ordered Farhi to move the treasury into Acre's government house, which Farhi did. He then dismissed Farhi as chief scribe and appointed Yusuf Qardahi, a Maronite from Sidon, in his place.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 107. After these demotions, Farhi requested to retire to Damascus, but Abdullah did not allow it, viewing Farhi's presence in Damascus as a potential threat to his rule. Al-Madi and Umar Effendi al-Baghdadi, a local official, convinced Abdullah that as long as Farhi was alive he would pose a threat to Abdullah's rule through the same influential Jewish contacts with the Sublime Porte that got Abdullah appointed in the first place. According to the French consul in Acre, Abdullah and Farhi entered into a scathing argument in which Farhi reminded Abdullah that he was the reason Abdullah was appointed governor. According to historian Thomas Philipp, the argument was \\"the final straw\\" which pushed Abdullah to have Farhi executed. On that same night, 8 August 1820, Abdullah ordered his brother-in-law Ibrahim Bey al-Jarkasi and a few of his soldiers to kill Farhi. Al-Jarkasi's men entered Farhi's home, strangled him to death and threw his body into the Mediterranean Sea. According to Mishaqah, Farhi's death was mourned by \\"all intelligent people in the province, regardless of their religion\\", as they viewed him to be \\"a wise administrator\\". Qardahi, another non-Muslim, assumed Farhi's duties, after Musa Farhi refused Abdullah's offer of succeeding his brother. According to Philipp, this confirmed that Farhi's elimination was the result of a power struggle rather than religious reasons. =Relations with Emir Bashir= Portrait of Emir Bashir Shihab II. Abdullah Pasha entered into a long-time alliance with Emir Bashir. Early in his rule, Abdullah made frequent demands from Emir Bashir II to pay tribute in the form of cash, jewelry or horses, to which Bashir II initially complied. However, within a short time Bashir II became either unable or unwilling to make the payments. In order to maintain cordial and stable relations with Acre, Bashir II dispatched one of his Melkite advisers, Butrus Karami, to smooth over ties with Abdullah, who was suspicious of Bashir's loyalties i.e. whether he was a Muslim or a Christian.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 108. Abdullah ultimately deposed Bashir for his failure to pay tribute and the latter exiled himself to the Hauran region south of Damascus. Two other, apparently Muslim, emirs from the Shihab dynasty, Emir Hasan ibn Ali and Emir Salman ibn Sayyid-Ahmad, were appointed to replace Bashir II in Mount Lebanon, although Abdullah detached the areas of Tuffah, Kharrub, Jezzine, Byblos and Jabal al-Rihan from the latter.Mishaqah, 1988, pp. 111‚Äì112. Bashir's successors proved less capable of paying tribute than Bashir. From the Hauran, Emir Bashir issued a request to Abdullah for intervention or assistance regarding a payment of 5,000 piastres imposed on him by the Ottoman governor of Damascus, Darwish Pasha.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 124. Abdullah responded favorably, writing that Bashir \\"will not see from me other than what will gladden him\\" and summoned him to Shefa-'Amr, a village in Acre's vicinity. Soon after, Abdullah restored the Mount Lebanon Emirate, including the detached areas (except for Byblos), to Bashir.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 126. The two formed a military alliance in 1821 against Darwish Pasha.Harris, 2012, p. 135.. =Conflict with Damascus= In retaliation against Farhi's execution, influential members of the Farhi family in Damascus and Istanbul, instigated the Ottoman authorities against Abdullah Pasha. In early 1822, armed confrontations between the forces of the Damascus Eyalet under governor Darwish Pasha and Abdullah's forces over territorial claims in the Golan Heights, Nablus and the Beqaa Valley occurred frequently. Darwish Pasha's actions were being instigated by the Farhi family and Abdullah sought support from Emir Bashir, writing to him that \\"the Jews have conspired with the Empire against him\\" and that the imperial authorities were attempting to dismiss Abdullah from the governorship of Sidon, which would then be annexed by Damascus Eyalet.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 131. Emir Bashir answered his summons to Acre, where Abdullah's mother told him \\"My son is your lord by virtue of his rank, but in view of age and your efforts on his behalf you are his son\\" and proceeded to concede that Abdullah had acted rashly with Bashir in the past and that he erred in having Farhi killed. Bashir replied that he would continue to serve Abdullah and fight in his service.Mishaqah, 1988, pp. 132‚Äì133. After meeting with Abdullah, the latter asked Bashir to mobilize his forces and meet Abdullah's troops at the Daughters of Jacob Bridge. From there, the coalition was to move against Darwish Pasha in Damascus. Emir Bashir and his allies mustered some 12,000 fighting men, while Abdullah's forces numbered 4,000 under the command of Ibrahim Agha al-Kurdi. Darwish Pasha's troops, backed by the Druze Yazbaki faction and Emir Mansur Shihab II assembled at Mezzeh outside of Damascus, where the two sides confronted each other in May 1822. Darwish Pasha's cannons in Mezzeh gave him an initial advantage over Abdullah's coalition,Mishaqah, 1988, p. 133. but once the latter's cavalry charged against the town, the battle turned into a rout for Darwish's men, 1,200 of whom were killed. Forty soldiers from Abdullah's coalition died in the battle.Dixon and Sarkees, p. 2013. Abdullah's forces besieged Damascus, but did not enter it, preferring to use the siege to leverage support from Mustafa Pasha, the governor of Aleppo. Abdullah had been previously warned that Mustafa Pasha and Bahram Pasha of Adana were given orders to support Darwish Pasha. As a result of the Farhis of Istanbul mobilizing support for Darwish Pasha, the Sublime Porte issued orders for Mustafa Pasha to reinforce Darwish, and a firman branding Abdullah as a rebel and dismissing him from the governorship of Sidon, which was then transferred to Darwish Pasha's jurisdiction. Emir Bashir, seeking to avoid the quandary of being disloyal towards Abdullah or defying Ottoman imperial orders, fled Syria for Egypt which was governed by the powerful Muhammad Ali.Philipp, 2013, p. 91. The siege of Damascus was consequently lifted and Abdullah's forces retreated to Acre to reinforce his hold over the city. Abdullah sought intervention on his behalf by Muhammad Ali, who had been supporting the Ottomans against Greek rebels in Morea. Darwish Pasha, sought to gain actual control of Sidon Eyalet before Abdullah and Emir Bashir could regroup, and besieged Acre in July 1822. Mustafa Pasha and Bahram Pasha backed the siege with their forces. Abdullah's forces numbered around 2,000, consisting of his personal guard, a number of professional soldiers, and Arab and Turkish irregulars.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 137. The siege was supported financially by Salamun Farhi of Damascus, who was present in Darwish Pasha's camp outside of Acre. After five months of no tangible results from the siege, Darwish Pasha was dismissed from the governorship of Sidon and replaced by Mustafa Pasha. =Restoration to the governorship= In April 1823, Muhammad Ali successfully intervened to have Abdullah pardoned and restored to the governorship and the siege was lifted. Mustafa Pasha was dismissed and ordered back to Aleppo. Both Abdullah and Mustafa Pasha accused the Farhi family of being the main party responsible for the war against Abdullah, with Mustafa Pasha producing documents to back his allegations. Coinciding with these accusations, the Ottoman authorities under Sultan Mahmud II's direction, began a process to reduce and ultimately destroy the Janissary corps, an influential military group that the Farhis and their associates had developed strong ties with. Salamun Farhi died sometime during the siege, while Hesekiel al-Baghdadi and his brother Ezra were executed in May 1823. The restoration of Abdullah to the governorship represented not only a success for Muhammad Ali, but also a shift in the sultanate's policy toward some Jewish financiers in the empire.Philipp, 2013, pp. 91‚Äì92. The Sublime Porte issued a demand for Abdullah to pay a fine of 25,000 purses to compensate for the expenses of the siege, and detached the districts of Tripoli, Latakia, Gaza and Jaffa from Sidon Eyalet until Abdullah made the payment. Abdullah had exhausted his financial resources during the siege and decided to impose the entire fine on Sheikh Bashir Jumblatt of the Shuf in Mount Lebanon as a punitive measure for defecting from Abdullah's coalition during Darwish Pasha's campaign. Emir Bashir intervened so that Sheikh Bashir would only pay a third of the fine, while Emir Bashir and his subjects would make up the remainder.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 142. In 1824, the Sublime Porte restored the districts of Gaza and Jaffa to Abdullah's jurisdiction. Although Abdullah had been restored to power, Acre's former political, military and economic dominance in Syria had been significantly reduced, with Emir Bashir of Mount Lebanon emerging as a major power in his own right and Muhammad Ali of Egypt carving out an influential role in the region's politics. Acre, nonetheless, maintained its superiority over the other administrative centers of Syria. In 1824, Sheikh Jumblatt launched a revolt against Abdullah from his headquarters at Mukhtara in Shuf. Abdullah and Emir Bashir mobilized against him. After three battles in the Shuf, the last one being a counterattack by Jumblatt in 1825 and involving the entire forces of each side,Johnson, 2001, p. 90. Jumblatt fled the area. He was pursued, arrested and sent to Abdullah Pasha in Acre. Abdullah ordered Jumblatt's execution and the latter was strangled in his jail cell. The elimination of Jumblatt, who had grown wealthier and more influential than Emir Bashir, further strengthened Emir Bashir's control in Mount Lebanon. In 1826, Abdullah was commissioned by the Sublime Porte to suppress a revolt in Jerusalem, which began in 1825, and bring order to the city. At the time, Jerusalem was outside of Abdullah's jurisdiction, being part of Damascus Eyalet, but the governor of Damascus, Mustafa Pasha, was unable to quell the rebellion. The rebels had ousted Jerusalem's mutasallim and controlled the city. Abdullah managed to restore the government's authority in Jerusalem with little blood being shed. During the period in which Tripoli and its dependencies were detached from Sidon Eyalet, Abdullah Pasha continued to wield influence in its affairs. The district was governed by Sulayman Bey al- Azm, but when the latter departed to guard the Hajj caravan in 1824, a revolt occurred in the city against the district's caretaker governor, Husayn Bey al- Azm. It was led by partisans of Tripoli's former mutasallim, Mustafa Agha Barbar. Abdullah intervened and demanded that Barbar, who was then based in Beirut, cease inciting his partisans, to which Barbar complied. Sulayman died in Tripoli shortly after returning from the Hajj. He was replaced by Ali Agha al-As'ad of Akkar, a loyalist of Abdullah. In 1827, the Sublime Porte restored Tripoli to Abdullah's jurisdiction because the authorities believed Abdullah could restore stability in the unruly district. Abdullah subsequently replaced Ali Agha with Barbar.Douwes, 2000, pp. 120‚Äì122. =Siege of Sanur= In October 1830, the Sublime Porte assigned the districts of Jerusalem, Nablus and Hebron to Abdullah Pasha's jurisdiction. The districts were traditionally part of Damascus Eyalet, but the latter's governor, Mehmed Pasha, had been unable to collect the miri (annual tax designated for the Hajj pilgrimage caravan) from them. The Ottomans also feared an imminent invasion of Syria by Muhammad Ali and viewed Acre, however weakened, as the sole power center that could confront such an invasion. Thus, the imperial authorities sought to strengthen Abdullah's political position. Abdullah's authority over Jabal Nablus, a mountainous region whose rural sheikhs had ruled with virtual autonomy from Damascus, put him into confrontation with the Jarrar clan, the most powerful rural family of the district. The Jarrar sheikhs rejected Abdullah's authority over their affairs. From their fortress in Sanur, the Jarrar clan had successfully resisted sieges by Abdullah's predecessors Zahir al-Umar and Jazzar Pasha, as well as from various governors of Damascus. Abdullah believed that by defeating the Jarrars and capturing their fortress, he would be considered \\"next to that of the greatest commanders of the world\\", according to the French consul in Beirut. Abdullah's forces, backed by Emir Bashir, besieged Sanur in December 1830. After three months of stiff resistance, the fortress fell in March 1831 and Sanur's defenders surrendered, or fled. The siege was financially costly for Abdullah in terms of ammunition and artillery shells.Finn, Palestine Exploration Fund, p. 123. Abdullah proceeded to have the fortress destroyed. After his victory, Abdullah opted to reconcile with the sheikhs of Jabal Nablus because an impending invasion of Syria by Muhammad Ali had become apparent.Mattar, p. 344. =Fall= Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt led the 1831‚Äì32 siege against Abdullah in Acre, which led to his surrender and exile from the city. In November 1831, Muhammad Ali, who had long demanded control of Syria as compensation for his assistance to the Ottomans in their war with the Greeks, launched an invasion of Syria under the command of his son Ibrahim Pasha.Petry, p. 165. As a public justification of his conquest of Sidon, Muhammad Ali alleged that Abdullah was harboring 6,000 Egyptian fellahin who were dodging conscription, corvee or taxes.Yazbak, 1998, p. 18. Ibrahim Pasha's troops faced no resistance as they entered Palestine, easily taking Gaza and Jaffa. Abdullah Pasha rushed to have Acre's defenses prepared. Meanwhile, Husayn Abd al-Hadi of Arraba, a prominent sheikh of Jabal Nablus, was advised by Emir Bashir to not resist Ibrahim Pasha's troops.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 166. When Ibrahim landed in Syria, Emir Bashir defected from his alliance with Abdullah and backed Ibrahim Pasha, and Abdullah accused Bashir of being \\"a treacherous and ungrateful infidel\\".Makdisi, p. 46. The siege of Acre began in December 1831 after Ibrahim's army captured the nearby port town of Haifa, where Abdullah maintained a summer residence. Ibrahim's forces, backed by Emir Bashir's men, bombarded Acre for several months, inflicting a significant toll on Abdullah's forces. On 29 May 1832, Ibrahim Pasha rallied his troops and intensified the artillery barrage on Acre's walls from all sides. The exterior wall was breached during a charge by Egyptian and Maronite cavalry who then engaged the city's defenders.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 169. Abdullah had been seeking safety with his family in a bunker in the city, but when he realized that the exterior walls were breached and that his remaining defenders amounted to no more than 350 men, he conceded defeat and opened Acre's gates. Ibrahim Pasha's army subsequently plundered the city, but Abdullah was treated with respect. After his surrender, Abdullah was sent to Egypt where he was warmly welcomed by his erstwhile ally Muhammad Ali. The latter issued Abdullah the monthly pension that he was officially entitled to as a vizier. Abdullah remained in Egypt for a period of time, but eventually requested that he be allowed to retire to the Hejaz, a request which Muhammad Ali granted. Abdullah died in the Hejaz. His defeat in Acre marked the end of that city's semi-autonomy within the empire and its political influence in the region. Politics Abdullah rid his administration of nearly all of Sulayman Pasha's confidants because he viewed them as potential threats to his rule. The main threats he perceived were Farhi, who he had killed early in his rule, and the older mamluks who had formed part of Sulayman's trusted retinue. He replaced most of the latter, particularly those who had been close to Muhammad Abu-Nabbut, with younger mamluks. They were give pensions as part of their dismissals from mutasallim posts throughout Sidon Eyalet. An example of Abdullah's tendency to rely on young administrators was the replacement of Nazreth's mutasallim with the 17-year-old Salim Agha. By the end of Abdullah's rule, none of his military commanders were mamluks.Winter, pp. 335‚Äì336. Not much is known about Abdullah's military forces. However, it is known that they generally consisted of Arab Hawwara irregulars, Kurdish Dalat cavalry irregulars and Maghrebi mercenaries. By the time of Acre's 1831‚Äì32 siege, Husayn Agha and Hamadi Agha were the commanders of the Hawwara, Shamdin Agha (a sole leftover of Sulayman's administration) was commander of the Dalat cavalry, and Ali Agha Farahat was the commander of the Maghrebi mercenaries. The general estimate of Abdullah's troop numbers was about 2,000 fighting men, although at times the number could have been higher. For instance, in 1824 his standing army consisted of 3,000 men, mostly Hawwara irregulars, as well as Dalat, Maghrebi and Albanian units. Abdullah often relied on the military support of the Druze clans and Emir Bashir's forces from Mount Lebanon and possibly the Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. Abdullah's expenditures were paid directly from Acre's treasury.Philipp, p. 221. In order to make up for declining revenues, Abdullah reversed the free market trend set under Sulayman Pasha by extending Acre's monopoly on Syria's cotton exports to imports coming into Acre as well. These policies resulted in Acre being bypassed by merchants and traders, with cotton from Nablus being shipped to Beirut instead. The French consul also relocated to Beirut, which was prospering at Acre's expense.Philipp, 2013, pp. 92‚Äì93. In a report, the French consul wrote that Abdullah \\"governs as if politics advised him to surround himself with ruins, to the point that all the country under his control presents a picture of isolation and poverty.\\"Philipp, 2013, p. 93. Translations from French on p. 268. According to Philipp, \\"only the instability of politics in Damascus ... and the preoccupation of the Ottomans with internal reforms and the Greek war disguised the weakness of Abdallah Pasha's regime\\".

Early life Laughlin was born on September 10, 1910 in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania. He earned a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws degree from The Catholic University of America. FBI career Laughlin joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation on December 2, 1935. He was recommended for the job by U.S. Senator Joseph F. Guffey and U.S. Representative James H. Gildea. His first assignment was as a special agent in the Boston field office. In 1937 he transferred to the New York office. On January 9, 1938 he was designated the Number One Man of the Newark office. That May he had an argument with a special agent and this, along with a personality clash with the office's special agent in charge, resulted in a transfer back to New York. When the SAC from Newark transferred to New York in the fall of 1938, Laughlin relocated to the Cincinnati office. In 1940, Laughlin was promoted to supervisor in the investigative division. The following year he moved to the security division, where he worked in the espionage section. In 1944, Laughlin was transferred to the St. Paul field office and promoted to assistant special agent in charge. He was transferred to the Baltimore office in 1945. On June 21, 1945 he was named acting special agent in charge of the office in Providence. He was designated SAC of Providence on July 17, 1945 and remained there until that fall when J. Edgar Hoover loaned him and Joseph Carroll to the War Assets Administration. Laughlin served as the WAA's deputy director of the compliance enforcement division. Although the assignment was to be temporary, he remained with the WAA until 1947, as the head of the administration, Robert McGowan Littlejohn refused to let Laughlin and Carroll return to the FBI until after Hoover got the White House to intervene. On April 1, 1947, Laughlin returned to the FBI as an inspector. From 1947 to 1953 he supervised the FBI's liaison and loyalty sections. In the role, Laughlin was involved in the investigations of Judith Coplon, William Remington, and Harry Dexter White. He then served as special agent in charge of the Washington field office until 1957, when he returned to Boston as special agent in charge. In March 1962, Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe announced that Laughlin was his choice to become the next Commissioner of the Boston Police Department. Laughlin was prepared to take a two-year leave of absence from the FBI to run the department. However, the Massachusetts General Court took the power to appoint the Boston Police Commissioner away from the Governor and returned it to the Mayor of Boston. Boston Mayor John F. Collins announced Laughlin as a finalist for the position, but Laughlin took himself out of the running, stating that he was \\"not interested in becoming commissioner\\". One of Laughlin's subordinates, Edmund McNamara, was chosen instead. Business career In 1962, Laughlin retired from the FBI and became the executive vice president of the Harrington & Richardson Firearms Company. He later became president of the company. Laughlin left H&R; in 1963 due to ill health and later ran a management security consulting business in Boston. Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Safety On September 29, 1965, suspended Commissioner of Public Safety Frank S. Giles resigned and Governor John A. Volpe appointed Laughlin to replace him. After he was sworn in, Laughlin found that Richard Caples, who served as acting commissioner during Giles' suspension, would not give up his office, as Caples claimed that he could not legally be replaced until the expiration of Giles' term on July 20, 1966. Laughlin instead took a temporary office in the agency's headquarters while Caples pursued legal action. On September 30, 1965, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Harry T. Kalus refused to issue an injunction to prevent the Secretary of the Commonwealth from issuing Laughlin's commission and Laughlin moved into the commissioner's office. Kalus later ruled that Laughlin was \\"the legally and duly qualified Commissioner of Public Safety\\". His decision was affirmed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Laughlin was appointed to a five-year term in January 1966. In 1967, The Boston Globe reported that Volpe wanted to oust Laughlin due to complaints over the way Laughlin handled the agency. Among the reported issues with Laughlin's leadership were his refusal to accept advice from his staff and low morale among members of the Massachusetts State Police. However, Laughlin refused to quit and Volpe could not remove him, as the accusations were not serious enough to justify bringing charges against him. Laughlin resigned as Commissioner of Public Safety effective August 31, 1969, to become executive director of 100 Club, a charitable organization that provides aid to the widows and children of police officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty. Family life Laughlin married Mary E. Galligan they had five children. His first cousin, James M. Quigley, was a United States Representative from Pennsylvania and Assistant Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. While working in Boston, Laughlin resided in Winchester, Massachusetts, across the street from John A. Volpe. Later life and death In 1978, Laughlin retired to Kennebunk, Maine and Belleair, Florida He died in Belleair, Florida on April 13, 1997.

Plot  After being attacked by Hydra, Andrew is found badly injured and brought to the Playground for treatment. May takes over the hunt for Ward and convinces Morse to join her, and they examine Strucker's bank transactions and learn he has travelled to the Cayman Islands. Ward orders Kebo to find and kill Strucker, who has sought refuge with his father's friend Gideon Malick, a former World Security Council member and senior Hydra member. Sending Strucker to Portugal, Malick later contacts Ward, offering him an alliance and telling him Strucker's location as a show of faith. May and Morse steal Strucker's safe deposit box, and Fitz traces the fake passports inside, finding further Strucker bank accounts and learning his location. Meanwhile, Coulson meets with Price, who agreed to show him the ATCU's facility for their captured Inhumans. There is a break-in at her apartment, and she and Coulson go there to investigate. Coulson suspects Price staged a burglary to divert his attention and gain his sympathy, at which point a hurt Price takes him to the Inhuman facility. Theorising Luther Banks may be Lash, Daisy, Hunter and Mack spy on him, and Hunter shoots Banks with an Icer so they can collect a blood sample. The DNA analysis proves Banks is not an Inhuman, but after finding a text on his phone regarding a delivery to Endotex Labs, the three agents go there and discover it is the facility where the Inhumans are being held by the ATCU. Daisy is shocked to find the Inhumans are being kept in suspended animation, and is further riled to see Coulson there. Though Coulson has misgivings, Price insists suspended animation is the only way to contain the Inhumans until the ATCU can find a cure to reverse their Terrigenesis. She also admits that her husband died from cancer years earlier, and that she genuinely wants to be allies with Coulson, if not friends. May and Morse arrive in Portugal to find Kebo torturing Strucker, and while Morse fights Kebo and fatally electrocutes him in a swimming pool, May subdues the other Hydra agents and frees a mortally wounded Strucker. Before losing consciousness, he reveals to a horrified May that Andrew Garner is the real Lash, and that he killed his Hydra attackers and then set the explosion in the convenience store to cover his tracks. In the end tag, Daisy shares a brief phone conversation with Lincoln, who is still off the grid after the ATCU tried to capture him. Andrew asks her to try to persuade Lincoln to come to the Playground, secretly plotting to kill him.

Death  Tamer Abdel Raouf was driving back just days after the August 2013 Rabaa massacre from a meeting with Egypt's new governor, Mostafa Hadhound, on the night of Monday, August 19, 2013, when he was killed on his way home. The meeting had lasted to before Egypt's curfew of 7 p.m. After taking three other journalists home from the meeting, Raouf and Hamed Al-Barbari, a journalist from the daily Al-Gomhuria Egyptian newspaper, were on their way to their homes in Kafr El Dawwar. On their way there, they approached a military vehicle checkpoint on an agricultural road in Damanhur, Beheira. Barburi states that as they approached they were waved on by soldiers to turn around and leave the checkpoint,and as they turned around to leave, soldiers fired on the vehicle, shooting Raouf in the head and injuring Barbari. The vehicle then came to a stop after hitting a light post. Barburi also stated that they arrived at the checkpoint shortly after 6 p.m., before the 7 p.m. curfew. However, the military states that the vehicle approached the checkpoint at a very high speed. Warnings were yelled and warning shots were fired, and Raouf's vehicle still sped towards them, so they fired on the vehicle. It was also stated that as Raouf attempted to turn around and leave the checkpoint, they fired because the soldiers believed they were trying to escape. Contrary to Barburi's statement, the military stated that Raouf's vehicle approached the checkpoint after the 7 p.m. curfew, not at 6 p.m. They also stated that shots were fired at the checkpoint by Raouf's vehicle. Barburi was detained for four days to investigate this after a handgun was found in the vehicle by police.  Context  In late November 2012, Mohamad Morsi, Egypt's president at the time, passed a new constitutional declaration that gave him enormous power. This led to the 2012-13 Egyptian protests, which led to Morsi's removal from office by the military on July 3, 2013. After his removal, many news reporters and journalists had been detained, attacked, and even killed by supporters of Morsi, which makes Egyptian journalist's and news reporter's jobs very dangerous. Early August 2013, Egypt's government ordered a country-wide curfew of 7 p.m. after two pro-Morsi protest camps were broken up as they demanded for the return of Morsi to office. This curfew was set to last until the following month. However, news reporters and journalists were exempt from this dusk-to-dawn curfew so that they could do their jobs. However, there had been many journalists stating that their exemption from the curfew was not being respected.  Impact  Since Morsi's removal of office on July 3, 2013, Egyptian news reporters and journalists had been targeted by military and police. 40 news providers had been attacked , 80 journalists detained, and five journalists killed by supporters of Morsi. Raouf was one of the journalists killed because of \\"government-ordered violence\\" and chaos in Egypt at the time. Raouf's death demonstrated the difficulty and danger of Egyptian news reporters and journalist's jobs at the time.  Reactions  Raouf's death led to many organizations calling for investigations to be done to determine the exact circumstances of his death. Many calls were also made pushing to end the violence in Egypt and ensure that news reporters and journalists were not targeted by military and police so that they can report news safely without danger. Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO said deploring his death and calling for a thorough investigation it. She also stated that \\"This is an issue of freedom of expression and information. I call on the Egyptian authorities to do everything possible to ensure the security of media workers. Reporters Without Borders said, \\"Reporters must be able to work without their lives being put in danger, regardless of the political fault lines. We deplore the passivity of the new Egyptian authorities and we urge them to react quickly by taking concrete measures to guarantee journalists' safety and respect for freedom of information.\\" The National Press Club called out the Egyptian government directly, said, \\"The Egyptian government appears to be targeting both domestic and foreign journalists for no reason other than they are reporting the news. There is a desperate need for the Egyptian people to know what's happening as unrest grips the country. The regime's open and violent crackdown suggests they want to keep their citizens in the dark.\\" NPC also called for investigations to be done on all news reporters or journalists killed or harmed, and to take action against those responsible. The DOHA Centre For Media Freedom (DCMF) also reacted, calling for Egyptian authorities to respect news reporters and journalists as they do their job, as it is important for them to get out the news without being in danger or risking their lives. They also called for the release of all detained journalists.

Format Mulhern picks three contestants out of the audience, who are wearing flashy outfits in an attempt to be noticed by Mulhern. He will then pick a fourth. The fourth will then be posed three questions and will ask each of the three players for one answer. One of the podiums is loaded with a prize such as a holiday, white goods or a vehicle, and that player has the answers in front of them. The other two will have to make up their answers. If the fourth player can pick the correct podium, (s)he will win that prize. Whichever player is picked wins ¬£1,000 and is replaced; contestants who are picked and manage to bluff their way to being picked are offered a gamble: ¬£1,000 and that prize if they can identify who was correct. All contestants who are picked automatically take home a Pick Me! shirt. This process repeats itself four times, involving ten contestants in total. All ten of the day's contestants are entered into the pick of the day at the end of the show. The player who gets the biggest cheer plays for the day's star prize; they then pick three contestants to play with them in the final. Each assistant is assigned an envelope, with one envelope containing the star prize and ask the contestant one question without knowing the answer. The contestant then locks in his answers. Once the contestant has given all three answers, the assistants will read out the correct answers from their screen; matched correct answers unlock envelopes. If the contestant opens the envelope with the correct answer they win the star prize. Reception The show has received mixed reviews by television critics. Adam Postans referred to the show as a \\"nightmarish freak show\\" stating that \\"its glorious stupidity is utterly compelling\\". In 2016, the series won a Rose d'Or for Best Game Show.

It was originally released in 1988 as a double-LP containing 34 tracks, and has been newly re-mastered and re-issued in 2015. Though most of the LP's tracks had appeared on volumes 3 and 4 of the Back from the Grave CD-specific sub- series (released between 1996 and 2000), in 2015, it was released on CD with the re-mastered material and closely matches the song content (and album cover artwork) of the original LP (containing all but two of the cuts on the original LP) as part of an effort to bring the LP's and CD's of the series into multi-medium coherence. In keeping with all of the entries in the series, and as indicated in the subheading which reads \\"Raw Blastin' Mid 60s Punk,\\" this collection generally excludes psychedelic, folk rock, and pop-influenced material in favor of basic primitive rock and roll, usually consisting of songs displaying the rawer and more aggressive side of the genre often characterized by the use of fuzztone-distorted guitars and rough vocals. The packaging features well-researched liner notes written by Tim Warren which convey basic information about each song and group, such as origin, recording date, and biographical sketches, usually written in a conversational style that includes occasional slang, anecdotes, humorous asides. The liner notes are noticeably opinionated, sometimes engaging in tongue-in-cheek insults directed at other genres of music. The packaging also includes photographs of the bands, and the front cover features a highly satirical cartoon by Mort Todd which once again depicts the customary revivified zombies whose ethos always demands strict adherence to what they consider to be the \\"one true faith\\" of \\"pure\\" rock & roll (i.e. with no admixture of \\"revisionist heresy\\"), and on this particular occasion they are accompanied by a very select remnant of survivors (\\"true\\" rock & roll musicians and fans accompanied by beautiful women) who have been allowed to seek refuge on rafts and be spared from the vengeful \\"apocalypse\\" (and its torrential flood of Biblical proportions, all of which typologically prefigured in earlier volumes of the BFTG series, which has been near-successfully waged against all forms of musio-cultural \\"heterodoxy\\" and its global adherents, in effect \\"crankin' out\\" a handful of \\"blastin'\\" garage tunes (from the past) in order to \\"clear the way\\" for their envisioned \\"retro-future,\\" in effect reducing civilization back to a supposed \\"Edenic\\" state or \\"glorified stone age\\" and making the world \\"safe\\" for the \\"triumphal\\" return of primitive two/three-chord \\"caveman rock\\". \\\\- LP Liner notes and cover artwork.

The blues-based \\"Orphan Boy,\\" by Half-Pint & the Fifths, is one of the highlights of the album and tells a tale about the dejected (and rejected) life of an orphan.

The Seljuk Sultan of R√ªm Kayqubad II appealed to Berke, khan of the Golden Horde, to attack the Byzantine Empire in order to free his brother Kaykaus II. Background These events are rather well-reported from various perspectives. Among the Egyptian sources are Baybars, Badr al-Din al-Ayni, al- Dhahabi, al-Nuwayri and al-Maqrizi; among the Persian Ibn Bibi and al- Aqsarayi; among the Byzantine George Akropolites, George Pachymeres and Nicephorus Gregoras; and among the Turkish the Sel√ßukname. According to Ibn Bibi and al-Aqsarayi, Kaykaus plotted to overthrow the Emperor Michael VIII, but his plans were revealed by his maternal uncle, Kyr Kedid. The emperor had his equerry blinded, his general executed and his family imprisoned. Kaykaus then turned to the Golden Horde. According to al-Aqsarayi, one of his paternal aunts was a wife of Berke. According to Pachymeres, he had an uncle of high rank in the Horde. Whatever his connection, he made contact with the Horde, who enlisted the support of their vassal, Bulgaria. Nicephorus Gregoras is unique in claiming that Kaykaus first made contact with the Bulgarian tsar, Konstantin Tikh, who enlisted his Mongol overlords. He admits, however, that the Mongol element was predominant in the invading army. He says that they came from Paristrion, that is, just north of the lower Danube. He gives their number as two thousand (or two tumens). According to Pachymeres, they were an autonomous band, de facto independent of the authority of the Golden Horde. If he is correct, then they were probably not under the leadership of Nogai Khan and were acting as mercenaries (to be paid in booty) of the Bulgars. Invasion The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube river in the winter of 1263/1264. They defeated the armies of Michael VIII in the spring of 1264. While most of the defeated army fled, the Byzantine Emperor escaped with the assistance of Italian merchants. After that Thrace was plundered. Michael VIII was forced to release Kaykaus, and signed a treaty with Berke, in which he agreed to give one of his daughters, Euphrosyne Palaiogina, in marriage to Nogai. Berke ceded Crimea to Kaykaus as appanage and agreed that he would marry a Mongol woman. Michael also sent tribute to the Horde. Berke's invasion of Thrace may have been the war which delayed Niccol√≤ and Maffeo Polo's journey in the 1260s.

The show is hosted by Jen and Sylvia Soska and premiered on October 21, 2015, on Game Show Network. The debut episode was watched by 503,000 viewers. The four episode second season began airing October 7, 2016, at 9:00 p.m. A team of four players begins the game, one is taken from them at the beginning of the show and placed in a cell designated as the Inferno. Gameplay Each episode centers around a legend whose central figure committed horrific deeds, generally torture and/or murder of multiple victims. The challenges in each episode are based on that legend. =Individual challenges= In Season 1, a team of 3 contestants participate in the game. In Season 2, a team of 4 contestants participate in the game although one of them is locked up in the Inferno at the start. The contestants usually have a common bond (nurses, college students, models, chefs, etc,). The Soska sisters tell the contestants in the Hellevator part of the legend. The subsequent challenge relates to that part of the legend. In Season 2, the overall legend relates to three of the Seven Deadly Sins, with each of the challenges relating to one of those three sins. The team members decide among themselves who will face that challenge, with each contestant having to take one of the three challenges. The contestant chosen exits the elevator and makes their way to the challenge area (they are usually told to follow the light that guides them). On the way there, they are usually either startled by sounds or actors intimidating them; or kidnapped by robed figures and taken to the challenge area. Once the contestant arrives, the Soska sisters tell them the rules of the challenge as well as how much time they have to complete it. While the contestant is performing the challenge, he or she may be distracted by such things as the challenge environment (for example, the room may get hotter as the challenge progresses, or certain actions may result in the contestant being covered in blood or other substances) and actors either screaming or actively antagonizing the contestant. In some challenges, the Soska sisters will provide clues either at the start or during the challenge to the contestants inside the Hellevator to help their teammate. The contestants are equipped with walkie-talkies so that the contestants still in the elevator can offer advice during the challenge. There is also a video screen inside the Hellevator to provide visuals as well as for necessity at times for the team to help the contestant doing the challenge. In order to win the money assigned to the challenge and remain in the game, the contestant must complete the challenge successfully and return to the Hellevator within the time limit of three or four minutes (five or seven minutes in Season 1) (not completing the challenge or doing it incorrectly will deny the contestant a return to the Hellevator). The first challenge is relatively easy and is worth $5,000, the second challenge is more difficult and is worth $10,000, the third challenge is the hardest and is worth $15,000. For Season 2, the values of the individual challenges were reduced to $2,000, $3,000, and $5,000 respectively. If the contestant fails to complete the challenge and return, he or she is eliminated from the game. In Season 1, eliminated contestants were out of the game completely and suggested to have met a horrific death related to the challenge (in reality, they exited the slaughterhouse, and do not participate in the interview at the end of the show). In Season 2, the contestants who failed to complete the challenge were sent to the cell called The Inferno where they had to remain until they could be rescued by their teammate(s) in the final challenge. Once the three challenges have been played, the remaining contestants face the Labyrinth (Season 1) or the Inferno Run (Season 2). Season 1 =The Labyrinth= Prior to the Labyrinth, the remaining members of the team surrender their walkie-talkie before exiting the Hellevator and are given a bag in which they place any money found. The Labyrinth consists of three areas designed to relate to the legend and/or the challenges featured in the show, each with a certain amount of cash hidden within. Also hidden somewhere in the Labyrinth is a special item, generally said to be the key to defeating the central villain of the legend, if found, this item is worth an additional bonus to the team. The amount of cash and the bonus total $20,000. In order to keep the money earned in the Labyrinth, the team must complete the entire run in the Labyrinth and return to the Hellevator within the time allocated. If the team fails to do so, they forfeit the money. If all three contestants had successfully completed their challenges, an alternate version of the Labyrinth was used instead of the traditional three-area format. In this alternate version (which was only used once), the team had to complete one final group challenge and return to the Hellevator within four or five minutes. There was no bonus item in this version, but during the final challenge, the team could find money bags worth $1,000 each, however, the team could only keep the additional money if they completed the task and returned to the Hellevator in time. In this version of the Labyrinth, there was a total of $25,000 available. A team that plays a perfect game by completing all three challenges and finding all of the money and the bonus item in the Labyrinth will win a total of $50,000 to $55,000. Season 2 =The Inferno Run= The Inferno Run replaced the Labyrinth in Season 2, and like with the Labyrinth, any contestant that accomplishes their individual challenge will get to participate in the Inferno Run. In the Inferno Run, there are seven doors with each door corresponding to one of the Seven Deadly Sins. One of those doors is removed for each of the individual challenges completed (always the sins relating to the challenge(s) completed by each successful contestant). The contestant(s) have a total of seven minutes to complete the remaining challenges (the time runs continuously once the round starts). Accomplishing each challenge will either reward them with money or with the key to free their teammate(s). If two or more contestant(s) make it to the Inferno Run, they will attempt the challenges individually. Once they enter the door, the Soska Sisters will explain the rules of the challenge. The contestant(s) must continue completing challenges, alternating turns, until they find the key. If they do find the key they may choose to either attempt additional challenges (if any remain) for extra money, or free their teammates and head back to the Hellevator. If the contestant(s) choose to play another challenge, they must complete it before they again have the option to end the game, if they choose to free their teammates, they cannot attempt any more challenges and must then return to the Hellevator. The entire team must return to the Hellevator before time runs out in order to keep their winnings from the Inferno Run, if they fail to do so, they forfeit the money from the Inferno Run, although they will retain any winnings from the individual challenges. Any episode ending in an Inferno Run failure ends with all of the contestants trapped in separate rooms in the Slaughterhouse, presumably \\"tortured\\" to death. There is a total of $40,000 in cash available, so that a team that plays a perfect game will again win a total of $50,000. =The Seven Deadly Sins= * Envy - The contestant must make both sides of the childhood bedroom (which the Soska Sisters claim to be theirs) match by taking a number of duplicate items from Sylvia's purple side and move them to Jen's grey side. * Gluttony - The contestant must search the birthday cakes using only their mouth to find the cash inside. * Greed - The contestant must search the safety deposit boxes for the combination to open the bank safe. * Lust - The contestant must retrieve a wedding ring from one of the holes in the wall and place it on the finger of the lusty corpse bride. * Pride - The contestant must siphon 15 pounds of fat or more from the patient in the operating room. * Sloth - The contestant must fix the gaps in the two leaking pipes by attaching the connectors that fit. * Wrath - The contestant must find the colored needles and jab them into the matching colored X's on the life-size voodoo doll.

The character made her first on-screen appearance on 29 October 2015. She is the first transgender person to play a regular transgender character in British soap opera. She was cast after the show held casting workshops to discover acting talent in the transgender community. Sally is characterised as a strict, \\"no-nonsense\\" headteacher who moves to Hollyoaks village to work at the local school. Hollyoaks writers explored the character's transgender status and worked alongside equal rights group All About Trans, who consulted and advised to make the story realistic. In one surprise storyline, Sally is revealed to be the biological parent of John Paul McQueen (James Sutton). Casting Hollyoaks featured a transgender character named Blessing Chambers played by actress Modupe Adeyeye. The trans community were not impressed with the show for not hiring a transgender actress for the role. Hollyoaks casting department were not familiar with any out transgender actors. They decided to create a casting workshop alongside equal rights group All About Trans. 30 transgender people were in attendance during the workshop. Wallace was selected from the group and invited to play the role of Sally. Wallace's casting was first acknowledged publicly via an article in The Guardian, written by transgender rights activist Paris Lees. She is the first transgender actress to play a regular transgender character in the British soap opera genre. The casting announcement came at a time rival soap opera EastEnders announced that they had developed similar plans casting transgender actor Riley Carter Millington as Kyle Slater. Hollyoaks were not originally going to announce Wallace's casting until the following week. They also planned not to announce the fact that Wallace is transgender. But with Millington's casting public knowledge, the show released a press release. Wallace believed that transgender actors were being hired more in 2015 because of the new found willingness of casting directors and dramas themselves to represent the community. Hollyoaks later announced that Sally would be introduced as the show's new headteacher at Hollyoaks High; replacing the role previously taken by Patrick Blake's (Jeremy Sheffield). Sally was billed as having a \\"no-nonsense attitude\\" and arrive at the school to help correct the behaviour of wayward students. It was also revealed that the character had an ulterior motive for moving to Hollyoaks. Of her casting Wallace stated \\"I'm delighted to be joining Hollyoaks as Mrs. St. Claire. She's such a great character and my first couple of scenes with Jeremy really show off her feisty personality ‚Äì she's a force to be reckoned with.\\" Wallace hoped her involvement with the show would change public perceptions of transgender people. She claimed \\"we're helping to change hearts and minds from people's living rooms.\\" Development =Characterisation= Sally is characterised as a strict headteacher who has a \\"no-nonsense\\" approach towards people and daily situations. She has a strong dislike of bullies and sneaky people. She is determined to influence her schools with her own policy. She is not a vindictive woman and only hands out punishments for good reasons. Wallace has said that Sally uses her strict nature as \\"a bit of a front\\" that hides a \\"softer side\\". =Transgender status= Sally initially keeps her transgender status a secret because of negative past experiences. At her previous school when parents and teachers found out they began to bully her. John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) is first to learn about her transition. He accidentally makes the discovery but is supportive towards Sally. Wallace told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that \\"it's the last thing Sally wanted to happen so soon after joining.\\" Sally is \\"terrified\\" and \\"fears\\" that those at Hollyoaks High will treat her the same as her previous school. John Paul's support for Sally becomes a positive in her life. He wants her to fit in with everyone else. Wallace enjoyed working with Sutton because he offered her support off-camera. When more character learn of her status Sally has become more settled at the school. The actress said that Sally has \\"earned respect\\" and enjoys working at the school. While it not an ideal situation, she feels better equipped to deal with everyone knowing. The first student to learn about Sally being transgender is Peri Lomax (Ruby O'Donnell). Sally refuses to let Peri hand in her work assignment late which upsets her. Peri wants revenge and she defaces a student art display which Sally is planning to unveil during an event hosted for the parents of students. When Sally unveils the exhibition there is red graffiti spelling out the derogatory term \\"tranny\\". Sally is shocked and upset that everyone knows that she is transgender. Wallace told Laura Heffernan from Inside Soap that her character stands up for herself and states that she will not tolerate transphobia. The events do leave Sally's future in Hollyoaks uncertain. Wallace said that her character may behave as \\"a bit of a hard act\\" but the revelation is a \\"real dent to her self-esteem and she truly believes she is about to lose everything dearest to her.\\" Sally announces her intention to resign from her position but John Paul tries to persuade her otherwise. But Sally mistakes John Paul's concern for criticism and she slaps him in the face. The actress explained that John Paul gives Sally \\"tough love\\" but says the wrong thing. Sally then \\"hates herself for lashing out\\" and cannot believe she has hurt the one person who had defended her. =John Paul McQueen= In the episode that aired on 15 March 2016, a surprise storyline unfolded for viewers. Sally and Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) interact for the first time and it is revealed that Sally is John Paul's father. While the story was kept a secret and not mentioned in press spoilers, Wallace had known about it for six months. Sutton was also involved in Wallace's audition process when producers were secretly testing their on-camera compatibility. She was told during a storyline conference and Wallace found keeping the secret \\"delightful\\". Some fans managed to figure out the story after they noticed Sally keeping a photograph of John Paul weeks before. The actress told Kilkelly that Sally came to Hollyoaks to find John Paul. She always knew he existed but she always felt unable to visit him. But as she has reached fifty- years-old and the height of her profession, she decided it was time. When the job position came up at Hollyoaks High, Sally knew the McQueen family lived in the village and she had found the perfect opportunity to be close to him. Despite not revealing her identity, Wallace defended Sally stating \\"She's been keeping it a secret from John Paul because she's too scared of how he's going to react, but she's still tried to be in his company all the time.\\" Some viewers perceived the story to be too outlandish. But Wallace noted that scriptwriters had been in contact with All About Trans for advice. She also claimed that it is not an uncommon scenario for a transgender person to become embroiled in. Trans people may have children existing from before their transition was complete. Wallace quipped the most uncommon and \\"very soap\\" part of the story was that it featured a headteacher and employee. On-screen Myra orders Sally to never tell John Paul the truth. She had lied to him that Ricky Bowen (Simon Cassidy) was his father. Myra knows it will destroy their bond if he knows she lied. Storylines Sally first appears introducing herself to Patrick Blake (Jeremy Sheffield) as his replacement. He is immediately irritated by Sally, and his wife Maxine Minniver (Nikki Sanderson) later starts a riot at the school when she has Patrick fired with immediate effect. She takes a shine to John Paul, and when he is helping her move into her new office, he comes across a document stating that Sally's birth name is \\"Iain Naismith\\", and realises that she is transgender. She later confirms this when he asks her about it. She is devastated in January 2016 when Peri, after hearing a conversation between her and John Paul, vandalises the school art exhibition, outing her as transgender. She suspends Peri immediately, and decides to resign from Hollyoaks High. After a heart-to-heart with John Paul, Sally decides to remain at the school. She later produces a photograph of John Paul from her desk, and looks at it, smiling. When laptops are stolen from the school while in John Paul's care, Sally reluctantly suspends him. This infuriates his mother, Myra, who goes to the school and confronts Sally. Myra instantly recognises Sally as Iain, and it is confirmed that Sally is John Paul's father. After a heated argument, Myra demands that Sally never tell John Paul the truth, which she reluctantly agrees to. She continues giving John Paul special treatment at work, leading John Paul to believe that she has feelings for him. When John Paul gets into a fight with Pete Buchanan (Kai Owen) on the school playground, Sally screams that John Paul is her son, stunning everybody. John Paul refuses to speak to Myra or Sally, but slowly warms to Sally when he finds and reads a letter from her which should have been given to him when he was a child, making him more hostile with Myra for withholding it. Myra later demands that Sally pay for all the years of child maintenance that she missed out on for John Paul, which she agrees to do but Myra is still adamant that Sally stays away. As she storms off, she sees red and attacks Sally, resulting in Myra falling down the stairs of the school. The next day, Sally is arrested for attempting to murder Myra, so John Paul hires James Nightingale (Gregory Finnegan) to defend her. She admits to James that she pushed Myra down the stairs in self-defence, but James warns her that if she does not lie to the police, she could be sent to an all-male prison, as she does not have a gender recognition certificate. When Sally eventually confesses to John Paul, he tells her that he wishes she never came back into his life.

John Paul later returns to the village, delighting Sally. Reception Duncan Lindsay writing for the Metro described Sally as a \\"refreshing\\" and \\"strong teacher\\" who acts as a \\"brilliant role model\\" for the show's audience. The writer was particularly fond of the character's initial storylines and added \\"definitely one of our favourite new characters this year ‚Äì long may Mrs. St. Claire reign!\\" Digital Spy's Kilkelly branded her a \\"no- nonsense headteacher\\" and \\"formidable character\\". Laura Heffernan from Inside Soap said that \\"hard-nosed\\" and \\"no-nonsense Mrs. St. Claire wasted little time spreading order and discipline throughout Hollyoaks High.\\" Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy included Wallace in a list of the genre's \\"rising stars\\". He described the character as \\"a bit of a nightmare\\" upon her introduction, due to her ruthless teaching methods. Their opinion changed as Sally continued to appear and Kilkelly stated, \\"as with all great soap characters, we've since seen her complexities with a much softer and vulnerable side.\\" References External links * Character profile at Channel4.com Category:Hollyoaks characters Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Fictional principals and headteachers Category:Fictional Scottish people Category:Fictional transgender and transsexual women Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 Category:Fictional lesbians Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Sally St. Claire"},{"id":"48297737","text":"1974 Ramna Massacre was a massacre of Jatiyo Samajtantarik Dal supporters that took place on March 17, 1974. The incident took place when a demonstrators from the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal, who were blockading the residence of the Home Minister Mansur Ali, located in the Ramna area of Dhaka, was fired upon by members of Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini. The incident reportedly claimed at least fifty lives.Ahmad, Mahiuddin, ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶â‡¶§‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶® ‡¶ì ‡¶™‡¶§‡¶®‡¶É ‡¶Ö‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶§‡¶ø, First published 2015, p. 111, Prothoma Prakashani, Dhaka.  Background  After Bangladesh won its independence through the liberation war of 1971, an ideological conflict was raised on the question of how Bangladesh will be governed. When Awami League leadership opted for democracy as its first choice, a large section of Awami League's students front Bangladesh Students League led by A. S. M. Abdur Rab and Shajahan Siraj expressed their dissent with the idea. This section, mostly the followers of former General Secretary of the front Serajul Alam Khan, formed a new political party opposing the Awami League's view and to establish a form of socialism what they called Scientific Socialism. Soon after the formation of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, the Jasad-fueled protests were met with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini personnel who were accused of conducting raids in the opposition politicians houses, torture, murders and abductions of the opposition activist.  Declaration  Due to the corruption, misappropriation of relief item, hoarding of essential goods by marketeers, and smuggling of food grains to India, during the initials days of 1974, there was inflation. Moreover, the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini came down hard handed on the protests. Jasad presented 29 points and declared to surround the government establishments those were linked with the distribution of relief goods and food grains on February 10 of 1974 through a public statement if the points were ignored. The statement read, The declaration gave Awami League government around one month time to take necessary measures or to face dire consequence on March 17.  March 17  On March 17, supporters of Jasad and the oppressed people of the capital and its surrounding areas started gathering at the Paltan ground of the capital as Jasad called a public meeting to mark the deadline of the ultimatum. They also distributed anti- government leaflets. The rally was supposed to end before the sunset and a then march towards the residence of Home Minister Mansur Ali to submit a Memorandum of Redemption after laying a seize around the house for some moment. But once the meeting began, it started getting agitated by the speeches of A. S. M. Abdur Rab, Mohammad Abdul Jalil and other leaders. The crowd subsequently became crazy. After the meeting ended, a large group of people started marching towards Minto Road of Ramna area where the residence of the Home Minister is located. After reaching the gate of the residence, the crowd laid a siege around the residence. An agitated group of people tried to burn down the gate. Police charged the crowd to disperse the rally and foil the siege, and a clash ensued between the police and the Jasad men. Jasad men started throwing brickbats targeting the police after the police started firing tear gas shells over the crowd. Within minutes, the area turned into a battlefield and the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini was called on. Once the armed Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini personnel reached the place with trucks, they started firing live bullets on the crowd. At this point the Jasad activists fell down on the streets to save themselves from the bullets. But the Rakkhis then started firing at the ground to ensure that the death toll gets higher than ever. According to A. S. M. Abdur Rab: After gunning down the political opponents of the government, Rakkhi Bahini personnel and the police arrested almost all the leaders of Jasad from the spot. Arrestees included Major Jalil, A.S.M. Abdur Rab, Momtaz Begum, Moinuddin Khan Badal and many others. All of them received bullet injuries and were taken to the hospital for treatment.  Death toll  The death toll of the massacre varies from six to around fifty. The government, after the incident issued a pressnote blaming Jasad for what happened. The government pressnote claimed that only six people died during the \\"clash\\" and some 20 people got injured. Jasad in an official statement claimed that the death toll is at least fifty. Ahmad Ullah Khan was a Deputy Superintendent of Police at Tejgaon of the capital Dhaka. He confirmed that 40-50 dead bodies were taken away by Rakkhi Bahini in their trucks that day.  Aftermath  All but Momtaz Begum who was a student were landed in the jail that day. They were released only after the Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. However, Moinuddin Khan Badal eloped from the hospital. The Daily Ganakantha was the spokesman of Jasad, and many of its correspondents were present during the incident to cover the protest rally. After the massacre that lasted for almost one hour, journalists from Daily Ganakantha prepared a news item on the death of around 50 Jasad supporters and the abduction of their corpses by Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini personnel. But the news was not published as the police and Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini personnel raided the office of Ganakantha and arrested the editor, Al Mahmud. In 2016, Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi criticized Hasanul Haq Inu for his role for blockade residence of then home minister Mansur Ali.

The museum is situated in the open air museum The Old Town in the Town Center neighbourhood in central Aarhus. The museum originates from a collection by the Danish painter Peder Stougaard who began collecting posters in 1972. Initially the collection was primarily Danish but it has been expanded with poster art from across the world through outreach to embassies and museums. The Poster Museum was founded in 1993 and Stougaards collection was donated to the museum where it remains central to the exhibit and overall collection. In 2006 the museum moved into buildings in the Old Town museum. The entrance to the museum is a pavilion from the Danish National Exhibition of 1909 but the interior is a modern complex in two stories, designed by the architects firm C.F. M√∏ller. In September 2012 Elsebeth Aasted Schanz was appointed to the position of museum director.

Eyolfson‚Äôs private member‚Äôs bill would have the federal justice and transport ministers work with the provinces to create a framework aimed at deterring and preventing distracted driving.

The bill was defeated at Second Reading March 21, 2018. In October 2017, Eyolfson sponsored S-228, the Child Health Protection Act in the House of Commons. The bill seeks to amend the Food and Drugs Act in an effort to fight childhood obesity by prohibiting the marketing of unhealthy food and beverages towards children. Eyolfson stated his previous experience as a doctor and his desire to take steps towards reducing childhood obesity and the risk of premature onset of chronic conditions such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease as his reasoning for sponsoring the legislation.

He presently serves as the Conservative National Caucus Chair for Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Early life and education Tom Kmiec was born in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. His family emigrated to Canada and settled in Quebec. Kmiec was raised in Quebec and went through the French education system as part of the Bill 101 reforms. In 2005, he moved to Calgary. He is raising his three children, Maximillian, Jolie, and Enoch. Kmiec graduated from Concordia University in Montreal with a bachelor's degree in Political Science. He then received his master's degree in American Government with a concentration in Terrorism and Homeland Security from Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA. Career Kmiec started his career as an intern in the office of then Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, Stephen Harper. Kmiec has since worked for cabinet ministers federally and provincially in Alberta in portfolios including: finance, immigration, sustainable resource development, and national defense. Kmiec was elected in the 2015 Canadian federal election for the riding of Calgary Shepard. Kmiec has served on the Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations, the Foreign Affairs and International Development Committee, and the Finance Committee. The latter two represent the most senior committees in Parliament. On September 18, 2017, Kmiec was moved from his role as Deputy Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Deputy Shadow Minister for Finance. In this role, Kmiec was a strong voice for lower taxes, financial responsibility, and housing affordability. Kmiec was named deputy critic for foreign affairs for the Conservative Party of Canada on October 16, 2016 in a shadow cabinet shuffle by Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose.https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5e9ee09d91aa4d38e08f9a7c3/files/OFFICIAL_OPPOSITION_SHADOW_CABINET_October_16_2016_FINAL.pdfhttp://www.tomkmiec.ca/mp_tom_kmiec_appointed_deputy_foreign_affairs_critic_in_new_shadow_cabinet_shuffle Prior to being elected as the MP for Calgary Shepard, Kmiec was the manager of policy and research with the Calgary Chamber of Commerce and worked for the Human Resources Institute of Alberta. This work received national coverage in the Globe and Mail and Maclean's magazine. Kmiec is an advocate for the Kidney Foundation and served on the board of the southern Alberta chapter. Pipelines and Energy Jobs Since being elected in 2015, Kmiec has worked closely with Conservative caucus colleagues and interested parliamentarians from other parties to champion the construction of new pipelines by the private sector to get Canadian energy resources to new markets. In the fall of 2016, Kmiec helped start the Alberta Jobs Taskforce in response to the growing energy jobs crisis in Alberta after unemployment reached 200,000 Later, on November 27, 2017, Kmiec became the first MP to ask for an emergency debate in Parliament on the energy sector job-loss in Alberta. In his request, he outlined his disappointment with the Liberal government's inaction on the Alberta recession. On April 18, 2018, Kmiec moved a motion at Parliament's finance committee asking to set aside 4 meetings to understand the impact of the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline cancellation on Canada's economy and consider whether the federal government should use its constitutional powers to ensure that the pipeline is built. The Liberal MPs on the committee rejected the motion. Supporting Canadians With Rare Diseases and Disabilities Kmiec is a vocal supporter for improving the government's processes to ensure that all Canadians living with a disability or a rare disease receive the benefits they are entitled to. On March 21, 2018, he tabled his first Private Member's Bill, Bill C-399 the Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act, that aims to improve and expand access to the Disability Tax Credit. The Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act would reduce the time to qualify for the Disability Tax Credit from 14 to 10 hours, include calculation of dosage into time to qualify for the credit and add medical food and medical formula to qualifying for the tax credit. On August 13, 2018, Kmiec‚Äô s daughter, Lucy- Rose Evangeline Winfield Kmiec, died 39 days after her birth. Lucy-Rose was born with Trisomy 13, a rare chromosomal disorder also known as Patau Syndrome. Following her death, Kmiec shared an emotional tribute to his daughter in the House of Commons. ‚ÄúHer short life was energetic and eventful. It has made me realize that life is much more than prizes, certificates and public recognition. Her great success is the incredible warmth she brought to my family and how she's been able to mature her older siblings into responsible caretakers without a spoken word‚Äù Kmiec stated. On December 3, 2018, Kmiec supported an amendment to the Budget Implementation Act that would have created a new 12-week bereavement leave for parents dealing with the death of a child. The Liberal MPs on Parliament's finance committee voted against creating this bereavement leave, and the amendment was defeated. Under the current law, fathers who lose a child are entitled to only five days of leave from work‚Äîthree paid and two unpaid‚Äîwhile the wording regarding leave for mothers is vague and unclear. Kmiec remains committed to ensuring that parents who experience the loss of a child are allocated up to 12 weeks of bereavement leave. Housing Affordability Kmiec is an outspoken critic of barriers to housing affordability facing young Canadian families. He has been vocal in questioning the Liberal government's mortgage lending rules and increases to mortgage insurance fees charged by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). Kmiec has repeatedly called for a full parliamentary review of the B-20 Mortgage Stress Test, that was introduced by the Liberal government in January 2018. He has published a series of articles on the topic and has moved two motions at Parliament's finance committee asking for a study of the mortgage lending rules. The Mortgage Stress Test is estimated to have prevented 100,000 Canadians from purchasing a home, slowed mortgage growth by nearly 12 percent, and will delete some 200,000 jobs from the economy by 2021. Parliamentary Friends of the Kurds Kmiec created the \\"Parliamentary Friends of the Kurds\\", a parliamentary group aimed at establishing dialogue between Canadian and Kurdish lawmakers and fostering positive relations between Canada and the Kurdistan Region. Kmiec, along with NDP MP Gord Johns and fellow Conservative MP Michael Cooper traveled to Washington DC in March 2016 to meet with officials from the Kurdistan Regional Government. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) Kmiec was the first Parliamentarian to unearth the Liberal government's $256 million pledge to the China-controlled Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which was hidden inside the Liberal government's 2017 omnibus budget, Bill C-63. Kmiec criticized the Liberals‚Äô decision to gift $256 million to the AIIB, which is funding the construction of three new energy pipelines in Asia while the Liberal government opposes and stalls the construction of energy pipelines in Canada. Kmiec called on the Liberal government to cancel Canada's participation in the AIIB through a series of motions at parliament's finance committee, but the Liberal MPs on the committee voted down the motions. Human Rights and Religious Freedom Kmiec is an active advocate for human rights and religious freedom around the world. He was a vocal supporter for Canada's Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act, created in response to the death lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in Russian custody. In response to the religious persecution of Montagnards highlanders who practice De Ga Protestantism and Ha Mon Catholicism in Vietnam, Kmiec tabled a petition calling upon the Government of Canada to demand that the Vietnamese government stop its abusive policies against these groups. The petition further demanded that future trade agreements with Vietnam would be contingent on their adherence to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that under the Sergei Magnitsky Act, sanctions would be applied against Colonel Vu Van Lau and Senior Lt. Colonel Pham Huu Truong. Kmiec is also an advocate for Canada to support the minority Uyghur population in China's Xinjiang region, who are being targeted for their religious beliefs and detained in internment camps. In May 2019, Kmiec questioned the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board regarding their investments in two Chinese companies ‚Äî Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. Ltd. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. Ltd. ‚Äî that are involved in the manufacturing of surveillance equipment used to repress Uyghurs in Western China. Kmiec has urged the CPPIB to divest their holdings in these companies. \\\\---- Electoral record References External links *Official Parliamentary Website *Official Website Category:Living people Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Alberta Category:Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Canadian people of Polish descent Category:Polish emigrants to Canada Category:Politicians from Calgary Category:Regent University alumni Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:1981 births Category:Current Members of the House of Commons of Canada ","title":"Tom Kmiec"},{"id":"48297921","text":"Fr√©derike Geerdink (born 1970) is a Dutch freelance journalist and author who specializes in reporting on Kurdish women and political issues in Turkey from Diyarbakir, where she was the lone foreign journalist based there between 2012‚Äì2015.

Notable works of journalism Fr√©derike Geerdink started reporting from Istanbul, Turkey in 2006, but since 2012, she has been located in Diyarbakir, Turkey, which is located in the southeast and predominantly Kurdish region of Turkey, where Geerdink covered Kurdish issues. She was the only foreign journalist reporting from and based inside Diyarbakir between 2012 and 2015. From Diyarbakir, she has focused on Kurdish issues, as well as the PKK, or Partiya Karker√™n Kurdistan (Translated: Kurdistan Workers' Party), which has been classified as terrorist organization in Turkey and by several other states and organizations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the United States and the European Union. The group is an advocate for a separate autonomous territory for the Kurdish people.

She was then detained and questioned. Following that she was charged with distributing terrorist propaganda and supporting the PKK through comments on social media and in her reporting. One of the reasons she had been arrested was because of her interview with PKK leader Cemil Bayik. She stated on Twitter that the investigation went well and that she had nothing to hide from the interview as it was just her doing her job as a journalist. Political leaders and press freedom organizations around the world reacted to her arrest, including Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Bert Koenders. Koenders said the intimidation of journalists was not acceptable. After a lengthy court battle, she was acquitted on 13 April 2015. =Second incident= On 6 September 2015, Fr√©derike Geerdink was arrested again and this time she was charged with crossing into a restricted zone and taking part in a protest while being there. During her incarceration, she was still able to post on Twitter, and report everything that was happening to her. On 9 September, Fr√©derike Geerdink was deported from Turkey and sent back to the Netherlands. According to Geerdink, she was transported by military convoy from Y√ºksekova to Hakkari, she then continued her journey from Hakkari to Van. As the soldiers played loud music, she realized that her time in Turkey was done for the moment, and that she was being deported. She was the third journalist in a month to be exiled from Turkey. The other two journalists were British and they were arrested on charges of terrorism for reporting about the Turkish government's conflict with the PKK youth wing and then deported from Turkey as a result. Upon Geerdink's return to the Netherlands, her arrest and deportation were protested by a joint statement from the European Federation of Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists, and the Dutch Association of Journalists. > \\"We find the arrest and deportation of the Dutch journalist Mrs. Frederike > Geerdink very alarming and contrary to international law and international > treaties, ratified by the Turkish State.\\" The Committee to Protect Journalists issued the following statement: > \\"\\"This deportation sends a chilling signal that authorities don't want > independent reporting on sensitive Kurdish issues in southeast Turkey,\\" said > CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney. \\"We call on the government in Ankara to > allow journalists to report freely from the region and to lift the > deportation order against Frederike Geerdink.\\" While her lawyers are challenging her deportation, Turkish rules say once a person is deported, the person cannot return for 5 years. Geerdink is trying to return to her professional journalism duties in Turkey.

Business career  After graduating from university, Lockhart worked as a manager for a corporate company, up until the birth of her first child. In 2004, she founded her own bridal salon business, Lockhart Weddings and Special Occasions located in Sussex, New Brunswick.

Lockhart also became the first female MP for the Fundy Royal riding. Whilst making history for her riding, many were critical of her candidacy during the 2015 election. Lockhart elaborated on the sexism faced from reporters in a 2019 interview with Chatelaine (magazine): > ‚ÄúI understand how I was a bit of a novelty being the first woman ever > elected in Fundy Royal, but I am guessing no one ever asked my predecessors > who would care for their children when they went to Ottawa.‚Äù In March 2019 on International Women's Day, Lockhart participated in a roundtable hosted by the Women's Enterprise Organizations of Canada (WEOC) in Kelowna, BC. The purpose of the roundtable was to discuss the future of women entrepreneurs.

Also, Lockhart was a Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business and Tourism from September 2017 to August 2018, as well as Parliamentary Secretary of Official Languages and La Francophone from August 2018 to September 2019. Lockhart is also a strong advocate for immigration, proposing a private motion M-39 to increase immigration to Canada, specifically to Atlantic Canada. According to Lockhart, \\"[w]hen Atlantic Canada does better, all of Canada does better\\". = 43rd Canadian Government = During the campaign, Lockhart was commended by Justin Trudeauas being a hard-working, connected member of her community with a passion for growing business and tourism. Following her defeat in the 2019 Canadian Federal Election, Lockhart took to Twitter to congratulate Rob Moore, and thank the voting district for allowing her the opportunity to serve. Despite the defeat, Lockhart takes great pride in making history as the first woman to represent the region at the federal level. = Parliamentary Secretary to Small Business and Tourism = Lockhart was Canada's Parliamentary Secretary to Small Business and Tourismfrom September 2017 to September 2019. This is a subject near to Lockhart's heart, as a previous small business owner herself. Since becoming MP in 2015, Lockhart has made many contributions to Canada's small business and tourism sector. In June 2018, Lockhart announced a federal grant of $180,000 to support business growth in rural communities.

Fort Greene is a United States Army Reserve installation in the Point Judith area of Narragansett, Rhode Island. During World War II this was a coastal defense fort, and together with Fort Church in Little Compton, it superseded all previous heavy gun defenses in the Harbor Defenses of Narragansett Bay. It is named for General Nathanael Greene of the Revolutionary War, who was born in Rhode Island.FortWiki article on Fort Greene History Fort Greene was built as part of a general modernization of US coast defenses, begun in 1940 with the outbreak of war in Europe and the Fall of France. The goal was to replace all previous heavy weapons, most of which were over 35 years old, with long- range ex-Navy 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 2 guns. Lighter weapons would be replaced by 6-inch guns on high-angle shielded barbette carriages. Ammunition magazines and the 16-inch guns would be in casemated bunkers to protect against air attack.Berhow, p. 205 The fort was intended to protect the approaches to Narragansett Bay as part of the Harbor Defenses of Narragansett Bay, and with a range of over it could protect the eastern approaches to Long Island Sound as well. It was mirrored by Fort Church in Little Compton near Sakonnet Point. Three reservations were acquired for Fort Greene 1939-1942, which was initially known as the Point Judith Military Reservation. The East Reservation was at the present Fort Greene Army Reserve Center, while the West and South Reservations are the present Fishermen's Memorial State Park. The South Reservation was near Point Judith Light. Battery Hamilton, or Battery Construction Number (BCN) 108, was on the East Reservation and had two 16-inch guns. BCN 109 was on the West Reservation and was designed for two 16-inch guns, but was never armed. To the west of BCN 109, also in the park, is a Plotting, Switchboard, and Radio (PSR) bunker. BCN 211 with two 6-inch guns was on the South Reservation, along with four \\"Panama mounts\\" (circular concrete platforms) for towed 155 mm guns.Berhow, p. 205 The Point Judith Fishermen's Memorial is next to the bunker of BCN 211; a path is also available to the top of the bunker. No interpretation of the military facilities in the park is provided. In 1947, with the war over, Fort Greene's guns were scrapped along with almost all other US coast artillery weapons. Several fire control stations were built in Narragansett, disguised as beach cottages as part of the Coast Artillery fire control system; these may date from the start of the Endicott Program circa 1900. Most have been destroyed; one (badly damaged by storms) is near BCN 211, and some survive and have been restored at the Camp Varnum National Guard facility, formerly Fort Varnum. Present A former 16-inch gun battery (BCN 109), which was never armed, is in the campground of Fishermen's Memorial State Park on the former west reservation, along with a Plotting, Switchboard, and Radio (PSR) bunker housing a plotting room as part of the Coast Artillery fire control system. The Fort Greene Army Reserve facility, on the east reservation, includes the former 16-inch Battery Hamilton.

Conservative MP Gerry Ritz caused controversy in September 2017 when he tweeted a link to a news story stating no industrialized nations were on pace to meet Paris Agreement carbon emission targets with the comment \\"Has anyone told our climate Barbie! \\" (referring to McKenna). Ritz deleted the original post within 20 minutes, afterward posted another message stating: \\"I apologize for the use of Barbie, it is not reflective of the role the Minister plays\\". Conservative leader Andrew Scheer condemned Ritz's comment later in the day and stated he would reach out to McKenna personally to \\"assure the minister that this type of behavior has no place in the Conservative caucus\\". In November 2018, in response to the Government of Ontario's decision to cancel all climate action projects supported through the federal Low Carbon Economy Fund, McKenna announced that the Government of Canada would work directly with businesses to re-invest the $200-million remaining in the province‚Äôs Low Carbon Economy Fund.https://www.canada.ca/en/environment- climate-change/news/2019/08/canada-announces-new-energy-savings-rebate- program-to-help-ontarians-save-money-and-fight-climate-change.html =Minister of Infrastructure and Communities= In November 2019, McKenna was appointed as the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities after serving as Canada's second-longest environment minister.

Her life had already been threatened once before in 2005. She also received threats before her murder in 2015.  Personal  Melinda Magsino was the daughter of an Philippine Army Colonel Danilo Magsino and Amelita, and came from a large family of six sisters and a brother. She attended high school at Sta. Teresa College in Batangas. At the time of her murder, she had been the partner of Benjamin \\"Benjie\\" Reyes for three years. She had resided in Batangas City, where she worked as a political journalist, and was buried April 19, 2015. Career Melinda Magsino worked as a Philippine Daily Inquirer correspondent until 2005. She was forced to leave PDI after an internal committee looked into allegations against her, including questionable ties to businesses and sources and competitor recruiting. During her six-year career with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, she exposed corruption within the Batangas City government, specifically that of late Batangas Governor Armando Sanchez. In 2005, Magsino exposed illegal gambling activities and called him a \\"jueteng lord\\" (gambling lord). In August 2005, Magsino resigned from the PDI and went into hiding after learning two convicted murderers had the intent of killing her. She once provided a voice over for a documentary on TV5. After 2005, she wrote for Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and after 2008, the Vera Files. In 2010, Magsino was the publisher, editor-in-chief, and reporter for the online news outlet Southern Luzon Inquirer. After leaving journalism, Magsino emerged from hiding and posted on her Facebook that she had worked as the Search Engine Optimization specialist and also worked at her partner's chiropractic clinic. She still made political comments as administrator of the Facebook group \\"Taga Bauan, Batangas Ka Kung‚Ä¶\\".  Death  Before Magsino was killed, she posted on her Facebook that she received death threats and was harassed. Magsino was shot by two gunmen on motorcycles April 13, 2015 at age 40. The shooting occurred at noon right outside of the apartment Magsino shared with Benjamin Reyes in Barangay, Balagtas, Batangas. The two suspects allegedly waited outside of the apartment for Magsino, with men in a van serving as backup. Magsino was shot close up in the back of the neck with a .45 caliber with the bullet's exit out of her left eye, and she died immediately. Security video caught the killers in the act. Investigation The Batangas City Hall in the background.Motives remain unknown with several speculations. The family claims the motive for the murder was Magsino's controversial political expos√© on the Batangas government. Partner Benjie Reyes told GMA News Online that Magsino was working on several possible stories before she died but did not disclose details. The topics of those stories remain unconfirmed. The mayor of Batangas denied involvement in Magsino's killing despite allegations. The NBI of Philippines, however, also were investigating a love triangle, but that motive was dismissed. On April 18, Magsino's father said the NBI had a suspect, but the family wanted to leave it up to the officials to handle the case details. As of May 8, 2015, the NBI was still looking for men in a maroon van at the crime scene. Two items of video evidence held by the NBI could aid in identifying both the gunmen and their accomplices in the van. The NBI also holds Magsino's computer and cell phone. In a most recent twist in the pursuit to arrest her murderer, Edgardo Paredes Luib one of Batangas PNP Top 10 Most Wanted, was arrested on Tuesday, March 5, at the house of his live-in partner in Santo Tomas, Batangas. Albayalde said Luib, who has a standing arrest warrant for two counts of murder, was identified through the help of a tipster, who provided the police information on February 4. Albayalde said Luib also admitted his involvement in the killing of Sytin on the evening of November 28 outside the Lighthouse Resort and Hotel in Subic Zambales. Sytin's driver was injured during the incident. On August 8 page A19 of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, former Bauan mayor Ryanh Dolor was named the sole suspect linked to the murder of Mei Magsino. The news came on the day that he was invited to Camp Crame when President Duterte identified him as a drug lord and to shed light in his involvement in the illicit drug trade in Batangas Province. As of this date he is the only public official in Batangas identified.  Context  In the Philippines, out of 129 journalists that have been killed since 1992, 52 of those, including Magsino's, have unconfirmed motives. Under President Benigno Aquino III's administration, she was the 32nd journalist to have been killed and 173rd journalist since 1986. After Magsino's death, five Batangas cops were removed from their positions due to their failure to prevent the murder.  Impact  Magsino won an award within the PDI for the co-written story \\"Swiss government probes $2-M Nani account,\\" which was co-written with Clarissa Batino. Magsino used unnamed officials' disclosure of the government's investigation of Justice Secretary Hernando Perez for money laundering.  Reactions  Vice President Jejomar Binay said, \\"There are no words strong enough to convey my disgust with the continued killings of our journalists. The press is a key institution in a democratic society and the protection of all media practitioners is a responsibility of the State and one that should be given priority.\\" The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said, \\"Mei's murder not only highlights the fact that leaving journalism is no guarantee of safety from the perils of the profession ‚Äì especially not from those with long memories and deadly intent ‚Äì it also underscores the depths to which the culture of impunity has become entrenched in our country and society, courtesy of a government that has shown only the most cursory regard for human rights.\\" Jane Worthington, Asia Pacific acting director International Federation of Journalists, said, \\"The IFJ offer its condolences to the family and colleagues of Melinda (Magsino) who was murdered in cold blood. This senseless murder highlights the challenges facing journalists across the Philippines.\\" Inquirer publisher Raul Pangalangan said, \\"It falls upon us to make sure that indeed (Magsino's) death doesn't become just another statistic.\\" Partner Benjie Reyes said, \\"We just wanna see justice done. We wanna get these people (the perpetrators) off the streets because if not, they will keep repeating what they do.\\" In an email to Rappler responding to Magsino's death, media ethicist Luis Teodoro wrote, \\"Any journalist killed diminishes the number of voices necessary in democratic discourse. The possibility of (journalism) being abused is part of the risks of free expression. The abuse of press freedom can and should be addressed through self regulation.\\" See also * Human rights in the Philippines * List of journalists killed under the Arroyo administration  References  Category:1975 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in the Philippines Category:Filipino journalists Category:Investigative journalists Category:Journalists killed in the Philippines Category:Murdered journalists Category:People from Batangas Category:Philippine Daily Inquirer people ","title":"Melinda Magsino"},{"id":"48298103","text":"The Youyang anti-missionary riot () occurred in Youyang, southeast of Chongqing, Sichuan Province, China in 1865.Chongqing missionary riot, 2007.01.21.

The album collects Lopatin's early synth-based recordings under the moniker dating back to 2003, including the three limited-run LPs Betrayed in the Octagon (2007), Zones Without People (2009) and Russian Mind (2009), as well as several additional cassette and CD-R releases. It was originally released on No Fun Productions in 2009 as a 2 disc set. The initial issue of Rifts sold beyond expectations and brought Lopatin early critical praise; UK magazine The Wire named it the No. 2 album of 2009. In 2012, the album was reissued as an expanded 3 disc/5 LP set, including previously unreleased tracks, on Lopatin's own Software label. Recording and composition Rifts collects Oneohtrix Point Never's electronic recordings dating back to 2003, primarily drawing from Lopatin's trilogy of limited-run LPs: Betrayed in the Octagon (2007), Zones Without People (2009), and Russian Mind (2009). He began exploring sounds inspired by '70s cosmic music and '80s new age during his time as part of Brooklyn's noise music scene in the early 2000s. Following the recording of Russian Mind in 2009 he noticed a \\"clear arc\\" between his three studio albums,Kawaii, Keith (November 24, 2009). \\"Oneohtrix Point Never\\". Tiny Mix Tapes. Retrieved July 24, 2016. which suggested the records were \\"basically a Stanislaw Lem-style trilogy of stories about vague metaphysical sci-fi.\\" The Roland Juno-60 analog synthesizer, which Lopatin inherited from his father, served as his primary instrument. He noted that \\"a ton of [the material on Rifts] is improvised. With the exception of sequencer based stuff, I record straight synth jams and then use that as source material which gets fleshed out and assembled on the computer.\\" The compilation showcases Lopatin's distinctive approach to synthesizers, employing \\"ornate electronic arpeggios, often run through echo pedals, which spiral off into infinity with breathtaking effect.\\" Tracks like \\"Format & Journey North\\" utilize samples taken from YouTube. Describing the musical template of Rifts, Tiny Mix Tapes stated that \\"some will hear 80s soundtrack music, cosmic ambiance, or minimalist repetition, while others might pick up on the mishmash of noise and plastic, mystical new age music.\\" Critic Simon Reynolds described these releases as involving \\"rippling arpeggiations, sweet melodies offset by sour dissonance, grid-like structures struggling with cloudy amorphousness.\\" AllMusic wrote that \\"many of the song titles here feel like they could be the names of forgotten classics of '70s and '80s sci-fi films and literature.\\" The track \\"Emil Cioran\\" is named after Romanian philosopher and pessimist Emil Cioran, who Lopatin described as \\"one of my top dogs.\\" Release The 2009 edition of Rifts sold out its initial 2,000-unit pressing, far beyond expectations, and \\"propelled Lopatin to underground-star status.\\" In 2012, it was reissued in an expanded 3-CD/5-LP edition on Mexican Summer and Lopatin's own Software label, including additional tracks and alternate sequencing. The 2012 LP version collects the bonus tracks of Rifts into the compilation albums Drawn and Quartered and The Fall into Time, which were themselves released separate from the box set in 2013. The 7 bonus tracks on the original version of Rifts ended up being the contents, in order, of Drawn and Quartered. Despite its underground release, Rifts received widespread critical praise from a variety of publications. The Quietus located the album in a tradition of \\"chromed modernity and pulp futurism\\" rooted in the cultural milieu of the 1980s, describing the music as \\"acting like a cracked mirror refracting the sounds of the past.\\" The Line of Best Fit described Lopatin's aesthetic as retro-futurist. Tiny Mix Tapes stated that \\"the sounds on Rifts look to past versions of unrealized futures for inspiration,\\" adding that \\"hearing the record in one sitting is like being in two times and places at once, like watching someone from another decade daydreaming.\\" PopMatters located a feeling of \\"dyschronia\\" in the music, noting an affinity with the contemporaneous \\"hypnagogic\\" music scene. The publication described the music as \\"strangely familiar and familiarly strange\\" and suggested that \\"much of Rifts indeed feels like communication technologies carrying on without the influence of anything but themselves and their own mechanical history, surrogate from human involvement.\\" Rifts placed second in The Wire magazine's annual critics' poll of the records of the year. Following its 2012 reissue, Pitchfork called the album \\"an important touchstone\\" and stated that \\"the way Lopatin discovered fresh ideas inside of a worn-out genre is an inspiring story for the present age.\\" Track listing =2009 edition= =2012 CD reissue= =2012 vinyl reissue= References Category:2009 albums Category:Oneohtrix Point Never albums ","title":"Rifts (album)"},{"id":"48298148","text":"The 2015‚Äì16 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets women's basketball team will represent Georgia Institute of Technology during the 2015‚Äì16 NCAA Division I women's basketball season.

This initiative was inspired by John's personal work before his life in politics to advocate for business' to be more environmentally and socially conscious. M-151 was voted on December 22, 2018 and unanimously passed. The federal government announced on June 10, 2019 that it planned to introduce a national ban on single-use plastics by 2021, including plastic bags, straws, cutlery, plates and stir sticks. The passing of the motion also caused municipalities and provinces to act by implementing various plastics bans. Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador both became the first provinces to ban plastic bags. Two days before the federal announcement on banning single-use plastics, Tofino and Ucluelet officially became the first two municipalities in B.C. to implement bans on single-use plastic bags and plastic straws. Johns introduced his most recent piece of legislation during the 42nd Parliament on June 12, 2019 and presented M-245, a motion that would tackle seafood fraud and mislabelling in Canada. Seafood mislabelling and fraud in Canada is a serious public health issue, with 44% of seafood in restaurants sampled across five Canadian cities by Oceana Canada being mislabelled. The study showed that fish fraud had a negative effect on fishers and fish stocks, which found that 30% of the seafood samples were endangered, threatened, or vulnerable species. This misleads customers on what the health of the seafood they consume is and places the burden on how fishers are affecting the populations of at-risk species. Personal life Outside of his professional career, Johns actively volunteers, donating his time to a number of environmental and Indigenous initiatives. He helped found Tofino's Earth Week events, served as a Committee Tofino/Tla-o-qui-aht Higher Learning Initiative and served as a co-chair of the Pacific Rim Whale Festival Society.

He is a member of the New Democratic Party. During the 42nd Canadian Parliament, MacGregor sponsored three private member bills, though none reached second reading stage: Bill 252 to add Shawnigan Lake to the list of navigable waters regulated under the Navigation Protection Act, Bill C-279 to limit federal election campaigns to a maximum of 46 days, Bill C-430 to create an organic farming tax credit. Prior to his election to the House of Commons, MacGregor worked as a constituency assistant to Member of Parliament Jean Crowder. He also previously worked as a tree-planting supervisor and a millworker. Background Alistair MacGregor was born in Victoria, British Columbia and raised in Duncan where he attended Cowichan Secondary School. While working summers as a tree planter, he graduated from University of Victoria in 2003 with Bachelor of Arts, and subsequently from Royal Roads University in 2008 with a Masters of Arts with a focus in professional communication. In 2007 he had moved to Duncan where he began working as the constituency assistant to Member of Parliament Jean Crowder, who had offices in both Duncan and Nanaimo. There he married and fathered twin girls. Upon Crowder's retirement, MacGregor entered the NDP nomination race to select a candidate for the upcoming 2015 federal election in the new Cowichan‚ÄîMalahat‚ÄîLangford riding. In the January 2015 nomination election, the 35 year old MacGregor was selected over five other candidates. With the 2015 federal election approaching, the other parties also nominated candidates and the NDP leader Tom Mulcair visited the riding during his tour of Vancouver Island. The Conservative Party nominated North Cowichan councillor John Koury but he withdrew from the race less than two months before the election citing family issues and he was replaced by chiropractor Martin Barker from Duncan. Likewise the Liberal Party originally nominated Langford small business owner Maria Manna but she was replaced by former RCMP officer Luke Krayenhoff of Saanich after Manna withdrew due to a controversy regarding previous comments posted on Facebook. Despite an unexpected surge for the Liberal Party, MacGregor won the riding in line with pre-election polls that projected a NDP victory. While he won his riding, MacGregor's NDP lost seats nationally and fell to third party status, with the Liberal Party forming a majority government. On January 31, 2018, MacGregor was named the NDP's critic for Agriculture and Agri-food, and serves as the vice-chair of the parliamentary standing committee on Agriculture and Agri- food. 42nd Parliament As the 42nd Canadian Parliament began, NDP leader Mulcair appointed MacGregor to be the party's critic for seniors and its deputy critic for heritage. He was also appointed to sit on the Committee on Justice and Human Rights. MacGregor opened a constituency office in Langford and later one in Duncan. On March 10, 2016, he introduced his first private member bill, Bill-252, which would have added Shawnigan Lake to the list of navigable waters regulated under the Navigation Protection Act, in response to the previous parliament's Jobs and Growth Act which had removed it. On May 31, 2016, he introduced his another private member bill, Bill C-279, which would amend to the Canada Elections Act to insert a maximum duration of 46 days for an election period. This bill was in response to the 2015 election campaign which lasted 78 days, the longest in Canadian history, and which MaGregor viewed as unfairly favouring the most well-funded political parties. MacGregor held a series of town hall meetings in his riding to hear views on electoral reform and to promote the private member bill. In February 2017 Mulcair reassigned MacGregor to be the party's critic for Justice and in this role he held the party's stance that marihuana possession should be decriminalized during the process of its legalization. After Mulcair's resignation, MacGregor endorsed Jagmeet Singh in the 2017 leadership election.

Biography Originally from Regina, Wagantall was raised in southern Saskatchewan until she moved with her parents and six siblings to Esterhazy in 1967. On full scholarship, she completed three of four years of her Bachelor of Science in Physical Education with top honours at the University of Saskatchewan. During her summers, she worked in hospitals and level 4 care homes. After traveling the world for a couple of years, Wagantall and her husband entered into a partnership in a lumberyard and contracting business in Springside. They eventually bought out the other partners, then lost their business during the recession. Wagantall moved to Edmonton in 1985. She served as the Athletic Director for what was then North American Baptist College (later Taylor College and Seminary). In 1991, their family moved to Lloydminster, Alberta where her husband was a pastor in NewLife Community Church for seven years. During that time Wagantall coached community, junior and senior high basketball and worked as a teacher's assistant with special needs children in kindergarten and high school. Upon returning to Edmonton in 1998, Wagantall worked for ten years at Taylor University College and Seminary in development, accounting and student loans. She also worked as a Sunday School teacher. In 2004 Wagantall served on the Conservative Party of Canada Board of Directors for Edmonton-Mill Woods- Beaumont as the election readiness chair, president and financial agent. She door-knocked with then-candidate Tim Uppal against incumbent David Kilgour, and served as campaign manager for Mike Lake in 2006 and 2008. She served official agent for Tim Uppal in 2011. She worked in Uppal's Edmonton-Sherwood Park constituency office until March 2011, when she and her husband returned home to Esterhazy to own and operate Positive Signs, a sign and print company.Positive Signs In November 2014, Wagantall won the Conservative nomination in Yorkton‚ÄîMelville for the 2015 federal election. On October 19, 2015, she won the seat with 59.2% of the vote. In the 42nd Parliament Wagantall introduced one private member bill, Bill C-225 titled Protection of Pregnant Women and Their Preborn Children Act (Cassie and Molly's Law), which sought to add a new class of person, a \\"preborn child\\", into the Criminal Code and make injuring or causing death to the preborn child while committing or attempting to commit another offence against a female person that the person knows is pregnant to be a separate offense. While the bill was similar to Ken Epp's Unborn Victims of Crime Act, Bill C-485, which received second reading and referral to committee in March 2008 during the 39th Parliament, Wagantall's Bill C-225 was defeated in a vote in October 2016 with only members of the Conservative Party voting in favour.

The ear is enclosed in modified leaves called husks. Each individual fiber is an elongated style, attached to an individual ovary. The term probably originated somewhere between 1850 and 1855.  Development  Up to 1000 ovules (potential kernels) form per ear of corn, each of which produces a strand of corn silk from its tip that eventually emerges from the end of the ear. The emergence of at least one strand of silk from a given ear of corn is defined as growth stage R1, and the emergence of silk in 50% of the plants in a corn field is called \\"mid-silk\\". The silk lengthens from the basal ovules during the 10 to 14 days previous to growth stage R1; this is due to a change of shape of existing cells rather than their replication. The elongation progresses at 1.5 inches per day at first, but gradually slows as the full length is approached. Elongation of a corn silk strand stops soon after a grain of pollen is captured, or due to senescence of the silk 10 days after its emergence. If an ovule is successfully fertilized, the corn silk will detach from it two or three days later. Otherwise, the silk will remain attached indefinitely, and fertilization remains possible (with decreasing chances of success) for 10 days after silk emergence. For this reason, it is possible to sample developing ears of corn from a field, husking them gently with a sharp knife, then shaking them to assess the progress of pollination based on how much of the corn silk falls away.  Function  Corn silk is part stigma and part style, providing a female flower surface to which pollen grains can adhere and defining the lengthy path through which the pollen must transmit its genetic material. The stigma is the very tip of the corn silk, which has a larger number of hairs to help pollen to adhere to it. Kernel formation in the cob requires pollination of the external corn silk by wind or insects. Usually several grains of pollen adhere, but only one will successfully participate in fertilization of the ovule to form a corn kernel. For the pollen grain, the male gametophyte, to transmit its genetic material to the ovule, it must germinate and form a pollen tube that extends down nearly the full length of the corn silk strand. Typically 400 to 600 kernels are successfully formed in this way. The pollen tube extends at a rate of over 1 centimeter per hour, requiring only 24 hours to create a foot-long pathway within the intercellular space of the corn silk, through which the sperm cells (the gametes) pass to join the female gametophyte within the ovule. The pollen tube is produced by the single vegetative cell in the pollen grain, which passes its cytoplasm, nucleus and two sperm cells into the tube. The tube extends itself at the apex only, in an actin polymerization dependent process, and the direction in which the apex progresses responds to cyclic AMP levels, including cAMP cyclization by a pollen signalling protein (PSiP). Corn silk can control the types of pollen that an ear of corn will accept through expression of certain forms of the Gametophyte Factor 1 gene. Many races of popcorn, of the everta type, will greatly slow the development of pollen tubes from any pollen that does not carry a similar form of Ga1-S or Ga1-M, thereby preventing the ingression of genes (natural or engineered) from other types of corn. The popcorn remains free to donate its genes via its own pollen to other types of corn. The effectiveness of this restriction can be measured by planting the popcorn beside purple dent corn; the xenia effect would cause the formation of purple aleurones if kernels permitted themselves to be fertilized by pollen from outside the group. Organic farmers are pursuing the transfer of some of these mechanisms into non-popcorn strains for purposes of preventing inadvertent pollination by GMO corn, which under U.S. regulations can cause their product to be rejected as organic corn, and for which they have no recourse against GMO growers.  Pathology  In its adult stage, a Western corn rootworm searches for pollen on corn silk. This insect can be a cause of silk clipping. The moisture of freshly emerged corn silk sometimes attracts insects, which can cause silk clipping, which can interfere with kernel formation.  Applications  Corn silk contains a variety of pharmacologically-active compounds, and as such is used in many types of folk medicine, including as a diuretic and as an inhibitor of melanin production.

All three men were charged with murder 16 January 2004. On 1 March 2005, Keizo Sakurai was sentenced to an 18-year prison term after pleading guilty to charges. On 11 October 2005, Yoshihiro Kumamoto was sentenced to 14 years in prison for the murder and kidnapping of Someya.  Context  The murder of Japanese journalists is extremely rare. The last reported murder of a journalist in Japan was Tomohiro Kojiri - a reporter for Ashai Shimbun - was shot and killed on 3 May 1987 at Shimbun newspaper offices near Kobe, Japan.  Impact  The Kabukich≈ç red light and entertainment district of Tokyo.Someya's books, Kagi no Seisho and Kabukicho Underground, both became best sellers in the Japanese market. The murder of Someya created a public concern over the recent burglaries and murders of citizens in the Tokyo Bay area. The reports from his book Kagi no Seisho showed that over 11,000 homes in Tokyo have had their lock's picked in the year of 2003 which was an increase of eighty-one percent from 2002.  Reactions  Japanese journalist murders are extremely rare, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which investigated the murder and its relation to Someya's journalism. Someya wrote that he was in danger in the postscript to his last book Kabukich≈ç Underground. His murderer Keizo Sakurai made the following statement in his guilty plea, \\"If I did not kill him, I would still have been a victim of false accusations by the dirty writer and would have suffered social ostracism. I could not help but kill him.\\" Sakurai had been mentioned in both of Someya's books. In pushing for a lengthy sentence, prosecutors said, \\"The crime is extremely cruel and brutal, taking time in killing (Someya) to make him feel the horror of death for a long time.\\"  Books  * Kabukich≈ç Underground (2003) () * The Key Bible (Japanese: Kagi no Seisho) (2002) See also * 2003 in Japan * Yakuza  References   External links  * The End of Japan society Part 1, the secret list of customers for Lolicon Prostitution Horror Fact of Japan Category:1960s births Category:2003 deaths Category:Crime journalists Category:Deaths by beating Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Deaths by stabbing in Japan Category:Japanese journalists Category:Murdered journalists Category:Writers from Tokyo Category:20th- century journalists ","title":"Satoru Someya"},{"id":"48298491","text":"Monosemy means 'one-meaning' and is a methodology primarily for lexical semantic analysis, but which has widespread applicability throughout the various strata of language.  Originator  Despite several precursors, monosemy as a theoretical model was developed most prominently by the transformational-generative linguist, Charles Ruhl.  Principles  Monosemy as a methodology for analysis is based on the recognition that almost all cases of polysemy (where a word is understood to have multiple meanings) require context in order to differentiate these supposed meanings. Since context is an indispensable part of any polysemous meaning, Ruhl argues that it is better to locate the variation in meaning where it actually resides: in the context and not in the word itself. Wallis Reid has demonstrated that a polysemous definition does not actually add any additional information that is not already located in the context, such that a polysemous definition is exactly as informative as a monosemous definition when the effects of context are \\"controlled\\" for (i.e. systematically factored out of a definition). A monosemous analysis assumes that any sign in a sign system signals one value within its paradigm, with a substance that arises out of its diachronic history.Wishart, Ryder A. ‚ÄúMonosemy: A Theoretical Sketch for Biblical Studies.‚Äù BAGL7 (2018) 107‚Äì39. http://bagl.org/files/volume7/BAGL_7-4_Wishart.pdf There are some cases where a word genuinely has two meanings that cannot be brought under a singular, more abstract sense, but these are better understood as instances of homonymy.  Recent Applications  Monosemy has been used in work by the Columbia School of Linguistics, in areas of cognitive linguistics, and in linguistic research into Ancient Greek.Wishart, Ryder A. ‚ÄúMonosemy in Biblical Studies: A Critical Analysis of Recent Work.‚Äù BAGL6 (2017) 99‚Äì126. http://bagl.org/files/volume6/BAGL_6-5_Wishart.pdf  Other Understandings of Monosemy  Monosemy can also be understood as an attribute of a language (though this is not precisely what Charles Ruhl's theory articulates), namely the absence of semantic ambiguity in language. The artificial language Lojban and its predecessor Loglan represent attempts at creating monosemous languages. Monosemy is important for translation and semantic computing.

She has been appointed as Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on November 20, 2019. She formerly held the positions of Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Minister of Small Business and Tourism. Chagger was elected as a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada in the 2015 Canadian election.\\"Liberal Chagger takes Waterloo\\", Waterloo Region Record, 20 October 2015. Chagger was the first female Leader of the Government in the House of Commons in the history of Canada. Early life and career Chagger's parents immigrated to Waterloo from Punjab, India in the 1970s. Her family is Sikh. Her father, Gurminder \\"Gogi\\" Chagger, was active in Liberal Party politics and an admirer of Pierre Trudeau, and Chagger's first involvement in politics came in the 1993 federal election as a 13-year-old volunteer for Andrew Telegdi's successful campaign in Waterloo. She attended the University of Waterloo, with aspirations to become a nurse, but she subsequently became an executive assistant to Telegdi, who represented Waterloo in the House of Commons for the Liberals from 1993 to 2008. Chagger graduated from the University of Waterloo with a bachelor's degree in science. After Telegedi's defeat in 2008, Chagger became a director of special events for the Kitchener-Waterloo Multicultural Centre. Federal politics Chagger volunteered for Justin Trudeau's 2013 party leadership bid, and subsequently became the Liberal Party's candidate in the newly reconstituted Waterloo riding. She took 49.7% of the vote and defeated two-term Conservative incumbent Peter Braid, who had earlier ousted her former employer Andrew Telegdi. =Minister for Small Business and Tourism= On November 4, 2015 Chagger was sworn in as Minister of Small Business and Tourism.Record Staff, Waterloo MP Chagger named to federal cabinet, The Waterloo Region Record, November 4, 2015 As a result of the July 18, 2018 cabinet shuffle, Chagger's responsibilities for Small Business were given to Mary Ng, and M√©lanie Joly took on the responsibilities of Tourism. =Leader of the Government in the House of Commons= On August 19, 2016, Chagger was sworn in as Leader of the Government in the House of Commons replacing Dominic Leblanc in the position. She retained her responsibilities as Minister of Small Business and Tourism until the July 18, 2018 cabinet shuffle. On March 10, 2017, Chagger in her role as Government House Leader released a discussion paper titled Modernization of the Standing Orders of the House of Commons which sought to implement different ways that House of Commons procedure and practice could be improved to be more accountable, predictable and available to all Members of Parliament, and the public. The modernization paper suggested reforms to the House of Commons such as the implementation of electronic voting, the curtailment of Friday sittings, the reformation of Question Period, including a Prime Minister's Question Period, changes to the process of prorogation, greater powers for the Speaker to separate votes and committee studies on omnibus bills and legislative programming. Opposition Members of Parliament were concerned with the reforms proposed in the discussion paper, in particular with proposals to implement legislative programming and the elimination or change of Friday sittings in the House of Commons. In late April 2017, Chagger sent a letter to her counterparts, then New Democratic Party House Leader Murray Rankin and Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen, to inform them that the government would be abandoning several of the key proposals that were part of the modernization paper, such as changes to the Friday sitting, legislative programming, and electronic voting. They would continue however with proposals that were explicitly part of the 2015 Liberal election platform, including the decision to have a Prime Minister‚Äôs Question Period, requiring the government to issue a report following the use of prorogation, and allowing the Speaker of the House of Commons to separate votes or committee studies on different parts of a bill that he or she deems to be omnibus. =WE Charity Ethics Investigation= In July 2020, Chagger was the first witness who testified in front of a parliamentary committee investigating awarding of a sole sourced contract to run Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG) to WE Charity, an organization with close ties with the Prime Minister and Finance Minister.

Originally it was reported that WE charity would get a payment of at least $19.5 million, later it was disclosed that the contract was paying them up to $43.5 million to run student volunteer grant program.

During his time on municipal council Nater served as chair of the Environmental Services Committee. In 2014 the committee began a project to build a new water tower in Mitchell. He did not run for re-election in the subsequent municipal election, as he planned to seek the Conservative nomination for Perth-Wellington, vacated due to the impending retirement of long-serving MP Gary Schellenberger.

Nater frequently called the nomination partisan and questioned the Liberal Government's appointments process. During the 42nd Canadian Parliament Nater earned a reputation as an expert on Parliamentary Procedure. On March 23, 2017 Nater made an intervention in the House of Commons on the Question of Privilege raised a day earlier by Lisa Raitt and Maxime Bernier. Nater argued there was sufficient grounds for a Prima Facie question of privilege. On April 6, 2017 Speaker Geoff Regan ruled there was. However, during debate on the motion following the ruling the Liberal MP Alexandra Mend√®s moved a motion to proceed to orders of the day, ending the debate and with it the opportunity to address a violation of Members' rights. On April 7, 2017 Nater made another intervention asking the Speaker to revive the previous motion. Citing extensively from previous speakers rulings and the rules of parliamentary procedure Nater argued that the Government's motion to move to orders of the day during a debate on a motion of privilege \\"is an extremely dangerous precedent that denies members their fundamental right to vote\\" On April 11, 2017 Regan ruled in favour of Nater and invited him to once again move a motion to refer the issue to the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.

Built in 1860 as a wedding present for the Southern belle Catherine Hunt, the daughter of planter David Hunt, the mansion remained unscathed during the American Civil War of 1861-1865. By the early twentieth century, it was used as a shooting location for 1915 classic film The Birth of a Nation. The mansion burnt down in 1940. Location The name \\"Balfour\\" on this map - just above and to the right of the city of Natchez - is where Homewood is located. Homewood was located north of the Natchez, Mississippi city limits on Pine Ridge Road. History Homewood, by Frances Benjamin Johnston, 1938. All bricks were made on premises. Had a mahogany fanspread stairway Homewood was the antebellum plantation home of William S. Balfour and his wife, Catherine Hunt. It adjoined Catherine's sister Charlotte's Lansdowne Plantation. The 600 acre Homewood Plantation was a wedding gift to William and Catherine from Catherine's millionaire, planter father David Hunt. William S. Balfour's father, William L. Balfour of Madison County, Mississippi, was one of the richest Mississippi antebellum planters. He was a founder of the Mississippi College at Clinton. James Buchanan had picked him to run as his vice-president in the 1857 presidential election; however, he died before the election. William and Catherine's mansion on Homewood Plantation was the suburban Natchez equal of nearby Stanton Hall, which was in the town of Natchez. The mansion, designed by Scottish architect James Hardie, took the five years from 1855 to 1860 to build. While it was being built, William and Catherine lived on his Issaquena County, Mississippi Plantation. They moved to Homewood in 1860 with their six children. During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, William served in the Confederate States Army as a Major, and Catherine left by carriage with her children for about one year, moving from place to place. The family returned after the war to find that Homewood was intact. Without the slave labor from before the war, the Balfour's wealth began to decline. Generally, Catherine and her siblings used Cincinnati, Ohio real estate, inherited from her father David, mortgages on their plantations, and whatever else they had to support themselves after the war. The Balfours sold Homewood to Mr. and Mrs. William J. Kaiser of Natchez in 1907. The Kaisers ran a dairy farm on the plantation. Some scenes from the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation were made on the grounds and porches of Homewood. Beginning in 1932 Homewood became well known, because it was on the annual Natchez Pilgrimage houses tour. When their children were grown, the Kaisers sold the mansion and 73 acres in 1937 to Mr. and Mrs. Swan of New York, who had visited Homewood on a Pilgrimage tour, for $35,000. Mrs. Swan caused a lot of talk in Natchez. She and her husband, who was much younger, spent huge sums modernizing the mansion and expanding the gardens during the last years of the Great Depression. Their dogs slept on Beautyrest mattresses. The mansion caught fire in 1940. As it was burning to the ground, Mrs. Swan, with a bottle of whiskey in her hand, slowed the firemen's efforts by ordering them off the property. People speculated that the Swan's intentionally burned the mansion. The Swan's, however, collected $43,000 in damages from five insurance companies as a result of the fire and returned to live in New York. The old antebellum kitchen dependency building, which survived the fire, has been remodeled for use as a residence. The plantation was later sold to William D. Meriwether, Sarah J. Meriwether, and their children.The old carriage house, which also survived the fire, has been a residence and a clubhouse for the Natchez Country Club. Architecture Floor Plan of the First Floor of Homewood Mansion The Homewood mansion was about 72 by 96 feet. It had five floors. The basement had several rooms with fireplaces. The first floor had six rooms. The first floor rooms were divided by a center hall and a cross hall that ran just behind the two front rooms. The library, front portion of the center hall, and the parlor could be combined into a 72 foot long ballroom, when the large solid mahogany pocket doors connecting them were opened, that stretched across the front of the house. The second floor had a similar floor plan to the first floor. The attic floor had a large center room surrounded by eight small storage rooms. From the cupola and the adjoining widow's walk on top of the mansion, the town of Natchez could be seen in the distance. The mansion had two and one-half foot thick brick walls and thirty-five foot high, metal front porch columns with Ionic capitals. The sidelight windows beside the front door had imported pink glass from Belgium. Both sides of the mansion had two-story porches with metal lace-work railings. The imported Cordovan marble fireplace mantles varied in color. The library mantle was pink and grey. The drawing room mantle was white. The dining room mantle was pink with oxblood. Each of the eight bedrooms had different shadings. The interior doors were made of three inch thick mahogany. A curved stairway with fan shaped steps and a black walnut railing was in the rear of the central hall and connected the first, second and attic floors. A spiral staircase rose from the large center room of the attic to the cupola on top. A two-story kitchen flanked a rear corner of the mansion. The grounds also contained a two-story carriage house made of brick.

He is currently serving as the South Okanagan‚ÄîWest Kootenay member of parliament in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. He was elected to that position in the 2015 Canadian federal election as a member of the New Democratic Party. During that parliament he sponsored three private member bills: one to promote the use of wood in federal public works projects, one to add various lakes and rivers to Navigable Waters Protection Act, and another to a Minister of Environment to respond to a Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada report. Cannings was appointed the NDP Critic for Post-Secondary Education as well as the Deputy Critic for Natural Resources in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. Prior to being elected as a member of parliament, Cannings unsuccessfully sought election as a member of the legislative assembly of British Columbia in the 2013 BC election. Prior to his involvement in politics, Cannings worked as a biologist specializing in birds, taught at the University of British Columbia for 17 years, authored numerous books about birds and natural history, and was a member of the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada for 8 years. He is an alumnus of Memorial University of Newfoundland and the University of British Columbia. Career Like their father, renowned environmentalist Stephen Cannings, Richard and his twin brother Sydney and their older brother, Rob, were born and raised in Penticton and all pursued careers in biology. Richard earned a master's degree in zoology from Memorial University of Newfoundland. He taught for 17 years at University of British Columbia before returning to Penticton in 1995 to work as a consulting biologist, including doing work for the non- profit Bird Studies Canada. He spent 8 years on the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, 11 years on B.C. Environmental Appeal Board and five on the B.C. Forest Appeals Commission. He was a board member of the Nature Conservancy of Canada from 2006 to 2015. Cannings authored or contributed to numerous books. In 1987 he co-authored with his brothers Birds of the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia which was published by the Royal British Columbia Museum. Based on previous work, he co-authored Birds of Southwestern British Columbia and Birds of Interior BC and the Rockies In 2007 Greystone Books published a memoir style book of essays by Cannings titled An Enchantment of Birds: Memories From A Birder's Life and in 2010 Greystone published a book of essays, titled Flights of Imagination: Extraordinary Writing about Birds, edited by Cannings. Co-authored with his son, Cannings contributed to Birdfinding in British Columbia and Best Places to Bird in British Columbia, both also published by Greystone. Politics At 58 years old Cannings entered politics in 2012 seeking the British Columbia New Democratic Party nomination in the Penticton riding for the next provincial election. Cannings won the nomination over Summerland councillor David Finnis. However, in the May 14, 2013, general election Cannings lost to Penticton mayor Dan Ashton of the BC Liberal Party, which went onto to form a majority government with the BC NDP as the official opposition. Cannings continued with politics by seeking the federal NDP nomination in the South Okanagan‚ÄîWest Kootenay riding for the next federal election. He won the nomination over Margaret Maximenko of Christina Lake. In the October 19, 2015, general election, the 61 year old Cannings faced realtor Marshall Neufeld of the Conservative Party, Okanagan Skaha School District trustee Connie Denesiuk for the Liberal Party, Green Party candidate Samantha Troy and independent candidate Brian Gray. With 37% of the vote, Cannings won the riding though his party became the third party with the Liberal Party winning a majority government. During ensuing 42nd Parliament Cannings was appointed by NDP leader Thomas Mulcair as their critic on post-secondary education issues and deputy critic of natural resources under Carol Hughes. He served the entire Parliament on the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. Cannings sponsored three private member bills. On April 13, 2017, he introduced Bill C-354 which would amend the Public Works and Government Services Act which would promote the use of wood in federal public works projects. Similar bills had previously been introduced by Claude Patry and G√©rard Asselin in the 41st and 40th Parliaments, respectively. The bill was passed by the House of Commons with support from all parties except the Conservative Party but was blocked from proceeding in the Senate by the Conservatives. In response to the previous parliament's Jobs and Growth Act, Cannings second private member bill, Bill C-360, sought to re-insert several lakes and rivers such as Skaha Lake, Vaseux Lake, Tuc-el-nuit Lake, Osoyoos Lake, Christina Lake, Okanagan River, Slocan River, Kettle River, and Granby River back into the Navigable Waters Protection Act. However, Bill C-360 did not advance past first reading as the government bill C-69 was amending the same act to re-define what water bodies and watercourses are deemed to be reviewable as navigable waters. He introduced his third private member bill, Bill C-363, on September 22, 2017, as a response to the practice used by the Ministers of Environment in the 28th Canadian Ministry between 2011 and 2015 of avoiding listing species in the Species at risk Public Registry by not notifying the Governor in Council of reports received from the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Though Bill C-363, which would require the Minister notify the Governor in Council and recommend to list a species or not, did not advance but it was adopted as a Ministry of Environment operational policy. In the 2019 Canadian federal election, Cannings sought re-election in the South Okanagan‚ÄîWest Kootenay riding, contested by Penticton city councillor Helena Konanz of the Conservative Party, Tara Howse of the Green Party, Sean Taylor of the People's Party, as well as Connie Denesiuk again for the Liberal Party. He successfully won re-election with a slim margin over the 2nd place Conservative. {{cite weburl= http://www.pentictonherald.ca/news/article_9e26a7f8-f492-11e9-87b1-37ace612dab9.html Electoral record Publications * Birds of the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia - 1987http://dickcannings.com/my-books/birds-of-the-okanagan-valley/ * Birds of Southwestern British Columbia - 2005http://dickcannings.com/my- books/birds-of-southwestern-british-columbia/ * The Rockies: A Natural History - 2005http://dickcannings.com/my-books/the-rockies-a-natural-history/ * An Enchantment of Birds - 2007http://dickcannings.com/an-enchantment-of-birds/ * Birds of Interior BC and the Rockies - 2009http://dickcannings.com/my- books/birds-of-bc-interior-and-the-rockies/ * Roadside Nature Tours through the Okanagan - 2009http://dickcannings.com/my-books/roadside-nature-tours- through-the-okanagan-valley/ * Flights of Imagination - 2010http://dickcannings.com/my-books/flights-of-imagination/ * Geology of British Columbia: A Journey Through Time - 2011http://dickcannings.com/my- books/geology-of-british-columbia/ * Birdfinding in British Columbia - 2013http://dickcannings.com/my-books/birdfinding-in-british-columbia/ * The New BC Roadside Naturalist - 2014http://dickcannings.com/my-books/bc-roadside- naturalist/ * British Columbia: A Natural History - 2015http://dickcannings.com/my-books/british-columbia-a-natural-history/ * Birds of British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest - 2016https://dickcannings.com/my-books/%20birds-of-british-columbia-and-the- pacific-northwest/ References External links * NDP - Richard Cannings Category:Living people Category:1954 births Category:British Columbia New Democratic Party candidates in British Columbia provincial elections Category:Canadian naturalists Category:Canadian nature writers Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from British Columbia Category:New Democratic Party MPs Category:20th-century Canadian non-fiction writers Category:20th-century Canadian male writers Category:21st-century Canadian non-fiction writers Category:People from Penticton Category:Memorial University of Newfoundland alumni Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:Canadian male non- fiction writers Category:Current Members of the House of Commons of Canada ","title":"Richard Cannings (British Columbia politician)"},{"id":"48298641","text":"Chi√±i Lakha (Aymara chi√±i bat, lakha mouth, \\"bat's mouth\\", hispanicized spellings Chinilaca, Chi√±ilaca) is a mountain in the Andes of southern Peru, about high.

The assassinations took place during a period when Haiti was undergoing a turbulent transition to democracy, and those political tensions were manifested in the Little Haiti neighborhood by the deadly attacks on radio journalists. The attacks caught attention of the Haitian community. There was further interest in whether the murders were ordered by the Haitian military regime as that could possibly change the status of refugees from economic to political asylum seekers. In addition to the journalists, radio host Ringo Cayard owned a building that was bombed after D'Or's murder, and Daniel Buron, a bus driver who supported democracy, was assassinated on 9 March 1994 in Little Haiti. The FBI was brought in once it was determined that the motive was political. The three journalists belong to the group of eleven race and ethnic community journalists to be killed in the United States since 1977. Political context Little Haiti south side commercial center.Jean-Bertrand Aristide became Haiti's first democratically elected president on 7 February 1991 after a long history of dictatorships and a new Constitution. Even before the inauguration of Aristide, there was a failed coup in January 1991.Collins, Edward Jr., Cole, Timothy M. (1996), \\"Regime Legitimation in Instances of Coup-Caused Governments-in-Exile: The Cases of Presidents Makarios and Aristide\\", Journal of International Law & Practice 5(2), p 220. However, Aristide was in office less than a year before he was ousted in a military coup on 30 September 1991. Although President Aristide had a short-lived presidential term, he created hope among Haitians that their conditions would improve and managed to introduce some human rights reforms. The military coup that overthrew the government of President Aristide was under the leadership of Lt. General Raoul C√©dras, who had been selected by President Aristide to serve as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The United States pushed those governing in Haiti to reinstate Aristide and honor the democratic vote. A multilateral effort led to the diplomatic agreement known as the Governors Island Agreement, which was signed to achieve the return of Aristide on 3 July 1993. If successful, the process return of President Aristide by 30 October 1993. However, C√©dras defaulted on the agreement. This led to a United Nations' mandate in July 1994 to use force, if necessary, to restore the democratically elected president. With an imminent US invasion planned for September 1994, C√©dras left Haiti, which led to the return of President Aristide. Jean-Claude Olivier Jean Claude Olivier, also known as Division Star, (ca. 1944 - 18 February 1991) was a Haitian-born music promoter and radio host of the program \\"Radyo Pep-la\\" (Translated: Radio of the People), for WLQY-AM (1320) broadcasting in French Creole, and he was the first to be assassinated just 11 days after President Aristide took office. While Olivier was involved with music entertainment, he shared D'Or's or St. Plite's interest in politics and engaged his audience with political talk. Similarly, he was supportive of Aristide, belonged to the political organization Veye Yo, and called for boycotts of businesses in the Little Haiti that were not supportive of Aristide or democracy. He received a threat before his assassination as did D'Or. On the evening of 18 February, a band Olivier represented had finished playing at the Chateau Club and Olivier was leaving the nightclub. His assassin approached him and when he was close enough to Olivier, he shot the journalist three times, before making his getaway in a waiting car with a driver. The team that assassinated Olivier and the others were Haitian-Bahamian and were hired to kill from a list of names. While WLQY is a station that serves the Miami-area, its signal carries to Haiti and has an audience there. Fritz D'Or The murder of Fritz D'Or, or Fritz Dor, (ca. 1953 ‚Äì 15 March 1991), was the second in a string of political attacks by supporters of the former Haitian military regime who were opposed to Aristide. D'Or was a US Haitian journalist and radio talk show host for WLQY-AM (1320). He was assassinated by Billy Alexander in Miami, Florida, for voicing his support for the new Haitian democracy and President Aristide. Political activists described Fritz D'Or as \\"the heart of the community\\" in Little Haiti. D'Or had four children and took care of his paralyzed brother. D'Or was an active member of Haitian-American political organization, known as Veye Yo. Aside from his political radio commentary, D'Or was both on the board of directors and worked as a paralegal at the Haitian Refugee Center, in addition to his involvement in multiple community education programs. He worked at WLQY-AM (1320) as a pro-democratic and pro-Aristide Creole-language commentator and political reporter. After receiving several threats, Fritz D'Or was fatally shot four times and killed by Billy Alexander for US$2,000 at 8:55 p.m. on Friday, 15 March 1991. At the time he was standing outside his office close to the intersection of Northeast Second Avenue and 59th Street in Little Haiti, in Miami, Florida. Police later found a death list with D'Or's name on it, as well as two other prominent Haitian journalists. Billy Alexander, a Haitian American, was convicted of killing D'Or. Dona St. Plite Dona St. Plite, (1952 ‚Äì 24 October 1993), was a Haitian-born radio journalist, host, and commentator who worked for the radio station WKAT, in Miami, Florida, which served the emigrant Haitian community. St. Plite was the third Haitian-born journalist assassinated in Miami in three years for supporting ousted Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. St. Plite was the host of two radio programs: Tet Ensemble on WKAT and \\"Tet Ensemble Extra\\" (Translated: Heads Together) on WLQY-AM. As a commentator, St. Plite primarily covered human rights and politics. His radio shows featured guests, call-ins, and French and Creole music. He was normally on the air between midnight to 6 a.m. The manager of the station, Arnie Premer, said St. Plite owned a driving school and was planning to open a used car dealership. Dona St. Plite was shot numerous times in the chest outside Miami Edison Middle School located in the Little Haiti neighborhood of Miami on October 24, 1993, as he was leaving a fundraiser for the family of Fritz Dor, a Haitian-born radio personality who was killed in 1991. Dona St. Plite's name appeared on a hit list of supporters of ousted Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Although the list's origin is unknown, it contains an introduction of flattering Haiti's military government and announcing those on the list should be killed in order to keep Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide from returning to Haiti. A radio commentator, Nelson Voltaire, premiered on a show with St. Plite a few hours before the shooting. They deliberated the ongoing political chaos in Haiti, including the United Nations' determination to force the military to give up power and allow Aristide to return to office by October 30, 1991.St. Plite was assassinated outside near Miami Edison Senior High School. Trial Well before anyone was arrested or tried for Olivier's or D'Or's murder, rumors were rampant in the Little Haiti community about who possible suspects might be. Former interim Haitian leader Prosper Avril, who at the time lived in Miami, gives his own account of being the target of such rumors in his book An Appeal to History: The Truth about a Singular Lawsuit. After law enforcement officials completed their lengthy investigation, those who were charged lacked the political connections rumored. Instead they were hired hit men. It was alleged that Billy Alexander, born ca. 1970, was contracted to kill D'Or for his opposition to Louis Thermitus, a local record store owner, who D'Or had accused of being a member of the Tonton Macoute and of supporting the regime that had ousted Haiti's elected President Aristide. At the time of his arraignment and later his conviction for the murder of D'Or and Jean-Claude Olivier, another radio journalist, Alexander was serving a life sentence for killing Alcee Lissitte during an unrelated robbery in Fort Lauderdale in 1991. The look out man for the contract killing Glossy Bruce Joseph was arrested in May 1991 and later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in 1993. Hitler Fleurinord was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and accused of being the alleged driver. Thermitus was never implicated or charged in the murders. Moses Durosier was suspected of being in the car the night Olivier was killed. The authorities said Durosier agreed to wear a listening device while deliberating with Fleurinord about the crimes. The authorities also said Fleurinord said he and Alexander were paid $5,000 for one slaying and $2,000 for the other during the conversation. Impact The murders of Haitian journalists raised awareness about the dangers faced by ethnic journalists in the United States. Fritz D'Or is one of eleven ethnic journalists to be killed in the United States since 1977, which includes Chauncey Bailey. By the time that D'Or was killed, there had already been eight journalists murdered since 1982, making ethnic journalism one of the field's most hazardous jobs. Most of those murders remained unsolved. Alt URL While there have been more since St. Plite's murder, the media has deepened its scrutiny into the matter. Ha√Øti Observateur, a Brooklyn-based Haitian weekly, was harassed as a result of the paper's anti-Aristide position. In Haiti, Observateur journalists began to receive vague threats from anonymous callers. The staff was so frightened by the threats that the business manager began delivering the papers himself. After the murders of Jean Claude Olivier and Fritz D'Or, Creole-language talk hosts, heard as far north as Palm Beach County, feared they were victims of terrorism aimed at silencing support of democracy in Haiti. Reactions One thousand people marched through the streets of Little Haiti to protest that no arrests had been made in the murder of Olivier and D'Or and within one week the alleged lookout man was arrested. Ron Ilhardt, the homicide detective in charge of the investigation of Jean Claude Olivier and Fritz D'Or, said, \\"These men were killed for words they spoke over the airwaves\\".

He runs Chalchitra Abhiyaan , a film and media collective in Western Uttar Pradesh in North India, with a special focus on local caste, class and gender issues through film screenings in rural areas, training local people to make their own films and news features. He grew up in Delhi and attended Kirori Mal College in Delhi University. He was as active member of Players, the dramatic society of the college. He then completed a course in direction at the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, during 2005-06. Nakul was also actively involved with Jana Natya Manch. Notable Works =Muzaffarnagar Baaqi Hai= His film 'Muzaffarnagar Baaqi hai that released in January 2015 is an extensively researched film on the sectarian violence in North India in September 2013, Muzaffarnagar riots, just a few months before the general elections in India. The film traces the economic, communal and sociological fallout of the violence that not just led to religious polarisation for political gains but also displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The screening of the film was stopped by right wing fundamentalists from the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad in Delhi University on August 1, 2015 where the filmmaker and the organisers including University professors were attacked. Following which over 200 protest screenings of the film were organised all across the country to mark dissent and support freedom of expression in India. Rohith Vemula, a Dalit PHd scholar, also screened the film in Hyderabad Central University on August 4, 2015 for which he was termed 'anti-national'. The film has been extensively screened and appreciated in India and screened abroad including MIT, Columbian School of Journalism, SOAS, NYU and others. It was also selected by Mumbai International Film Festival and the International Film Festival of Kerala. =Izzatnagri ki Asabhya Betiyan= His film 'Izzatnagri ki Asabhya Betiyan' (Immoral Daughters in the Land of Honour) released in January 2012 traces the resistance of young women against honour killings and diktats of clan councils called Khap Panchayats in North India. The film explores caste, class and gender intersectionality in contemporary India. Another version of the same film 'Immoral Daughters' has been screened at several international film festivals. =Kairana, After the Headlines= Kairana, a small town in western Uttar Pradesh's Shamli district was in the headlines in June 2016. This is when Kairana's MP, Hukum Singh, from the Bharatiya Janata Party, claimed that there was an exodus of Hindus from Muslim-majority Kairana because of harassment by Muslims. To substantiate his allegation, he released a list of 346 Hindu families who had supposedly migrated from the town. It didn't take long, but the list was soon discredited. Many in the list were still living in Kairana, some had moved out over a decade ago for economic reasons, and while some did claim that deteriorating law and order was a serious concern, no one attributed their migration from Kairana to a Hindu-Muslim conflict. The film looks at the town and its politics, and the issues that affect it, beyond the binaries of Hindu versus Muslim. The film speaks to a range of voices from Kairana ‚Äì from Muslim youth, to Hindus and Jains, the workers who have to travel far from the town for their daily wages, Dalits and women. The town, like many others in UP (and perhaps India) is today confronted with the grim reality of its real issues being glossed over under the shrill rhetoric of religious polarisation imposed on residents by influential politicians. In the midst of this despair, the film looks at the daily resistance of the people of Kairana and their struggles to bring back to the fore the real issues that afflict them. The film was instrumental in dispelling the myth around the communal binaries and exodus. It was widely acclaimed and released jointly by Chalchitra Abhiyaan and The Wire. It was screened at Film South Asia 2017, SOAS, London among other places. =Savitri's Sisters= One year after the public flogging of Dalits at Una in Gujarat, a call was given for ‚ÄòAzadi Kooch‚Äô yatra (march). The yatra travelled through several towns and villages of Gujarat. The main demand was the handing over of land which was allocated to Dalits on paper, but has been illegally occupied by people from dominant castes for several years. During the yatra, a whole range of other socio-political and economic issues were raised; the issue of gender justice was the most prominent. Savitri's Sisters at Azadi Kooch looks at two emerging Dalit women leaders, Laxmiben and Madhuben, and their participation in the yatra. The film traces their journey, their struggles to reclaim the land that rightfully belong to Dalits and also an internal struggle within the movement to ensure that gender justice becomes an inalienable aspect of the march, as well as the larger movement against caste and capitalist exploitation. As they assert their agency as women, Laxmiben and Madhuben, in the process of discovering a world outside the domestic spheres, also hope to inspire many other Dalit women to join them in their journey towards an egalitarian society. The film was screened at various Indian film festivals and was released online. The film was especially applauded for documenting the making of new leadership among Dalit women, a theme rarely touched upon in contemporary Indian documentaries. =With a Little Help from my Friends= He directed his first film in 2005, 'With a Little Help from my Friends', which won the award for the 2nd best film at the 60 Seconds to Fame film festival in Chennai. =Other works= At the Film Institute, he directed 'Agaurav' and 'Undecided' that won awards for the 2nd Best Film and Best Director respectively at the Hyderabad International Film Festival. After completing his course, he made a feature- length documentary 'Once upon a time in Chheharta' on the history of the working class movement among the mill workers of Chheharta, Amritsar.

The species was found in the lower reaches of Han River in Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The shape of the first and the third uropods, the posterior appendages, alongside the relatively large size of the body distinguishes the Sinocorophium hangangense from other related species.  Classification  Sinocorophium hangangense is classified in the genus Sinocorophium, a genus of 10 species native to the marine and brackish waters of China, Japan, Vietnam and Korea. Sinocorophium is further divided into two groups, one being the relative ancestral and the other is a derived subgroup. The two groups are differentiated by the characteristics of the species' second antenna; first gnathopod, an appendage modified for feeding; uropods and pereopods. Sinocorophium hangangense is a part of the latter group among other species namely, Sinocorophium homoceratum, Sinocorophium intermedium, Sinocorophium japonicum, Sinocorophium monospinum, Sinocorophium triangulopedarum and Sinocorophium alienense.  Etymology and habitat  Named after the locality where Sinocorophium hangangense were first discovered, they are usually found in the blackish water regions and downstream in rivers where salinity is lower. They are mostly found in the Gongreung stream, a small Han River tributary in the lower reaches of the river. The naming, \\"han-gang-ense\\" came after the \\"Han river\\" as the Korean word \\"gang\\" means river. In Korea they are also known as Han-gang-baem-yeop-sae-u. Alongside Han River in Gyeonggi-do, they are also found in parts of Paju-si, Gyoha-eup and Songchon-ri, Korea.  Description  Being a part of the genus Sinocorophium, S. hangangense has a cylindrical body with second antenna resembling the shape of the crustacean's foot with ventrodistal tooth. First gnathopod's palm of propodus is transversed and distinct as it is dactylus rather short. Pereopods no. 3-4's carpus are not shortened, though, it's slightly shorter than merus. Pleonal epimeron no. 3 is subquadrately pointed posteroventrally. They have urosomites separated and laterally inserted uropod no. 1. The telson is short and subtriangular in shape. = Coloration = When preserved in alcohol, the body of the species is yellowish grey with a light brownish color between antennae and urosomites, the color reticulate pattern dorsally significantly the pereonities with light brown longitudinal rows. = Adult male = With distally pointed rostrum, triangular in dorsal view, the head of the species is longer than pereonite 1. The overall body is long. After preservation in alcohol the eyes are transparent, but the cephalic lobe is observed to be sharply produced. Shorter than pereonite no. 3, pereonite no. 1 and 2 is subequal in length. Urosomite no. 1 and 3 are separate. Antenna no. 1 is subequal in length to head and is weakly setose. However, antenna no. 2 is massive, twice as long as antenna no. 1. The telson is thickened, grooved centrally and fleshy. The shape is sub-triangular, broadest in the center and truncate at the corners. = Female = The body is almost similar to that of the male including antenna no. 2, nevertheless, the rostrum is weaker. Antenna no. 2 is less robust and shorter than male's antenna no. 2.

He was most notable for being a journalist who reported on controversial land claims, as well as being a political activist. He was assassinated by professional gunmen in rush hour traffic on 12 January 2012.  Personal  Wisut Tangwittayaporn was married to Jiraporn Hosakul. He was cremated at the Kajonrangsan Temple in Phuket Town. A billboard outside of the crematorium read, \\"The fearless reporter who never feared death ‚Äì Ae Inside\\".  Career  Wisut Tangwittayaporn was a journalist. He owned the newspaper Inside Phuket and he edited Phuket E-News. Wisut covered some controversial stories, including controversial land claims in Freedom Beach and other areas in Phuket and an expos√© on illegalities within the system of the transfer and promotion of government officers. Wisut was also the secretary of the Red Shirt political group, a group that opposed the military coup that overthrew Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and he led a local community group that opposed the private use of Freedom Beach.  Death  Wisut was killed on 12 January 2012 by two gunmen on a motorcycle. He had been under observation by his killers for two months. Wisut and his wife were in a black Honda Jazz on Thepkasattri Road in Phuket when the gunmen pulled the motorcycle in front of his car and shot him three times with four shots fired before making their getaway. The crime was captured by surveillance video. Wisut died in Vachira Phuket Hospital. Wisut's wife, Jiraporn \\"Ji\\" Hosakul, survived the attack unharmed and was able to describe the gunmen and vehicle to police. There were also other witnesses at the scene. Noppadol \\"Pae\\" Praisri was arrested and confessed to being the driver of the motorcycle. He said he was paid 50,000 baht. He also accused Sanya \\"Noo\\" Klinchum of being the gunman. Noppadol reenacted the crime for the police and images of his demonstration appeared in the media. Sanya \\"Noo\\" Klinchum was arrested as the gunman. Noppadol implicated Somkuan \\"Mr. Boy\\" Deepan as the person who arranged the shooting and paid for it but Somkuan remains uncaught today. The main suspect for ordering the murder was Ausadakorn \\"Pord\\" Sidorkbaow, the director of KPP Cable TV and deputy director of the Phuket's Chamber of Commerce. Ausadakorn was allegedly friends with Somkuan, or \\"Mr. Boy\\", and he was mentioned in a column written by Wisut. For his part Ausadakorn said Somokuan had been a worker at one of his construction sites and that he was friends with Wisut. Without the confession of Somkuan, he was granted bail, he denied any involvement, and he was never convicted.

There were several other murders related to the real estate industry in the province around the time of Wisut's death as well.  Impact  After Wisut's death, Pheu Thai Party officials investigated the land at Freedom Beach, which is associated with his reporting and political activity.  Reactions  The murder of Wisut Tangwittayaporn was condemned by the UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova, who called for an investigation and labeled it violation of the human right of expression. The statement read: \\"Media professionals and owners must be allowed to carry out their work freely and without fear. Only under such conditions can the media fulfill its responsibilities, contributing to democracy and good governance. This brutal killing must be investigated and its perpetrators be brought to trial in the interest of press freedom and the fundamental human right of freedom of expression.\\" Thida Thavornseth, leader of the Red Shirts, said, \\"Mr Ae was a very brave man. First, because he was fearless in his reporting. Second, because he was openly a red shirt supporter, which is rare in the South ‚Äì this is not a ‚Äòred-shirt‚Äô area. To do what he did was very dangerous. Some people in Thailand still solve problems in barbaric ways. This is an indicator of an undeveloped country. I want to pass this message on to all people in the media: to report all facts truly and accurately without fear. Those who think differently than those around them, should be able to walk freely through society without fear of repercussions.\\" Phuket's Governor Tri Augkaradacha took personal interest in the investigation.

It sees the return of full-art basic lands, last seen in the Zendikar block. It is also the first block in Magic (since the Shadowmoor block) to use the new Two-Block Paradigm, wherein each block has two sets instead of the three that were previously used (the last block having three sets being the Khans of Tarkir block).  Story  = Battle for Zendikar = Battle for Zendikar revolves around the Eldrazi, ancient monstrosities that are bent on destroying the entire plane of Zendikar, within which they were once imprisoned, and their fight against the Allies defending their home plane. The creature cards are split along these lines, with most being either on the Eldrazi side or the Ally side. Eldrazi cards are generally very powerful or aid in playing them, while Ally cards give bonuses to each other whenever one comes into play. As the Eldrazi are decimating the plane, six Planeswalkers each have their own role in the resistance. Jace Beleren, a logical mage, and Ugin, an ancient dragon, are working together to find a way to defeat the Eldrazi; Gideon, a human who fights for justice and honor, is rounding up the survivors; Ob Nixilis, a demon who lost his powers as a Planeswalker, is trying to regain his abilities; Kiora, a merfolk native to Zendikar, is eager to use her new discoveries on other planes to help her home plane, and Nissa Revane, an elf from Zendikar, who lost her connection to the land and regains it in a surprisingly powerful manner. In the original Zendikar block, there were three chief Eldrazi, but most now are of Ulamog's lineage. As the block's story line proceeds, Jace disagrees with Ugin on how to handle the rampage of Ulamog and his brood: Ugin advises against destroying the titan, Ulamog, as the ineffable nature of the Eldrazi means it is unclear if killing their physical form will destroy them entirely, or merely free them to roam across the Blind Eternities, devouring planes unchecked. Jace, Gideon and Nissa settle on a plan with the survivors of the army that retook Sea Gate to channel the natural leylines on Zendikar in tandem with the Hedrons to encircle Ulamog, trapping the Eldrazi again. As the battle rages around the ruined city, the plan appears to initially succeed. However, the demon Ob Nixilis, having survived an apparently fatal encounter with Nissa earlier, returns to face the Planeswalkers again, interrupting the hedron alignment and subverting the power involved for his own purpose - regenerating his \\"spark\\", the essential power that resides within all Planeswalkers. As the hedron circle crumbles, Ob Nixilis uses his newly refound powers to raise the second of the three Eldrazi Titans - Kozilek. = Oath of the Gatewatch = Whilst Kiora leads a one-woman sea assault on Kozilek, Gideon, Jace and Nissa find themselves outflanked by Ob Nixilis. The demon attempts to trap them on Zendikar to be destroyed by the Eldrazi, much as he himself was, but is stopped by the unexpected arrival of Chandra Nalaar, who frees them to continue the fight. Ob Nixilis decides to planeswalk away and leave his revenge for later. However, the battle on Zendikar is going poorly. Kiora, the only planeswalker left to represent the Zendikari, is defeated by Kozilek and almost loses her prized possession, the Bident of Thassa which she obtained on Theros. The Zendikari army has been devastated, and Tazri steps up to reorganize it in Gideon's absence. The four planeswalkers emerge from Ob Nixilis' erstwhile prison to discover the Sea Gate destroyed and the Zendikari in disarray. They will not be able to trap both Eldrazi using the Hedrons, and none of them are powerful enough to fight alone. Jace suggests simply planeswalking away, but Gideon suggests they swear an oath as they overlook the Sea Gate‚Äîthe Oath of the Gatewatch, in which they promise to cooperate to defend the Multiverse against extraplanar threats. And since the Eldrazi are extraplanar threats and cannot be contained, the newly formed Gatewatch have only one option: kill them outright. Jace lays out their battle plan: the corporeal forms of the Eldrazi, monstrous though they are, are only part of their existence; the rest of them reside in the Blind Eternities, the whirling chaos between planes. This is why Ugin has always counseled against destroying the Eldrazi's corporeal forms. Jace's solution is to draw Ulamog and Kozilek entirely into Zendikar so that they can be fully slain. Whilst Gideon, Kiora, Chandra, Tazri and the Zendikari army distract the Eldrazi with battle, Jace and Nissa are to use the remaining Hedrons to anchor them in corporeal form. The plane of Zendikar itself, which has been trying to consume the titans ever since they were imprisoned there, will do the rest. Or, at least, that's the plan. Zendikar quickly begins to struggle over the mouthful it has bitten off, and Nissa and Kiora, both Zendikari natives, almost come to blows over the fate of their home. It's Chandra who has the answer: Nissa redirects the last of Zendikar's mana to her, and Chandra employs a purifying fire that annihilates both Ulamog and Kozilek. In the aftermath, Zendikar begins to rebuild. Gideon cedes his role as Commander- General to Tazri. Jace still has his own concerns: of the three Planeswalkers who originally imprisoned the Eldrazi here on Zendikar‚ÄîUgin, Sorin Markov, and Nahiri the Lithomancer‚Äîthe latter two have failed to help; and when Ugin himself arrives, he has only criticism for Jace's impetuousness at destroying two lifeforms that are older than worlds, their purposes in the Multiverse unknown. Jace decides to hunt down Sorin Markov, who was last seen on the plane of Innistrad. Mechanics Battle for Zendikar features a number of new mechanics as well as a returning mechanic in Landfall: * Devoid: Devoid is a characteristic-defining keyword which sets the card's colour to colourless, regardless of the mana required to cast them. While functionally colourless, these cards were numbered in the set according to the colours of mana required in their casting cost. This is unique to Eldrazi-themed cards in the set. * Ingest: Ingest is a new keyword appearing on creatures in Battle for Zendikar. It is a triggered ability that exiles the top card of the opponent's library whenever a creature with ingest deals combat damage to him or her. Similarly to devoid, this is unique to the Eldrazi in the set. * Awaken: Awaken is a keyword found on instants and sorceries in the set, which allows the player to cast them for an alternate cost which in addition to other effects of the spell, turns a land into a creature with haste with a number of +1/+1 counters on it as defined by the card. This mechanic is unique to cards themed around the Zendikari natives. * Rally: Rally is a keyword found solely on creatures with the card type Ally in the set. Whenever an Ally creature enters the battlefield, it triggers its own Rally ability, along with those of any other Allies currently on the battlefield. * Converge: Converge is a keyword found on instants, sorceries, creatures and enchantments, and again is found solely on Zendikari-themed cards. Cards with this keyword gain additional effects, or have their effect become stronger, based on how many colours of mana are used to cast them. * Landfall: Landfall is a triggered ability returning from Zendikar and Worldwake, which triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control.  Zendikar Expeditions  Zendikar Expeditions is a set of 45 (25 in Battle for Zendikar, 20 in Oath of the Gatewatch) premium cards printed as part of the Battle for Zendikar block, consisting of rare land cards that were previously printed in other sets. The majority of these cards were highly sought-after when they were new, and now have a foil, full-art face, with new art and a special hedron-themed frame, which led to Battle for Zendikar being one of the most highly anticipated sets in recent memory. While the majority of the cards' original printings were at Rare, the Expeditions were distributed at roughly the same level as foil Mythic Rares.

It was built from 1930s to 1950s. It is also known as Alfredson's Pre-Cut House Workshop and Alfredson's Sawmill. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008.  History  The former Alfredson's joinery, pre-cut house workshop and sawmill complex at 28 King Street Cooran is evidence of the long history of timber-based industry in the Noosa Shire and North Coast region. The business was also involved in efforts to address the post-World War II housing shortage. The multi-level timber building, built on a sloping site with a combination of gabled, saw tooth and skillion rooflines, provides intact evidence of a timber-based family business premises that was operated, expanded and adapted between 1933 and 1990. Timber was the stimulus for the development of Noosa Shire. Development of the area was underway by the mid-1860s with timber getters active along the Noosa River and Kin Kin Creek. Around 1870 the township of Cooran began as a coach stop on the road from Tewantin to Gympie. This road was formed after a sawmill was established c.1870 at Mill Point, Lake Cootharaba, to supply the Gympie goldfield with timber. Logs from the mill, owned by McGhie, Luya and Co, were towed down the Noosa River to a depot at Tewantin. The railway arrived at Cooran from Gympie in June 1889, which helped the district to develop as an agricultural and timber centre. Shops were built along King Street in Cooran opposite the railway line, and the town became an important centre for loading local goods, freight, timber and produce onto the train. However, after the North Coast Railway between Gympie and Brisbane was completed in July 1891 the town of Cooroy, further south, became the main rail centre for access to Tewantin. Timber continued to be important to the economy of Cooran. Albert Doyle was sawmilling at Cooran by 1907, and other sawmillers operating in the town prior to World War II included Renshaw and Loseby, George Renshaw, and Straker and Company. Dairy farming also grew as an industry in the Noosa Shire, and butter factories were opened at Kin Kin (1914), Cooroy (1915), Pomona (1919) and Eumundi (1920). During the 1920s the Shire boomed, and a 1926 newspaper report on a typical load of goods dispatched from Cooran by train included: bananas, beans, gooseberries, pigs, butter, case timber and log timber, cream, and opossums. Mervyn William Henry Alfredson, born in Nambour in 1912, started his apprenticeship as a cabinetmaker with Page Furnishers in Pomona, and completed it in Gympie. He then returned to Cooran, where his father, Thorvald P Alfredson, was the Cooran railway station master. In May 1933 Mervyn Alfredson purchased of land opposite the railway station from Alice McIlwraith and set up a woodworking shop. In 1937 he married Mavis Miller, and for about six months they lived under the woodworking shop, placing timber from glass packing cases around the stumps to enclose the area. No evidence of this habitation remains under the present joinery. They then moved into a house at number 7 Henry Street, which has been occupied by the Alfredson family from to the present day, except for a period in the 1950s. Alfredson is first listed in the Queensland Country Post Office Directory of 1939, as a \\"Joinery & Cabinet Maker\\". As he was in a reserved industry, he was rejected for defence service during World War II, but his workshop supplied the Australian Army with tent floors, tent pegs and other items. In September 1942 Alfredson purchased an additional of land from Alice McIlwraith, to the south and west of his original workshop. In July 1944 the Widgee sawmill near Gympie was purchased to supply timber to Alfredson's operation, and M.W. Alfredson & Company was also formed that year. In October 1944 title for a one quarter share in the total landholding of and went to Robert R. Brown, with the other three quarter shares being held by Mervyn Alfredson. Alfredson's joinery complex appears to have been extended to the south and west, and given a skylight, in the late 1930s; and it was extended again to the south by the 1960s. By the mid 1960s the front (north) elevation of the joinery was truncated at an angle on the eastern side, as earlier photographs of this elevation do not display the current angle. The pre-cut house workshop and sawmill to the south of the joinery seem to post-date 1946. According to archived Queensland Forestry Department correspondence, in November 1946 Alfredson was seeking advice on the design of a timber seasoning yard, and was intending to erect a drying kiln and a boric acid treatment plant \\"in conjunction with his furniture factory and sawmill\\". A sketch from this time appears to show the joinery and a sawmill to its south and west. Apparently Alfredson's did have a sawmill on the western side of the joinery during the 1940s and 1950s, but they then lost the forestry license for this sawmill, and had to rely on the Widgee sawmill thereafter. However, there is still a sawmilling section at the south end of the pre-cut house workshop. By the early 1950s Alfredson had devised a system, based on ideas he had read about in journals, of pre-cutting morticed and tenoned house frames. In partnership with Queensland Pastoral Supplies (QPS), a company which sent mail order catalogues to country customers and with whom Alfredson had worked previously, he started manufacturing pre-cut houses. The houses, their timber bundled together and stencilled for ease of assembly, were despatched on rail cars from Cooran railway station. They were delivered with all their components from the stump caps up, with quantity lists and plans, mouldings, doors and windows, hardware and roofing. Pre-cut houses are sometimes referred to as \\"prefabricated\\", but more advanced forms of prefabrication involve whole walls, sections, or the complete house being manufactured off the building site, before transportation and assembly on site. Although prefabricated houses represent an attempt to bring the time and cost efficiencies of the factory assembly line to the building sector, they have never been popular, other than in times of absolute necessity. However, pre-cut (or kit) houses have been commercially successful in Australia since at least the early 20th century, perhaps because they provided an answer to labour shortages in rural areas without carrying the stigma of being fully prefabricated. One of most successful Queensland firms supplying pre-cut houses (to country districts only) in the early 20th century was Brisbane's James Campbell & Sons Ltd; Campbell Redicut Homes was established in 1903. A Campbell's catalogue c.1920 announced that all frame timber was cut, shaped and finished to set plans. The frame was erected at Campbell & Sons' Albion mill yards to test the fit, and the timbers were marked before disassembly. All materials, including cladding and joinery (doors, window sashes, railings, steps, and mouldings) were then despatched to their destination by steamer or train. Brown and Broad Ltd also operated in the pre-cut house market in Queensland prior to World War I, under the trade name of \\"Newstead Ready-to-Erect Homes\\", while Rooney and Co of Townsville provided pre- cut houses to North Queensland rural areas. However, the do-it- yourself trend grew after World War II, and pre-cut houses provided one answer to the high demand and high labour costs of the 1945 to 1960 period. For example, by 1952, there were about 15 local companies manufacturing pre-cut houses in Sydney. Although pre-cut houses increased in popularity, they were still only a small fraction of total Australian housing starts, and demand peaked in the early 1950s, before falling away in the late 1950s. Queensland Pastoral Supplies does not appear to have entered the pre- cut house market until after World War II. In October 1935 the QPS catalogue had advertised building material, tools, furniture, house wares, and joinery, but no complete houses. By August 1940 houses were being advertised at prices of and , but the timber was supplied in random lengths rather than being pre- cut. However, the 1954 QPS catalogue advertised Cooran Pre-Cut Homes, and included two articles from the 9 August 1953 edition of the Truth newspaper. The first Truth article noted rising housing costs, and claimed that after months of planning, QPS had tackled the problem, offering a 740 square foot house for just over . The article also claimed that the QPS had only been manufacturing the \\"Cooran\\" home for a short period, and that a display house had been built at Dell Street in St Lucia for Exhibition Week. The materials were entirely pre-cut, so that an amateur could build the house. The \\"Cooran\\", priced at in August 1953, had six rooms (including two bedrooms), and could easily be extended. The framework consisted of hardwood, the floorboards were hardwood, and the exterior was clad with hardwood weatherboards. The interior walls were clad with V-jointed pine, the ceilings with Durabestos, and the roof with English corrugated iron. The same house design clad externally with Durabestos was offered for . Two smaller pre-cut houses were priced at and , and a larger \\"Hibiscus\\" home was offered for . The second article in the Truth noted that every part of a Cooran home was marked, making it impossible to make a mistake during erection, and that every part of framework was morticed and tenoned where necessary. The 1954 QPS advertisement went on to add that since Cooran homes had been introduced over 800 had been supplied. Specifications on the Cooran homes noted that the wall studs were tenoned to fit into the morticed top and bottom plates and interior sheeting could be either four and a half inch tongue and grove V-jointed pine (hoop pine), or fibro cement. The floor was made with tongue and groove seasoned hardwood, and mouldings were Queensland pine (hoop pine). Joinery could be made with cedar, oak, or maple timber. The price of a Cooran No.3 home (timber clad, either seven inch weatherboard or four inch chamferboard) was now ; a Cooran No. 4 (Durabestos clad) was ; and the frame alone could be purchased for . The two smaller one- bedroom models still sold for (), and ( including verandah) respectively. A \\"Lazy Dayser\\" skillion-roofed weekend cottage was also advertised. A number of models of house were produced over the years, the known ones including: Hibiscus models number 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10; Cooran models 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 17 (model No.3 being the most popular); Tropical 1 and 2; plus garages, the one bedroom models, and the Lazy Dayser weekend cottage. There were also variants within the models - for example, models 3a to 3e. The marketing of Alfredson's pre-cut houses through QPS catalogues reflected the housing shortage and concurrent building price increases that occurred in Australia after World War II. Thanks to a lull in house building during the Great Depression of the 1930s, there was an undersupply of houses even before World War II. National Security Regulations issued in February 1942 limited private building to projects linked to the war effort. The undersupply of houses was exacerbated after the war by returned servicemen starting families, and also by strong post-war immigration. Prices were also driven upwards by a shortage of skilled labour, and the legislation of the 40-hour week in 1948. Another inflationary pressure was the lack of a ready stockpile of building materials. In 1939 the average five room brick house cost . By 1946 this had risen to ; by 1951 it was over . Although wages were rising, the price of an average house also increased, from three times the average pre-war income, to five times the average income by 1950. When cost increases were combined with the Australian Government's decision to limit the area of new houses to 1200 square feet for timber and 1250 square feet for brick until 1952, the result was \\"Austerity\\" housing, and the increased use of functionalist design. Functionalism viewed the house as \\"a machine for living\\", where form followed function and efficiency was more important than ornamentation. After the war functionalism would be widely adopted out of the necessity to reduce building costs. Austerity houses were small, with an eye to the future addition of bedrooms as families expanded. To save on the cost of building materials and labour, living rooms and dining rooms were combined into one space, entrance halls disappeared with the arrival of the \\"L\\" shaped house, and verandahs shrunk to small cantilevered porches over the front door. People made do with one chimney, and pretentious ornamentation was dropped. Building materials increasingly included asbestos cement (sold by Wunderlich as \\"Durabestos\\" and James Hardie as 'Fibrolite'), and compressed fibre boards such as Masonite and Cane-ite, as well as Timbrock hardboard. In the southern states a brick veneer over a timber frame became more popular. The emphasis was also on do-it-yourself building, as labour counted for about 50% of the cost of a house by 1948. Magazines such as \\"Australian Home Beautiful\\" catered for the proliferation of owner- builders in the 1950s, and newspapers featured stories on the housing issue and possible solutions, as can be seen by the Truth articles on Cooran homes. Between July 1951 and March 1955 around 140,000 Australian houses were owner- built; more than one third of the total. A government response to the housing shortage was the 1945 Commonwealth State Housing Agreement, and the Queensland Housing Commission (QHC) was formed that year, tasked with building houses for rent or purchase. By 1959 the QHC had built nearly 23,000 state houses, and about 96,000 state houses were built in Australia between 1945 and 1956. The housing shortage had ended by 1960. In response to the housing shortage, M.W. Alfredson & Company produced at least 1,200 pre-cut houses by the mid 1960s, when marketing through QPS ended. These included five houses built in Cooran, for Alfredson's staff, at 4, 5, 6 9 and 11 Henry Street; and four houses built in Cooran in the 1950s for the QHC. In 1965 a total of 62 houses were delivered to the Presbyterian Church's Weipa Mission at Cape York. Pre-cut houses had been delivered as far north as New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and as far south as Casino, New South Wales. Western Queensland station properties might order up to five houses over a period for their workers. Up to Mervyn Alfredson's death in 1973, about 120 houses were also custom designed, supplied and built locally, including several extant examples in Pomona: at the corner of Exhibition Street and Pavilion Street; at 7 Pine Street; and behind the Catholic Church. Alfredson died after he was hit by a falling limb from a cypress tree at Inskip Point near Rainbow Beach. Mervyn's share of the land was transferred to Mavis in 1982, and Brown's quarter share was transferred in 1985. Mervyn and Mavis's daughter Jeanette had worked at M.W. Alfredson & Company from the time she finished school, becoming proficient in all aspects of joinery and manufacture as well as doing office work. With her mother's health failing, she gradually assumed control of the business, which concentrated on the production of specialist timber joinery and cabinet making for custom orders. Government tenders were won, especially for schools. Doors and windows were also supplied for the Public Works Department in Queensland. Over the years a large number of people from Cooran and nearby towns were employed by M.W. Alfredson & Company. At its peak the business employed 32 men, plus logging contractors, carriers and subcontractors, and over 60 apprentices learnt their trade in the factory. A weatherboard clad building at 32 King Street, with folding garage doors and a saw tooth roof, was constructed in 1962 as an office for Jeanette Alfredson, and was known as the \\"front office\\" of the joinery. Behind the office was an area for sharpening tools, and underneath were quarters for the single men. Part of the building was used as a garage, and it still has a maintenance pit in the floor under a trapdoor. This building is not included within the heritage boundary. After Jeanette retired, the land was sold to Kesselwood Pty Ltd in March 1991 and to Kidman's Pty Ltd shortly thereafter. In 1997 the of land purchased by Mervyn Alfredson in 1933 (allotment 38) was split 50-50 between Kidman Pty Ltd and Marbelle Pty Ltd, while Kidman Pty Limited continued to hold all of Lot 41 (Alfredson's 1942 land purchase). In 1998 the total acreage previously owned by Alfredson was subdivided into its current configuration. Alfredson's complex now stands on lot 42, a combination of former lots 38 and 41 that has been fully owned by Marbelle Pty Ltd since 1998. In 2007 Alan Guymer operates a traditional joinery workshop on the former pre-cut house workshop (underneath and to the south of the former joinery), although his main business is building and demolition. The current machinery within and under the pre-cut house workshop, and most of the machinery in the sawmill section, was introduced by Alan. An original log carriage and its metal rails is still in situ in the rear sawmill shed, and original timber rails survive running north‚Äìsouth along the floor of the pre- cut house workshop, along with some metal gantry rails running east‚Äìwest across the ceiling. The top level of the building, the former joinery, is now called the Cooran Trading Post and Second-Hand Dealers (furniture). The shop still contains a lathe which is supported on concrete piers under the floor. There is no internal stairway between the former upper and lower workshops. Many of the building's stumps have been replaced by Alan over the years, and since 1990 he has also enclosed parts of a skillion roofed extension to the building west of the pre-cut house workshop.  Description  A long, rambling timber and corrugated iron building sheltered by a combination of gable, sawtooth and skillion roofs, the former joinery complex steps down the slope from a ridge along King Street at the northwest end of Cooran. The property is set against a backdrop of treed mountains and grassed paddocks to the south, has small scale domestic/commercial buildings adjacent and overlooks the railway to the north. The building now accommodates an antique shop at street level and a joinery workshop and timber working areas below. Approximately long and wide with a truncation to the northeast, the building is organised over three levels - the former joinery workshop at street level, the former pre-cut house fabrication workshop to the middle and the sawmilling area at the lower level. The former joinery complex is notable for the range of timbers used in the construction of the various parts of the building ranging from sawn and dressed timbers to logs retaining their bark. The joinery workshop is sheltered by a large gable roof clad with corrugated iron and has a small barrel roofed rectangular lantern along the ridge towards the rear. The workshop is timber framed, clad with a single skin of oiled weatherboards and supported on high round timber stumps set into the dirt floor below. The main entrance is through wide double timber doors off the truncated side to King Street. A sign above the main entrance says 'Alfredson's'. A smaller double timber door opens off the north corner of the building. There is a rear exit at a set of timber stairs descending from the southeast corner. Exposed timber trusses support the roof and the workshop has a fine tongue and groove timber floor. A line of single skin timber partitions divides the space along the west side. The workshop is lit from each side by a range of window types and styles including sash and casement. A lathe from the early joinery workshop stands to the centre of the space and is supported on a concrete base rising up from the dirt floor below. There is a small projecting alcove to each of the long elevations. Sprinklers are installed within the roof framing. The understorey has a dirt floor and is enclosed with vertical timber boards and sheets of corrugated iron. It accommodates storage areas, timber storage racks, a range of tools and equipment and the concrete base of the lathe. A grass and dirt driveway sloping down the property along the west side gives access to the middle and lower levels of the complex. This driveway is also part of the easement shared with the adjoining property. A lean-to garage/loading dock and office stands approximately down the slope and extends down this side of the building to the end of the former pre-fabrication workshop which it opens into. Sheltered by a skillion roof, timber framed and standing on tall round timber stumps, the loading/office area is partly enclosed to the west with a range of cladding materials including weatherboards and corrugated iron sheeting. A single-skin weatherboard clad partition separates the loading/office area from the pre-fabrication workshop. The pre-fabrication workshop is sheltered by two roofs - a sawtooth roof throwing southern light into the northern end of the space and a skillion roof to the balance. Timber framed, the workshop has exposed dressed timber trusses, sawn timber framing to the skillion roof, rough log beams and a steel beam across the south end. Rows of round timber posts support the roofs and the workshop stands on high round timber stumps. Enclosed to the east with vertical timber boards and open to the south, the workshop has a fine timber tongue and groove floor with a set of timber rails running along the centre of the floor to the narrow loading platform to the south. A trolley with metal wheels runs on the rails. Two sets of timber stairs descend to the sawmilling area to the rear of the complex. The understorey of the pre-fabrication workshop houses various pieces of equipment and timber storage and is enclosed to the southeast by corrugated metal sheeting. The sawmilling area, which includes timber storage/loading and log working sections, is level with the driveway on the west side and has an elevated platform to the east. It is sheltered by a metal trussed skillion roof and houses a log carriage and breakdown saw sheltered by a low narrow barrel roof to the upper level. The log carriage and saw are operational and the carriage has rails and a trolley. A small timber shed houses the recently introduced four-sider machine. The timber loading area, log working area, understoreys to the loading/office, pre-fabrication workshop and the joinery workshop now accommodate various pieces of timber working equipment introduced by the present owner and are used for storage of timber, joinery items and a range of equipment and parts.  Heritage listing  Alfredson's Joinery, Pre-Cut House Workshop and Sawmill was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Alfredson's Joinery, built and expanded between 1933 and the 1950s, is important surviving evidence of the timber industry in the Noosa Shire and the North Coast (now Sunshine Coast) region. The timber industry played a major economic role in the history of the North Coast region, which from the 1860s was one of the most important timber producing regions in Queensland. Alfredson's is important evidence of the manufacturing aspect of the area's timber industry from the 1930s to the 1980s. Its location at Cooran was close to timber supplies, and the adjacent railway facilitated the shipment of the joinery's products. The establishment by Alfredson's of a pre-cut timber house fabrication workshop in the early 1950s is representative of the response of timber firms to the Australia-wide post-World War II housing shortage. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. In the first half of the 20th century, the milling of timber and the manufacture of timber products was an integral component of the North Coast timber industry, a major industry for Queensland. Alfredson's Joinery complex is a rare surviving example of the pre-World War II era of sawmilling and joinery operations on the North Coast, and is also a rare example of a post-World War II pre-cut house workshop. The lathe and log carriage are important as rare surviving equipment from those operations. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. In its layout the Alfredson's Joinery complex is important in demonstrating the linear operation of a timber manufacturing process. This is evident in the planning and organisation of the sawmilling and pre-fabrication workshop where timber was unloaded and worked in the sawmilling area and then moved by trolley to the fabrication area where the timber passed through a number of bench and cutting processes. The finished fabricated components were then dispatched through the western loading dock. The construction of sawtooth roofs to the prefabrication workshop and lantern to the joinery workshop are good examples of the standard design practice of introducing as much daylight as possible into workshop spaces, particularly southern light in the case of the sawtooth roofs.

Paul was close to the Sun family, and to the politically prominent widow of Sun Yatsen, Madame Soong Ching-ling ÂÆãÊÖ∂ÈΩ° (1893‚Äì1981), also through his wife Eileen, whose father Chen Xing Èô≥Ë°å (1890-1953) was the right hand of T. V. Soong or Soong Tzu-wen ÂÆãÂ≠êÊñá(1891-1971), Soong Ching-ling's brother. He attended the University of British Columbia (UBC) for one year (1938‚Äì39) and then moved to the United States. = Student years in the United States = He entered the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1939 to study engineering, but soon found out that ‚Äúhis academic interests lay elsewhere, in International law ‚Äúwhich could be used to defend China‚Äôs interests‚Äù; he graduated in this field in 1943. At Ann Arbor he engaged in public speaking, winning the first prize at the 1942 Northern Oratorical League with a speech supporting Chinese war effort against Japan. He also became a member of the Chinese Students‚Äô Christian Association (CSCA), then the oldest and most influential Chinese Student Group in America, which was becoming growingly politicized due to the pressure of the Sino-Japanese War. He would become the Association's president in 1944. By that time he had moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to study at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and at Harvard. With the end of the war against Japan, as China descended into Civil War between Nationalists and Communists, the CSCA became more and more critical of the Nationalist regime and of American support of it against Communism. Feeling the increasingly hostile political climate in the United States he decided to move to China with his family in 1949, before finishing his dissertation at Harvard. In 1951 the CSCA was disbanded and restraining orders prohibited most Chinese students to return to the PRC. = Chinese years 1949-1964 = In China he became close to premier Zhou Enlai, thanks to his contacts with a prominent returned Chinese academic he knew from Michigan and Harvard, Pu Shouchang Êµ¶Â£ΩÊòå (1922-). He also became close to Soong Ching- ling, to whom he had family connections through his brother Andrew as well as through his wife. He worked variously as a freelance translator of contemporary Chinese literature and editor of an English-language international news bulletin. He was also a broadcaster and Artistic Director of English-language services in Radio Peking. He edited and narrated documentary films on China for the Central Documentary Film Studio. Towards the end of his stay, he was professor of international law and relations at Huaqiao University. In 1958, he took part in the first wave of \\"intellectuals sent down to the countryside\\" and spent a year working with the peasants in a poverty-stricken village in North China. Shortly before the start of the Cultural Revolution, Song Qinglin advised him to return to Canada with his family. = Return to Canada and role in the d√©tente towards China (1964-1970) = He returned to Vancouver in 1964. After a brief period of teaching at UBC, in 1965 he was offered a position at McGill, to teach Chinese History and head a new Centre for East Asian studies. At the time he was considered a controversial figure, object of a series of hostile editorials and reports inspired by Nationalist Taiwan. Even his brother David, due to his loyalty to the Chinese Nationalist government, of which he was an overseas representative in Canada, grew estranged from him. The death of his son Christopher in a car accident close to the border between the US and Canada in August 1966, raised a strong but unproven suspicion that it was a hit arranged by the Nationalist government as a warning to his father, a not unusual strategy at the time. He was one of the most influential voices advocating the recognition of China, most prominently at the 1966 Banff conference bringing together academics and foreign and Canadian diplomats, and at the 1967 Geneva convocation based on Pope John XXIII‚Äôs encyclical Pacem in Terris (Peace on Earth). In 1969 he organized the McGill‚Äôs China Consultation, bringing together Canadian as well as American academic and public figures with the aim to improve Sino-Canadian and Sino-American relations. On the Canadian side, this was an important step leading to the official recognition of October 1970 by the recently elected Trudeau government. On the American side, in January 1970 Henry Kissinger sent an associate of his, Ernst Florian Winter, to ask Lin to relay a confidential message to Zhou Enlai conveying Kissinger‚Äôs desire to meet Chinese leaders in view of a visit by President Nixon to China. Lin soon thereafter went to China to relay the message and meet Zhou Enlai, staying from May to October 1970. At his return he was the object of a parliamentary interrogation accusing Pierre Trudeau of planning to nominate Lin the first ambassador to China. = Later role as mediator and as academic (1970-1988) = While not receiving any such nomination, Lin was generally perceived as an advisor to Trudeau and Kissinger and served for the following years as one of the main informal channels between China and Canadian and American politicians, journalists and academics Beside this informal role Lin was a key player in developing economic ties between Canada and China, where in 1978 he led a ground-breaking trade delegation. He also advocated the formation of the Canada-China Business Council which remains a flourishing organization to date. On November 26, 1979, Deng Xiaoping met Lin and Frank Gibney of the US Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. During the meeting Deng announced a new stance on economic policy, introducing the concept of socialist market economy. Answering a question by Lin about past restrictions on the role of a market economy in China, Deng clarified: \\"why can't there be a market economy in socialism\\"? We can't say that this is capitalism. Our planned economy is in the primary position; it integrates with the market economy, but this is a socialist market economy.\\" He participated to the International dialogue with the Chinese Churches in Montreal, October 1981 where he met with his longtime friend K. H. Ting ‰∏ÅÂÖâË®ì (1915- 2012), then Anglican bishop of Zhejiang and a prominent figure in Chinese Christianity. He retired from McGill in 1982. In 1984 he collaborated with Gary Bush at the Canadian short documentary film \\"The Children of Soong Ching-ling\\", which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. He was appointed as rector of University of East Asia (later Macau University) in 1986. In his role as rector he conferred an honorary Doctor of Law degree on the former U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and the former Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. In 1988 he resigned as the Rector of the University of East Asia, due to the restriction of academic freedom under the Macau Government‚Äôs policy. = Later political activism and last years (1989-2004) = After his resignation, Lin settled back in Vancouver and became an Honorary Professor in the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia. He established and chaired the Institute's China Program for Integrative Research and Development and was appointed to the UBC Senate in 1994. He played a role in organizing a number of Vancouver's civic societies. After 1989, he became a vocal critic of Tiananmen repression. In 1998 he became a Member of the Order of Canada, the highest national honor. Equally active in community and charitable services, Lin set up a personal charity and donated steadily in support of children, hospitals, arts and social services in Vancouver. The Lin couple founded the Soong Ching Ling Children's Foundation of Canada which is devoted to linking the people of Canada and China, and promoting the education, health and welfare of children. During the last years of his life he worked on his autobiography, which was completed by his wife and published by McGill-Queen's University Press with the title \\"In the eye of the China storm: a life between East and West\\".  Personal engagement  * Soong Ching Ling Children's Foundation of Canada * Scholarship in memory of his son Christopher (1945-1966)  Awards  In 1992, the Hong Kong Society of Chinese Scholars named him the \\"Most Distinguished Chinese Scholar.\\" Lin was named a member of the Order of Canada in 1998, the highest national honor, by the Governor- General of Canada in Ottawa in recognition of his lifelong commitment to fostering Canada-China relations. In the words of a close friend and colleague, Lin was \\"a truly great Canadian and a great Chinese\\", a man who lived \\"a life of principle and a life of courage.\\"  List of publications  \\"The change of values in contemporary China.\\" Abridged transcript of an oral presentation given at the Report of a North American Working Party on \\"the Rise of China\\": Held Under the Auspices of the Political Commission of the World Student Christian Federation as a Part of the China Study Project at La Solitude, Montreal, Canada, January 7‚Äì13, 1968, pp. 197‚Äì209. \\"Historical Perspectives on Contemporary China\\", lead chapter in book, Contemporary China, Canadian Institute of International Affairs, 1968. \\"Beyond Coexistence\\", in Beyond Coexistence: The Requirements of peace, ed. by Edward Reed, New York, Grossman Publishers, 1968. \\"Education in China\\", chapter in China: A Century of Struggle, Canadian Institute of International Affairs, 1971. \\"Medicine in China\\", Center Magazine, Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, Santa Barbara, California, June 1974. \\"War or Peace: The State of the Globe\\", Symposium Transcript, U. of Pennsylvania, 1974 \\"Development guided by Values: Comments on China's Road and its Implications\\", concluding chapter of book entitled On the Creation of a Just World Order, ed. by Saul H.

It was built in 1923. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 December 2003.  History  The former Cooroora Masonic Temple was erected in 1923 and is opposite the Pomona railway station in the small Sunshine Coast hinterland town of Pomona. The land on which it is situated was part of an Agricultural Allotment of occupied under license by Robert Peter Grant in 1896. The area developed in the early 20th century with an economic base of timber, dairying and fruit growing. Page Furnishers Pty Ltd, a furniture making concern established in 1919, has also been a major source of local employment. The township of Pomona was named in 1900 for the Roman goddess of fruit and for much of the 20th century acted as a service and administrative centre for Noosa Shire. Freemasonry was established in Pomona in 1913. It had arrived in Australia with the first European settlers and spread from New South Wales into Queensland in individual lodges. The first Freemason's lodge in Queensland was established in 1859, shortly before Separation from New South Wales. New lodges were formed as settlement spread, as when a group of 17 Masons in Pomona applied to the Grand Lodge of Scotland to form a Lodge under the Scottish Constitution. This was consecrated as Lodge Cooroora No 1128 on 15 November 1913 at a ceremony at which 78 people were present. The first ordinary meeting was held on 13 December 1913. In 1920 the Lodge affiliated with the Grand Lodge of Queensland under the English Constitution and on 21 April 1921 joined the United Grand Lodge of Queensland as Cooroora Lodge No. 232. For the first ten years of its existence, the Cooroora Lodge met in a hall at the Noosa Showgrounds. On 22 May 1923 the Trustees of the Lodge purchased a block of land across the road from the railway station. A temple was erected using volunteer labour and cost . The first meeting in the new building was held on 23 June 1923. A local fruiterer and restaurateur, William (Bill) Hodge, who had joined the Lodge in 1920, was Master in 1924-25. In 1925 he began a project to embellish the temple that was to take nine years to complete. Working mainly in the evenings he painted trompe l'oeil murals on all four internal walls of the lodge room. These murals are replicas of those that decorated the Masonic Temple at the Criterion Restaurant, London and were featured in an article in the September 1921 edition of an English Masonic magazine, the Masonic Record. Using the small black and white photographs accompanying the article as a guide, Hodge reproduced the scenes of classical and biblical architecture on the walls of the Pomona temple. Between 1925 and 1928 he painted the Eastern and Western walls and between 1932 and 1934 the southern and northern walls. Hodge mixed the lead-based paints himself, using a neutral palette of beige, grey, black and white. During both periods he worked by kerosene light, as electricity was not supplied to Pomona until 1941. Hodge died in 1949 and is buried in Pomona cemetery. The subjects and symbols depicted are integral to Masonic tradition and philosophy. Although materially modest in value, reflecting the economic status of the small community who met there, the murals provide a sense of richness and elegance to what would otherwise be a very simple interior. They are valued and have been cared for by the members, remaining in good condition. It is believed that the Criterion Restaurant and the original murals were destroyed during the bombing of London during World War II and that no other known copies of the murals have been made. . Some of the furniture in the temple was made locally by Page, possibly by Herb Page who established the original cabinet- making workshop in Pomona in 1919. The number of lodge members peaked in 1965 at 55. Falling membership numbers and lack of funds to maintain the building made the lodge unviable and the building was sold in 2005, with the lodge then meeting at the Tewantin Masonic Lodge before being wound up entirely in 2008.  Description  The former Masonic temple is a rectangular timber framed building clad externally with hardwood chamferboard. It is set on low metal stumps and has a gabled roof clad with corrugated iron. A verandah along the front appears to have been built in and a small gabled timber porch shades the front entrance and is accessed by timber stairs to each side. Windows along both sides and the front have been blocked but the front windows lighted the anterooms and not the hall proper. The blocking of the side windows to the hall has enabled the murals painted on the interior to cover the whole of each wall. The front part of the building is an anteroom and contains portraits of Lodge Masters and Members. The interior of the lodge room is lined with vertical boards and has a coved ceiling. The ceiling and upper section of the walls is painted a traditional light blue, which also provides a suggestion of sky. Below this each wall is covered with a trompe l'oeil mural depicting famous buildings replete with Masonic symbolism. The Eastern wall depicts the Temple of Demeter and Dionysus at Eleusis, the western wall the temple of Theseus at Corinth, the Southern wall the Choragic monument of Lysicrates at Athens and the Northern wall the building of the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalem. The lodge room currently retains equipment and furniture pertaining to Masonic use including chairs was locally manufactured by Page.  Heritage listing  The former Cooroora Masonic Temple was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 December 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Cooroora Masonic Temple is important in demonstrating the development of Pomona in the early 20th century and the spread of Freemasonry through Queensland in the wake of European settlement. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The interior murals, which embody much of the symbolism and beliefs of Freemasonry, are thought to be unique in Australia. As the original murals appear to have been destroyed by bombing during World War II, the Pomona paintings may now be the only record of this work, originally carried out in the temple of the Criterion Restaurant in London. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Cooroora Masonic Temple is an intact example of a regional timber Masonic temple, a category of building prominent in the streetscape and important in the social life of many country towns. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The murals decorating all four interior walls of the temple have aesthetic value and represent a remarkable achievement for the artist, William (Bill) Hodge who worked from small scale black and white photographs in difficult conditions over period of many years to complete the work. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former Cooroora Masonic Temple has a special association with those Freemasons living in and around Pomona and with the Freemasonry movement as an early 20th century temple in Queensland.

In 2005 he collaborated with the electronic music composer Maurizio Martusciello in the audiovisual project X-Scape, presented at Mutek Festival in Montreal and IXEM in Venice. His work often revolves around Deleuzian ideas. He reportedly manifested his interest in \\"painting the forces\\" and the use of audiovisual languages as \\"affections in their pure state\\". In an interview in 2010, discussing one of his projects, he alluded to the concept of ritornell in Deleuze and the capacity of structured sounds, notably rhythm, to define a space. Casalegno's work often deploys technologies, ideas and aesthetics borrowed from science. He used EEG and Neurofeedback technologies in several installations and performances. His kinetic sculpture RBSC.01(2011‚Äì2014) is inspired by the RuBisCO enzyme, the most abundant protein on Earth. Talking about this piece, he stated: \\" After the disconnection from nature, desire is not coming from a lack of something, but out of production. [...] My machine is a kind of nothing in a way, because you need the symbol it produces to be within yourself. That symbol is this desire of transforming your environment in such egotistic and shortsighted ways. We might rationally conceive that we are going towards destruction, but we can‚Äôt escape to make ours what is outside of ourselves.\\" In other projects Casalegno tackles topics of ecology, system theory and biology, as in Strutture Dissipative (2009), \\"and the interactive audiovisual installation Il Gesto Sospeso, ideated in collaboration with the fashion designer Roberto Capucci and artist Maurizio Martusciello, and premiered at the Hadrian Temple for the Rome Fashion week in 2010. In 2012 he designed a visualization of data from the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute as part of a site-specific performance by environmental artist Lita Albuquerque for the Knowledge Festival at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. The durational performance was produced in collaboration with the LA Master Chorale and staged on one of bridges leading to the observatory. In 2016 Casalegno produces the installation TWINS, inspired by Kinbaku, the Japanese art of bondage: \\"I like this idea of tying down some sort of freedom in order to induce a heightened state of awareness. You're tied your entire life. I like that state of mind, where you feel in danger. Your body is more open, in a way. [...] It might be a statement on the way we're living, on the relationship we have with technology. In the end, I‚Äôm interested in talking about what we do with technology ‚Äì how we change with it.\\" In 2018 he created an immersive gastronomy project titled 'Aerobanquets RMX', inspired by the Italian Futurist's Cookbook. For this Mixed Reality project he collaborated with chef Chintan Pandya, food writer Gail Simmons, electronic musicians dj Spooky and Maurizio Martusciello, and restaurateur Roni Mazumdar.

It was built in 1950s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 December 2008.  History  The Cooroy Lower Mill Site Kiln, located in the Sunshine Coast township of Cooroy, was a timber drying kiln built in late 1956 by the prominent South Queensland sawmillers, J Wilkinson and Sons Pty Ltd and Straker and Sons Pty Ltd. South Queensland produced the largest amount of timber in the State by the middle of the 20th century: in the North Coast (now Sunshine Coast) region, timber was one of the most important industries in the 1950s. As late as the 1980s, a hardwood mill operating at Nandroya near Cooroy was claimed to be the largest in Queensland. The kiln at Cooroy was the product of a post- World War II trend in the sawmill industry towards centralisation and larger operations to enable economies of scale. One of the motivations for this trend was the need to acquire technology like drying kilns in order to remain competitive. The amalgamation of sawmills made greater funds available for this equipment. Improvements in road transport, which enabled timber to be transported from a wider area, made the trend towards bigger centralised operations feasible. By 1956, Straker and Sons and J Wilkinson and Sons already owned several milling operations on the North Coast. The Strakers owned the Cooroy Sawmilling Company located next to the kiln together with mills at Cooran and Gympie. J Wilkinson and Sons owned sawmills at Yandina and Conondale. The two organisations partially merged in 1956 to form Kiln Dried Timbers Pty Ltd, the company that operated the kiln and an adjoining planing mill (no longer extant). The kiln enabled the partners to accelerate the process of seasoning hardwood from their mills including flooring and chamferboard and to expand their market to include far western Queensland, Sydney and Melbourne. These markets demanded lower moisture content than could be achieved by air drying. The kiln was claimed to be the first built on the North Coast. As built in 1956, the kiln comprised a steam heated, cross shaft internal fan design that was common in Australia at the time. The design was obtained by the company from CSIRO. It consisted of four double chambers each with a height of and a capacity of 9000 super feet. They were fabricated from concrete. Carefully stacked timber was transferred into the kiln using trolleys on rails. Heat was generated by a boiler and transferred to the kiln chambers by a series of tubes. Hot air radiating from the tubes was circulated in the chambers by internal electric fans. The temperature in the kiln was designed to reach around . The boiler was fuelled by waste from the adjacent sawmill via a hopper and chutes (all extant). As well as providing steam for the kiln, the boiler powered a steam engine and electric generator (extant). Electricity from this was used to power the electrical plant including the fans. Also extant on the site is a reconditioning chamber adjacent to the kiln. This chamber was used to treat a condition called \\"collapse\\" brought about by abnormal and excessive shrinkage. The collapsed timber was steamed in a closed chamber with saturated steam at atmospheric pressure for a period of about six hours. Steam was injected into the chamber via a single perforated steam pipe. By the 1970s, an increasingly challenging timber industry made it necessary for Strakers and Wilkinsons to undergo a further amalgamation. They were also joined by the Lutton family's sawmilling operation and together they formed North Coast Sawmills Pty Ltd. The new company opened the large hardwood mill at Nandroya. This enabled the use of more efficient modern machinery and logs were sourced from a wider area. North Coast Sawmills' Cooroy mills were bought by Quintex in the 1980s and subsequently Boral Timber. Boral used the kiln and planing plant to produce and dry boards for flooring and decking. The kiln was closed in the early 2000s under the terms of the Regional Forests Agreement. In 2007, the kiln and adjacent sawmill sites were undergoing redevelopment as a public recreational precinct.  Description  Structures remaining from the drying kiln complex operated by sawmillers Wilkinson and Sons Pty Ltd and Straker and Sons Pty Ltd stand on the Cooroy Lower Mill site in an open grassed paddock to the east of Lower Mill Road on the north side of the town of Cooroy. They are within a larger industrial estate of modern sheds. To the southeast of the kiln complex a grassed track crosses the creek and connects the site back to the former Cooroy Butter Factory now operating as an art gallery and community centre. The kiln complex consists of a boiler shed with a prominent tall stack, hopper and chutes, control room, reconditioning chamber, a four chamber drying kiln and associated equipment, fixtures and fittings including a steam engine and electric generators in the boiler shed. = Drying kiln = An in-situ concrete structure with a flat roof, the drying kiln consists of four discrete chambers long and high. Each chamber is open at the north end and accessed by a hatch door from the control room at the south end. Trolley rails run within each chamber between narrow concrete platforms. Fans are fixed to and pipes, ducts and conduits run along the ceilings. Rails for a transfer line run across the north entrances to the chambers. Four sets of twin wheels and belts are fitted to the top third of the exterior west wall beneath the overhanging eaves. A projecting timber walkway with a timber balustrade runs along beside them. = Reconditioning chamber = A hollow in-situ concrete channel rectangular in section, the reconditioning chamber stands to the east of the drying kiln. Trolley tracks run within the chamber between narrow concrete platforms. The lower third of the north opening is concreted and the south end is sealed with a small opening for the air duct. = Control room = The control room comprises a narrow corridor running between the boiler shed and the kiln. It is sheltered by a skillion roof off the south side of the kiln chambers, clad with corrugated galvanised iron. The room contains pipes, valves, gauges and other equipment that regulates the functioning of the kiln chambers. Each chamber has a viewing window and hatch door access from the control room. = Boiler shed = A tall rectangular, single-skin, timber framed shed clad with chamferboards and sheltered by a gable roof clad with corrugated galvanised iron, the boiler shed is dominated by the boiler. Standing on a concrete slab floor, the metal encased boiler is supported on a brick base. A timber framed and clad chute feeds into the boiler from a hopper in the northeast corner of the shed and an exhaust stack projects from the boiler through the roof. Metal ladders are fixed to the north and south sides of the base of the stack. The tall chimney stack is secured externally with metal ties. Direct current and alternating current generators stand to the north of the boiler and each has a maker's plate from the English Electric Company Ltd London. A tall timber framed tank stand stands to the west of the boiler shed. There is no tank. = Hopper = A rectangular box tapering from base to top, the hopper has an external stud frame and a single skin of weatherboards. Twin fibreglass exhaust ducts project through the flat timber roof. A narrow hinged door opens out on the north side and a metal pipe runs up the northeast corner turning into the hopper near the top. A narrow timber platform to the northwest accommodates a small motor and a set of timber stairs at the southwest end descend from the roof of the hopper to flat roof of the reconditioning chamber. A timber chute runs from the base of the hopper up into the hopper in the boiler shed. Adjacent to the kiln site East of the kiln site, remnants of a former sawmill lay scattered about including trolleys, rails and concrete plinths. The site is presently used as an open sawmilling area and is not included in the heritage listing.  Heritage listing  Cooroy Lower Mill Site Kiln was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 December 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Cooroy Lower Mill Site Kiln (1956) is important in demonstrating the development of the State's timber industry insofar that it is a rare example of a timber drying kiln established on the North Coast (now Sunshine Coast) when the region was recognized to be one of the State's most important timber producers. As the first drying kiln to be built in the region, it demonstrates the trend from the mid-20th Century towards improving efficiency using more scientific methods. As the product of a joint venture between major sawmilling companies, it also demonstrates the trend, at the time, towards centralizing operations to finance shared capital equipment. The drying kiln enabled timber to be seasoned more rapidly and it enabled timber to be sold to markets that demanded lower moisture content than could be achieved by air seasoning. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The kiln is the only known example of a timber drying kiln in the Sunshine Coast region and it remains in a highly intact condition. A large number of sawmills and associated facilities were once located in this noted timber producing region. However, owing to economic and environmental factors, intact facilities have become increasingly uncommon since the middle of the 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The kiln is a highly intact example of a steam heated, cross shaft internal fan design. This design was once common in the industry. All of the operating elements of the facility remain intact including the fuel system, boiler, steam engine and electric generator, most of the heating tubes, fans, kiln chambers and reconditioning chamber. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Dominated by the tall rusting stack of the boiler, the surviving elements of the drying kiln complex are a monumental presence in the landscape. The place has an arresting impact as an industrial ruin - the concrete hulk of the kiln chambers, the rusted galvanised iron and weathered timber, the slowly decaying remnants of machinery, equipment, fixtures and fittings - all combine to evoke a tough industrial aesthetic.

In 1969, day scholars of the technical and commercial divisions separated from the Technical College to form East London Technical High School and the East London Commercial High School ( now Stirling High School .In 1974, after a proposition by the then head master, Dr. Johan Brittz, the schools name was changed from East London Technical High School to Port Rex Technical High School. The name \\"Port Rex\\" came from the British sailor who landed at the Buffulo River mouth in 1823 . Until 1947 East London was called Port Rex . Dr Brittz also played a significant role in drafting the current school crest. By early 1980s, the premises in Lukin Road had become too cramped to house three separate educational institutions. Urgent attempts were made to look for an alternative location for Port Rex THS. The De La Salle College (1935-1976) in Chamberlain Road became available and was bought from the Irish Catholic Brothers for R 6 million . Dr Brittz was again influential in negotiations with the Public Works Department so that the property was allocated to Port Rex THS. After major extensions amounting to R 3 million, the pupils and teachers moved to the new campus on 9 August 1982 . In recognition of the former dwellers the schools hall was named the De La Salle Hall. In 1988 the school declared its rugby fields officially open . In 1989 the school became co-educational, allowing girls to be part of Port Rex, and 4 year's later the school became a former model-C school in the South African schools terminology.

Life Walter Adolf Florens Hermann Kriege was born in Paraguay in 1891. His father, Johannes Kriege (1859-1937), was a German diplomat who during the early 1890s worked as the German Consul in Asunci√≥n. After taking part in the First World War Kriege completed his studies in jurisprudence at Berlin, where he obtained his doctorate. Between 1921 and 1923 he worked at the Reichsbank (German Central Bank). Between 1923 and 1944 he worked in the Prussian Justice Ministry, later transferring to the national State Justice Ministry. In April 1940 he was appointed Ministerial Director in the Justice Ministry, a post he retained till his arrest in July 1944. It subsequently emerged that a year after his appointment, on 23/24 April 1941, Kriege was one of several top government lawyers called to a special meeting at Hermann G√∂ring's palatial offices in Berlin at which participants were informed about the government's new (and subsequently controversial) Enforced Euthanasia policy. Between 1939 and 1944 Kriege also served as the president of the Senior Maritime Trophies Court (Oberprisenhof). Walter Kriege was nominated a member of the planned Goerdeler Shadow Cabinet as Secretary of State at the Justice Ministry or, according to another source, as Justice Minister.Gerhard Ritter: Carl Goerdeler und die deutsche Widerstandsbewegung. DVA, Stuttgart 1984. pp. 617-619. However, the planned government never came to power because the assassination plot against Germany's incumbent chancellor failed. Instead, Walter Kriege was arrested. Unlike many of those arrested at this time he was released a few months later, however, in November 1944. War ended in May 1945 and what remained of Germany was divided into four occupation zones, each administered by one of the four principal victorious powers. Later, in May 1949, three of the four occupation zones would be bundled together and re-founded as the German Federal Republic (West Germany). Between 1946 and 1949 Walter Kriege worked as deputy president of the \\"German Finance Council\\", located within the US occupation zone at Stuttgart, also holding the directorship of the \\"Finance Administration Office\\" (\\"Verwaltung f√ºr Finanzen\\") which in 1949 would mutate into the West German Finance Ministry. With the foundation of West Germany the country's new Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, was keen to appoint Walter Kriege as his Administrative Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The post was a particularly ambiguous one, because West Germany was established under terms established by the country's sponsors in the so-called Occupation statute of April 1949, which greatly qualified the autonomy of the new country and expressly excluded foreign policy from the Adenauer government's areas of responsibility. In the event neither Kriege nor , to whom the post was offered, accepted it, and during the early years of his chancellorship Konrad Adenauer ran his Foreign Ministry himself. Kriege himself took a bank directorship, probably before being formally offered the foreign ministry post, as President of the \\"Land Bank\\" (\\"Landeszentralbank\\") of North Rhine- Westphalia, a post he retained till his death just over two years later.

Along with the pamphlet, he also provided each recipient a Nicaraguan postage stamp that depicted the active Momotombo volcano.

Blaney is a Canadian politician who was elected during the 2015 Canadian federal election to represent the federal electoral district North Island‚ÄîPowell River. Blaney was appointed the New Democratic Party critic for multiculturalism, and subsequently for seniors issues, and the deputy critic for Infrastructure and Communities in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. She introduced two bills into the House of Commons. An Act to amend the Canadian Bill of Rights (right to housing) sought to add the right to proper housing free of unreasonable barriers into the Canadian Bill of Rights, though it was defeated at second reading, and An Act to amend the Old Age Security Act (monthly guaranteed income supplement) to provide guaranteed income supplement recipients assistance in filing yearly taxes. Background Rachel Blaney was raised in Terrace, British Columbia, as an adoptive daughter of a Stellat'en First Nation family. She moved to Nanaimo to attend Malaspina University- College where she received a bachelor of arts degree in First Nation studies. She moved to Campbell River in 1998 where she married, and raised three children. She worked with the Homalco First Nation before becoming the executive director of the Immigrant Welcome Centre of North Vancouver Island (later the Multicultural and Immigrant Services Association of North Vancouver Island) in 2007. In fall 2014, the 40-year-old Blaney sought to be the New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate in the North Island‚ÄîPowell River riding for the upcoming 2015 federal election, gaining the candidacy over challenger Dave Coles, a retired union leader also from Campbell River. She was encouraged by a visit from party leader Tom Mulcair in December 2014, and campaigned throughout 2015 in preparation for the October election in which she was viewed as a likely contender to wrest her riding away from the Conservative Party. In the election, she electorally benefited from a wave of NDP support over Vancouver Island and defeated Conservative Party political advisor Laura Smith, retired meteorologist Peter Schwarzhoff for the Liberal Party and financial administrator Brenda Sayers for the Green Party. 42nd Canadian Parliament Though Blaney was elected as a Member of Parliament to represent the North Island‚ÄîPowell River constituency, her party had lost seats overall and formed the third party in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. She opened constituency offices in Powell River and a shared Campbell River office with MLA Claire Trevena. For constituency work, Blaney hosted numerous public meetings on a variety of topics, including hosting Romeo Saganash to discuss aboriginal affairs and the NDP critic on international trade Tracey Ramsey to discuss the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Party leader Tom Mulcair assigned her to be the party's critic on multiculturalism issues and deputy critic (to Matthew Dub√©) for the Ministry of Infrastructure and Communities. Mulcair reassigned her critic role from multiculturalism to seniors issues in February 2017. Also in 2017, Blaney was named as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit for a Facebook post that read, \\"Taxpayers paid $550,000 for what? No notes, nothing tracking the work he had done.\\". The lawsuit was filed by Gordon Wilson, whose politically-appointed position as \\"LNG - Buy BC Advocate\\" was eliminated by a new provincial government and that Blaney ought to have known that the post was false. In the October 2017 NDP leadership election Blaney endorsed Jagmeet Singh, who went on to win and appoint Blaney as the party's Deputy Whip under Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet, and a year later, in 2019, added critic for veterans affair to her portfolio. Blaney introduced two bills into parliament. First, An Act to amend the Canadian Bill of Rights (right to housing) (Bill C-325), sought to add the right to proper housing free of unreasonable barriers into the Canadian Bill of Rights. It was the same bill that Peter Stoffer had introduced in the previous four parliaments (38 through 41), but while it received first reading in December 2016, the bill was defeated at second reading in November 2017 with both the Liberal and Conservative parties voting against it. Blaney went on to introduced An Act to amend the Old Age Security Act (monthly guaranteed income supplement) (Bill C-449), in May 2019, which sought to allow guaranteed income supplement recipients additional time to file taxes and to mandate Employment and Social Development Canada to provide assistance in their tax filings. Along with Courtenay‚ÄîAlberni MP Gord Johns, she advocated for reversing the previous government's scheduled closure of the Comox Marine Communications and Traffic Services. While the new government directed the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans to review the closure, they ultimately upheld it.

It occurs in people with reduced immunity. The maxillary sinus is the most commonly involved. Fungi responsible for fungal sinusitis are Aspergillus fumigatus (90%), Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger. Fungal sinusitis occurs most commonly in middle-aged populations. Diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor involved.subscription needed  Types  Granuloma The types of fungal sinusitis are based on invasive and non-invasive as follows: * Invasive :*Acute fulminant :*Chronic invasive :*Granulomatous * Non Invasive :*Saprophytic infection :*Sinus fungal ball :*Eosinophil related FRS including AFRS  Signs and symptoms  Individuals with the condition of fungal sinusitis mostly present with features that include facial pain and pain around the eyes, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea(running nose), headache, later there may be ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of ocular muscles).  Pathophysiology  The mechanism of fungal sinusitis depends on which form, such as: * Acute fulminant form ‚Äì the fungus invades into vessels causing thrombosis, necrosis with minimum inflammation * Chronic invasive ‚Äì fungal hyphae invades tissue leaving necrosis with minimal inflammation * Granulomatous form ‚Äì invasive hyphae invades tissue with inflammation and non-caseating granuloma (with foreign bodies). * Saprophytic infection ‚Äì growth of fungus seen on mucous crusts within sinus cavity. * Sinus fungal ball ‚Äì sequestration of fungal hyphae as densely tangled, and has gritty matted appearance. * Eosinophil related Allergic fungal sinusitis ‚Äì though not completely understood, a possible mechanism sees the protein component of fungus elicits IgE mediated allergic mucosal inflammation.  Diagnosis  In terms of diagnosis, the clinical examination gives an idea about fungal sinusitis, as well as: MRI :::::::*Suggestive clinical features include - multiple recurrent episodes, persistent pathology, and absent ability to smell (the Eustachian tube may also be affected). :::::::*X Ray - can be done if the diagnosis is not certain. :::::::*CT ‚Äì can document the presence of sinusitis, in the coronal views :::::::*MRI ‚Äì used to find the CNS spread (extent of the disease), to evaluate individuals who demonstrate signs of invasive fungal sinusitis :::::::*Histology studies  Treatment  Voriconazole Treatment for fungal sinusitis can include surgical debridement; helps by slowing progression of disease thus allowing time for recovery additionally we see the options below: * In cases where the fungus has invaded the sinus tissue, echinocandins, oral voriconazole, and I.V amphoterecin may be used * For allergic fungal sinusitis, systemic corticosteroids like prednisolone, methylprednisolone are added for their anti-inflammatory effect, bronchodilators and expectorants help to clear secretions in the sinuses.  Epidemiology  Though it is widely held that fungal infections of the nose and paranasal sinuses are not common, most agree that their frequency has been increasing over past decades.

The captain of the British ship warned the Zuhaf captain that any attempt to land men or supplies at Kuwait would be resisted by force, and the Ottoman captain misunderstood and telegraphed a report to Istanbul that Britain had conquered the Kuwaiti emirate as a colony. The German Empire, alarmed over the perceived change of the balance of power in the Middle East, would join the Ottomans in accusing the British Foreign Office of reneging on its previous pledges.

Participation is by invitation-only. All discussions take place under the Chatham House Rule.  History  The Mediators' Retreat, which in 2006 became known as the Oslo Forum, was initiated in 2003 as a small gathering of mediation practitioners. The first Forum only included 17 participants but the event has now expanded to around 100 participants each year. The Forum is scheduled over two days. In November 2005, a regional retreat was organised for the first time in Singapore to discuss peace processes in South and South East Asia. Since then, Asian and African regional retreats have regularly taken place to complement the global retreat organised in Oslo.  Purpose  The Forum aims to improve mediation practice, by facilitating open exchange, debate and reflection across institutional and conceptual divides, analysing commonly held perceptions about conflicts and providing a safe venue for sharing experiences and best practices. The Forum also provides informal networking opportunities that encourage coordination and cooperation when needed and facilitates space for conflict parties to advance their negotiations.  Participants  Dr Funmi Olonisakin, H.E. Mr B√∏rge Brende and H.E. Mr Kofi Annan Every year approximately one hundred conflict mediators, high-level decision makers, key peace process actors, war correspondents, outstanding analysts, thinkers and experts on specific issues attend the Oslo Forum.

The Winton Motor Carriage Company auto was the 40-horsepower Bullet, and Winton was the most successful of race car driver in America. Ford had never raced a car before, and was using the smaller, 26-horsepower Detroit Automobile Company vehicle, but he had one feature in his design, \\"a spark coil wrapped in a porcelain insulating case fashioned by a dentist\\",Vincent Curcio, Chrysler: The Life and Times of an Automotive Genius (Oxford University Press, 2001) p. 173 an early version of the spark plug. Heavily favored to win, Winton took the early lead, and was one-fifth of a mile ahead after three miles, particularly because he was on the inside and better at rounding curves and Ford often \\"shut off power and ran wide on each curve\\" David L. Lewis, The Public Image of Henry Ford: An American Folk Hero and His Company (Wayne State University Press, 1976) p. 18 Ford, however, gradually closed the gap on the straightaways and was catching up by sixth lap. Winton, on the other hand, began to have trouble as the ball bearings in his engine were overheating. After seven miles, Ford passed Winton on the eighth lap, and won with an average speed of 43.5 miles per hour. The upset win not only brought Ford (who would never race again) nationwide fame, but also attracted Detroit investors who wanted to form a new corporation, which would be named the \\"Henry Ford Company\\" to capitalize on Ford's celebrity. Despite the loss to Ford, Winton won most of the headlines, because he had broken the world record for the fastest speed to drive a mile, setting a new mark of one minute, 12.4 seconds and an average speed of 49.72 miles per hour.\\"Alex Winton's Fast Mile‚Äî Cleveland Expert Made the Distance in 1:12 2‚Äì5 at Grosse Point\\", Detroit Free Press, October 11, 1901, p. 1 *Thousands of spectators in Toronto heard the song O Canada for the first time in their lives, as the band of The Royal Canadian Regiment played the music while troops marched past the visiting Duke of York.

Built as residence for the attendant of Borgmestervangen and T√•dmandsvangen, two pastures available to the mayors of Copenhagen, it received its name after a Tage Nielsen who died in 1704. A so-called bird's pole (Danish: Fuglestang) had already been installed at the site in 1616. It was used for the king's falcons and later also for ceremonial shootings and as the location of illegal duels up through the 18th century. Holger Petersen's Textile Factory Tagensvej was originally only a track that linked Jagtvej with the Lers√∏en lake to the northwest. The area between Blegdamsvej and Jagtvej was still a military area when industrial enterprises began relocating the road in the 1880s. Holger Petersen (1843‚Äì1917) Holger Petersen 's textile factory occupied a new factory on the street in 1883. S. C. Hauberg established a machine factory on Tagensvej in 1885. Other early industrial enterprises were K√∏benhavns Saffiansfabrikm a manufacturer of goat's skin products founded in 1869, and Copenhagen's Horse Shoe Factory. File:J. L.

She designed a variety of projects in New York with her firm Edelman Sultan Knox Wood/Architects. A feminist, she was an advocate for the advancement of women in architecture and led the American Institute of Architects' first task force on women. Early life Edelman was born Judith Hochberg in Brooklyn in 1923. Her parents were migrants from Eastern Europe. She was interested in architecture from a young age after visiting an architectural office as a high school student. She attended Connecticut College, New York University and Columbia University, finishing her Bachelor of Architecture at Columbia in 1946. Career After graduating from Columbia, Edelman struggled to find work and was told by numerous employers that they would not hire women. She worked briefly designing mental hospitals before she was hired by the Greenwich Village-based architect Huson Jackson. In 1960, she co-founded Edelman and Salzman Architects (later known as Edelman Sultan Knox Wood/Architects) with her husband, Harold Edelman, and Stanley Salzman. Edelman was a frequent campaigner for the advancement of women architects and insisted that women should become involved in the American Institute of Architects (AIA) although it was \\"an exclusive gentleman's club\\". She was the first woman to be elected to the executive committee of the AIA's New York chapter in 1972. In 1972, she founded the Alliance of Women in Architecture, an organization to promote the advancement of women architects. The next year, she was a co-author of \\"Status of Women in the Architectural Profession\\", a resolution for the AIA that encouraged the institute to adapt to the \\"climate of change\\" brought about by the feminist movement of the time. At the AIA national convention in 1974, she gave a presentation about the fact that only 1.2 percent of American registered architects were women, claiming that the only industries with a smaller proportion of women were coal mining and steel work. After the presentation, she was recruited to lead the AIA's first task force on women, and came to be called \\"Dragon Lady\\" at AIA headquarters. She was the inspiration for Gloria and Esther Goldreich's 1974 children's book titled What Can She Be? An Architect. With the firm she started, Edelman worked on a variety of projects in New York City, including many affordable housing projects. One such was Phelps House, a housing complex with a community center for the elderly, completed in 1983. In the 1960s she worked on a design to convert nine brownstone houses on the Upper West Side into a single building while preserving their facades; the building is now 9G Cooperative Apartments. Her designs won awards from the AIA, the Municipal Art Society and the City Club of New York, and she and her husband won the Andrew J. Thomas Pioneer in Housing award from the AIA's New York chapter in 1990. Personal life She married Harold Edelman in 1947; they had two sons, Marc and Joshua. She died of a heart attack on October 4, 2014.

In the late 1720s Aggie tried to sue for her freedom. The attempt was unsuccessful, but managed to catch the attention of Lieutenant Governor William Gooch, who presided over the trial and believed that Aggie had made a good case of establishing her belief in Christianity. This proved to be beneficial when, in September 1730, she was indicted for stealing goods valued at forty shillings from her owner, Annie or Anne Sullivan. The value of the goods was enough to make it a felony, which was punishable by death during this time period, and Aggie was brought to trial in York County, Virginia. Upon hearing of her predicament Gooch sent an attorney to monitor the trial. Aggie again tried to plead for benefit of clergy, but was denied and Gooch appealed the decision. The appeal was divided and the case was referred to England for a final ruling. On May 6, 1731 Aggie was pardoned on the condition that she leave Virginia and on July 1, 1732 the Virginia General Assembly ruled that \\"any Negro, mulatto or Indian whatsoever\\" could claim benefit of clergy. While this was a victory for Gooch, the new law was also restrictive since it limited the amount of instances where slaves, blacks, or Indians could use this plea. The law also had other detrimental effects, as these people would now be unable to give testimony in court for any reason other than a slave being brought up for a capital offense and would also enable courts to use other forms of corporal punishment other than death.

The church is situated in the Indre by neighbourhood on the western edge of the City Hall Park and was completed in 1893 from a design by Emanuel Edvard Christie Fleischer and Hjalmar Kj√¶r in the Neo-Romanesque style. Saint Nikolaj Church is today owned and operated by the Catholic Church in Denmark and home to the local Chaldean congregation in Aarhus. The church is 700 square meters and holds 28 benches which can seat up to 300 people. History The church originally belonged to a congregation under the Catholic Apostolic Church, founded in Scotland in 1832. The Apostolic Church came to Denmark with Sir Georg Hewett in 1861; in 1879 the congregation in Aarhus was established, and in 1893 the church was completed by plans by Emanuel Edvard Christie Fleischer and Hjalmar Kj√¶r. The first service was held on 23 April 1893. The congregation peaked in the 1940s with some 600 members, also operating a second church in Thun√∏gade street. The Apostolic belief system meant that priests could only be appointed by one of 12 apostles. The last apostle died in 1901 and no new priests were appointed, so in 1953 the last priest left St. Nikolaj Church. The congregation did not disappear, but activities in the church were thereafter led by regular laity. Over time the membership of the congregation diminished and in the late 2000s the church was used no more than half an hour per week. In December 2010 the church was given to the Catholic Church, which renamed it to St. Nikolaj Church and today use it for the Chaldean congregation in Aarhus. The church was named St. Nikolaj for a number of historical reasons. The other Catholic church in Aarhus, Church of Our Lady, was originally named St. Nikolaj Church, the street running perpendicular to the church is Skt. Nicolaus Gade, and Saint Nicholas as a saint connects the eastern and western churches and is the patron saint of port cities. Chaldean Church The Chaldean congregation in Denmark is composed of some 2000 Catholics primarily from Iraq, and the Chaldean congregation in Aarhus is the largest in Denmark. Prior to 1991 most Chaldeans lived in northern Iraq, but Saddam Hussein forcefully relocated most of them in an attempt to turn make areas majority Muslim. Today most Chaldeans lived in Baghdad and Mosul, but degradation in security since the early 2000s have forced many to flee, which has caused the congregation in Denmark and Aarhus to grow. In 2010 some 400 Chaldean families resided in Denmark.

The next series was an homage to the old masters of oil painting, entitled Riffs on Old Masters (2003-2004). He also completed two series inspired by landscapes, Status Mountainous Cumulus (2006-2009) et Ponds (2012-2013) Literature is also a source of inspiration for Kowatch. Two of his series are entitled Don Quixote (2009-2012) et Moby Dick (2013), respectively, and form a tribute to the heroes‚Äô epic journeys. Kowatch is also inspired by Belgium and has drawn on his own personal adventure in his series Belgium Odyssey. Most recently, Kowatch has been inspired by the themes of the circus and carnival. He produced his largest painting, Christ Leaving Brussels, in response to James Ensor's The Entry of Christ Into Brussels. This painting has been acquired by the Royal Fine Arts Museums of Belgium in 2018. In November this same year, Galerie La Forest Divonne and Galerie Faider joined forces in Brussels to show two exhibitions of Kowatch's work. Michel Draguet (Director of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts) talks of passion and ardour, while Claude Lorent writes about art works \\"monumental, powerful [‚Ä¶] expressionnist by the grafic strength, tonic and fervent\\".

Trans American MicroscSoc 103 :195‚Äî204 Its description was emended by Clopton in 2009. It was previously designated Solitaricae by Chakravarty in 1960. Description Species in this superfamily infect only a single host during their life cycle. The trophozoites are solitary and may develop either intracellularly or extracellularly. The epimerite varies in its structure between species. The gametocysts may or may not have sporoducts. They have a hyaline epicyst. Oocysts are released in a variety of ways depending on the species: * Dehiscence of the gametocyst and release of single oocysts en masse * Release of oocysts in polyete chains from the gametocyst * Rupture of a gametocyst valve and release of oocysts in monete chains * Expulsion of isolated oocysts en masse =Differential diagnosis= This superfamily is distinguished by the Porosporidae by only having one host in the life cycle. It is distinguished from the Gregarinicae by the lack of formation of association between the parasites before gametocyst formation. Members of the Gregarinicae typically form associations before they mature. This occurs some time before the onset of syzygy.

The band formed in May 2012, and disbanded in February 2016.  History  After originating from various local bands, the group was constructed by Tomas Morgan, James Kearle and ex-bassist Luke Williams in June 2012. The band recruited Indigo Lani Lewis-Jones and Gary Holley to complete the line-up. From Her Eyes quickly gained a small following in the local area, and dedicated more time into the project. From Her Eyes released a demo EP entitled No Place Like Home in late June 2013. After the release, Luke Williams subsequently announced his departure from From Her Eyes in mid-July, citing personal commitment as the reason. Luke was replaced later with Jesse Simmonds, a friend of Kearle and his ex co-band member of Concepts of Fiction In the following months, From Her Eyes continued to perform regularly whilst beginning to write new material. Demos for the tracks \\"Comatose\\" and \\"Disillusionist\\" (which would both feature on the band's EP Demons) were completed in late 2013. Indigo Lani Lewis-Jones left the band in January 2014. Upon her release, From Her Eyes went through an extensive 8 month audition process, eventually recruiting Joe Shutt (after the recording of the Demons EP, but before its official release.) The band recorded the Demons EP with Jonny Renshaw (Devil Sold His Soul) at Bandit Studios (Devil Sold His Soul, The Elijah, Blood Youth) in April 2014. The EP was subsequently released on 25 August 2014. On the back of this EP, From Her Eyes signed a management deal with Imperial Music in Spring 2015. They subsequently supported Bury Tomorrow, Polar, Monuments, No Consequence, Continents and more and then proceeded to record a new single. \\"Glass\\" was released on 21 September 2015.
