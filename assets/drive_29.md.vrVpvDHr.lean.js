The concept came out of discussion between Lars von Trier, Berrie, Scherfig and Jensen. Each film is to be made by different first-time directors and producers. The production companies Sigma Films (Glasgow) and Zentropa (Denmark) are behind the concept. Scherfig and Jensen created a list of characters and gave them back stories, which the three directors could then use to build their story. Casting for all three films was to be done at the same time by the three different directors, due to the intended shared cast.

The books were adapted as a musical play produced in 1968, namely The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N. Internet Broadway Database Hyman Kaplan Mr Kaplan is an immigrant and a pupil at a New York night class in English. He is extremely diligent and enthusiastic, but seems completely incapable of learning: the teacher, Mr Parkhill, is eventually driven to conclude that, although Mr Kaplan admits that English has rules ‚Äì \\"good rules, sensible rules\\" ‚Äì he is quite unable to admit that the rules apply to him. (In The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N, Kaplan's English pronunciation has improved substantially between semesters.) Mr Kaplan is extroverted and highly assertive, particularly when his moral sense has been outraged by some perceived injustice in class or in American history, and he frequently gets into noisy disagreements with other members of the class. Mr Kaplan usually signs his name in colored crayon with green stars between red letters outlined in blue. In the last story of all, \\"Mr K*A*P*L*A*N the Eumoirous\\", he signs a note to his teacher simply \\"Hyman Kaplan\\", but addresses it to \\"Mr P*A*R*K*H*I*L*L\\". Mr Parkhill wonders if he will ever again be so honored. Mr Kaplan was born in Kiev, has lived in America for fifteen years, and claims (on Columbus Day) that his birthday is October 12. From his pronunciation of English (the characters' various idioms are a major source of the stories' humor), it appears that Mr Kaplan's native language is Yiddish. This would seem to be confirmed when Kaplan calls flowers \\"bloomers\\", and a fellow student reminds him not to mix up two languages, leading the teacher to reflect that Mr Kaplan's native language refers to flowers as blumen.  The teacher  Mr Parkhill is the point-of-view character in the stories, a staid, kind-hearted, mild-mannered teacher with a tendency to think of his pupils in terms of classical literature. Mr Parkhill is rigorously fair-minded, often to his own detriment when faced with Mr Kaplan's very individual brand of logic. He is also a lonely and rather tragic character: when the class present him with a new briefcase with the initials \\"M.P.\\" on it as a birthday present, he is at first puzzled since his first name does not begin with M; then realizes that the letters stand for \\"Mr Parkhill\\" and that he cannot remember the last time anyone addressed him by his first name.  Other members of the class  *Mr Norman Bloom (in the first book) and Mr Reuben Plonsky (in the second book; renamed Olansky in the combined version), both of whom are better than Mr Kaplan at grasping the rules of English, but who somehow end up on the losing side of the arguments that erupt between them. *Miss Rose Mitnick, a quiet, shy young woman whose grasp of English is almost perfect, but who generally withers before the force of Mr Kaplan's rhetorical passion. Eventually she starts a relationship with the ebullient Nathan P. Nathan. *Mrs Sadie Moskowitz, characterized by Mr Parkhill as \\"the Niobe of the beginners' grade\\", a large, lugubrious middle-aged lady who is baffled by the English language and spends much of the time asleep, waking only to punctuate a particularly intimidating fact with a despairing exclamation of \\"Oy!\\" *Miss Olga Tarnova, an emotional old Russian woman, a retired ballerina who recalls the Imperial days with nostalgia and despises Communism. Her compositions often deal either with her former life or with her interest in Spiritualism. *Mr Sam Pinsky, a loyal ally of Mr Kaplan. *Miss Carmen Caravello, an Italian woman prone to loud disagreement with Mr Kaplan. *Gus Matsoukas, the only Greek in the class, whose dogged pursuit of English is accompanied by near-constant muttering to himself.

However, Edward and his best friend Charlie Wallace, his best man, are to leave for France that evening. Edward does his best to stay cheerful while at Eaton Place, but is terrified. Georgina gets two of her officer friends, who are also going to the Front that evening, to give him advice. Daisy later accompanies him to the station, and cannot stop herself crying as they said goodbye while Edward is on board the train. Georgina is also at the station with her friend Angela Barclay to say goodbye to her two officer friends, Captain Martin Adams and 2nd Lt. Harry Gurney. After they have left, Georgina tells Angela that she will stay a while. She then helps out when a hospital train arrives, and hands out coco and cigarettes. One soldier she gives a cigarette dies minutes later, with the cigarette still in his mouth, and Georgina immediately volunteers to be a VAD nurse and soon starts training.

Other sources (Haskell and Penny 1981, p. 196; Anonymous 1996, p. 90) give 1586 as the earliest certain date the statue is known to have been at Fontainedbleau (mentioned by the Dutch traveller Van Buchell [Haskell and Penny]) and was reported in the 17th century to have come from the Ch√¢teau de Meudon. with a subtle but inescapable allusion to the king's mistress, Diane de Poitiers. It was probably discovered in Italy. The Louvre website suggests the Temple of Diana (Nemi): an ancient sanctuary, while other sources posit Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. \\"Alone amongst the statues exported from Italy before the second half of the seventeenth century the Diane Chasseresse acquired a reputation outside Italy equivalent to the masterpieces in the Belvedere or the Villa Borghese\\",Haskell and Penny, 1981, p. 196. though its admirers generally confused it with the Artemis at the temple of Ephesus.The error was forcefully refuted by Jean-Aymar Piganiol de La Force, Nouvelle description des ch√¢teaux et des parcs de Versailles et de Marly (Paris, 1713), Haskell and Penny note (1981:196). It was installed as the central feature of the Jardin de la Reine (today's Jardin de Diane) laid out west of the Galerie des Cerfs at the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau; there it was the most prominently displayed and among the first Roman sculptures to be seen in France. In 1602, Henri IV removed it to the Palais du Louvre, where the Diana was installed in a gallery specially designed to receive it, the Salle des Antiques (now the Salle des Caryatides). At the time, its restorations were revised by Barth√©lemy Prieur. In 1696 it was installed in the Grande Galerie (Hall of Mirrors) of Versailles by Louis XIV.Date according to the Mus√©e du Louvre on- line catalogue. As one of France's greatest treasures, the Diane Chasseresse returned to the Louvre in An VI (1798) of the French Republican calendar (Haskell and Penny 1981:196).Accession number 589.Anonymous 1996, p. 90: \\"Numerous copies of the statue from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries attest to its popularity during that era, but the work is widely ignored today.\\" It was restored once more, in 1802, by Bernard Lange.Lange is also credited with the first restorations to the Venus de Milo Fountain of Diana at Fontainebleau A bronze copy of 1684 was installed on the garden fountain at Fontainebleau in 1813. In 1605, after the marble Roman statue had been removed from Fontainebleau, Barth√©lemy Prieur cast a replacement, a bronze replica which was set upon a high Mannerist marble pedestal, part of a fountain arranged by the hydraulics engineer Tommaso Francini in 1603. The fountain incorporated bronze hunting dogs and stag's heads spitting water, sculpted by , and was located in the Jardin de la Reine, with a parterre surrounded by an orangery.The orangery was swept away under Louis-Philippe.\\"Diane √† la biche\\", Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau; Jean-Marie P√©rouse de Montclos, Le ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau (Paris: Scala, 2009), p. 212. At the time of the French Revolution, Prieur's bronze was sent to the Louvre, but in 1813, Emperor Napoleon offered it to Empress Jos√©phine to decorate her Ch√¢teau de Malmaison. At the same time, he ordered the present bronze, a replica cast by the Keller brothers in 1684 and formerly at the Ch√¢teau de Marly (demolished 1806), be placed on the fountain at Fontainebleau. Prieur's bronze was later returned to the Louvre and only in the 20th century was it brought back to Fontainebleau, where it was placed in the Galerie des Cerfs. Other replicas Comparable Roman replicas of the same model, noted by the Louvre's website, have been found at Leptis Magna (Libya), at Antalya (Turkey) and also Annaba (Algeria). Besides the modern era replicas by Prieur and the Keller brothers, a full-size bronze replica was made in 1634 by Hubert Le Sueur for Charles I of England, the brother-in-law of Louis XIII.It is now at Windsor Castle. For Marly, a marble copy was executed by Guillaume Coustou in 1710. In the second half of the 18th century, numerous replicas of all sizes were created in bronze, plaster, and lead (Haskell and Penny 1981:197). A miniature replica of the statue stood on the fireplace mantle in the Titanic's first class lounge. In 1986, Robert Ballard discovered and photographed the statue on the sea floor near the bow section of the wreck.

As a professional association, it provides pilots the opportunity to meet and discuss aviation-related matters. Its Technical Committee is involved in the development of Australian and international aviation safety standards. As an industrial organisation, its role is to improve employment conditions for its members, including collective bargaining‚Äînegotiating labour contracts, representing members involved in a dispute with their employer or in the event of an accident or incident. Mission and role Its stated mission is to \\"represent and promote the interests of Australian professional flight crew and to champion the highest possible standards of aviation safety.\\" AFAP- represented pilots work in general aviation and flight instruction, crop dusting, aeromedical services and fly for regional and international airlines. Its representation encompasses most Australian commercial pilots who serve in a professional capacity, with the notable exception of Qantas' mainline pilots, who are represented by the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA). AFAP are founding members of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations. History The first precursor to the AFAP was the Australian Institute of Air Pilots and Navigators, which began Sunday evening, 18 May 1938 at the Moonee Ponds Town Hall in Melbourne, when a group of about 40 pilots and navigators, primarily from Victoria, but also from New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. After World War II, it became the Australian Air Pilots‚Äô Association (AAPA), taking on a greater role in traditional trade union matters such as contract negotiations and working conditions. In 1948, it was one of the organisations which came together to form the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations, an international body representing the interests of professional pilots. The AAPA was disbanded in 1959, when its entire membership resigned due to an arbitration system imposed by the government on all trade and industrial unions which was perceived as \\"incapable of understanding the profession.\\" These members formed the AFAP, which initially operated as a pilots' federation outside the regulatory system of industrial and trade unions. Thirty years later came the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute, one of the most expensive and dramatic industrial disputes in Australian history. The dispute was a response by the AFAP to a prolonged period of wage suppression, undertaken in support of its campaign for a pay increase in the domestic airlines (which it quantified at 27.00% plus a compounding amount for future inflation creating 29.47%, though such claims usually form a starting position for negotiations). The percentage figure was created to cover all pilots from small flight instruction through to domestic carriers as the talks were forced to an Industry wide discussion at direction of Federal Government. Beginning 18 August 1989, AFAP members imposed limitations on the hours they were prepared to work at Australian Airlines, Ansett, East-West and Ipec Aviation, making themselves available for flying duties only within the normal office working hours of 9am to 5pm. They argued that if they were to be treated in exactly the same way as employees in other industries, their work conditions should also be the same, the position adopted by the government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The dispute escalated, with Australian Defence Force personnel being used as strikebreakers and AFAP member pilots resigning en masse. Despite the Hawke Government efforts to destroy the Federation they survived as an organisation and grew larger continuing to represent pilots in Australia. The Airline Companies directly involved all disappeared from Aviation in following years. Organisation The AFAP is organised as a labor federation along a democratic model, with direct democracy the preferred method for major decisions, such as finalising workplace negotiations. It comprises various pilot councils retaining control of their own direction. Among those are councils representing pilots working for the following organisations: * Australian Helicopters *Bristow Helicopters * CHC Helicopter * Civil Aviation Safety Authority * Cobham Aviation Services Australia * Eastern Australia Airlines (a Qantas subsidiary) * Jetstar Airways * Regional Express Airlines * Sunstate Airlines (a Qantas subsidiary) * Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia * Tigerair Australia * Virgin Australia Benefits In addition to providing employee representation during collective bargaining negotiations and as part of formal grievance procedures, the AFAP also provides ancillary benefits to its members, such as: *Insurance against loss of pilot's license via a mutual benefit fund *System of retirement payments called superannuation in Australia, and its underlying trust fund *Bereavement benefit payments *Discounts on accommodation, travel, dining and car rental References Category:Transport trade unions in Australia Category:Aviation organisations based in Australia Category:Airline pilots' trade unions Category:International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations Category:Trade unions established in 1938 Category:1938 establishments in Australia ","title":"Australian Federation of Air Pilots"},{"id":"8014743","text":"{{Infobox company  name = DEICHMANN Shoes  logo = Heinrich_Deichmann- Schuhe_2011_logo.svg  logo_size = 220px  caption =  type = Societas Europaea  genre =  fate =  predecessor =  successor =  foundation =  location = Essen  area_served =  key_people = Heinrich Deichmann (CEO)  industry =  products = Shoes, Bags  services =  revenue = ~‚Ç¨6.5 Billion EUR Deichmann flagship store in Essen, Germany Deichmann SEDocument of the society's founding at Amtsgericht (local court) Essen; trade register number HRB21020; 19.08.2008 is the largest footwear retailer in Europe and is headquartered in Essen, Germany.  Company structure  Deichmann SE is a wholly owned family company. Among other countries, the company's stores are called Dosenbach in Switzerland and Van Haren in the Netherlands.  History  = Founding years 1913‚Äì1940 = Heinrich Deichmann, born in 1888, opened a shoemaker‚Äôs shop, called Schuhreparatur Elektra, in 1913 at the age of 25 in what is now Johannes-Brokamp-Stra√üe in Borbeck, which was incorporated into the city of Essen two years later. At first, his customers were mainly miners from the then up-and-coming Ruhr area who needed inexpensive shoe repairs, being part of the lower income bracket. After World War I, Deichmann and his shoemakers produced their own shoes for the first time. Soon afterwards, Heinrich Deichmann bought cheap new goods from shoe factories to resell them to his own customers. Heinrich Deichmann opened the first large shoe shop at Borbecker Markt in 1936. His wife, Julie, took over the business after his death in 1940. = After World War II = After World War II, Deichmann improvised by making 50,000 pairs of shoes out of poplar wood and parachute harnesses. In addition, a swap shop was set up for used shoes, quickly growing to a total of 5,000 customers on file. Early on, their son Heinz-Horst Deichmann helped out in the company, opening the first shop outside Essen on Ackerstra√üe in D√ºsseldorf in the late 1940s. He studied theology, received his doctorate in medicine and continued to run the small family business together with his mother. He gave up his career as a doctor in 1956 to fully take over management of the shoe business, buying out his four older sisters. By 1963, the company was operating 16 shops along the Rhine and in the Ruhr. Under Heinz-Horst Deichmann‚Äôs management, the company grew to become the market leader in the German and European shoe retail trade. Deichmann was the first to introduce the display stands and later the rack-room concept in Germany, where shoes are presented in boxes for customers to try on directly. = International expansion and acquisitions = The company acquired the Dosenbach shoe chain in Switzerland in 1973, followed by shoe and sports chain Ochsner in 1992. The two chains were merged to form Dosenbach-Ochsner. Their names are still used today for the branches located in Switzerland. The company expanded to the USA in 1984, the Netherlands in 1985, Austria in 1992 and Poland in 1997. Heinz-Horst Deichmann‚Äôs son Heinrich Otto took over as Chairman of the Board in 1999. His sisters do not work for the company. In 2001, branches were opened in Hungary and the United Kingdom. This was followed by Denmark and the Czech Republic in 2003, Slovakia in 2004, Slovenia and Turkey in 2006, Romania in 2007 and Bulgaria in 2009. Germany‚Äôs thousandth branch was opened in 2006. The company was legally changed to a Societas Europaea company on 1 January 2010. Deichmann opened its first stores in France and Belgium in 2017. The group had a total of 4,205 branches worldwide in 2019. In the US, Deichmann SE completed the largest acquisition in the company‚Äôs history by purchasing the KicksUSA chain in 2018 with over 60 stores in the streetwear and athletic shoe sector. China also began activities on the Chinese market in 2019 and opened its first branches in Estonia, Latvia and Dubai. Deichmann was the first company to set up an online shop for shoes in 2000. The company currently runs 40 (2017: 36) online shops internationally and is working to expand its omnichannel concept.Deichmann store in Frankfurt  Market positioning  During the 2019 fiscal year, the Deichmann Group sold around 183 million pairs of shoes worldwide, some 40% of which in Germany. As of 31 December 2019, the group employed around 43,000 employees in 30 countries and is the European shoe retail market leader. Deichmann does not produce its own shoes, instead purchasing shoes in about 40 countries. Its primary purchasing market is Asia. Deichmann purchased traditional brands Gallus and Elefanten-Schuh in May 2005. Gallus is a shoe factory founded by M√∂nchengladbach shoemaker Heinrich Vogels in 1880, which was based in D√ºlken until 1997. The name Gallus goes back to the Hahn family of manufacturers in G√∂ttingen (Latin: Gallus), from whom Heinrich Vogels acquired the rights to the brand in the 1930s. Elefanten-Schuh (Kleve) was closed down by English shoe manufacturer Clarks in late 2004 after failing to find a suitable investor. Since then, shoes that Deichmann purchases from suppliers have been sold under the brand names Elefanten and Gallus. Deichmann does not produce its own shoes. The Pussycat Dolls collaborated with Deichmann on testimonial advertisements, beginning in March 2006. Extreme athlete and musician Joey Kelly appeared in advertising for Deichmann‚Äôs Victory brand of running shoes. The Sugababes collection was released in the spring of 2008, with their song ‚ÄúDenial‚Äù used in the campaign‚Äôs television advertising. American supermodel Cindy Crawford brought her own shoe collection to market exclusively for Deichmann under the 5th Avenue label in 2009. Halle Berry appeared in advertising for Deichmann in 2012. Sylvie Meis presented her first Deichmann shoe collection in 2015, with additional collections released in 2016 and 2017. Ellie Goulding also released her own collection for Deichmann in 2017. Deichmann collaborated with singer Rita Ora to release a collection of 40 women‚Äôs shoe designs in 2019. Dosenbach took over title sponsorship of the second highest level football league in Switzerland for one season, which was called the Dosenbach Challenge League during that time.  Public perception  = 2003: Founding member of the amfori BSCI (Business Social Compliance Initiative) = Deichmann is a member of the BSCI. More than 2,400 retailers and companies from 46 countries are part of the initiative. They pursue common goals, including improving working conditions in factories, helping suppliers adapt to national laws and international guidelines, and facilitating socially responsible behaviour in the globalised economy. = 2012‚Äì2014: Chromium (VI) oxide pollution = According to RAPEX, the EU rapid alert system for unsafe consumer products and consumer protection, there were multiple reports of leather shoes produced under the company‚Äôs own 5th Avenue brand being contaminated by chromium trioxide between 2012 and 2014. = 2018: Member of the cads association = Deichmann SE is a member of the cads association (cooperation for assuring defined standards for shoe and leather goods production). In 2018, the initiative, which was launched in 2007, became a registered association with some 80 members. These include companies from the footwear and leather goods industry, brands, retailers, test laboratories and chemical manufacturers. cads is committed to sustainable development in the footwear and leather goods industry along the entire value chain. All members agree to abide by jointly defined production and environmental standards. = Member of the Leather Working Group = Deichmann SE is a member of the Leather Working Group, which was founded in 2005. The multi-stakeholder initiative brings together brands, manufacturers, retailers and leading technical experts from the leather industry and non-governmental organisations. Its aim is to make the production chain in leather processing more transparent. In addition, it aims to bring about sustainable changes to processing in tanneries and through distributors, including by reducing water and energy consumption.

It aired on December 1, 2006. Writer Michael Taylor received a nomination for the 2006 Nebula Award in the script category for this episode. An extended version of this episode with 25 minutes of extra footage was included on the Region 1 DVD and Blu-ray releases of the third season and in the UK exclusively on the Blu-ray release  Plot  The crew of Galactica have reinstated an old military tradition by setting up a boxing ring and putting rank aside ‚Äî by the placing of dog tags in a metal box ‚Äî crew and officers freely duke it out in one-on-one matches. Colonel Tigh is match referee. Elsewhere in a bunk room, Starbuck has finished having sex with her estranged husband Samuel T. Anders. Starbuck remarks that their encounter was just what she needed and gets up to leave. Anders replies that he wants to reconcile their marriage. Starbuck responds that she's not ready yet and heads to the fights. Kara heads past the boxing match and observes Major Apollo losing a match against Captain \\"Helo\\" Agathon. Apollo leaves the ring and picks up his dog tags to signify that he is quitting the competition. However, Starbuck drops her tags in the box and goads an initially reluctant Apollo into fighting her instead. Admiral Adama arrives with President Roslin, who is a boxing enthusiast, to watch the next series of fights; Kat wins against a female crew member, and Hot Dog is quickly knocked out by Starbuck. Adama then observes Chief Tyrol and his wife Cally, recalling a moment when the fleet first settled New Caprica and Tyrol and Cally were still assigned to Galactica. Tyrol asked Adama for permission to leave the ship so he and Cally's child could be born and raised down on the planet. Adama refused the request, telling Tyrol he and Cally are needed on board. Back at the boxing match, Adama overhears Tyrol give one of his crew permission to watch the fight although the crew member has not yet finished fixing a broken spacecraft. Without warning, the Admiral steps into the ring and tells Chief Tyrol to get his \\"fat, lazy ass\\" in there with him. Tyrol enters as ordered, thinking the match will be a joke until the bell rings and Adama knocks him to the mat with a fast right hook. Adama taunts Tyrol asking him if this is how he fought down on New Caprica. Insulted, Tyrol rises to his feet and begins to lay into the Admiral. Adama is easily over matched as Tyrol angrily pummels him into the ropes asking if this is what he wanted. Adama is saved for the moment by the bell. Adama sits to rest while Doctor Cottle looks him over. Roslin rushes to Adama's side and gives him some advice on how to win, but Adama replies that he does not intend to win. Round two begins with Tyrol rushing Adama back into the ropes with more fierce pummeling. Adama does not do much to resist, with his face beaten to a bloody pulp. Tyrol eventually floors the old man who stays down for the count. A stunned silence falls over the crowd as Tyrol and Tigh help Adama back to his feet. The fight is over and Adama takes a moment to tell the crew that he has let them all get \\"too close\\" to him, something which must come to an end, and he will no longer forgive laxity among the crew as he's done in the past - he let them drop their guard during the initial settlement of New Caprica and left humanity exposed to the Cylons as a result. As the Admiral leaves, Tigh announces the matches are over and orders everyone back to duty. Starbuck will not give up her planned fight with Apollo, however. They both enter the ring and let loose with all their bottled up hostilities. As fists fly, flashbacks take the scene back to New Caprica. During the late evening of a ground-breaking ceremony, Apollo and Starbuck found a moment alone to talk. Starbuck had (literally) drunk Anders under the table, and he had passed out cold on the ground, under a table. Apollo took the opportunity to ask Starbuck about her plans for the future, musing about what will become of her relationship with Anders. Back to the present, the boxing match between Starbuck and Apollo intensifies. Dee watches as Anders remarks that the two look like they'll kill each other. On New Caprica the two eventually head outside the city to a secluded field and they end up making love. Afterward, Starbuck wonders what will happen if anyone finds out about what they have done ‚Äî especially Anders or Dee. Apollo stands up and shouts to the night sky that he loves Kara Thrace, unconcerned about anyone hearing him. Hesitantly at first, Starbuck eventually does the same shouting that she loves Lee Adama. Apollo says he will tell Dee about the new situation and asks that Starbuck do the same with Anders. In the boxing ring, Apollo knocks Starbuck to the mat at which point the fighting turns dirty. Starbuck does a leg sweep and trips Apollo. As he gets back to his feet, Starbuck kicks him in the face. Seeing the match is getting personal, the few remaining spectators begin to leave the room. Flashing to the next morning on New Caprica, Admiral Adama and Roslin talk with Chief Tyrol and Cally. Adama tells Tyrol that he has given the Chief's situation some thought and that he has decided they can remain on New Caprica to have their child. Apollo awakes in the field and finds Starbuck has gone. Returning to the town, he meets his father, who tells him that Starbuck and Anders have just got married in a surprise ceremony earlier that morning. Still reeling from the news, Apollo meets the newlyweds walking down the street. Anders reveals that the wedding was Starbuck's idea and that she \\"popped the question to him\\" only that morning. Apollo recovers enough to congratulate Anders and wish him luck, adding that \\"you're going to need it\\" as he glances towards Starbuck. Apollo then walks off in a dazed shock back to a Raptor to return to Pegasus, with Dee waiting on the entry ramp. Apollo walks straight from his confrontation with Starbuck to Dee and immediately kisses her. Back at the boxing ring, Starbuck and Apollo have battled each other to a stand-still. They slump against each other in the middle of the ring with their arms around each other. An awkward silence follows, and the spectators shuffle out of the hall. Anders leaves too, while Dee lowers her head. Starbuck whispers to Apollo that she has \\"missed him\\". Apollo replies that he missed her, too. As the scene fades out, there is the trace of a smile upon Starbuck's face.

Luxembourg railway station (, , ) is the main railway station serving Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg. It is operated by Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois, the state-owned railway company. 80,000 passengers use this station every day. It is the hub of Luxembourg's domestic railway network, serving as a point of call on all of Luxembourg's railway lines. It also functions as the country's international railway hub, with services to all the surrounding countries: Belgium, France, and Germany. Since June 2007, the LGV Est connects the station to the French TGV network. The station is located south of the city centre (Ville Haute), to the south of the River P√©trusse. The station gives its name to Gare, one of the Quarters of Luxembourg City. History Aerial view of the railway station's Place de la Gare and the quarter around Avenue de la Libert√© The original railway station was built entirely from timber, and was opened in 1859. The position of the new station on the south bank of the P√©trusse, away from the original built-up area of the city, was on account of Luxembourg's role as a German Confederation fortress. The first connection to the city proper came in 1861, with the construction of the Passerelle viaduct. After the 1867 Treaty of London, the fortifications were demolished, leading to the expansion of the city around the station. The old wooden station was replaced by the modern building between 1907 and 1913, at the height of an economic boom, fuelled by iron from the Red Lands. The new station was designed by a trio of German architects (R√ºdell, J√ºsgen, and Scheuffel) in the Moselle Baroque Revival style that dominates Luxembourg's major public buildings. The station lies at the end of the Avenue de la Libert√©, one of the city's major thoroughfares, and its imposing clock tower can be seen from a considerable distance. Modernisation work In 2006, the Ministry of Transport began a six-year renovation project on Luxembourg station that totaled ‚Ç¨95 million. The improvements included new ticketing and sales facilities inside the main hall, expanding platforms, new lifts, a new passenger subway, upgraded overhead electrical wiring, installation of two platform escalators, a new entrance porch, a redesigned forecourt, a glass passenger hall, and a four-storey car park. Train services As of December 2017 the station is served by the following services: Rail map with departure times from Luxembourg station *High speed services (TGV) Luxembourg - Thionville - Metz - Paris *Intercity services Luxembourg - Ettelbruck - Troisvierges - Gouvy - Li√®ge *Intercity services Luxembourg - Wasserbillig - Trier - Koblenz - K√∂ln - D√ºsseldorf *Intercity services Luxembourg - Arlon (- Namur - Brussels) *Regional services Luxembourg - Ettelbruck - Diekirch *Regional services Luxembourg - Wasserbillig - Trier - Koblenz *Regional services (TER Lorraine) Luxembourg - Bettembourg - Thionville - Metz - Nancy *Regional services Luxembourg - Bettembourg - Esch - Petange - Rodange *Regional services Luxembourg - Rodange - Athus *Regional services Luxembourg - Rodange - Longwy *Regional services Luxembourg - Kleinbettingen - Arlon Luxembourg station has some voltage-switchable tracks for Line 50 to Arlon, which is electrified with the Belgian voltage of 3 kV DC.

Sydney Robert Bellingham (August 2, 1808 - March 9, 1900) was an Anglo-Irish businessman, lawyer, journalist, military and political figure in Canada East. He served as a captain with the Royal Montreal Cavalry during the Lower Canada Rebellion and represented Argenteuil in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1867 to 1878. After the deaths of his three elder brothers he inherited Castle Bellingham and returned to Ireland to administer the estate Early years Castle Bellingham, Co. Louth; seat of the Bellinghams since 1660. His wife, Mrs Arabella (Holmes) Bellingham, at Montreal in 1871 Born at Dunany House, Castlebellingham, Co. Louth, he was the fourth son of Sir Alan Bellingham (1776‚Äì1827) 2nd Bt., and his wife Elizabeth (1788‚Äì1822), daughter of the Rev. Rees Edward Walls of Boothby Hall, Lincolnshire. Sir Alan Bellingham was heir to his uncle, Sir William Bellingham M.P., but survived him by less than a year. By 1824, Sir Alan Bellingham had run into financial difficulties and leaving his family in Ireland, he fled his debtors to France, taking up residence at Ch√¢tillon-sur- Loire. Then just fifteen years old, Sydney came to Canada alone to seek his fortune. Arriving in Quebec, he travelled widely throughout Upper Canada until 1827 when he took a job in the timber business at Montreal under another Anglo-Irishman, the brother of George Hamilton. A few months before his marriage, he started an import-export business with his friend James Wallis (1807‚Äì1893), formerly of Drishane Castle, Co. Cork, who had settled at Fenelon Falls. In 1831, Bellingham married Arabella Holmes (1808‚Äì1887), to whom he was related through his grandmothers family. She was the youngest daughter of one of his father's friends, William Holmes of Quebec. Her family were well- connected in the Canadas and in addition to that she was the heiress to of land in the counties of Buckland and Bellechasse. After the failure of his business with Wallis, aided by his wife's money, Bellingham entered Canadian politics. Canadian Politics, Business & Military In 1834, Bellingham was an unsuccessful candidate in Montreal East for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. He opposed the reforms to government being proposed by the Parti Patriote. He was named a Justice of the Peace in 1837. During the Lower Canada Rebellion, Bellingham served as a captain with the Royal Montreal Cavalry and the aide-de-camp to Lt.-Col. George Augustus Wetherall. As a civil magistrate he led many daring raids deep into Patriote territory to arrest the rebel leaders during the war. He studied law with Alexander Buchanan, and was called to the Lower Canadian bar in 1840, entering into practice with William Walker at Montreal. He also edited the Canada Times, a reform-oriented newspaper. Bellingham supported the reforms proposed by Lord Durham but opposed the union of Upper and Lower Canada. In 1843, he became editor of the Times and Daily Commercial Advertiser. Bellingham was a proponent of annexation with the United States and served as secretary of the Montreal Annexation Association. In 1853, he co-founded the Montreal and Bytown Railway. In 1853, he bought a tract of land on the north brow of Mount Royal overlooking Montreal, where he and his wife made their home, Dunany Cottage, named for the house in which he grew up at Castlebellingham. In 1854, Bellingham was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Argenteuil. He bought 21,000 arpents of land there, bringing many settlers, both French and English to the area, aiding them to farm successfully. He was also made a colonel of the local militia, the Argenteuil Rangers. However his election was declared invalid twice after it was alleged that he had used intimidation and bribery but he was re-elected in the by- elections that followed and he finally took his seat in May 1856. He was elected again in 1858, his election was overturned in 1860. After Confederation, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. In 1871, he criticized Joseph-√âdouard Cauchon, another member of the assembly, for the deplorable conditions in his asylum which received government grants; this led to Cauchon's resignation. In 1871, he became editor of the Daily News of Montreal. Originally elected as a Conservative, Bellingham became a Liberal following the Tanneries scandal in 1874. Return to Ireland Bellingham was recognized as 'one of the best political writers in Lower Canada'. In 1877, he was appointed president of the Lovell Publishing Company of Montreal, but the following year he and his wife returned to Ireland to take up residence at his ancestral home, Castle Bellingham, which he had inherited in 1874 after the deaths of his elder brothers. His ties with Montreal remained strong, always keeping abreast of Canadian politics. In 1895, he dictated his Canadian memoirs to his nurse, and they were published privately the year after his death by his nephew. He and his wife lived at Southgate House, Castlebellingham, where he died 9 March 1900, without children. In his will he left the Castlebellingham estate to his nephew, Sir Henry Bellingham 4th Bt., and all his personal effects to Edward Graves Meredith, the eldest surviving son of his niece, Lady Meredith.

He is an emeritus professor of the department of anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh. Academic career A drawing of the Tuxtla Statuette, which also used inscriptions from Kaufman's work Kaufman received his PhD in Linguistics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1963 with his thesis on the grammar of Tzeltal. Kaufman has produced descriptive and comparative-historical studies of languages of the Mayan, Siouan, Hokan, Uto-Aztecan, Mixe‚ÄìZoquean and Oto- Manguean families. Due to his focus on gathering empirical documentation of unwritten languages through fieldwork and training of native linguists, Kaufman's list of publications is less extensive than those of other scholars in the field though many of his articles were co-authored with other scholars such as Lyle Campbell, Sarah Thomason and John Justeson. In a 1976 paper co- authored with Lyle Campbell, he advanced a theory that the Olmecs spoke a Mixe‚ÄìZoquean language, based on the substantial presence of early Mixe‚ÄìZoquean loans in many Mesoamerican languages, particularly from specific, culturally significant semantic domains. Along with Lyle Campbell and Thomas Smith-Stark, Kaufman carried out research published in Language (1986) which led to the recognition of Mesoamerica as a linguistic area. In Language contact, Creolization, and genetic linguistics (1988), co-authored by Kaufman and Sarah Thomason, the authors developed a theoretical framework for the understanding of the processes of contact-induced language change. Along with John Justeson, in 1993 he claimed to have successfully deciphered the Isthmian or Epi-Olmec script.Justeson, John S. and Terrence Kaufman (1993), A Decipherment of Epi- Olmec Hieroglyphic Writing. Science, 19 March 1993, pp. 1703‚Äì1711. This claim has been rejected by anthropologists Michael Coe and Stephen Houston in 2004 after using the decipher key on a recently discovered jade mask. Coe states that the result \\"turns out to be total nonsense and gobbledygook,\\".

The area was part of the old Cunninghamhead estate, and once contained several watermills. Cunninghamhead and the mills on the Annick Water The bridge over the Annick Water at Cunninghamhead. The area is recorded as far back as Pont's / Blaeu's map of 1654 where it is listed as Kunghamhead with a water mill situated nearby. The mill appears on Armstrong's map of 1775. This relatively large mill still exists today as a private house. One of the millers here was a cousin of the Smiths of Coldstream Mill and he taught them the milling craft (Griffith 2004). A track from the mill ran to Byres Farm and thus to the main road (Bartholomew 1912). The leat for the mill ran from a dam on the other side of the 'river loop', then behind the miller's dwelling to finally run under the road to enter the mill site. It is said locally that the dam was removed, after the closure of the mill, by the anglers, who lost salmon to poachers gaffing them as they leapt over it. The leat has been filled in. The course of the lane has changed, once running directly in front of the miller's house. The miller's house is particularly well constructed and ornamented, being owned, like the mill, by the Cunninghamhead Estate until sold after the death of the Kerr sisters. Just across the Annick Bridge is located a dwelling called 'Tail' on Aitken's 1829 map and Roys map of 1745 - 47.Roys Map The 1850s OS map shows a dwelling known as Hallgate existing in the middle of the first field on the right after crossing Cunnighamhead Bridge. The only remains are the entrance drive as well as ground depressions and hummocks on the satellite views. Tail and Hallgate appear to be in the same location. An area of well established and biodiverse woodland is present nearby, containing a very large specimen of a Black Poplar (2009), a rare tree in Ayrshire. Evidence suggests that the name Cunninghame was originally produced as 'Kinikim' and in the 18th century Cunninghamhead Moss was still referred to as Kinnicumheid Moss. A legend is told of how the warlock Laird of Auchenskeith near Dalry set the Devil to make a road across this moss in a single night.(Service, P. 105) Downstream from the mill was a sawmill fed from a lade which took its water from a dam built on a natural dyke across the Annick. These dykes, bands of especially hard rock, are found at several points crossing the river and many were exploited as the basis for dams, such as also occurred at Dalgarven Mill on the River Garnock. The course and position of most of these dykes is well known as they were a major consideration in the exploitation of coal. Nothing remains of the sawmill other than a vague indication of the lade and the exit onto the river. It had a right-angle turn on its lade, which is a very unusual feature. The point at which the lade changes direction may have been the site of the old mill marked on the 1832 map, but not afterwards, and the lade was then later reused for the sawmill. A mill-wand was the rounded piece of wood acting as an axle with which several people would role a millstone form the quarry to the mill and to permit this the width of some early roads was set at a 'mill-wand breadth', giving an early conformity to the appearance of country lanes (Gauldie 1981).  Crossroads  Cunninghamhead and the crossroads from the old smithy on the Kilmaurs road. 2007. A map of the area in 1897. The 1860 OS map shows the Crossroads hamlet to only consist of the school, toll house and Dykehead farm with a few other buildings, probably 'butt and bens' and cothouses occupied by farm and other labourers. The 1897 25 inch to the mile clearly marks 'Crossroads' in bold letters. Therefore this hamlet does seems to have been called Crossroads and the name Cunninghamhead only referred at this time to the estate and mansion. Aitken's 1829 map confirms that the name Crossroads as does Railton's of 1856, whilst the 1923 OS map seems to call the hamlet site Dykehead, which is the farm name. Dykehead may refer to a dyke or dike as has been described crossing the river relatively nearby, especially as Dykehead is marked on Pont's 1654 map at a time when very few stone hedges or dykes existed. The Wallace family were blacksmiths for several generations, living and working at Crossroads in the 19th century. They are buried at the Dreghorn parish churchyard. The statistical report refers to the hamlet as Cunninghamhead railway station in around 1875. Dykehead Smithy was located at the bend of the road before the crossroads on the Kilmaurs road end side. Crossroads used to actually be a 'true' cross road junction of two roads, B769 and the road to Torranyard and Kilmaurs roads. It is believed that on the grounds of safety the junction was altered to a staggered junction in about the mid 1980s it was renamed to \\"Cunninghamhead\\", which causes great confusion with Cunninghamhead Estate. The alteration of the junction to Springside just beyond the old Cunninghamhead railway station bridge was altered at around about the same time. =Breeking the cotte= A quaint method of tying up the skirt at the front in a knot or from below with string to prevent it getting dirty in the fields, called 'Breeking the Cotte', literally 'making a skirt into trousers' was a habit of women working on the farms in this parish according to Milligan and McMichael. Two methods are recorded, the first being by sewing a button on the hem in front and a loop on the hem behind, and buttoning it together between the ankles; it is usually adopted by wives. The other, which gives more scope for athletic movements, is done by raising the hem and tying it with a garter round each limb above the calf - the cotte bulging a little, like a pineapple.McMichael, Page 148  Views of Cunninghamhead in 2007 - 2008 Image:Annickwatercunnighamhead.JPGThe Annick Water near Cunninghamhead mill.

She was the first woman named to the Virginia State Corporation Commission and later was the first woman named to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, where she served until her retirement in 2007.http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/directories/women_trailblazers/lacy_bio.authcheckdam.pdf Early and family life Lacy graduated from St. Mary's College at Notre Dame in 1966 and taught elementary school in Texas for a year. She studied law at the University of Texas Law School and graduated in 1969. She also received an LL.M. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1992. Career Lacy practiced law in Texas before moving to Virginia, serving for three years with the Texas Legislative Council, and then for three years with the Texas Attorney General's office, specializing in antitrust and consumer protection law. From 1976-1977, Lacy moved to Virginia and served as legislative aide to state delegate Carrington Williams. She then began working for the Virginia Office of Attorney General, under Gerald L. Baliles. She rose to become the state Deputy Attorney General for Judicial Affairs (a division that prosecutes consumer protection violations, oversees the state's antitrust laws, state regulations and conflict of interest statutes). Governor Charles S. Robb appointed her to the State Corporation Commission, which had judicial as well as responsibilities. She was the first woman on the SCC. After Gerald L. Baliles was elected Governor of Virginia, he appointed Lacy to the Virginia Supreme Court as discussed below. Delegate Theodore V. Morrison Jr., a lawyer from Newport News, Virginia and part-time member of the General Assembly, was nominated and confirmed to succeed her on the SCC. On November 22, 1988, Gov. Baliles appointed Lacy to the Virginia Supreme Court, and the General Assembly confirmed her appointment in due course. She was again the first woman to hold the position, and she was subsequently elected to a full 12-year term. Although by seniority she was the longest serving active member of the Supreme Court when Chief Justice Harry L. Carrico retired, Lacy did not succeed him as Chief Justice. Although the Chief Justice was previously the senior active member of the Court, a change in the law before Chief Justice Carrico's retirement provided that in future the Chief Justice would be selected by an election of the Court members for a four-year term. Chief Justice Leroy Rountree Hassell, Sr., then second in seniority to Justice Lacy, was elected Chief Justice, and was the first African American to hold that position. Justice Lacy retired and took senior status effective August 16, 2007. On December 31, 2019, Justice Lacy stepped down as a Senior Justice after more than 30 years' service to the Court. The Library of Virginia honored her as one of the eight Virginia Women in History for 2008.

It is situated relatively close to Cheltenham racecourse, Pittville Park, the Prince of Wales Stadium/ Leisure @ Cheltenham and the area of Cheltenham known as \\"Swindon Village\\".  Overview  The brook itself is dammed at Pittville to form an ornamental lake, and partly culverted as it flows through the district. In 2006 investigation revealed that the brook was suffering from increasing pollution from the Marle Hill landfill site (now a golf course). Before the brook becomes Pittville Lake, it flows through Whaddon (another area of Cheltenham). This is why a road adjoining the Cheltenham Town football ground is called \\"Wymans Road\\". After this, the brook goes on to flow through the residential area of Pittville, and under \\"Overbrook Drive\\". Following this, it flows along the bottom of Pittville School's front playing field and into Pittville Park where it becomes the lake as mentioned previously. After the brook leaves the area of Wymans Brook, it flows through some small industrial units on \\"Wymans Lane\\" and along the edge of Swindon Village Park, situated in the Swindon Village area of Cheltenham, and out into countryside. Before the area of Wyman's Brook was developed, as with a lot of Cheltenham, it was open fields and orchards. The majority of houses on Wymans Brook are privately owned and were built in the 1970s. The main road running through the estate is \\"Windyridge Road\\". Some of the smaller roads at the end closest to Cheltenham Racecourse, were named after race horses. Names of roads include \\"Arkle Close\\" and \\"Golden Miller Road\\". Some social housing was added to the estate, just off \\"Windyridge Gardens\\", in the 1990s. These houses were built on part of the Midwinter allotment site, therefore, the newer road is named \\"Midwinter Gardens\\".  Railway Past  The old (and former) Honeybourne Line, which runs along one edge of Wymans Brook, once passed by here and was since been taken up in the late 1970s, before the houses of the area were built. The former trackbed of the line is now used as a cycle track in part. This track if followed in one direction, from Wymans Brook, leads to Hunting Butts Tunnel and to a nearby Cheltenham Racecourse railway station, where the line has been reopened by the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway. This part of the track is still covered with ballast from when it was in use and therefore is not really suitable for cycling on. If the track is followed from just behind the Prince of Wales stadium, which is at the other end of Wymans Brook, in the opposite direction to the racecourse, it runs along the bottom of the High Street and carries on past the Waitrose supermarket and on up to the Cheltenham Railway Station that is currently in use. This part of the track has been surfaced by the council and is now a useful and busy cycle/footpath for many residents of Cheltenham who can use it to get from the town centre to the swimming pool and sports facilities at \\"Leisure @ Cheltenham\\". There is another railway line which runs along the opposite edge of Wymans Brook which was built by the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway. This is currently in use and is the border between Wymans Brook and the industrial units off \\"Wymans Lane\\" and further along the road, \\"Swindon Village\\". The line is crossed using an automated level crossing on Swindon Lane. This railway line runs from Cheltenham Spa railway station. However the GWSR own a further mile of track (through Hunting Butts Tunnel) to only as far as the nearby Prince of Wales sports stadium close by, where a new station may be built and may form the terminus of the line. The short section of trackbed further beyond is now owned by the council and completely surfaced to Cheltenham Spa railway station itself.  Facilities  The facilities in Wymans Brook are located on Windyridge Road. The facilities include a Chinese takeaway, a Pub, a Pharmacy, a Fish & Chip Shop, a Doctors surgery, a dentist's surgery, a window company and a small supermarket. The pub stands separate from the other facilities, it was built in 1979 and was named \\"The Haymaker\\", possibly with reference to the fact that the estate was previously fields. In 2007, the pub was refurbished and renamed \\"The Ridge\\", a reference to the fact that it stands on \\"Windyridge Road\\". The old \\"Haymaker\\" sign is displayed next to the bar. The supermarket etc. are in a block of units. The supermarket is a Co-op store which sells groceries etc. The doctors surgery and the dentist's surgery are accessed via a flight of stairs as they are above the Co-op and Chinese takeaway. Wymans Brook is a very pleasant residential area and close to many facilities including Cheltenham Town Centre and a number of Retail Parks. It is also very close to the Cheltenham Racecourse and adjacent to open countryside and fields.

The benefits of Cheltenham's mineral waters had been recognised since 1716, but not until after the arrival of Henry Skillicorne in 1738 did serious exploitation of their potential as an attraction begin. After the visit to Cheltenham in 1788 of King George III, the town became increasingly fashionable, and wells were opened up at several points round the town.Phyllis Hembry, The English Spa 1560-1815, A Social History (1990) pp 179-90 Pittville, the vision of Joseph Pitt, was a planned 'new town' development of the 1820s, in which the centre-piece was (and remains) a pump-room where the waters of one of the more northerly wells could be taken. The PumpThe Pump Room was built by the architect John Forbes between 1825 and 1830. It is a Grade I listed building standing at the northern end of Pittville Lawn with landscaped grounds running down to a lake. The building contains the original Pump, made of marble and scagliola, to which the waters are today fed by electric pumping. The building has a colonnade of Ionic columns; the interior houses a ballroom on its ground floor. Further Ionic columns support a gallery under a dome from which music might be played; on upper floors there were a billiard room, library and reading room. Above the colonnade are three statues, by Lucius Gahagen, erected in 1827, of the goddess Hygieia, Aesculapius and Hippocrates.David Verey, Gloucestershire: the Vale and the Forest of Dean, The Buildings of England edited by Nicholas Pevsner, 2nd ed (1976) The Pump Room and its grounds were managed during the 19th century by a succession of lessees, who offered the typical fare of pleasure gardens including menageries, exhibitions and balloon ascents. However the concession did not prove lucrative. Eventually Pitt himself went bankrupt and in 1890 the Room and the grounds passed into the ownership of the town council.Steven Blake, Pittville Pump Room, 2nd edition, (2000) . They are now part of The Cheltenham Trust, a charity which also manages the Cheltenham Town Hall, the Wilson Art Gallery & Museum, the Prince of Wales Stadium and Leisure @ - plus the town's Tourist Information Centre which has continued to use them for public events. The Pump Room is frequently used as a concert hall, especially during the Cheltenham Music Festival. At one time the upper floor housed a Museum of Fashion. Following elections in 2007 the incoming Council discussed the possibility of selling the Pump Room but after widespread protests this proposal was later dropped in favour of a limited privatization which would retain the building's public use.BBC report, 6 June 2007 http://www.cheltenhamtownhall.org.uk/ Interior of the dome References External links * Pump Room web site Category:Buildings and structures in Cheltenham Category:Pleasure gardens in England Category:Grade I listed buildings in Gloucestershire Category:Colonnades Category:Tourist attractions in Gloucestershire Category:Culture in Cheltenham ","title":"Pittville Pump Room"},{"id":"8015055","text":"In social dynamics, critical mass is a sufficient number of adopters of a new idea, technology or innovation in a social system so that the rate of adoption becomes self-sustaining and creates further growth. The point at which critical mass is achieved sometimes referred to as a threshold within the threshold model of statistical modeling. The term critical mass is borrowed from nuclear physics and in that field, it refers to the amount of a substance needed to sustain a chain reaction. Within social sciences, critical mass has its roots in sociology and is often used to explain the conditions under which reciprocal behavior is started within collective groups, and how it becomes self-sustaining. Recent technology research in platform ecosystems shows that apart from the quantitative notion of a ‚Äúsufficient number‚Äù critical mass is also influenced by qualitative properties such as such as reputation, interests, commitments, capabilities, goals, consensuses, and decisions, all of which are crucial in determining whether reciprocal behavior can be started to achieve sustainability to a commitment such as an idea, new technology, or innovation.Evans, D. S., & Schmalensee, R. (2010). ‚ÄúFailure to launch: Critical mass in platform businesses.‚Äù Review of Network Economics, 9(4), 1-33. David, R., Aubert, B.A., Bernard, J-G., & Luczak-Roesch, M. (2020). Critical Mass in Inter-Organizational Platforms. Americas Conference of Information Systems (AMCIS), Salt Lake City, UT. 10-12 August, 2020. https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&context;=amcis2020 Other social factors that are important include the size, inter-dependencies and level of communication in a society or one of its subcultures. Another is social stigma, or the possibility of public advocacy due to such a factor. Critical mass is a concept used in a variety of contexts, including physics, group dynamics, politics, public opinion, and technology. History The concept of critical mass was originally created by game theorist Thomas Schelling and sociologist Mark Granovetter to explain the actions and behaviors of a wide range of people and phenomenon. The concept was first established (although not explicitly named) in Schelling's essay about racial segregation in neighborhoods, published in 1971 in the Journal of Mathematical Sociology, and later refined in his book, Micromotives and Macrobehavior, published in 1978.Schelling, Thomas C. Micromotives and Macrobehavior. New York: Norton, 1978. Print. He did use the term \\"critical density\\" with regard to pollution in his \\"On the Ecology of Micromotives\\".Schelling, Thomas C. \\"On the Ecology of Micromotives,\\" The Public Interest, No. 25, Fall 1971. Mark Granovetter, in his essay \\"Threshold models of collective behavior\\", published in the American Journal of Sociology in 1978 worked to solidify the theory.Krauth, Brian. \\"Notes for a History of the Critical Mass Model.\\" SFU.ca. Web. 29 November 2011. https://www.sfu.ca/~bkrauth/papers/critmass.htm. Everett Rogers later cites them both in his important work Diffusion of Innovations, in which critical mass plays an important role. =Predecessors= The concept of critical mass had existed before it entered a sociology context. It was an established concept in medicine, specifically epidemiology, since the 1920s, as it helped to explain the spread of illnesses. It had also been a present, if not solidified, idea in the study of consumer habits and economics, especially in General Equilibrium Theory. In his papers, Schelling quotes the well-known \\"The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism\\" paper written in 1970 by George Akerlof.Akerlof, George A. The Market for \\"lemons\\": Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism. 2003. Print. Similarly, Granovetter cited the Nash Equilibrium game in his papers. Finally, Herbert A. Simon's essay, \\"Bandwagon and underdog effects and the possibility of election predictions\\", published in 1954 in Public Opinion Quarterly, has been cited as a predecessor to the concept we now know as critical mass. Logic of collective action and common good Critical mass and the theories behind it help us to understand aspects of humans as they act and interact in a larger social setting. Certain theories, such as Mancur Olson's Logic of Collective ActionOlson, Mancur. The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1971. Print. or Garrett Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons, work to help us understand why humans do or adopt certain things which are beneficial to them, or, more importantly, why they do not. Much of this reasoning has to do with individual interests trumping that which is best for the collective whole, which may not be obvious at the time. Oliver, Marwell, and Teixeira tackle this subject in relation to critical theory in a 1985 article published in the American Journal of Sociology. In their essay, they define that action in service of a public good as \\"collective action\\". \\"Collective Action\\" is beneficial to all, regardless of individual contribution. By their definition, then, \\"critical mass\\" is the small segment of a societal system that does the work or action required to achieve the common good. The \\"Production Function\\" is the correlation between resources, or what individuals give in an effort to achieve public good, and the achievement of that good. Such function can be decelerating, where there is less utility per unit of resource, and in such a case, resource can taper off. On the other hand, the function can be accelerating, where the more resources that are used the bigger the payback. \\"Heterogeneity\\" is also important to the achievement of a common good. Variations (heterogeneity) in the value individuals put on a common good or the effort and resources people give is beneficial, because if certain people stand to gain more, they are willing to give or pay more. Gender politics Critical mass theory in gender politics and collective political action is defined as the critical number of personnel needed to affect policy and make a change not as the token but as an influential body. Pdf from Norges Handelsh√∏yskole (NHH), the Norwegian School of Economics. This number has been placed at 30%, before women are able to make a substantial difference in politics. However, other research suggests lower numbers of women working together in legislature can also affect political change. Pdf. Kathleen Bratton goes so far as to say that women, in legislatures where they make up less than 15% of the membership, may actually be encouraged to develop legislative agendas that are distinct from those of their male colleagues. Others argue that we should look more closely at parliamentary and electoral systems instead of critical mass. Interactive media While critical mass can be applied to many different aspects of sociodynamics, it becomes increasingly applicable to innovations in interactive media such as the telephone, fax, or email. With other non- interactive innovations, the dependence on other users was generally sequential, meaning that the early adopters influenced the later adopters to use the innovation. However, with interactive media, the interdependence was reciprocal, meaning both users influenced each other. This is due to the fact that interactive media have high network effect,Rogers, Everett M. Diffusion of Innovations. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2003. Print. where in the value and utility of a good or service increases the more users it has. Thus, the increase of adopters and quickness to reach critical mass can therefore be faster and more intense with interactive media, as can the rate at which previous users discontinue their use. The more people that use it, the more beneficial it will be, thus creating a type of snowball effect, and conversely, if users begin to stop using the innovation, the innovation loses utility, thus pushing more users to discontinue their use. =Markus essay= In M. Lynne Markus' essay in Communication Research entitled \\"Toward a 'Critical Mass' Theory of Interactive Media\\", several propositions are made that try to predict under what circumstances interactive media is most likely to achieve critical mass and reach universal access, a \\"common good\\" using Oliver, et al.'s terminology. One proposition states that such media's existence is all or nothing, where in if universal access is not achieved, then, eventually, use will discontinue. Another proposition suggests that a media's ease of use and inexpensiveness, as well as its utilization of an \\"active notification capability\\" will help it achieve universal access. The third proposition states that the heterogeneity, as discussed by Oliver, et al. is beneficial, especially if users are dispersed over a larger area, thus necessitating interactivity via media. Fourth, it is very helpful to have highly sought-after individuals to act as early adopters, as their use acts as incentive for later users. Finally, Markus posits that interventions, both monetarily and otherwise, by governments, businesses, or groups of individuals will help a media reach its critical mass and achieve universal access. =Fax machine example= A fax machine An example put forth by Rogers in Diffusion of Innovations was that of the fax machine, which had been around for almost 150 years before it became popular and widely used. It had existed in various forms and for various uses, but with more advancements in the technology of faxes, including the use of existing phone lines to transmit information, coupled with falling prices in both machines and cost per fax, the fax machine reached a critical mass in 1987, when \\"Americans began to assume that 'everybody else' had a fax machine\\".

It is scored for 5 voices (in most sources, soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), baritone (Bar) and bass (B), although some specify SSATB instead) and presents the legend that swans sing only just before their deaths (see swan song). History and text The song was first published in Gibbons's First Set of Madrigals and Motets of 5 parts (1612). Gibbons dedicated this collection to his patron, Sir Christopher Hatton (1581‚Äì1619). It was normal at this time for composers to seek aristocratic patronage, and for example Hatton's brother-in- law Henry Fanshawe had a set of madrigals dedicated to him the following year by his composer in residence John Ward. By Gibbons' own account, he used Hatton's London house as a place to compose. Hatton appears to have selected the texts used in the collection:Vining, Paul. ‚ÄúGibbons and His Patrons‚Äù.

The anonymous lyrics of The Silver Swan are as follows: : The silver Swan, who, living, had no Note, : when Death approached, unlocked her silent throat. : Leaning her breast against the reedy shore, : thus sang her first and last, and sang no more: : \\"Farewell, all joys! O Death, come close mine eyes! : More Geese than Swans now live, more Fools than Wise.\\" The last line has been taken as a comment on the demise of the English madrigal form or, more generally, on the loss of the late Elizabethan musical tradition. Music Commenting on the musical form, Philip Ledger notes that \\"in common with the lute-song, and unlike any true madrigal, it has two musical sections, the second one repeated, and new words are provided for this repeat\\". Though composed as a madrigal, The Silver Swan is, in modern times, often performed as a song for chamber choir. It is also performed as a song for soprano and viol consort. Other settings of the poem The words to this madrigal have been set to music by the following composers and groups: *Gary Bachlund (1966), for a cappella SATB chorus. *Garth Baxter, from Three Madrigals (for voice and piano, voice and guitar, or SATB).http://garthbaxter.org/instruments/vocal.html *John Musto (1987), from Canzonettas for high voice or medium voice and piano. *Ned Rorem (1949), for high voice and piano. *Qntal (2006), on their album Qntal V: Silver Swan. *Lori Laitman (2007), for voice and piano, or voice, flute and piano.

On 13 November 1805 Marshals Murat and Lannes, commanding the French advance guard, had captured a bridge over the Danube at Vienna by falsely claiming that an armistice had been signed, and then rushing the bridge while the guards were distracted. Kutuzov needed to gain time in order to make contact near Brno (Br√ºnn) with reinforcements led by Buxhowden. He ordered his rearguard under Major-General Prince Pyotr Bagration to delay the French. Murat and Lannes commanded the 4th and 5th Corps and the Reserve Cavalry. Bagration took up a position about 6 km north of Hollabrunn, on the hill above the small town of Sch√∂ngrabern (today part of Grabern). Murat believed that the whole of the Russian army was before him, and hesitated to attack. Bagration then suggested to Murat that negotiations for an armistice should be opened. Murat agreed, and did not attack. When Napoleon was informed of this he was furious and wrote to Murat: On 16 November 1805 Murat informed Bagration that the armistice would end at 5:00 pm. The confused action took place during the night. After sustaining several French assaults and holding the position for some six hours, Bagration was driven out and executed a skilled and organised withdrawal to retire northeast to join the main Russian army. His skillful defence in the face of superior forces successfully delayed the French enough for the Russian forces of Kutuzov and Buxhowden to unite at Brno (Br√ºnn) on 18 November 1805.  The battle in fiction  The battle is depicted in Leo Tolstoy‚Äôs novel War and Peace. Prince Andrei Bolkonsky is present and attaches himself to the artillery battery of Captain Tushin. As the battle progresses the battery ends up alone and unsupported, becoming the deciding factor in the successful withdrawal of the Russian troops. Later that evening, some Russian staff officers accuse Captain Tushin of having abandoned his artillery pieces, rather than retreating with the guns as ordered. Prince Andrei tells Bagration that there were no supporting Russian troops, and that Captain Tushin and his men might well have been the vital point in delaying the French advance. Given the lack of detail in historical sources for this battle, it is unclear how closely Tolstoy's version of the battle relates to the historical action.

Early life and education  Singh was born in Yalalevu, Ba, Fiji on 3 May 1950. He is a descendant of Indian indentured labourers brought to Fiji between 1879 and 1916, to develop Fiji's economy and prevent the exploitation of native Fijians. He started school at the local Arya Samaj primary school and then moved to the nearby Methodist Mission School to complete his primary education. His secondary education was at Xavier College in Ba. He then enrolled at the University of the South Pacific, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in 1972. After a short stint as Physics teacher at his old school, Xavier College, Singh took up a teaching position at the Derrick Technical Institute (now known as the Fiji Institute of Technology). His desire for further education took him to the University of Auckland, from where he graduated with Master of Science. He returned to Fiji in 1982 and took up lectureship in Physics at the University of the South Pacific.  Member of the Fiji Labour Party  Singh was disappointed with the racial politics of the two major political parties in Fiji and was one of the first people in Fiji to express a need for a completely new non-racial political organisation in Fiji. He strongly supported the formation of the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) in 1985. He was one of the candidates for the FLP in the November 1985 election for the Suva City Council, in which the FLP won 8 of the 20 seats. Singh stood in the safe Alliance ward of Muanikau but lost by only a narrow margin. When talks began for a coalition between National Federation Party (NFP) and the Fiji Labour Party, Singh openly expressed his opposition. He released the results of a survey, which demonstrated that FLP could win 26 seats on its own. His main concern was that a coalition with NFP would destroy Labour's multiracial image and undermine its efforts to win greater Fijian support. Singh's survey was designed to rally anti-coalition support at the first FLP convention in Lautoka in July 1986, but the convention decided to give the party's Management Board a free hand to negotiate possible areas of co- operation with the NFP.  Post coup Fiji  In 1986 Singh left for the United Kingdom under an Association of Commonwealth Universities scholarship to pursue a PhD degree which he subsequently obtained from the University of Leicester in 1990. On his return to Fiji in 1990 he found that Fiji had undergone a huge change during his three-year sabbatical. The 1970 constitution had been abrogated, there was little freedom of speech and the majority of the community lived in fear as the rule of law had broken down. Fiji was ostensibly being ruled by an interim government with Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau as President and Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara as Prime Minister but the military held a strong grip on the affairs of the nation, and called all the shots. After the failure of the interim government in having two versions of its proposed Constitution accepted by all people of Fiji, the country was in a political stalemate. The announcement on the night of 25 July 1990 by the President of Fiji of a new Constitution came as a complete shock to many of the people of Fiji as it had happened without any prelude. Initially, those opposed to the imposition of the new constitution, and brave enough to express their views, began expressing their opposition to the new constitution through letters to the media. But the interim government was adamant that the constitution was there to stay and did everything in its power to create an impression that the unilaterally-imposed Constitution had been accepted by all citizens of Fiji.  Group Against Racial Discrimination  To co-ordinate efforts against the imposition which was regarded as unjust, it was decided to form a pressure group, known as Group Against Racial Discrimination (GARD). This was a loose grouping of like-thinking individuals, most of who were University of the South Pacific (USP) academics including Singh, who had the common desire to see the restoration of a democratic government in the country after the 1970 constitution had been abrogated by Major-General Rabuka. Their main aim was to bring the plight of the people of Fiji to the notice of the free world through letters and other means of communication. Efforts towards the local campaign quickly became ineffectual after the media began refusing to publish the letters. GARD decided that a better way to demonstrate its opposition was by burning copies of the constitution. This had been tried a couple of times earlier, however, these actions had been largely ineffective as they had failed to gain any publicity. To gain widespread publicity in Fiji, and internationally, it was decided to carry out the protest during celebrations for the Diwali Festival, also known as the festival of lights, celebrated by Hindus. The protest was implemented on Thursday, 18 October 1990 in Suva. After a short speech by Singh, a copy of the constitution was burnt. The protest was duly reported in the Daily Post the next day, with the front- page headline saying \\"Hindus burn constitution\\". The interim government called an emergency cabinet meeting. It condemned the protest, and released a statement calling the action \\"treasonous and despicable\\". It asked the police to investigate.  Abduction  Despite precautions by members of the group, on the morning of Wednesday, 24 October 1990, Singh was abducted while on his way to work. He was blind-folded and taken to a forest in hills outside Suva called Colo-i-Suva. He was gagged and severely beaten and interrogated for 12 hours. His captors then left him in the dark and disappeared. Somehow, he made his way to a road and was driven to safety by a passing taxi. He had incurred severe injuries to his face and hands and needed to travel to Australia for medical treatment. On 22 November 1990, five members of the Special Operations Security Unit of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces pleaded guilty to the abduction and torture of Singh and were sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for 15 months. The army denied that the five had acted on its orders and even sent them on peace keeping duties overseas. Singh has written an account of his experience in the book, Silent Warriors.  High Court ruling  Singh sued the five and the Attorney General and after a thirteen-year delay, on 1 November 2006, the High Court of Fiji ruled in favour of Singh. In his judgement, Justice R.J. Coventry said \\"I do find that there were tortious acts as pleaded in the Statement of Claim committed by the first five defendants. I do not find that the defence under section 52 of the Royal Fiji Military Forced Act is available to the five defendants nor consequently the sixth defendant. I find that the tortious acts committed by the five defendants were so closely connected with their employment and in particular the functions and purposes of the Special Operations Security Unit that the sixth defendant, representing the State, is vicariously liable for those tortious acts.\\" Singh, speaking to Fiji Live said he has finally found closure as the matter has been in the judicial system for 13 years. \\"People have been asking me, is it about the money? Money is not important. What's important is the fact that we have proved ourselves that we were right. Today's ruling has set a precedent and is clearly a landmark case that will definitely have positive ramifications. There are many others that were tortured during the period after the 1987 coup.\\" On 6 September 2007, Singh was awarded $793,022 as compensation by the High Court. Judge Justice Roger Coventry ruled that the State, and the soldiers involved, pay Singh the money. Justice Coventry said that he regarded Singh's original claim of $25,000 for exemplary damages \\"too modest\\" given the circumstances of the case. He is still not being paid $793,022 since 2007 to 2013.  The meaning of democracy  Singh has never shied away from speaking on issues affecting the citizens of Fiji. Following the 2006 military coup in Fiji, he has, in a letter published in a local newspaper, defined \\"democracy\\" in the context of the situation in Fiji. He has argued that even if a Government is elected by constitutional means, it is not democracy \\"when the outcome of the process brings about oppression of a large section of the country\\" ‚Äì referring to the policies of the Qarase Government that he says overtly discriminated against the Indo-Fijians. On the military coup, he has stated that \\"history is full of examples where equal rights for all could only eventuate through illegal, and indeed criminal acts.\\"  See also  * Group Against Racial Discrimination  Bibliography  *  References   External links  * University of the South Pacific ‚Äì Staff Information * State is liable for torture soldiers: Court Category:1950 births Category:Alumni of the University of Leicester Category:University of the South Pacific alumni Category:People from Yalalevu Category:Indo-Fijian writers Category:Fijian Hindus Category:Living people Category:Quantum physicists Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:Fijian democracy activists Category:Fijian scientists Category:University of the South Pacific faculty ","title":"Anirudh Singh"},{"id":"8015155","text":"Northview Hills is a neighborhood within the city limits of Tampa, Florida.

His tenure as an active Justice of the Court, at more than 42 years, was the longest of any justice excluding William Fleming, who served nearly 44 years, from 1780-1824.Fleming was appointed to the General Court in 1780 and became a member, ex-officio, of the Supreme Court of Appeals. Each of the judges serving on the Supreme Court of Appeals from 1779-1788 also served on another appellate court (the Court of High Chancery, the Court of Admiralty, or the General Court). When the court was reorganized as an entirely separate body in 1788, Edmund Pendleton, Peter Lyons, Paul Carrington, and John Blair were appointed members. Fleming remained on the new court until he died in 1824. Thus Fleming \\"was a member of the Virginia court of last resort for nearly 44 years.\\" David Mays, \\"William Fleming, 1736-1824,\\" Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the Virginia State Bar Association 1927, v. 39 (Richmond, Va.), 426-435. Because current law requires active judges and Justices in Virginia to retire or take senior status on or shortly after their seventieth birthdays, Justice Carrico's longevity record likely will not be challenged. Early life and education Carrico was born in Washington, D.C. and soon after moved to Fauquier County. He attended Fairfax County, Virginia public schools and received his undergraduate and law degrees from George Washington University. Career Carrico began his legal career as an associate in the law firm of Rust & Rust, Fairfax (1941‚Äì43); he was then appointed to serve as a trial justice and judge of Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (1943‚Äì51). He returned to the private practice of law (1951‚Äì56). In 1956 he was appointed a judge of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. He was elevated to the Supreme Court in 1961. He served as a justice until 1981 when, by virtue of seniority, he became Chief Justice. (The Chief Justice is no longer selected by seniority, but is elected by the Justices to a four-year term). During his tenure as Chief Justice, Carrico served as President of the Conference of Chief Justices from 1989-90. He retired from active service in 2003 and took senior status. Carrico was succeeded as Chief Justice by Leroy Rountree Hassell, Sr., the first black Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia. The vacancy created by Carrico's retirement was filled by G. Steven Agee, a former member of the General Assembly. Carrico's daughter, Lucretia Carrico sits as a General District Judge in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Judge Lucretia Carrico sits primarily in Petersburg, Virginia, but may also sit in Powhatan, Amelia, Dinwiddie or Nottoway counties. As a general district judge she hears misdemeanor cases, preliminary hearings for felony cases and civil cases involving sums less than $15,000.00. Loving v. Commonwealth Justice Carrico was the author of the Virginia Supreme Court's unanimous 1966 opinion in Loving v. Commonwealth, upholding Virginia's miscegenation statutes. Richard Loving and his wife, Mildred Loving, had been convicted of living together as husband and wife without being legally married, since their Washington, D.C. interracial marriage was not recognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Both were sentenced to one year in prison for miscegenation, but their sentence was suspended on the condition that they leave the Commonwealth of Virginia and not return for 25 years together. They appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court.Loving v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 924, 147 S.E.2d 78 (1966) Because in 1956 The United States Supreme Court upheld Virginia's anti- miscegenation law by refusing to accept a challenge to it in Naim v. Naim, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals could not rule that the law was a violation of the U.S. Constitution since lower courts are not allowed to overrule the United States Supreme Court. Justice Carrico's opinion merely reiterates the arguments used in \\"Pace versus the State of Alabama\\" (1883) and \\"Plessy versus Ferguson\\" (1896) two United States Supreme Court decisions that had not been overturned prior to 1966, although \\"Brown v The Board of Education Of Topeka, Kansas\\" (1954) seemed to signal an end to the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine established by the Supreme in Plessy. Many view Carrico's opinion upholding Virginia's segregationist and unconstitutional statute as obstructionist but it has not been established that Carrico, as a white jurist, arrived at his conclusions out of racial animosity towards African-Americans. Nevertheless, for many, the implication of racism from Carrico's opinion is hard to avoid given what appears to be his deliberate refusal to follow Supreme Court precedent, and indeed, Carrico's opinion was promptly and unanimously overruled by the United States Supreme Court. In Loving, Justice Carrico stated that \\"There is no dispute that Richard Perry Loving is a white person and that Mildred Jeter Loving is a colored person within the meaning of Code, ¬ß 20-58. Nor is there any dispute that the actions of the defendants, as set forth in the indictment, violated the provisions of Code, ¬ß 20-58.\\" Ignoring a whole host of Supreme Court precedents, Carrico went on to rely on the infamous and discredited Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 41 L. Ed. 256, 16 S. Ct. 1138 (1896) and its progeny, finding Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 98 L. Ed. 873, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954) distinguishable, because Brown dealt with education and not marriage. Distinguishing Brown and its progeny, Justice Carrico observed that \\"it must be pointed out that none of them deals with miscegenation statutes or curtails a legal truth which has always been recognized that there is an overriding state interest in the institution of marriage. None of these decisions takes away from what was said by the United States Supreme Court in Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 31 L. Ed. 654, 657, 8 S. Ct. 723: > Marriage, as creating the most important relation in life, as having more to > do with the morals and civilization of a people than any other institution, > has always been subject to the control of the Legislature. Justice Carrico further held that \\"Although the defendants were, by the terms of the suspended sentences, ordered to leave the state, their sentences did not technically constitute [illegal] banishment because they were permitted to return to the state, provided they did not return together or at the same time.\\" He therefore remanded the case so that the decision could be modified to prohibit Mr. and Mrs. Loving from cohabiting as husband and wife in Virginia, a less restrictive condition of the 25-year suspended sentence. The Loving decision was subsequently overruled by a unanimous United States Supreme Court in 1967. The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that anti- miscegenation laws were racist and had been enacted to perpetuate white supremacy: > There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious > racial discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that > Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons > demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own > justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy. In Loving v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court held that marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man, a fundamental freedom which could not be denied based on race. Later service During Carrico's tenure as Chief Justice, which began in 1981 and lasted 22 years, he was an advocate for the admission of women and minorities to the legal profession in the Commonwealth. He also was the moving force behind the institution of Virginia's first-in-the-nation mandatory professionalism course, which every attorney must complete within 12 months of admission as an active member of the Virginia State Bar. At the time of his retirement in 2003 after his historic 42-year tenure on the Virginia Supreme Court, he was a widely respected figure in the Virginia legal and judicial communities. In 2007, the professionalism course he founded was named in his honor by the Virginia State Bar, which also named its annual professionalism award in his honor; he was the first recipient. Carrico died, aged 96, in Richmond, Virginia.

The team was of county strength and featured the noted players Tom Faulkner, Joe Harris, John Harris, George Jackson and Durling. The team immediately accepted the Slindon Challenge, in 1744, to play against any parish in England. The only other club to accept was Robert Colchin's Bromley. Matches It is not known when the Addington club was founded and the team played its earliest known game, in London, in 1743. At the Artillery Ground on 25 July, Addington defeated the foremost London Cricket Club by an innings & 4 runs. London scored 32 & 74; Addington 110. Kent players Robert Colchin, aka \\"Long Robin\\", and Tom Peake played for Addington as given men while Surrey's William Sawyer played for London as a given man. It was after Slindon defeated London in September 1744 that it issued its challenge to the rest of England. Addington and Slindon met at the Artillery Ground on 12 and 13 September but the occasion was ruined by bad weather and the match could not be concluded. Addington and London won a home game each against each other in 1745. The best Addington players were frequently involved in single wicket contests, which were hugely popular throughout the 1740s. They also played often in representative teams. Tom Faulkner in particular was one of the most influential figures in the sport. In 1746, Addington beat Bromley \\"with great difficulty\\" on Bromley Common but a return match at the Artillery Ground was inconclusive. In 1747, Addington joined forces with nearby Croydon to play three matches against London: they won one, lost one and one had an unknown result. In 1748, the \\"best five\\" Addington players took part in a big single wicket contest against \\"The Rest of England\\". One of the Addington five was described as \\"the shoemaker that lately came out of Kent\\". It is possible that this shoemaker was Durling, who first made his presence felt that season. Durling's origins are otherwise unknown. Signs of Addington's decline can be seen at the end of the 1740s. On 10 July 1749, \\"Five of All-England\\" defeated \\"Five of Addington\\" at the Artillery Ground. The match was played for fifty guineas a side and was the result of a challenge by the Addington players to meet any other five in England. Betting was 8-1 in favour of Addington but the team of Faulkner, Joe Harris, John Harris, George Jackson and Durling was beaten by Colchin, John Bryant, Robert Eures, John Bell and Thomas Waymark. On 17 July, in a return match, the same Addington five beat the same All-England five for fifty guineas. But on 26 July in a deciding match, All-England won by 2 runs, scoring 11 and 12; Addington replied with 16 and 5. The prize this time was 100 guineas. All-England made two changes to its team with James Bryant and Val Romney replacing Bell and Waymark. Addington‚Äôs five were unchanged. On 17 July 1750, Addington lost a sensational match to the re- emerging Dartford by 6 runs on Dartford Brent. Dartford scored 46 and 34; Addington replied with 39 and 35. William Hodsoll and the two Bryants all played for Dartford as given men. According to the London Evening Post on Thursday 19 July, Dartford lost its last five second innings wickets in five successive deliveries by a mixture of caught and bowled, but still won. There are more Addington games in the records until the end of the 1752 season but then there is nothing more, apart from occasional mentions of Faulkner and Durling who played into the 1760s. The Addington cricket ground still exists, is still in use for local games and is held to be one of the oldest in England.

The bin Attash brothers, who were interrogated in the CIA's archipelago of covert black sites, were captured in a Karachi safe house. *refer to instances when a suspect temporarily stayed in Karachi safe house or guest house. According to the 9-11 Commission Khalid Sheikh Mohammed rented a safe house in Karachi specifically to house the men who would later hijack the jetliners on September 11, 2001. The 9-11 Commission reported that Mohammed rented the safe house with funds from Osama bin Laden. Captured in a Karachi safe house or guest house American and Pakistani counter-terrorism officials conducted an extensive series of raids, across Pakistan, on September 11, 2002, the first anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001. Suspected safe houses and guesthouses in Karachi and Faisalabad were particular targets. Several of the captives captured on September 11, 2002 were of sufficient intelligence value that they were interrogated first in one of the CIA's archipelago of black sites, in particular the dark prison.

Intelligence analysts alleged the safe houses he managed were used as underground hospitals for fighters injured in Afghanistan. They alleged the safe houses had been used as an underground factory for the manufacture of the timers for time-bombs, and that five of the USS Cole bombers and seventeen of the nineteen hijackers in the September 11 attacks had stayed there. Connection to the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl Yosri Fouda, Al Jazeera's London bureau chief, interviewed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in April 2002 in a Karachi safe house. According to Jane Mayer, writing for The New Yorker, Fouda was \\"astounded\\" at the lack of concern Mohammed showed for his personal security, during and after the interview. She reported that Mohammed escorted Fouda downstairs and onto the street, following the interview. During this interview in the Karachi safe house Mohammed gave Fouda an unedited copy of the video of the beheading of American journalist Daniel Pearl. Pearl had been kidnapped and beheaded by jihadists in February 2002, in Karachi, two months prior to the interview. While Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was, eventually, to confess to beheading Pearl, when subjected to \\"extended interrogation methods\\" in CIA custody, he did not take credit for the beheading when interviewed by Fouda. In July 2002 Khalid Sheikh Mohammed lived in a four bedroom safe house in Karachi. It contained three laptops and five cell phones. Saud Memon, a wealthy Karachi industrialist owned the building where Pearl was held, killed and buried. He disappeared while living outside Pakistan in March 2003. He was found near his family home in Karachi four years later on April 28, 2007. He was emaciated, infected with meningitis, and unable to speak, or to recognize members of his family. He died three weeks later, on May 18, 2007, without offering an account of his missing four years. He was widely reported to have been apprehended by American security officials.

Les Tanneries in 1861 On July 16, 1874, the Montreal Herald announced that the provincial government had exchanged land at Les Tanneries (now the Saint-Henri district of Montreal) worth over $200,000 for a farm on the Coteau Saint-Pierre of west Montreal valued at less than $40,000. An organizer for the Conservative party, Arthur Dansereau, was alleged to have received $65,000 in commissions in the deal. Louis Archambeault, the commissioner of public works, was also implicated in the affair. George Irvine, John Jones Ross and Joseph Gibb Robertson, the three English-speaking members of the cabinet, resigned and Charles-Eug√®ne Boucher de Boucherville replaced Ouimet as premier. Ouimet was reelected to his seat in the assembly in the general election that followed in 1875. Despite the outrage of the public over the affair, the provincial Conservatives were able to retain power, mainly because of the continuing support of the party by the Catholic clergy of the province. Later that year, judge Francis Godschall Johnson found no evidence of fraud or conspiracy. The commission investigating the affair did not comment on the guilt or innocence of any cabinet member but did recommend that the land exchange which had triggered the scandal be cancelled. Although the scandal did not result in a change of the ruling party in the province, it did solidify the affiliation between the Catholic Church and the provincial Conservatives.

There are two main types of visual orientations, covert (exogenous) which occurs when a salient environmental change causes a shift in attention and overt (endogenous) which occurs when the individual makes a conscious decision to orient attention to a stimuli During a covert orientation of attention, the individual does not physically move, and during an overt orientation of attention the individual's eyes and head physically move in the direction of the stimulus. Information acquired through covert and overt visual orientations travels through the norepinephrine system, indirectly effecting the ventral visual pathway. The four specific brain regions involved in this process are the frontal eye field, the temporoparietal junction, the pulvinar, and the superior colliculus. The frontal eye field is involved in goal-driven eye movements and can inhibit stimulus driven eye movements. The temporoparietal junction appears to be involved location-cueing tasks, and individuals with lesions in this area have difficulty with attentional reorienting. The pulvinar is located posterior to the thalamus and its role in the orientating system is still being researched; however it is thought to be involved in covert orienting. Finally, the superior colliculus provides information about the location of the stimuli to which attention is directed.

In addition to the keep, sections of a gatehouse and wall survive. It has been designated a scheduled monument by Historic Environment Scotland. Newark Tower was granted to Archibald Douglas, Earl of Wigtown around 1423. It was incomplete at this time and work continued until about 1475. The surrounding barmkin was added around 1550, and the present battlements and two square caphouses date from about 1600. After the fall of the Black Douglases the Tower was held by the crown, and in 1473 it was given to Margaret of Denmark, wife of James III. The royal arms are visible on the west gable. Margaret Tudor, mother of James V, came to Newark in June 1532 to keep the Forest Court of Ettrick, the Ettrick lands being part of her marriage gift. The Laird of Buccleuch refused to give her the keys, until James V who was hunting at Cramalt in Meggotland sent confirmation. Margaret gave the keys to her husband Lord Methven.State Papers King Henry the Eighth, vol. IV part IV (London, 1836), p. 608. Newark was unsuccessfully besieged by an English army in 1547, but was burnt the following year. In 1645, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, 100 royalist followers of the Marquis of Montrose were shot in the barmkin of Newark after the Battle of Philiphaugh. The Tower was altered for Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch at the end of the 17th century. It was visited by Sir Walter Scott and William and Dorothy Wordsworth in 1831. Walter Scott set the frame story of The Lay of the Last Minstrel there. The Tower is believed to be haunted by the souls of women and children murdered by brutal soldiers at the site, who are heard each year on September 13.http://www.paranormaldatabase.com/lowlands/borddata.php?pageNum_paradata=1&totalRows;_paradata=39  References * * Category:Castles in the Scottish Borders Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in the Scottish Borders Newark Tower, Selkirkshire Category:Yarrow Valley Category:Reportedly haunted locations in Scotland Category:Tower houses in Scotland ","title":"Newark Castle, Selkirkshire"},{"id":"8015311","text":"Robert Sherwood Haggart (March 13, 1914 ‚Äì December 2, 1998) was an American dixieland jazz double bass player, composer, and arranger.

Set in Rome and Tripolitania between December AD 73 and May AD 74, during the reign of Emperor Vespasian, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The title refers to the execution of criminals in the arena, by trained lions. Plot summary As part of his attempts to earn enough money to buy himself into the upper middle ranks, and thus make his relationship with Helena Justina respectable, Marcus Didius Falco has offered his services to Vespasian as a tax collector during the 'great Census' of AD 73. Unfortunately, his plan has several flaws, one major one being his need to take on Anacrites as a partner. Whilst conducting the audit of two gladitorial training schools, Falco stumbles upon the apparent murder of a star man-eating lion and an apparent rivalry between the schools. When a gladiator also ends up dead, Falco takes on the investigation, one which leads him to Tripolitania. To add to the confusion, Helena's younger brother, Camillus Justinus, has eloped with the betrothed of his older brother, Aelianus. They too have made their way to North Africa, drawn by Justinus' quest to find Silphium, an expensive herb already deemed extinct.

Arad was lost on a mission over Lebanon, captured by Shiite group Amal and was later handed over to the Hezbollah.Reference needed. Contrary to this - Hezbollah, Born in Vengeance, Hala Jaber, New York (1997), p.29 Personal life Arad was born on 5 May 1958 in Hod HaSharon, Israel. He studied in the Boarding Command School in Tel Aviv. Arad began military service in the Israel Defense Forces in 1978 and graduated from the IAF flight course in 1979 as a combat navigator. In October 1985, Arad began studying chemical engineering at the Technion in Haifa. Arad was married to Tami and is father to a daughter, Yuval. Capture On 16 October 1986, Arad and pilot Yishai Aviram were on a mission to attack PLO targets near Sidon, Lebanon. A bomb dropped by their F-4 Phantom II apparently exploded prematurely, causing damage to the aircraft and forcing both crewmen to eject. Aviram was located by an Israeli Bell AH-1 Cobra a few hours later, and escaped by clinging to one of its landing skids as it flew away while under heavy enemy fire, but Arad was captured by the Lebanese Amal. Arad was taken to Beirut where he was held by then-head of security of Amal, Mustafa Dirani. Amal head Nabih Berri announced that he was holding Arad, and proposed an exchange for Shiite and Lebanese prisoners held in Israel. In 1987, three letters in Arad's handwriting and two photos of a bearded Arad were received, proving Arad was alive. The Israeli government negotiated for his release, but talks failed in 1988. After this time, credible information about Arad has been hard to obtain, though unsubstantiated claims of new information are made regularly. To gain further insight on his whereabouts, Israeli commandos captured Hezbollah member Abdel Karim Obeid in 1989, and Mustafa Dirani in 1994. The Israeli government claimed it was holding them in order to find out information about Arad. During his interrogation by IDF officers, Dirani reportedly disclosed that on 4 May 1988, Arad was turned over first to a Hezbollah unit and then to Iranian Revolutionary Guards who were in Lebanon at the time aiding Hezbollah guerrillas, after which he may have been taken to Iran. But neither Iran nor any guerrilla group ever offered any useful information about Arad's fate. Karim-Obeid and Dirani were released in 2004 as part of a prisoner swap. No information on Arad's fate was released after the swap. =Efforts to determine his fate= In 2003, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon revealed that an intelligence agent had been killed during efforts to rescue Arad. In December 2003, an organization seeking information about Arad issued a reward of $10 million to anyone coming forward with such information. In 2004, Aman, the IDF's military intelligence branch, formed a secret commission to investigate Arad's fate, headed by Major-General Aharon Ze'evi-Farkash. The investigation was based on interrogation transcripts and polygraph tests of Mustafa Dirani, intercepted messages, and intelligence gathered by Mossad and the IDF, including information from a 2004 Hezbollah investigation. The Farkash Commission concluded that Arad had died sometime between 1993 and 1997, with no signs of life received since 1995. According to the report, Arad had been captured by the Amal Movement, which openly demanded ransom money, arms, and a prisoner exchange. He was then abducted by Mustafa Dirani, then Amal's head of security, and was taken to the Beqaa Valley, where he was kept in hiding. When Dirani left Amal and defected to Hezbollah, he transferred Arad to Hezbollah custody. In early 1988, Arad was hidden in the village of Al-Nabi Shayth, where he was guarded by the Shukur clan. On May 5, 1988, his captors fled the area following Israeli bombing attacks. Arad was left behind, hidden in the bushes, and when the Shukur clan returned the next morning, they found that their prisoner had disappeared. Dirani then contacted a leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. Both Dirani and Hezbollah later suspected that Arad had been picked up by Revolutionary Guard personnel and taken to Iran. The commission claimed that he was taken to Tehran in 1990, where he was held in strict secrecy and in complete isolation. Arad was transferred back to Lebanon following the capture of Mustafa Dirani in a 1994 Israeli commando raid, after the Iranians feared that Dirani would implicate them. Arad was held at a Revolutionary Guard facility in Lebanon. The report stated that Arad died after he became gravely ill and was refused medical treatment, and that he was buried by militiamen in the Beqaa Valley. Furthermore, both Iran and Hezbollah did not know the precise location where he was buried, and were unable to locate his gravesite. While the majority of the committee members concluded that Arad had died in early 1995, others said that he probably died in late 1996 or early 1997. The report's analysis also revealed that Hezbollah assumed that Arad had died around 1995. Prime Ministers Ariel Sharon, Ehud Olmert, Benjamin Netanyahu refused to publish the results, and military censors only released the findings after Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman threatened to file a complaint with the Supreme Court. After the report became public, Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that Israel would continue to work under the assumption that Arad was alive, unless there was \\"conclusive evidence\\" that he was dead. In the early 1990s, Israel offered Iran a $10 billion aid package and to help Iran negotiate a compromise with the United States over $5 billion in Iranian assets frozen after the 1979 Iranian revolution in exchange for information on Arad. The report also revealed that when Iran was negotiating long-term loans with Western European countries to prevent economic collapse, Israeli intelligence closely followed the negotiations and discovered a strategy of deceit used by Iranian negotiators to get better rates and longer terms out of European lenders by telling them that other lenders had offered better rates and longer terms. Israel threatened to expose this information if Arad was not released, and when Iran refused, Israel carried out its threat, which resulted in negotiations being halted. Israel threatened to expose more embarrassing information unless Arad was released. These details were revealed in 2005 in Yediot Ahronot. In 1998 Ahmad Rezaee, the son of the former Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Mohsen Rezaee who had defected to the United States, claimed to have some information on the location of Arad and was willing to use his contacts in Iranian intelligence to find out his specific fate. However, his monetary demands were considered excessive and Israel rejected his offer. In 2006, Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah publicly stated that Hezbollah believed Arad to be dead and his remains lost. This marked the first time they publicly acknowledged their lack of knowledge about Arad's whereabouts. On 28 August 2006, the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation broadcast new footage of Arad. It is unknown when the footage was recorded.https://www.haaretz.com/1.4863425 In October 2007, Israel received a two-decade old letter written by Arad to his family. On 29 June 2008, United Nations negotiator Gerhard Konrad informed the Israeli government that according to Hezbollah, Arad had been killed during an escape attempt in 1988. In a news conference on 2 July 2008, held by Hassan Nasrallah, he stated that his group conducted a detailed investigation into the fate of the missing Israeli navigator. The investigation spanned three years, and included in- depth interviews with prominent figures in Lebanon. Nasrallah declined to indicate the findings of the investigation, but stated that a written report was handed to the United Nations representative mediating between the Lebanese group and the Israelis. During the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange in 2011, the son of Arad's pilot, Yishai Aviram, was the helicopter pilot who flew Gilad Shalit home after he personally appealed to Air Force commander Ido Nehoshtan. In February 2016, a Lebanese man, Moufid Kuntar, claimed in court that Arad had been tortured to death while being interrogated in 1988 and was buried in a forest near Mount Lebanon. Kuntar was a commander of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and claimed that the group captured Arad after he ejected. Kuntar was charged with spying for Israel's intelligence services, but claimed that he provided Israel with false information of Arad's fate until his court appearance. In October 2016, news reports revealed that a joint investigation carried out by Mossad and IDF Military Intelligence, based on new information received over the previous two years, concluded that Arad had died in 1988.

Under his rule, the commune of Milan became a strong Ghibelline city and one of the Holy Roman Empire's seats in Italy. Biography =Early life= Born in Invorio, near Novara, Ottone was the one of the 6 children of Uberto Visconti, lord of Massino, and Berta Pirovano. Along with his brother Azzone (later Bishop of Ventimiglia), Ottone was forced to ecclesiastical career by his family. He became canon to Desio and in 1247 chamberlain of the powerful Cardinal Ottaviano degli Ubaldini. Under his patronage, Ottone was appointed by Archbishop of Milan Leone da Perego as his envoy to France in 1252, gaining the trust of Pope Innocent IV, becoming his chaplain. After the death of Leone da Perego in 1257, Ottone was supported by Cardinal Ubaldini as successor to the Archdiocese of Milan, against Raimondo della Torre's candidacy. This action displeased city's lord Martino della Torre (relative of Raimondo), which claimed the historical autonomy of Milan on Archbishop's appointment. Despite Martino's opposition, Pope Urban IV chose Ottone as new Archbishop on 22 July 1262. =Power struggle in Milan= Ottone's insigne as Archbishop The Pope's choice did not stop the hostility of Martino della Torre, who occupied Milan Cathedral on August 1262, obtaining the excommunication by papal legate Filippo di Pistoia. This act started a war between Martino's family, the Della Torre or Torriani, and the Visconti. The two families were also politically opposed: the Della Torre were historically Guelphs and allied of Charles I of Anjou, while the Visconti were Ghibellines and exponent of low nobility. Still in Montefiascone, near Viterbo, where he received Pope's appointment, Ottone marched to Arona on 1 April 1263, where he met several nobles fled by Milan for their opposition to Della Torre. Informed on Ottone's presence in Lombardy, Martino sent his troops to put Arona under siege. Ottone, who occupied the near Rocca of Angera, was forced to surrender on 5 May 1263. Returned in Montefiascone, Ottone lost his powerful ally Urban IV, died on October 1264. Della Torre, however, never get Raimondo formal appointment, and after Martino's death, the once loyal Pallavicino family switched side to Visconti, scheming the assassination of Paganino della Torre, podest√† of Vercelli, on January 1266. In response, the new lord of Milan Napoleone della Torre executed 53 nobles, suspected of conjuring. This vicious act undermined Della Torre's grab on Milan, aggravated by Pope Gregory X, a Visconti of Piacenza, who in 1273 confirmed Ottone Visconti as legal Archbishop of Milan. Napoleone della Torre reacted exiling all noble families who don't supported him, causing the formation of an √©migr√© coalition in Novara and Pavia. Using their financial and military support, Ottone's nephew Teobaldo Visconti led an army in Vercelli, occupying Castelseprio. Defeated by Torriani's forces, Teobaldo fled to Lurate, near Como, but after a battle in Gallarate, his last forces were defeated and he was beheaded by Napoleone della Torre in 1276. Ottone, returned in Lombardy in the same year, recruited his supporters near Desio, where he was canon, and after a bloody battle on January 1277, Visconti emerged victorius. Napoleone della Torre was imprisoned and tortured to death in Castel Baradello, while his brother Francesco was executed after the battle. Ottone entered in Milan on 22 January 1277, becoming the first Visconti de facto ruler of the city. =Rule and final years= Became Lord of Milan at age 69, Ottone tried to strengthen his family's power on city and Lombardy. The years of his rule weren't peaceful: Della Torre still claimed the signoria (Italian for \\"lordship\\") and conquered Lodi and Castelseprio, ruling as rogue power in the region between Adda and Ticino rivers. Ottone seek the support of his ally William VII, Marquess of Montferrat, who demanded the city's government as Capitano generale (general- captain), granted to him in 1278. After William VII's side switch in 1281, Ottone re-acquired full powers on the city, and in the battle of Vaprio d'Adda of 1281, his forces defeated Cassone della Torre, who was killed in the battle, and Raimondo, elder claimant to Milan Archdiocese, who fled to Friuli. In 1287, the old Ottone appointed his grand-nephew Matteo I Visconti as new Capitano generale, left to him political affairs. On May 1288, Matteo Visconti also gained the title of Imperial vicar by Rudolph I of Germany, who avoided so to intervene directly of Lombard political situation while still nominal ruler of Milan. In his final years, Ottone never get involved in Milan politics, concentrating only of religious affairs. He died on 8 August 1295, at age 88, in the Abbey of Chiaravalle, obtaining the burial in Milan Cathedral.

The airport is located on a narrow peninsula between the Pacific Highway and a shallow tidal inlet that forms the entrance to Lake Macquarie. For most of its history, the airfield functioned as the base for Aeropelican Air Services, who operated commuter flights to and from Sydney using DHC-6 Twin Otters, however services were withdrawn in 2006 and the airfield was sold to the Mirvac Group for $5.5 million in 2008. NSW Ambulance and Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service operate a base from the airport, performing aeromedical retrieval services for northern New South Wales. Other tenants include nationwide skydiving company, Skydive the Beach and Beyond, whose Newcastle tandem skydiving drop zone operates here, along with Red Bull Air Race pilot Matt Hall. Past proposals for use Lake Macquarie City Council has expressed an interest in maintaining the site for aviation uses. Although the airport is privately owned and council has limited control over the site, zoning restrictions encourage future aviation use. The Council's Lifestyle 2030 Strategy development plan, published in March 2013 identifies the airport as having \\"ongoing potential for use by commuter aircraft\\" to serve Sydney and regional areas while generating business and employment opportunities. The council has previously rejected a proposal to redevelop the airport into housing estates. Under current guidelines, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has classified Belmont as an Aircraft Landing Area (ALA) as due to land constraints the site infrastructure does not meet the dimensions required to operate as a registered airport, placing some restriction on future uses for commercial passenger flights. Despite this, there have been attempts to restore the airport as an aviation facility since the withdrawal of Aeropelican, particularly since the closure and redevelopment of Cooranbong Airport, another privately owned airfield located to the west of Lake Macquarie. At the time of the 2008 sale, the Central Coast Aero Club was reported to have struck a deal with Mirvac to purchase the airport as a base of operations in exchange for the redevelopment of Warnervale Airport, owned by the club. This deal did not eventuate. In 2013, a consortium represented by Skyline Aviation Group and Red Bull Air Race pilot Matt Hall were reported as being close to closing a deal with Mirvac to purchase the airport, however backed out of negotiations before the deal could be finalised. In July 2014, negotiations led by Airborne Windsports, Matt Hall Racing, Skyline Aviation Group, Skydive the Beach and Beyond and a private investor concluded successfully, with airport upgrade works planned to commence immediately. As of June 2017, these works have not yet commenced.

It was originally recorded for the 2004 compilation album Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1, while a slightly altered version appeared on the band's third studio album Siren Song of the Counter Culture later that year. It is a hardcore punk song, with lyrics that are about \\"being a punk rocker in today's world,\\" according to lead vocalist Tim McIlrath. It was released as Siren Song of the Counter Culture first single in October 2004. Despite receiving minimal coverage from music critics who reviewed Siren Song of the Counter Culture, \\"Give It All\\" has become one of Rise Against's most widely recognized songs, and is credited as the band's breakthrough single. It has been featured on multiple lists of the best Rise Against songs, and peaked at number thirty-seven on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The accompanying music video has the band perform in a crowded subway car, while other people travel throughout the city of Chicago vandalizing and defacing billboards and posters, with the intention of raising social and political awareness. Background and composition After spending several years as an underground band in which they released two albums with Fat Wreck Chords, Rise Against signed a recording contract with Geffen Records in 2003. This deal was criticized by some fans, who felt that a major record label would hinder the band's creative process and negatively impact their music. The first song the band released following their signing to Geffen was \\"Give It All\\", which was featured on the 2004 compilation album Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1. The band liked the song, and decided to record a slightly altered version for their third studio album Siren Song of the Counter Culture later that year. \\"Give It All\\" is a short hardcore punk track, with a fast pace and a slow bridge, and in the key of A major (although the verses, pre-chorus, and bridge start with F-sharp minor). Lead vocalist Tim McIlrath commented that the song is \\"kind of a punk rock anthem about being a punk rocker in today‚Äôs world; like what being a human being in today‚Äôs world is like.\\" Scott Heisel of Punknews.org felt that the Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 version maintained the band's distinctive sound, and signing to a major record label had not changed the band's music. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic noted that the Siren Song of the Counter Culture version reminded him of a harder version of songs by the Offspring, and that it was controlled enough to appeal to casual rock fans. Reception \\"Give It All\\" began playing on radio stations in October 2004, as the first single from Siren Song of the Counter Culture. Commercially, \\"Give It All\\" became the first Rise Against song to reach the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, peaking at number thirty-seven on January 1, 2005. Upon the release of Siren Song of the Counter Culture, \\"Give It All\\" received almost no coverage from music critics who reviewed the album,Reviews that did not assess ‚ÄúGive It All‚Äù in a critical manner include:  * aside from Justin Donnelly of Blistering, who described the piece as \\"a little generic and forgettable\\". Despite the lack of coverage, it has become one of the band's most widely recognized songs, and John J. Moser of The Morning Call credits it as Rise Against's breakthrough single. Dave Kim of WGRD-FM listed \\"Give It All\\" as the fourth best Rise Against song. Music video In the music video, Rise Against performs the song inside a crowded subway car. The accompanying music video was directed by James Cox, and filmed in Chicago. In the video, Rise Against performs inside a subway car on the Chicago \\"L\\". Passengers begin boarding the car in large quantities, and engage in a mosh pit, while the band continues to perform. Simultaneously, other passengers leave the car and travel throughout the city at night, vandalizing and defacing billboards and posters with the intention of raising social and political awareness. In the morning, the vandals change into suits, and go to work. The band was given a small budget to film the music video. McIlrath remarked that the band did not want to make a video that felt \\"really cheesy or overproduced\\", and instead wanted to incorporate the song's message. The night before filming began, the band performed at a local venue, and asked the audience members to star in the video; several audience members came the following day. The subway car featured in the video continued to make its regular stops, while the band and the actors performed. During one scene in the video, the vandals sneak into the local zoo, and deface a tiger cage with a sticker that says \\"I've spent my entire life trapped in a cage\\". The zoo had not given permission for the band to film the tiger cage, out of fear it would damage their reputation. The filming crew chose to instead sneak into the zoo at night to film the scene.

All atomic formulas are thus of the form P(x), where P is a relation symbol and x is a variable. Monadic predicate calculus can be contrasted with polyadic predicate calculus, which allows relation symbols that take two or more arguments.  Expressiveness  The absence of polyadic relation symbols severely restricts what can be expressed in the monadic predicate calculus. It is so weak that, unlike the full predicate calculus, it is decidable‚Äîthere is a decision procedure that determines whether a given formula of monadic predicate calculus is logically valid (true for all nonempty domains).Heinrich Behmann, Beitr√§ge zur Algebra der Logik, insbesondere zum Entscheidungsproblem, in Mathematische Annalen (1922)L√∂wenheim, L. (1915) \\"√úber M√∂glichkeiten im Relativkalk√ºl,\\" Mathematische Annalen 76: 447-470. Translated as \\"On possibilities in the calculus of relatives\\" in Jean van Heijenoort, 1967. A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931. Harvard Univ. Press: 228-51. Adding a single binary relation symbol to monadic logic, however, results in an undecidable logic.  Relationship with term logic  The need to go beyond monadic logic was not appreciated until the work on the logic of relations, by Augustus De Morgan and Charles Sanders Peirce in the nineteenth century, and by Frege in his 1879 Begriffsschrifft. Prior to the work of these three men, term logic (syllogistic logic) was widely considered adequate for formal deductive reasoning. Inferences in term logic can all be represented in the monadic predicate calculus. For example the syllogism : All dogs are mammals. : No mammal is a bird. : Thus, no dog is a bird. can be notated in the language of monadic predicate calculus as : [(\\\\forall x\\\\,D(x)\\\\Rightarrow M(x))\\\\land eg(\\\\exists y\\\\,M(y)\\\\land B(y))] \\\\Rightarrow eg(\\\\exists z\\\\,D(z)\\\\land B(z)) where D, M and B denote the predicates of being, respectively, a dog, a mammal, and a bird. Conversely, monadic predicate calculus is not significantly more expressive than term logic. Each formula in the monadic predicate calculus is equivalent to a formula in which quantifiers appear only in closed subformulas of the form :\\\\forall x\\\\,P_1(x)\\\\lor\\\\cdots\\\\lor P_n(x)\\\\lor eg P'_1(x)\\\\lor\\\\cdots\\\\lor eg P'_m(x) or :\\\\exists x\\\\, eg P_1(x)\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land eg P_n(x)\\\\land P'_1(x)\\\\land\\\\cdots\\\\land P'_m(x), These formulas slightly generalize the basic judgements considered in term logic. For example, this form allows statements such as \\"Every mammal is either a herbivore or a carnivore (or both)\\", (\\\\forall x\\\\, eg M(x)\\\\lor H(x)\\\\lor C(x)). Reasoning about such statements can, however, still be handled within the framework of term logic, although not by the 19 classical Aristotelian syllogisms alone. Taking propositional logic as given, every formula in the monadic predicate calculus expresses something that can likewise be formulated in term logic. On the other hand, a modern view of the problem of multiple generality in traditional logic concludes that quantifiers cannot nest usefully if there are no polyadic predicates to relate the bound variables. Variants The formal system described above is sometimes called the pure monadic predicate calculus, where \\"pure\\" signifies the absence of function letters. Allowing monadic function letters changes the logic only superficially, whereas admitting even a single binary function letter results in an undecidable logic. Monadic second-order logic allows predicates of higher arity in formulas, but restricts second-order quantification to unary predicates, i.e. the only second-order variables allowed are subset variables.

The field was also used by the nearby University of Waterloo Warriors for their home football games. The Warriors played their final season at the stadium in 2008; they then moved to the new Warrior Field on the University of Waterloo north campus on Columbia St.http://news.therecord.com/article/302082http://www.athletics.uwaterloo.ca/varsity/sports/2008_2009/football/warrior_field.htm History Seagram Stadium was built for the University of Waterloo in 1957 with a $250,000 donation from Joseph E. Seagram and Sons Ltd. and additional contributions from Ontario Hydro and the City of Waterloo. It formally opened on May 7, 1958. The Waterloo College Mules played the first football game on October 5 of that year. https://www.therecord.com/community- story/8701869-flash-from-the-past-seagram-stadium-s-six-decades-began-with-a- gift/ Initially owned by Waterloo College, the stadium was sold to UW which sold it to the City of Waterloo on August 12, 1974 for $1 million, after leasing it to the city from 1968 to 1974. At that time, the stadium was in need of extensive repairs. In July 1992, the city sold the facility to Wilfrid Laurier University, also for $1 million. Artificial turf was installed in 1994 at a cost of $1.7 million. The stadium was renamed University Stadium and Sports Centre in March 1995.https://www.therecord.com/community- story/8701869-flash-from-the-past-seagram-stadium-s-six-decades-began-with-a- gift/ In 2007, the stadium underwent a major $5-million renovation which changed the layout; that included replacing the field's playing surface with Fieldturf, overhauling the bleachers, rearranging existing rooms and expansion of the entrance, concession areas and washrooms. The football field was then renamed Knight‚ÄìNewbrough Field (although the name of the field itself has changed, the stadium as a whole retains the name University Stadium.)https://www.laurierathletics.com/generatepage.php?ID=32 The name honours two influential figures in Laurier athletics history, former football head coaches for the Laurier Golden Hawks and UW Warriors Dave \\"Tuffy\\" Knight and Rich Newbrough.https://www.therecord.com/community-story/8701869-flash- from-the-past-seagram-stadium-s-six-decades-began-with-a-gift/ University Stadium is located near Waterloo Park on Seagram Drive.

During his political career, he served as Mayor of Brooklyn, a member of the United States House of Representatives, U.S. Minister to the Netherlands, and member of the New York State Senate. Murphy was an author and newspaper editor; he founded and was the first editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper, authored monographs on subjects including Henry Hudson's explorations, and translated several Dutch historical works into English. In addition to his political and literary careers, Murphy was involved in several business ventures in Brooklyn, including railroads and construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. Murphy died in Brooklyn in 1882 and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery. Early life Henry Cruse Murphy was born in Brooklyn on July 5, 1810. He was the eldest son of John Garrison Murphy and Clarissa Runyon, a New Jersey couple who settled in Brooklyn after their marriage. John Murphy was a prominent businessman, and his accomplishments included inventing and patenting in partnership with another individual a horse-powered wheel for use on East River ferries, which enabled them to change direction for round trips without having to turn around. Henry C. Murphy's grandfather Timothy Murphy was a doctor and an immigrant from Ireland who settled in New Jersey and was a veteran of the American Revolution. Henry Murphy graduated from Columbia College in 1830, studied law under Judge Peter W. Radcliffe, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Brooklyn. He was also the first editor of the Brooklyn Eagle and Kings County Democrat newspaper, which launched in 1841. Political career Murphy served as Brooklyn's City Attorney and Corporation Counsel, and was Mayor of Brooklyn in 1842 and 1843. In November 1842, prior to completion of his term as mayor of Brooklyn, Murphy was elected to the United States House of Representatives, and he served one term, March 4, 1843 to March 3, 1845 (28th Congress). He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1844, and served as a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1846. Murphy was returned to Congress in the November 1846 election, serving a second non-consecutive term from March 4, 1847 to March 3, 1849 (30th Congress). A Biographical Congressional Directory, 1774 to 1903, p. 711 Murphy was a delegate to the 1852 Democratic National Convention. When the convention deadlocked after several ballots on the selection of a presidential nominee, the delegation from Virginia decided to support a dark horse‚Äîa northerner whose views on slavery were acceptable to southerners (doughface)‚Äîwho they intended to vote for as a unit in the hopes of rallying enough delegates around one candidate that he could win the nomination. The Virginia delegates considered Murphy and Franklin Pierce. By one vote they decided to support Pierce, who went on to win the nomination and the presidency.Stiles, p. 14 From 1857 to 1861 Murphy served as Minister to the Netherlands. In 1860 he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Columbia. He was a member of the New York State Senate (3rd D.) from 1862 to 1873, sitting in the 85th, 86th, 87th, 88th, 89th, 90th, 91st, 92nd, 93rd, 94th, 95th and 96th New York State Legislatures. During the American Civil War Murphy opposed secession and supported the Union. He was one of the prominent Brooklyn leaders who recruited and equipped the 3rd Senatorial Regiment, which was mustered into service as the 159th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Murphy was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in the 1867 election, but Republicans controlled the state legislature and elected Roscoe Conkling. Murphy cast his ballot for George F. Comstock in the caucus held to choose the Democratic nominee, and again in the full legislative election. In 1867 he also served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention.Civil List and Constitutional History of the Colony and State of New York, p. 132 In 1868 Murphy was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York, but the Tammany Hall organization and its leader, William M. Tweed, controlled the process and were able to effect the nomination of John T. Hoffman. Murphy was the choice of Democrats in the legislature for the United States Senate in 1869, but the Republican majority elected Reuben Fenton. In the caucus to decide the Democratic nominee, Murphy cast his ballot for Henry S. Randall, and he voted for Randall again in the election held by the full legislature. When Fenton's term expired in 1875, Democrats controlled the legislature and Murphy was a candidate, but Francis Kernan won the support of the Democrats in the state legislature and was elected. Business career Murphy was active in several business ventures, including president of the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railroad, and member of the board of directors for the Brooklyn City Railroad and the Union Ferry Company. In 1866 Murphy became active in the effort to construct the Brooklyn Bridge. He was an incorporator of the original venture, the Brooklyn Bridge Company, and served as its president. When the project was converted to a public work, Murphy was elected president of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge Company Board of Trustees, the entity created to plan, oversee construction of, and operate it. He served as president of the board until his death. Career as author Murphy was a historian and writer, and is perhaps best known for his research on the early Colonial history of New York. He was a founder of the Long Island Historical Society and the Brooklyn City Library.\\"Henry Cruse Murphy\\" in James Grant Wilson and John Fiske (eds.), Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Volume 4.

Galdi is regarded as a pioneer in Italian erotic photography. He is known to be first in breaking the taboo of not depicting an erect penis.  Biography  = Early Years = Rosa D'Amore, photographed by Vincenzo Galdi at the end of 19th century Galdi was born in Naples on October 11, 1871. His father Vincenzo was one of the descendants of an ancient Italian noble house with title of baron, one of whose ancestors was a Norman knight, who participated in liberation of Salerno from the Saracens. He belonged to a branch, which in the middle of the eighteenth century had settled in Marigliano and inherited the title of Castelan of Ischia and Procida, as well as Lord of Corleone in Sicily. Elder Vincenzo was a banker and owner of a hat factory. Vincenzo Galdi's mother, Rosa D'Amore, was the sister of the mayor of Marigliano. = Naples = Poster of the show \\"I Cammorristi nel Carcere della Vicaria\\",in which Galdi played the role of Aniello, performed on stage in 1890 at the Theater Folly of Naples. Vincenzo Galdi enrolled in the Institute of Fine Arts in Naples. During his studies he was especially impressed with optics and photographic technique, even building a wooden camera with a telescopic lens by himself. As a student he worked at the studio of Giorgio Sommer at his photographic studio on Via Monte di Dio. He started to study with German photographer Guglielmo Pl√ºschow, who had a studio in Naples in 1886 or 1887. As he was strikingly good-looking, Galdi also modeled for Pl√ºschow at that time. Starting from 1887, and until 1890, the young Galdi also worked in theater as a set designer, instrumentalist and actor with the Eduardo Scarpetta's company and then with Alberto Cozzella and Vincenzo Esposito. But the economic default of the former Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the decline of Naples art scene led Galdi to leave his homeland and move to Rome with Guglielmo Pl√ºschow. = Rome = When he arrived in Rome in 1890, Galdi bought a penthouse with terrace on Via Sardegna 55 in the new Ludovisi district, still suburban at that time, where he was going to live with her older sister Eutilia. He opened a studio on Via Campania 45 ‚Äì not far from his apartment ‚Äì specializing in feminine and masculine nude art, becoming soon the most well-known author of the time in that genre after von Gloeden and Pl√ºschow. He also produced portraits and some of his photographs were sold as postcards. The Via Campania studio also worked as an experimental an art gallery. When Pl√ºschow decided to move to Rome around 1895 himself, he took residence in the same street as Galdi (at number 34). The two continued their collaboration, started in Naples. This fact is documented by a letter by Theodore F. Dwight, director of the Boston Public Library, sent in January 1896 in which he described his visit to the studio of the photographer: > \\"Pl√ºschow was not present in person, but his assistant was and I was given > every pleasure to see his collection, apparently without you expecting me to > buy it. While we were talking, the beautiful Italian, with black hair and > mustache, a rather vigorous build and wide shoulders, over the age of 24, > who seemed anxious to be to noted and acted as a master of the place? I > asked and learned that it was Vincenzo Galdi, the model of many of our > photos. He laid for those in which he sat on the wall, with a band around > his head, and along with Edoardo, the most beautiful, 17 in an infinite > number of other photos. I told him that I know him from the tip of his feet > to the top of his head and he immediately became very talkative, showing me > all his preferred poses. We have established such friendly relationships as > I have now the privilege of taking pictures in the studio of Pl√ºschow and of > the Pl√ºschow models\\" .. Letter from T.F. Dwight to Charles Warren Stoddard,18 January 1896 (University of Notre Dame Archives). Cited in Genteel Pagan: The Double Life of Charles Warren Stoddard, by Roger Austen (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1991), 189 The partnership with Pl√ºschow lasted probably until 1902, given that the following year he moved his own study to Corso Umberto 333, where he worked with two assistants: Pietro Magnotti and Enrico Simoncini. Among the photographs attributed to Galdi are a series of shots commissioned by English painter Robert Hawthorn Kitson, depicting Carlo, his young lover from Taormina, whom he adopted. The photographs bear the stamp of Galdi with the address of via Sardegna 55 and are dated 1906. In 1902, Galdi married Virginia Guglielmi (12 April 1885 ‚Äì 24 May 1941), an elementary school teacher. They had three children together: Ernesto Theodor (b. 1903), Vincenzo (b. 1904), named Vincenzino, and Michelangelo (b. 1917).  Pl√ºschow scandal  In 1902 Pl√ºschow was charged with \\"solicitation to prostitution\\" and \\"seduction of minors\\" and had to spend eight months in jail. Another scandal followed in 1907, and, in 1910, Pl√ºschow left Italy for good and returned to Berlin. There are no extant documents that show the trial involved Galdi as well, but a letter of Edward Irenaeus Prime-Stevenson, that mentions G. ‚Äì famous Rome nude photographer being arrested and sentenced for \\"outraging public morals\\" due to overly audacious photographs for sale everywhere, even in Rome.  The scandal of the Naiads fountain  Vincenzo Galdi(left) and Mario Rutelli(right) outside the sculptor's studio in via Margutta. The photo created with the self-timer in 1901. When the sculptor Mario Rutelli received a commission to renew the 'Naiads fountain' on Piazza della Repubblica he collaborated with Galdi. They met at one of masonic lodges, to which Galdi and Rutelli belonged. Galdi had just returned from Paris, where he visited exhibition of Rodin, and was describing the great art of French sculptor, when Rutelli blurted out: \\"Vincenzo, I want new models, I'll show you what Rodin has conceived in a dark museum. I'm Sicilian and I will put my own statues in a bath of light so that they will look alive.\\" Galdi procured the models and photographed them, finding shots suitable for his ideas and those of the Mario Rutelli. The sculptor created casts from these nude photographs of pagan nymphs, which immediately created outrage in conservative circles. The question was raised at the session of the City Council, during which some clerics and conservative opponents, offended by the proud nudity of the naiads, asked the Mayor for immediate removal of the statues from the fountain. Instead, the city council decided to simply cover the fountain with a fence in order to prevent the public from seeing the statues. One councilor asked to start an investigation against Galdi and Rutelli. Photographs and drawings were seized. All ended up in the press with Avanti defending the sculptures and L'Osservatore Romano judging them as \\"a gross\\", criticizing them sharply from an artistic and moral point of view. The situation was resolved spontaneously one night when a group of students destroyed the fence by opening the monument to the public.  Art trade  Around the time when Guglielmo Pl√ºschow left Rome, Vincenzo Galdi abandoned photography and concentrated on art trade. He opened an art gallery in Rome, in Via del Babuino, the \\"Galleria Galdi\\". He started the art trade with organizing exhibition and selling futurist works of Giacomo Balla and Umberto Boccioni with help of Anton Giulio Bragaglia and his brothers. Some traditionalist painters protested the exhibition and broke the window of Galdi's gallery, even damaging some works. Originally the gallery was located at the same building as the Galdi's studio and then moved to via Sistina,75, where it stayed until early 1920s. It changed several location until it was moved to via Baburino 180. The gallery remained there until the end of 1950s, when Galdi closed it due to his old age and failing health. Vincenzo Galdi was known to bring regional Italian and international artist to Rome. Galdi's grandson remembers that he was the one who brought to fame contemporary Roman painters Onorato Carlandi and Pio Joris. He was a good friend with american art historian Bernard Berenson. Berenson learned the technic of macrophotography from Galdi as a tool to study art works. Vincenzo Galdi's son, Ernesto, who was suffering from poliomyelitis, lived for a few years with Berenson on his villa in Settignano near Florence, because at that time Florence was the only place in Italy, where the treatment for the illness was available. Despite Galdi's liberal views, he was called to be the part of panel of experts for the protection against art counterfeit by National Fascist Federation of Art Dealers. = Death = Vincenzo Galdi died in Rome on December 20, 1961, in Zappal√† clinic, where he had been hospitalized with prostate cancer. He was buried on the 23rd of the same month on the cemetery of Verano, near his wife Virginia, who had died in 1941.

Her grave in Abney Park Cemetery, London, was given listed status in 2008 but little is known of her life. Early life and family She was born to Susannah Cullen of Fordham, Cambridgeshire, and Olaudah Equiano (also known as \\"Gustavus Vassa, the African\\") on 11 April 1795, and baptised in St Andrew's Church, Soham, on 29 April. Her father was well known for his 1789 autobiography, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano.The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa. An African man. Written by Himself. 8th Edition, London, 1794. Her mother was a subscriber to Equiano's Narrative and they were married on 7 April 1792 in Soham parish church. The year after Joanna's birth, Susannah died of an illness, on 21 February 1796, and was buried at St Andrew's Church, Soham. Joanna's father died just over a year later.Vincent Caretta, Unchained Voices: An Anthology of Black Authors in the English-Speaking World of the Eighteenth Century, The University Press of Kentucky, 2003. Shortly afterwards followed the death of her elder sister and only sibling Anna Maria (born 30 January 1793), on 21 July 1797.Peter Fryer, Staying Power: The History of Black People in Britain, London: Pluto Press, 1984. Anna Maria is commemorated by a poetic plaque outside St Andrew's Church, Chesterton, Cambridge. Adulthood and marriage Joanna Vassa's memorial at Abney Park Cemetery shortly after its discovery in 2005, awaiting restoration In 1816, on reaching her 21st birthday, Joanna Vassa, being Equiano's only known surviving relative, inherited a silver watch and ¬£950 () from his estate. It is not clear how Joanna met her future husband, the Congregational minister, Rev. Henry Bromley, but on 29 August 1821, they were married at St James's Church, Clerkenwell, a Church of England parish church in London. He had been ordained a minister at the Independent Chapel in Appledore in Devon, two months prior to the wedding. He was 24 years old and Joanna was 26. They settled in Devon for at least five years until they moved to the Congregational Church (present day United Reformed Church) at Clavering, Essex, where Rev. Bromley was pastor between 1827 and 1845. He was a member of Clavering Reading Society throughout his time there. Later life, death, and memorial On 26 October 1845, Rev. Henry Bromley resigned from his congregation, citing his wife's health as the reason. She was 50 years old and he was 48. The couple moved to London that year for her health, her husband taking on only occasional commitments at Clavering thereafter. He became a minister at the Providence Chapel in Harwich during 1851, while Joanna lived with his family in Stowmarket, Suffolk. Eventually, she moved back to London and resided at 21 Benyan Terrace, Buckingham Road, in Hackney; but there is no record of Henry living with her. She died of uterine disease, possibly brought on by fibroids, on 10 March 1857, aged 61. She was buried on 16 March in Abney Park Cemetery, close to the memorial statue to Isaac Watts on the axial walk from the chapel to Stoke Newington Church Street. Her husband Henry survived her for twenty years, and was buried with her on 12 February 1878. It has not been discovered whether they had any children. Her memorial at Abney Park was pinned and re-erected in 2006, in time for the 150th anniversary of her death in 2007. This coincided with the bicentenary of the Slave Trade Act which abolished the slave trade in the British Empire, a goal towards which her father had worked.

Not long afterward, the town established a strong trading relationship with Baghdad and became a hub of the grain trade in southern Iraq. Shatrah became the most important town along the Gharraf Canal and gained the nickname \\"Little Baghdad\\". It served as the administrative center of a qadaa (subdistrict) of the same name, which was part of the Muntafiq Sanjak of the Basra Vilayet. The town's original official name was \\"Shatrat al-Muntafiq\\", but it was simplified by local residents to \\"al-Shatrah\\" to distinguish it from the nearby town of Qal'at Salih, which was officially known as \\"Shatrat al-Amarah\\" by the Ottoman authorities. In the summer of 1889, al-Shatrah experienced an outbreak of cholera, which caused the deaths of around 700 of its inhabitants, including the qaimaqam (lieutenant-governor) of the town. Prior to the outbreak, the population stood at around 5,000, but al-Shatrah was largely and temporarily deserted after the outbreak. Al-Shatrah was a stronghold of the al-Muntafiq tribal confederation which dominated southern Iraq during the Ottoman era. In the early 20th century, it was regarded as the tribe's seat of power. It had a population of roughly 4,000, nearly all of whom were Shia Muslim Arabs with small Jewish and Mandean communities. Its market contained nearly 300 shops and was frequented by the Muntafiq tribesmen who predominated in the surrounding region. The Jewish community managed a primary school in the village. =Iraq War= During the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. troops, the body of a U.S. Marine was dragged through the streets of al-Shatrah and hung up in the town square.Baker, Peter and Sheridan, Mary Beth (14 April 2003) \\"Marines Rescue Seven U.S. Prisoners; Iraqis Alert Unit Bound For Tikrit\\" The Washington Post p.

Construction began in 1871 and was completed in 1878. The capacity is about 866 million gallons, with a surface area of 63 hectares. It can be found from the A59 road. The reservoir is below and directly adjoining Fewston Reservoir. The area around the reservoirs is popular with walkers.  Before the reservoir  Beneath the waters of the reservoir are the remains of New Hall, originally a home to the Fairfax family, whose members included Ferdinando Fairfax and the poet Edward Fairfax. Women in the nearby village of Timble were twice tried at York for witchcraft on the accusation of Edward, who suspected them of possessing his two daughters. Neighbouring Fewston Reservoir covers another Fairfax family home, Cragg Hall.The Washburn by Tom Bradley (published 1895, reprinted 1988)  Construction  The reservoir was built by the Leeds Waterworks Company, and employed a labour force of around 300 men under the management of Robert Brooks, previously an assistant at the construction of Lindley Wood Reservoir. Consultants were Thomas Hawksley of Westminster and Edward Filliter of Leeds.Lesser Railways of the Yorkshire Dales and the Dam Builders in the Age of Steam by Harold D Bowtell, Work on the construction of the reservoir began in 1871. \\"The Huts\\", as they were known locally,Timble Man ‚Äì Diaries of a Dalesman, by John Dickinson, edited by Ronald Harker (published 1988) were constructed to house the workforce, in part using materials from a water mill dismantled in the valley. The bulk of the materials for the dam itself came to Starbeck by rail. From there they were, at first, transported to the site using a steam traction engine pulling wagons. However, by 1872 this practice was put to an end due to the damage being caused to the 'Turnpike road', now the A59, and from then on materials were transported by contractors. At the site, a narrow gauge railway was constructed, and two locomotives purchased, the first arriving in 1873 and the second in 1875. The impact of the construction work was considerable for local residents, in ways both positive and negative. In his diaries, local man John Dickinson mentions the waterworks band coming with their music on Christmas Day, a visit to a \\"Magic Lantern performance at The Huts\\" and a waterworks sports day on Swinsty Moor with several hundred in attendance. On the downside, he complains several times of \\"rough navvies\\" occupying the local inn at Timble, and expresses the hope they will soon be gone. As work neared completion in 1877, the huts were removed and the filling of the reservoir began. Work was finally completed in 1878.  Design and architecture  Achelous watches over the reservoir The reservoir is fed directly from the overflow of neighbouring Fewston Reservoir via a shallow spillway which bypasses Fewston Dam and terminates in a grand stepped cascade of falling water. The culvert under the dam itself terminates in an archway topped on the keystone with an ornate carving of the head of Achelous who stares out over the reservoir itself. The water is held in place by a small dam on the eastern side, and a much larger one at the southern end, beyond which the River Washburn continues its descent to join the River Wharfe.  Swinsty Hall  Swinsty Hall, on the bank of the reservoir On the banks of the reservoir stands Swinsty Hall, built in the 17th century. Local legend has it that the hall was built by a man named Robinson, who left nearby Fewston to seek his fortune in London. On arriving there, he found it in the grip of the great plague of 1603‚Äì4. Robinson took to looting the houses of the dead and amassed a great fortune with which he returned home, purchased the Swinsty estate, and built Swinsty Hall. The truth appears more mundane ‚Äì a family named Wood owned the Swinsty estates in the sixteenth century, and Francis Wood undertook to erect a new hall on the estate as part of a marriage contract. Unable to pay for it, he raised a loan from Henry Robinson, and when he got into further financial difficulties in 1590, Robinson foreclosed and took the hall and estates in lieu of the debt. The hall was owned by a succession of Robinsons right up until 1772. At this point, the male Robinson line came to an end and the hall and estate passed to Robert Bramley, husband of Mary Robinson, and later his son John Bramley, and in 1853 John Bramley's son, also named John.Harrogate and the Forest of Knaresborough by William Grainge (published 1871, reprinted 1988) Stone for the construction of Fewston Reservoir was purchased from the Swinsty Hall quarry in 1874, from a Mr Bramley. It is currently owned by former England international footballer and current England manager Gareth Southgate.

Biography Born in North Shields in 1926, he first made his name with local amateur sides, and as a result was invited to Tottenham Hotspur for trials. Although he impressed the London club and was signed as a professional, he found first team opportunities limited at White Hart Lane. He was one of 19 players used in the club's Championship winning side of 1950‚Äì51 when he featured in one match.1950-51 Champions He moved to Gillingham in 1952 for ¬£3,500. It was during his time at Priestfield Stadium that he wrote his name into the record books with a lightning-fast hat-trick against Leyton Orient on 1 November 1952. This was officially recognised as the fastest hat-trick in the history of the Football League until February 2004 when James Hayter notched three goals in 2 minutes 20 seconds for AFC Bournemouth against Wrexham, with contemporary reports stating that the previous record had been 2 minutes 30 seconds.BBC Sport news story Sources published in the intervening years, however, give the total time of Scarth's goals as exactly 2 minutes or even as little as 110 seconds, which is quicker than the 2 mins 13 secs claimed for Irish player Jimmy O'Connor for the \\"world's fastest hat-trick\\". Scarth left Gillingham in 1955 after scoring 24 goals in 138 League matches, and joined non-league Kent team Gravesend & Northfleet, where he was to remain until he retired from football in 1960. During his time there he scored 64 goals in 189 games and helped the club win the Southern League title in 1958. He died at Welwyn Garden City in 2000. His son Bobby Scarth joined Tottenham as an apprentice but failed to make the breakthrough to the professional game.

Goodfellow was one of the founders of the Center for International Policy (CIP) in 1975 and served as executive director from 1985 to 2017. Goodfellow testified before congressional committees and published op-ed articles in major U.S. newspapers. During the late 1970s, Goodfellow and his colleagues at CIP successfully lobbied for legislation that requires the executive branch to consider a country‚Äôs human rights record before providing economic and military aid.(1) In the 1980s, Goodfellow promoted negotiations to end the civil wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador. He worked closely with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and championed the Esquipulas Peace Agreement in the United States. He attended every Central American summit meeting and spoke and published articles about the peace process, which silenced the guns in Central America.(2) Goodfellow directed CIP‚Äôs Common Defense Campaign to reduce U.S. military spending and change the way America relates to the rest of the world. He was co-chair of the Afghanistan Study Group (2009-2013), which brought together former senior government officials, academics and area specialists. In August 2010, the Afghanistan Study Group issued a report that urged the Obama administration to seek a negotiated political settlement in Afghanistan. From 1973 to 1975, Goodfellow was an associate at the Indochina Resource Center, a non-profit think tank staffed by academics and activists who produced scholarly research for the anti-Vietnam War movement.

He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman from through , most notably as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics dynasty that won three consecutive American League pennants from 1929 to 1931 and, won the World Series in 1929 and 1930. He played his final two seasons for the Boston Red Sox. Bishop was the leadoff hitter for one of the most feared batting orders in the history of baseball featuring three future Baseball Hall of Fame members (Al Simmons, Jimmie Foxx, and Mickey Cochrane). Nicknamed \\"Camera Eye\\" for his ability to draw bases on balls, his .423 career on-base percentage ranks as the 15th highest in Major League Baseball history. His career ratio of bases on balls to hits is the highest of any player in Major League Baseball history. After his playing career Bishop served as baseball head coach at the U.S. Naval Academy from 1938 to 1962. Professional baseball career Bishop was born in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania and his family moved to Baltimore when he was 14-years-old. He attended Baltimore City College in 1918, and played as a second baseman for the college team that included future major league players Tommy Thomas and Johnny Neun. He began playing professionally with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League in 1918 where, he led the league in putouts and assists. He became a starting player for six seasons during which time the Orioles won the International League championship five times. His tenure in Baltimore would mark the beginning of his combination with shortstop Joe Boley for five years in Baltimore and five-plus years with the Athletics. The Philadelphia Athletics purchased Bishop's contract from the Orioles on December 10, 1923 for $20,000. He made his major league debut with the Athletics on April 15, 1924 at the age of 24. Athletics manager Connie Mack installed Bishop as his leadoff hitter and urged him to become much more patient at home plate and to try to take a base on balls. Bishop became the Athletics' table-setter, whose job was to get on base in front of the more powerful hitters who followed in the batting order. With the Athletics, his teammates called him \\"Tilly\\" because of the way he held his arms stiff at his sides when he ran. The Athletics finished in eighth place in Bishop's first year with the team but, became more competitive and for the next four years were either second or third in the American League standings. Between 1925 and 1928, Bishop recorded an on-base percentage above .400 and, in 1926 he led American League second basemen in fielding percentage. In 1928, Bishop posted a career-high batting average of .316 and once again led American League second basemen in fielding percentage as the Athletics finished the season just 2¬Ω games behind the vaunted New York Yankees of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. In 1929, he led the American League with 117 bases on balls and scored 102 runs to help the Athletics win their first American League pennant in 15 years with a substantial 18 game lead over the second-place Yankees. The Athletics went on to win the 1929 World Series in five games from the Chicago Cubs. On May 31, 1930, Bishop walked eight times in the doubleheader to set a Major League Baseball record. The Athletics' success continued with two more American League pennants in 1930 and 1931 as, they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in six games to win the 1930 World Series before losing to the Cardinals in their rematch in the 1931 World Series. Bishop played in all 18 of the World Series games, and handled all 69 fielding chances without an error. In 1933, Bishop posted a .294 batting average along with a career-high on-base percentage of .446 but, with the onset of the Great Depression and declining attendance, Connie Mack sought to reduce expenses by selling or trading his best players. In September 1932, Mack had sold Simmons, Jimmy Dykes and Mule Haas to the Chicago White Sox for $100,000. In December 1933, Mack sent Lefty Grove, Rube Walberg and Bishop to the Boston Red Sox for Bob Kline, Rabbit Warstler and $125,000. By 1935, the Athletics had fallen to last place in the American League. While with the Red Sox Bishop walked eight times in the doubleheader on July 8, 1934, tying his own major-league record set in 1930. After two years in Boston, Bishop signed a contract with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League to be a player-manager but, was injured in his first game and was fired for being unable to play. He ended his playing career at the age of 36 in 1936 with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League and then scouted for the Detroit Tigers in 1937. Career statistics In a twelve-year major league career, Bishop played in 1,338 games, accumulating 1,216 hits in 4,494 at bats for a .271 career batting average, along with 41 home runs and 379 runs batted in. His career on-base percentage of .423 is the 15th highest in Major League Baseball history. Bishop had a career fielding percentage of .976. Bishop had the second-highest career secondary average among second basemen in Major League Baseball history behind only Joe Morgan. He collected 100 walks eight times, leading the AL with 128 in 1929; twice walked eight times in a doubleheader, to set a major league record; twice drew five walks in a single game, to become the only major leaguer to do this twice and recorded a 2.55 walk-to-strikeout ratio (1153-to-452), as his walk percentage of .204 is only surpassed by Ted Williams's .207. He also scored 100 or more runs during four consecutive seasons (1928‚Äì1931), with a career-high 117 in 1930. When Bishop scored 117 runs in 1930, he became the only man in major league history to score at least 70 runs while collecting more runs than hits. Rated as one of the best fielders in the game, Bishop led AL second basemen four times in fielding percentage and played 18 World Series games without committing an error, recording 29 putouts and 40 assists in the 1929, 1930 and 1931 World Series. Baseball historian Bill James devised a Baseball IQ rating system which ranked Bishop second highest in baseball history behind only Joe Morgan. Later life After his playing career had ended, Bishop served as baseball head coach at the U.S. Naval Academy between 1938 and 1962. During his 25 years as Navy Midshipmen coach, he posted a 306‚Äì143 record, including an academy seasonal record of 24 victories and two defeats in 1961. Bishop died in his home of Waynesboro at age 62. The baseball stadium at the Naval Academy is named Max Bishop Stadium in his honor.See Navy Midshipmen#Facilities (at \\"Terwilliger Brothers Field at Max Bishop Stadium\\").

Gandhara, 3rd century CE Abhij√±ƒÅ (; Pali pronunciation: abhi√±√±ƒÅ; mngon shes ‡ºã; ) is a Buddhist term generally translated as \\"direct knowledge\\",Bodhi (2000), e.g., SN 45.159 (pp. 1557-8). \\"higher knowledge\\"Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-5), pp. 64-65. or \\"supernormal knowledge.\\" In Buddhism, such special knowledge is obtained through virtuous living and meditation. The attainment of the four jhanas, or meditative absorptions, are considered a prerequisite for their attainment. In terms of specifically enumerated knowledges, these include mundane extra-sensory abilities (such as seeing past lives and various supranormal powers like levitation) as well as the supramundane, meaning the extinction of all mental intoxicants (ƒÅsava).  Pali literature  In Pali literature, abhi√±√±ƒÅ refers to both the direct apprehension of dhamma (translated below as \\"states\\" and \\"qualities\\") as well as to specialized super-normal capabilities. =Direct knowing of dhamma= In SN 45.159, the Buddha describes \\"higher knowledge\\" (abhi√±√±ƒÅ) as a corollary to the pursuit of the Noble Eightfold Path:Walshe (1985, 2007), passage 56, SN 45.159. Such direct knowledge, according to the Buddha, is obscured by desire and passion (chanda-rƒÅga):SN 27.1 (Thanissaro, 1994). =Enumerations of special knowledges= In the Pali Canon, the higher knowledges are often enumerated in a group of six or of three types of knowledge. The six types of higher knowledges (chalabhi√±√±ƒÅ) are: # \\"Higher powers\\" (iddhi-vidhƒÅ), such as walking on water and through walls; # \\"Divine ear\\" (dibba-sota), that is, clairaudience; # \\"Mind-penetrating knowledge\\" (ceto-pariya-√±ƒÅa), that is, telepathy; # \\"Remember one's former abodes\\" (pubbe-nivƒÅsanussati), causal memory, that is, recalling one's own past lives; # \\"Divine eye\\" (dibba- cakkhu), that is, knowing others' karmic destinations; and, # \\"Extinction of mental intoxicants\\" (ƒÅsavakkhaya), upon which arahantship follows.Orientalia (2007); Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-5), pp. 64-65, 115-116, 121-122, 272, 288-289, 372, 432; Thanissaro (1997). The attainment of these six higher powers is mentioned in a number of discourses, most famously the \\"Fruits of Contemplative Life Discourse\\" (', DN 2).Thanissaro (1997). Other discourses that mention the six types of higher knowledge include the Kevatta Sutta (DN 11), the Lohicca Sutta (DN 12) and the Mahasakuludayi Sutta (MN 77). The attainment of the four jhanas is considered to be a prerequisite for the attainment of the higher powers. The sixth type is the ultimate goal of Buddhism, which is the end of all suffering and destruction of all ignorance.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2007). According to the Buddha, indulgence in the abhi√±√±ƒÅs should be avoided, as they can distract from the ultimate goal of Enlightenment. Similarly, the three knowledges or wisdoms (' or ') are: # \\"Remember one's former abodes\\" (pubbe-nivƒÅsanussati); # \\"Divine eye\\" (dibba- cakkhu); and, # \\"Extinction of mental intoxicants\\" (ƒÅsavakkhaya).See, for instance, Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), pp. 307, 617. The three knowledges are mentioned in numerous discourses including the Maha-Saccaka Sutta (MN 36) in which the Buddha describes obtaining each of these three knowledges on the first, second and third watches respectively of the night of his enlightenment. These forms of knowledge typically are listed as arising after the attainment of the fourth jhana.Thanissaro (1998). Other discourses that mention the three include the Tevijja Sutta (DN 13) and the Bhaya-bherava Sutta (MN 4). While such powers are considered to be indicative of spiritual progress, Buddhism cautions against their indulgence or exhibition since such could divert one from the true path of obtaining suffering's release.  Parallels in other cultures  The first five types of Abhijna, are similar to the siddhis of yoga in Hinduism, mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana and by Patanjali: * Knowing the past, present and future; * Tolerance of heat, cold and other dualities; * Knowing the minds of others; * Checking the influence of fire, sun, water, poison, and so on; * Remaining unconquered by others.

The show was a collaboration between then radio producer Jeff Green and the children's theatre group Salt & Pepper Theatre Company. In 1987, the Salt & Pepper Theatre Company had written and performed an 8-part series of 30 minute children's radio programs for Ottawa album oriented rock station CHEZ-FM on which Green had acted as producer and engineer. In addition, the theatre group had been involved with CHRO-TV, supplying children's theatre workshops in schools throughout the Ottawa Valley. When the Salt & Pepper Theatre Company were offered a regular slot on the station to help fulfill its CRTC license commitments for original local children's programming, they approached Green to collaborate on a series. In 1990, the team produced a pilot for Cowboy Who?, which gained them a commitment for a season of 13 episodes, and primary shooting began in the fall of that year. Two and a half more seasons were eventually created. The show spent several years in rotation on the MCTV stations. The show was notable for its technical production values despite its obviously low budget, its humorous social commentary, a deliberate post- modernist structure (it is a television show about a television show that features numerous other television shows), and the cult following it developed during its run. It was further distinguished in that it was suitable for all ages (from infants to adults), and had a broad demographic appeal:Jeff Green, the producer of the show, in response to an inquiry about ratings wrote: \\"We were never allowed to see the exact BBM ratings for our time slot(s), but were informally told that we had a remarkably broad demographic\\". providing puppets, cartoons, and on-screen behaviour appropriate to a pre-teen children's program (its ostensible target market); an overt anti-authoritarian angle for older children; and subtle adult humorFor example, the \\"Native American\\" in the serial \\"Trail of the Royal Mounted\\" was given the name \\"Chief Spread-Eagle\\" and often referred to as \\"the fake Indian\\". designed to appeal to parents who were watching with their children. In 2005, a collaboration between Jeff Green and \\"DVD-Lab\\" software creator Roman Voska on Green's \\"Stranger Still\\" production led to the publication of the first season of Cowboy Who? as a DVD set. Overview Each season was distinct from the others in that the overall structure of the show changed between them, and the cast of characters on the show's primary set (the \\"studio\\") decreased with each season as it focused more on content purportedly generated outside of the studio (e.g. \\"alien television programs\\"). In the third season, only \\"Cowboy Slim\\" is left, and in the final season, even he has left the studio -- leaving in his place an \\"Automatic Telepathic Interface\\" that supposedly \\"reads the minds of the viewers\\" to choose what to show next -- using an almost reductio ad absurdum minimalism as a means of deconstructing the television program as a medium of popular culture. The stylistic device of television programs within television programs was used to stave off heavy repetition and overt formulaism by allowing the producers the freedom to insert near-random material into the individual shows. Heavy reliance was made throughout the production on short segments of other \\"shows\\" and \\"commercials\\" -- all written, directed, and produced by the Cowboy Who? team, and featuring the primary set of performers, as well as performers brought in specifically to do the segments.One such segment is notable as being the first television appearance of The Daily Show \\"correspondent\\" Samantha Bee in a mock ad for \\"Fitness Rope\\" in episode 7 of season one. She is a non-speaking character sitting on a couch who loses her guilt at watching televised fitness ads by holding a \\"Fitness Rope\\". Season one has a strong plotline that runs throughout the shows, and season two has three sub-plots that each run for most of the shows. Seasons three and four dispense with overarching plots, and use a premise to provide an almost variety show format -- where season three has a host (\\"Cowboy Slim\\"), and season four features an \\"Automatic Telepathic Interface\\" that purportedly \\"allows the viewers to choose from a list of available programs by their thoughts\\". Still from an opening title sequence of Cowboy Who? Every episode featured unique opening title and closing credit segments produced specifically for the show in which they take place, often complementing a theme within the episode, and usually executed with sophisticated video effects. Furthermore, consistent in style and content within each of the four seasons, each episode had a unique introductory segment that was shown before the opening titles. In season one, each show had a mock \\"warning\\" (e.g. \\"WARNING! This program contains scenes of younger viewers that may not be suitable for violence and course language. Discressionary parenting is advised.\\") which was followed by a \\"crime log\\" by the character \\"Inspector O'Really\\" that was used to summarize the plot to that point of the season. In season two, every episode began with a warning again; however, in contrast to the \\"warning\\" in season one, the text was only on the screen long enough for a person to register the fact that a \\"warning\\" had been presented before it was obscured by a graphic from \\"Interstellar Broadcast\\" (\\"IB\\"). The purported intent of these warnings was to encourage viewers to tape the program off the air and watch it again later.e.g. Episode 3 of season two has the following \\"warning\\": \\"Attempting to speed read a warning that appears only briefly on your screen can induce headaches, blurred vision, nausea and schizophrenic paranoia. We strongly recommend taping this program and reading the text in freezeframe at your leisure.\\" The voice from \\"IB\\" announces that the show being watched is using an unauthorized \\"pirated\\" broadcast channel, and that the viewer should instead be watching an inane robotic \\"mandatory inter-species equal-time educational program\\" called \\"Watzit?\\" (a contraction of \\"What Is It?\\"). After about 20 seconds of \\"Watzit?\\", the \\"signal is re-acquired\\" by Cowboy Who? and the opening titles proceed. Season three featured a short segment called \\"Bonehead\\" featuring a plasticine skull and crossbones that provided safety \\"advice\\" to children watching (e.g. \\"Don't Play With Things!\\") that always concluded with the phrase \\"or that could make you a bone head!\\". And season four (of which there were only six episodes), featured a \\"Cowboy Quote\\", with the character \\"Cowboy Pat\\" delivering an incomprehensible bit of cowboy \\"wisdom\\" (e.g. \\"A cowboy's hat is like the leaf of a tree, it always comes off in the fall\\"). In addition to a large number of \\"one off\\" segments produced for the show, each season had a staple of regular features. Season one had two primary recurring segments: a nature show spoof entitled \\"Think About It! With Professor Dave\\", which was actually taped in Africa and features a misinformed slacker as its host; and \\"Trail of the Royal Mounted\\", an actual 1930s black and white serial re-edited and re-dubbed for comic effect. Season two features several recurring segments: \\"Tangled Webs\\" a loose parody of the documentary series In Search of...; \\"The Rugged Road To Learning\\", a re-dubbed 1910s black and white documentary; \\"Sally Polkadot\\", a stop-action puppet show that takes place in the enforced utopia \\"The Land of Lollypops\\" that pokes fun at stereotypical British children's shows; and \\"Esoteric Knowledge\\", a spoof of the low-budget 1960s films that used to be shown in science classes. Additionally, new or re- edited episodes of \\"Think About It!\\" are presented. In season three, much of each episode was occupied with the mostly live action and puppets \\"Dee Dee & Dwilfer\\" show, which had a number of regular sub-segments itself (see below), and which always ended with \\"Dee Dee\\" pressing a large \\"panic\\" button on her vest in frustration or shock at the behavior of the alien \\"Dwilfer\\". Season four's episodes are largely occupied by a live action and puppets show entitled \\"Mack's\\", which also features a number of regular sub-segments (see below). These episodes have a darker, more adult, atmosphere about them, and each \\"Mack's\\" segment ends with an automated \\"Evil Content Override\\" by \\"IB\\".

Plot summary =Season one= The \\"Evil Tom\\" malevolent alien character puppet The first season of the series has a developing storyline which establishes the primary premise: the host of the lackluster \\"Cowboy Pat\\" show, a run-of-the-mill local children's show that has been on the air for thirty years, disappears in a mysterious flash of light, the oddly autonomous puppet co-host Smilin' Tom enlists the show's apathetic late-teen technician to fill his role, a mysterious figure in black named Chip appears to take over the technician's role, and a bumbling detective arrives to investigate the disappearance. In time Phyllis Blanding, a fussy woman from C.U.T.E.S.E.Y. (The Council for the Unification of Television Entertainment Standards Everywhere, Yahoo!) arrives to oversee their programming. The detective accuses the puppet of being an alien, which to everyone's surprise turns out to be true, a battle for control of the show occurs between a malevolent alien race and the co-hosts, and in the final scene of the season the entire studio building is accidentally launched into space as a result of this battle. Season one also includes numerous mock ads, the \\"Think about it! With Professor Dave\\" segment in which a rather empty- headed slacker tries to present nature programming, and \\"Trail of the Royal Mounted\\", an actual 1930s Canadian black and white serial re-edited and re- dubbed for comic effect. =Season two= Finding themselves in space, Slim, Smilin' Tom, Phyllis, and Chip discover that in space they are able to pick up the astonishing amount of television being broadcast by alien worlds, and they are able to navigate around the galaxy. In time they find that the broadcasting in the galaxy is controlled by a robotic entity called IB (Interstellar Broadcasting), and when an election is announced for the head of IB, Phyllis decides to run. Meanwhile, Smilin' Tom decides he has to find his long-lost twin brother and solicits a television program that specializes in solving mysteries, called \\"Tangled Webs\\", to help him in his search. Slim is kidnapped by an alien called Dipswitch but turns out to be just down the hall. Dipswitch is actually trying to connect with Chip, who leaves with him to become a transdimensional being. IB tries many things to keep Phyllis from winning the election, but she is eventually crowned Queen of the Universe and leaves to begin her rule. Smilin' Tom finds his brother running a video store in Peterborough and leaves to join him. The season includes many segments such as \\"The Rugged Road To Learning\\", a re-dubbed black and white documentary from 1910, \\"Sally Polkadot\\" a sweetly bizarre stop-action puppet show voiced by a British woman (Laura Jarrah), and \\"Esoteric Knowledge\\", a low-budget science show apparently from the 60s hosted by the generally misinformed Dr. Onius. =Season three= With only Slim left at the station he decides to solicit videos from the audience and otherwise just watches his favourite alien show, \\"Dee Dee & Dwilfer\\". The first segment is re-voiced videos from actual school children, the second segment is the \\"Dee Dee & Dwilfer\\" show, which has a female host stuck on an alien planet who is helped by a puppet alien named Dwilfer to put on a kid's show. The Dee Dee & Dwilfer show-within-the-show includes several regular segments: \\"Earthview\\" is a series of questions supposedly asked of regular school children, but the questions that appear as titles are actually quite different from the ones the children were in fact answering; \\"Time for Tots\\" is stories read by Mack Yavellian, who was apparently a technician on Dee Dee's ship but who has been recruited as a reader (he picks inappropriate material, like Edgar Allan Poe); \\"The Music Box\\" is a tiny girl in a cigar box held by Dwilfer who sings country songs, but when he starts to sing along he always knocks the box and sends her flying; \\"Gilbert the Educated Fish\\" is a talking fish puppet that complains about pollution; and \\"Story Tales\\" is little kids acting out fables in a bluescreen environment that sets them against children's drawings of the story locale. In the third show segment Slim in the studio kills the time by tuning in random shows, some apparently alien in origin, others from Earth, and the last show always cleverly wove the show credits into the content. The third season always began with a segment called \\"Bonehead\\", a plasticine skull & crossbones that warned children about the dangers of doing almost anything (e.g. \\"Don't Play With Things!\\"). Smilin' Tom makes a guest appearance on Dee Dee & Dwilfer in show 7, and in the last episode Tom appears again and at the very end Cowboy Pat appears on the set as he disappeared at the series' opening. =Season four= For the last season only six episodes were ordered. Each episode began with a \\"Cowboy Quote\\", with Cowboy Pat delivering an odd bit of cowboy wisdom (e.g. \\"A cowboy's hat is like the leaf of a tree, it always comes off in the fall\\"). Apparently Cowboy Slim has finally left the studio and left in his place an Automatic Telepathic Interface that allows the viewers to choose from a list of available programs by their thoughts. For some reason viewers always choose \\"Mack's\\" which is a show inexplicably given to Mack Yavellian, the somber story reader from the previous season's \\"Dee Dee & Dwilfer\\" show. This show has Mack co-hosting with a beleaguered young woman named Tara and a red serpent puppet named Billsy Bubb. Mack seems only interested in showing videos from his \\"band\\", who strongly resist all his attempts to guide them to commercial success. He has also arranged for two segments: \\"Expozany\\", which is obviously a somewhat strange friend of his who hosts a conspiracy-themed show that he has shot in his basement while wearing a clown mask, and \\"Esoteric Knowledge\\", a revisiting of a fictional 60s science \\"educational\\" science show starring the remarkably ill-informed Dr. Onius. Tara tries to counter all the darkness of the show with episodes of \\"Story Tales\\" as seen in season three. Meanwhile, Billsy tries to make the themes of the shows one of the seven deadly sins, and when he becomes especially impassioned his eyes begin to glow and a sequence is triggered featuring a comically evil puppet called Hobnob that spouts ridiculous curses. This sequence is always interrupted by the automatic interface (\\"Evil Content Override\\"). When the automatic interface comes back it always malfunctions, causing a random scan of available channels that show a wide variety of show fragments and fake ads.

His recordings and repertoire remain influential to the present day. He was among a handful of recording artists who returned the accordion to prominence in commercially recorded Cajun music and dance hall performances. The return of the accordion contrasted with the popular Cajun recorded output of the late 1930s and 1940s, a time during which fiddles and Western Swing sounds from Texas were influencing Cajun music. The return of the accordion to prominence is referred to as a Cajun music renaissance, i.e. a return to the roots and rebirth in Cajun pride in their traditional music. Iry LeJeune is regarded as one of the best and most beloved Cajun accordionists and singers of all time. Early life Iry LeJeune was born October 28, 1928, on a modest sharecropping farm at Pointe Noire, a rural area near Church Point, LA. LeJeune came from a family that embraced music and his father, Agness LeJeune, taught him the rudiments of accordion at an early age. LeJeune's cousin, Angelas LeJeune, an excellent accordion player who'd made 78s in the 1920s, also encouraged him, often showing LeJeune traditional songs on his instrument. Nearly blind, music provided happiness for LeJeune, and as he grew older, he relied on it to make a living. Besides his cousin, LeJeune's major influence was Am√©d√© Ardoin, the Creole accordion player who made several records in the 1930s - \\"Jole Catin\\" and \\"Les Blues De Voyage\\" among others ‚Äì and was popular at white and Creole dances in the area. LeJeune selected Ardoin's repertoire and adopted the emotive crying style of vocals that would eventually become his trademark. Unable to work in the fields because of his poor eyesight, as a youth, LeJeune entertained the local sharecroppers. By the time he reached his teens, LeJeune was making a few dollars on weekends playing dances around Church Point, and occasionally traveling as far as Eunice, LA to perform. At the conclusion of World War II, LeJeune moved west to Lacassine, Louisiana (near Lake Charles, LA) where there were many more venues in which to play music. Cajun Renaissance Initially, LeJeune found the going tough because at the time the accordion and Cajun music had become unpopular, as it was being replaced by the fiddle and Western Swing music. In postwar Louisiana, many felt Acadiana should assimilate with the rest of America and eliminate the French language, culture and music. Luckily, in 1948 LeJeune met fiddler Floyd LeBlanc. Together they traveled to Houston, Texas where they recorded \\"Love Bridge Waltz\\" and \\"Evangeline Special\\" on Leblanc's \\"Opera\\" label with Virgil Bozeman's Oklahoma Tornadoes supporting. The disc was the turning point in LeJeune's career and for Cajun music. For the first time in nearly a decade, the accordion again wailed from radios and jukeboxes, largely due to many Cajuns returning home from World War II eager to hear their own Cajun music. Cajun listeners responded by buying great quantities of the release. LeJeune stayed in Houston with LeBlanc, performing and enjoying the popularity of the record, but returned to Louisiana after six months. Upon returning to Lacassine, LeJeune went to radio station KPLC in Lake Charles and asked to perform on the air. The station manager wasn't keen on hearing the primitive, wailing accordion, but disc jockey Eddie Shuler liked what he heard and featured him on several broadcasts. \\"I felt sorry for the kid,\\" admitted Shuler. \\"He was nearly blind and he had no other way to make money.\\" The cameo on Shuler's show proved so successful that Lake Charles listeners demanded more French music. A year later, there was as much as eight hours of French broadcasting on KPLC daily. Still, LeJeune needed a new record out to get work at the dances around Lake Charles. He then approached Shuler, who'd already made a record with his group, the Reveliers, and released it on his own Goldband Records label. \\"He said 'Eddie, I want to make records and I want you to make them,'\\" said Shuler. \\"I didn't know anything about making French records. Finally I agreed though because there was nobody around here making French records. Nobody was interested in making them because there was no money in French records. But as it turned out, I had the market to myself.\\" Bribing the engineer with a bottle of Old Crow, Shuler had LeJeune record \\"Lacassine Special\\" and \\"Calcasieu Waltz\\" on a disc cutter at the radio station used to record commercials and jingles. He sent the metal masters to Houston where several hundred 78s were pressed on the Folk Star label. Later, he did the same with TNT Records in San Antonio. Selling the release from the trunk of his car to record shops and jukebox outlets, the disc did remarkably well in the area. As a result, Shuler rushed LeJeune back to the station to cut \\"Teche Special\\" and \\"Tee Mone.\\" Suddenly, the fiddle was on the way out of Louisiana and the accordion was back in. Accordionists Lawrence Walker, Aldus Roger, Sidney Brown and Nathan Abshire would soon follow with their own records, but they couldn't touch LeJeune in terms of popularity or sales. LeJeune assembled a crack band, the Lacassine Playboys, which at one time or another featured Crawford Vincent or Robby Bertrand on drums, Alfred \\"Duckhead\\" Cormier on guitar, Wilson Granger on fiddle, R. C. Vanicor on steel guitar and even occasionally Shuler on guitar. The Playboys were known for their casual appearance on the bandstand as LeJeune, never further than an arm's length from a cigarette and a cold bottle of Jax, often looked like he'd just arrived from a day of fishing. Attire aside, LeJeune continued to accumulate a phenomenal body of work. Shuler continued to record LeJeune at KPLC and later at the studio he built on Railway Avenue in Lake Charles. He even recorded LeJeune at his Calcasieu, LA house, setting his tape recorder on the kitchen table. From LeJeune's kitchen came the beautiful \\"Duralde Waltz,\\" a song that featured no accordion, but did include a well-timed bark by LeJeune's fox terrier. Another classic was \\"I Made A Big Mistake,\\" a J.D. Miller composition accentuated by LeJeune's bluesy vocals and crying accordion. Death Sadly, at the peak of his career, LeJeune was killed at the age of 26. LeJeune and fiddler J. B. Fuselier were returning home after playing at a dance at the Green Wing club in Eunice on October 8, 1955 when tragedy struck. \\"They were coming home on old Highway 90,\\" recalled Shuler. \\"They had a flat where they were widening the highway and they couldn't pull off. They were trying to change the tire when a guy came along going about 90 MPH. He hit him (LeJeune) and knocked him into a field. That was the end of Iry.\\" LeJeune left a wife Wilma, and five children including Eddie LeJeune and Ervin LeJeune, who would follow in their father's musical footsteps. Legacy Widely mourned in Acadiana, LeJeune's music continued to live on. To this day most jukeboxes in Acadiana have at least one selection by LeJeune, he remains a staple of Cajun radio, and most Cajun bands feature some of LeJeune's material. The timelessness of LeJeune's music can be traced to his mastery of the accordion and his unrestrained individuality. LeJeune sang deeply personal songs about his life which in fact reflected the lives of all Cajuns. Iry LeJeune said that he wasn't ashamed to sing and speak French and that the Cajun way of life suited him just fine. Simply put, he was proud to be Cajun when it wasn't necessarily popular. LeJeune's complete body of work consists of fewer than 30 songs. Frustratingly for Cajun listeners, unless you were lucky enough to possess some of his original 78s or 45s, until a few years ago, you couldn't hear LeJeune's undoctored masterpieces. When assembling LeJeune's material for reissue on LP in 1970, Shuler overdubbed an electric bass on all the tracks. This was undone when Ace Records in England assembled Iry LeJeune: Cajun's Greatest ‚Äî The Definitive Collection using original discs and master tapes as sources. * Iry LeJeune with the Oklahoma Tornadoes: Love Bridge Waltz * Iry LeJeune with the Oklahoma Tornadoes: Evangeline Special Both Love Bridge Waltz and Evangeline Special were inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2009.

It is popularly known as The Hen ().  Nickname (the Hen)  The nickname comes from the clucking second subject in the first movement, which reminded listeners of the jerky back-and forth head motion of a walking hen.Ethan Mordden, A Guide to Orchestral Music: The Handbook for Non-Musicians. New York: Oxford University Press (1980): 82.  Movements  The symphony is in standard four movement form and scored for flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns and strings. #Allegro spiritoso, #Andante, in E major #Menuet: Allegretto ‚Äì Trio, in G major #Finale: Vivace, in G major File:Haydn-83-1-theme.png The symphony opens in stormy G minor with the minor triad further intensified by the added dissonance of the C. The dotted rhythms that answer are transformed into fanfares later in the first theme group of the sonata form movement.Brown, A. Peter, The Symphonic Repertoire (Volume 2). Indiana University Press (), pp. 214‚Äì216 (2002). File:Haydn-83-I-second-theme.png The second theme in B major features dotted repeated notes in a solo oboe against jerky appoggiatura in the first violins. This is the \\"Hen\\" motif that gives the symphony its nickname, although it is also related to the dotted rhythm response in the first theme. The development features the exploration of the two themes in different keys. It opens with the first theme in C minor, followed by the second theme in E major and F minor. The first theme is then heard contrapuntally leading towards the dominant allowing for a retransition to the tonic for the recapitulation.

Bushes of the genus Pariana provide the leaves for the chakapa. Chakapa is also the common name for these bushes. Curanderos (healers) and other shaman of the Shipibo-Conibo people in the Peruvian Amazon use the chakapa in healing ceremonies. In an ayahuasca ceremony, for example, a curandero may shake the chakapa around the patient while singing an icaro (healing song). The sound of the chakapa is said to comfort patients in an ayahuasca ceremony and \\"cleans\\" the energy surrounding the patient. Shaman have a large variety of chakapa movements that create different sounds and energy waves; these movements match the coinciding icaro and healing that is being done at the time. Some people report seeing green, blue, and gold ribbons of light form around the chakapa, and then move in tendrils about the room. The chakapa is also an important cleansing tool used during venteadas and arcanas. In the Amazon, once the shaman catches the bad spirits in a chakapa, it is then blown out of the leaves into the forest. The spirits are distributed and taken in by all nature such as trees and plants. A chakapa is made by tying together the leaves from the bush in a fashion that forms a fan shaped instrument. (See picture) Folklore The Woodland Cree have a legend about a great hunter named Chakapas. The legend talks about how Chakapas trapped the moon so that it did not shine anymore. Since the brightness of the moon was gone, the Indians had problems with traveling between seasons because they could not see as easily. They begged Chakapas to let the moon go, but Chakapa could not get close enough to the moon to release it. He used the help of mice to set it free. A brave mouse chewed the cords that tied the moon. It left him burned which is the Indians explanation for mice having a light grey belly. The moon was eventually set free and the shadow of Chakapas remains on the moon to this day.http://www.penumbrapress.com/kids/storyofchakapas_creation.php Notes Category:Shamanism of the Americas ","title":"Chakapa"},{"id":"8016027","text":"Robert Sutton may refer to: Politicians *Robert Sutton (died 1414), MP for Lincoln *Robert Sutton (MP for Derby), see Derby *Robert Dudley alias Sutton (died 1539), MP *Robert Sutton, 1st Baron Lexinton (1594‚Äì1668), Member of Parliament for Nottinghamshire in 1625 and again in 1640 *Robert Sutton, 2nd Baron Lexinton (1662‚Äì1723), English diplomat *Robert Sutton (diplomat) (1671‚Äì1746), diplomat and politician, great-nephew of the 1st Baron Lexinton Sports * Robert Sutton (sailor) (1911‚Äì1977), American sailor who competed in the 1932 Summer Olympics * Bob Sutton (American football) (born 1951), American football coach * Robert Sutton (cricketer) (born 1940), New Zealand cricketer * Robert Sutton (cricketer, born 1813) (1813‚Äì1885), English cricketer Religion *Robert Sutton (Archdeacon of Lewes) (1832‚Äì1910), Anglican priest *Robert Sutton (martyr) (died 1587), English Roman Catholic priest *Robert Sutton (d. 1588), martyr *Robert Sutton (priest), Irish priest Others *Robert Sutton (Irish judge) (died 1430), Irish judge and Crown official *Robert I.

He is best known for being the author of a widely used calculus textbook. Early life Born in Boise, Idaho, Thomas' early years were difficult. His father, George Brinton Thomas Sr., was a bank employee, and his mother, Georgia Fay Thomas (n√©e Goin), died in the 1919 Influenza Epidemic, just eight days before his fifth birthday. His father remarried shortly thereafter, to Lena Steward. They lived in a tent with a wooden floor and a coal stove. After his stepmother Lena died from complications due to childbirth, the father and son moved to the Spokane Valley in Washington State, where they both attended Spokane University. George Thomas Sr. married again, to Gertrude Alice Johnson. Thomas began attending Washington State College (now Washington State University), after Spokane University went bankrupt. There, he earned a B.A. in 1934 and an M.A. in 1936, both in mathematics and mathematics education. On August 15, 1936, Thomas married Jane Heath at her family's home in South Bend, Washington. The couple lived in Pullman, Washington for a year; Thomas worked at a local shoe store to save money for further graduate education. In 1937, Thomas was accepted into the graduate mathematics program at Cornell University. At Cornell, Thomas worked as an instructor while pursuing his research in number theory. Academic career Thomas finished his doctoral work in 1940 and was immediately hired by MIT for a one-year teaching appointment. He was well liked at MIT, and was invited to join the faculty after his teaching fellowship ended. During the Second World War, Thomas was involved in early computation systems and programmed the differential analyzer to calculate firing tables for the Navy. In 1952, George and Jane Thomas moved into the Conantum community in Concord, Massachusetts, where many younger Harvard and MIT faculty members lived. = Calculus and Analytic Geometry = In 1951, Addison-Wesley was then a new publishing company specializing in textbooks and technical literature. The management was unhappy with the calculus textbook they were then publishing, so they approached Thomas, asking if he could revise the book. Instead, he went ahead with an entirely new book. The first edition came out in 1952; Calculus and Analytic Geometry is now in its fourteenth edition and is in use worldwide. = Commitment to education = Thomas became involved with math and science education in America's primary and secondary schools some years before the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. From 1955 to 1957, he served on the board of governors of the Mathematical Association of America and was the group's first vice president from 1958 to 1959. From 1956 to 1959, he served on the executive committee of the mathematics division of the American Society for Engineering Education. He also served on the Commission on Mathematics of the College Entrance Examination Board. Thomas used the positions to speak out on mathematics education reform in high schools and universities. In the late 1950s, Thomas went to India with a grant from the Ford Foundation to train mathematics instructors.  Later life  Jane Thomas died in 1975 from breast cancer. In 1980, Thomas married Thais Erving; she died in 1983, also from breast cancer. In 1978, Thomas retired from full-time teaching. He became interested in religion, attending the Unity Church and later taking up Christian Science. Thomas died in Foxdale Village in State College, Pennsylvania, a retirement community centered around the needs of retired academics.

Name and description The species was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1767. The attribution \\"Sprenger's Asparagus,\\" refers to Carl Ludwig Sprenger who made it popular in Europe as an ornamental plant. Asparagus aethiopicus is a branching perennial herb with tough green aerial stems which are sparsely covered with spines. The oval-shaped leaves are actually leaf-like cladodes, which are 0.8‚Äì2 cm long and 0.1-0.2 cm wide, and arise in groups of four or more from the stem. Occurring in spring, the small white or pinkish-white flowers are 0.3-0.5 cm long and arise in clusters off the stem. Flowers are followed in summer by small round berries 0.5 cm in diameter, which bear a black 3 mm diameter seed. Initially green, the berries mature and turn red in the winter. The root system is a mat of fibrous roots with bulbous tubers, from which plants may resprout.Asparagus aethiopicus - SANBI PlantZAfrica.com File:Asparagus fern in flower (5389824646).jpgFlowers File:Asparagus aethiopicus fruit1 (11971208444).jpgFruit File:Vicious asparagus 1.jpgThorns Distribution Asparagus aethiopicus is native to southern regions of South Africa, mainly in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and the Northern Provinces.

Life Of his life we know only what St. Jerome tells us.De viris, chapter 84; Chron., ad an. 2345; Epist. lxx, 5; In Matt., I, ii, 11. He was a Spaniard of very good birth, became a priest, and wrote in the time of Constantine I. From one passage in his work (II, 806, sq.) and from St. Jerome's Chronicle it must be inferred that he wrote about the year 330. His poem, in dactylic hexameters, is entitled Evangeliorum libri (The Gospels). It is a history of Christ according to the Gospels, particularly that of St. Matthew. He goes to the other Evangelists for what he does not find in St. Matthew ‚Äî as the story of the Infancy, which he takes from St. Luke. He follows his model very closely, \\"almost literally\\", as St. Jerome says. The whole problem for him is to render the Gospel text into easy language conformable to the tradition of the Latin poets, and borrowed especially from Virgil. His task permits of little originality beyond that exhibited in new words composed, or derived, according to familiar types (auricolor, flammiuomus, flammicomans, sinuamen), elegant synonyms to express the Christian realities (tonans for \\"God\\", genitor for the Father, spiramen for the Holy Ghost, uersutia for the Devil), or, lastly, archaic expressions. The language is correct and the verses well constructed, but there is little colour or movement. A few obscurities of prosody betray the period in which the work was written. The whole effect is carefully wrought out. In the prologue, Juvencus announces that he wishes to meet the lying tales of the pagan poets, Homer and Virgil, with the glories of the true Faith. He hopes that his poem will survive the destruction of the world by fire, and will deliver him, the poet, from hell. He invokes the Holy Spirit as the pagans invoked the Muses or Apollo. The work is divided into four books, which make arbitrary divisions of the life of Christ. The number four seems to be symbolical, corresponding to the number of the Evangelists. Other traces of symbolism have been found in Juvencus, the most notable being the significance attached to the gifts of the Magi ‚Äî the incense offered to the God, the gold to the King, the myrrh to the Man. This interpretation, of which he, certainly, was not the inventor, was to have the greatest success, as we know. Lastly, eight preliminary verses, Juvencus's authorship of which is disputed, characterize the Evangelists and assign emblems to them; but they assign the eagle to St. Mark and the lion to St. John. The Bible text which Juvencus paraphrased was of course an ancient one. He appears, too, to have had recourse at times to the Greek text. The source of his poetical phraseology and his technic is, first, Virgil, then Lucretius, Propertius, Horace, Ovid, Silius Italicus, and Statius. The cold correctness of the work recommended it to the taste of the Middle Ages, when it was frequently quoted, imitated, and copied. St. Jerome tells us that Juvencus composed another, shorter, Christian poem on \\"the order of the mysteries\\" (Sacramentorum ordinem). This work is lost. Modern writers have incorrectly attributed to him the Heptateuchus, a work of Cyprianus Gallus, and the De Laudibus Domini, a work of Juvencus's time, but to be credited to some pupil of the rhetoricians of Augustodunum (Autun).

He was the first Kumagai Professor of Engineering in computer science at Stanford University from 1991 until his retirement. He is particularly known for his contributions to search, planning, knowledge representation, and robotics. Shakey at the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California  Early life and education  Nilsson was born in Saginaw, Michigan, in 1933. He received his Ph.D. from Stanford in 1958, and spent much of his career at SRI International, a private research lab spun off from Stanford. Nilsson served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force from 1958 to 1961; he was stationed at the Rome Air Development Center in Rome, New York.  Career  = SRI International = Starting in 1966, Nilsson, along with Charles A. Rosen and Bertram Raphael, led a research team in the construction of Shakey, a robot that constructed a model of its environment from sensor data, reasoned about that environment to arrive at a plan of action, then carried that plan out by sending commands to its motors. This paradigm has been enormously influential in AI. Textbooks such as , and the first edition of show this influence in almost every chapter. Although the basic idea of using logical reasoning to decide on actions is due to John McCarthy , Nilsson's group was the first to embody it in a complete agent, along the way inventing the A* search algorithm and founding the field of automated temporal planning. In the latter pursuit, they invented the STRIPS planner , whose action representation is still the basis of many of today's planning algorithms. The subfield of automated temporal planning called classical planning is based on most of the assumptions built into STRIPS. = Stanford University = In 1985, Nilsson became a faculty member at Stanford University, in the Computer Science Department. He was chair of the department from 1985 to 1990. He was the Kumagai Professor of Engineering from the foundation of the Chair in around 1991 until his retirement, and remained Kumagai Professor Emeritus until his death. He was the fourth President of the AAAI (1982‚Äì83) and a Founding Fellow of that organization. Nilsson wrote or coauthored several books on AI, including two that have been especially widely read (, ).  Awards and memberships  In 2011, Nilsson was inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems' AI's Hall of Fame for the \\"significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems\\". Press release source: PRWeb (Vocus).  Personal life  On July 19, 1958, Nilsson married Karen Braucht, with whom he had two children. Braucht died in 1991. In 1992 he married Grace Abbott, who had four children from a previous marriage. Nilsson died on April 23, 2019, at his home in Medford, Oregon, at the age of 86.

Tello (died 24 September probably 765) was the Bishop of Chur from 758/759 until his death. He was the last member of the ecclesiastical dynasty of the Victorids to wield power in Rhaetia through his control of the bishopric. His will is one of the earliest surviving records from Graub√ºnden and is an important source for the history of Rhaetia in the eighth century. According to his will, dated 15 December 765, and the Liber de feodis of 1388, he was a son of Victor, the praeses of Rhaetia, and his wife Teusenda. It is also mentioned in the will that he had brothers and sisters, though they are left unnamed. His episcopate can be demonstrated from 759 and he held, concurrently, the title of praeses, which had been his father's. He thus held both the spiritual and the temporal authority in the province. He is mentioned in the Vita sancti Galli of Walafrid Strabo under the year 759 or 760. In 762 he participated in the Council of Attigny on the Aisne as a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Mainz. His signature appears on the conciliar documents. Tello is elsewhere documented in the Verbr√ºderungsbuch (fraternity book) of the Abbey of Reichenau. He began the construction of the cathedral, which has an unusual crypt and was renovated in the Romanesque style. His death date is secured as 24 September, but the year is unknown, probably the same year as that of his will, which was dated to December. He bequeathed his extensive landed and movable wealth, which was concentrated in the lower Surselva between Flims and Trun, to Disentis Abbey, with which he had had close ties.

For any cardinal number K, the K-hedgehog space is formed by taking the disjoint union of K real unit intervals identified at the origin (though its topology is not the quotient topology, but that defined by the metric below). Each unit interval is referred to as one of the hedgehog's spines. A K-hedgehog space is sometimes called a hedgehog space of spininess K. The hedgehog space is a metric space, when endowed with the hedgehog metric d(x,y)=\\\\left x - y \\\\right if x and y lie in the same spine, and by d(x,y)=\\\\leftx\\\\right + \\\\lefty\\\\right if x and y lie in different spines. Although their disjoint union makes the origins of the intervals distinct, the metric makes them equivalent by assigning them 0 distance. Hedgehog spaces are examples of real trees. Paris metric The metric on the plane in which the distance between any two points is their Euclidean distance when the two points belong to a ray though the origin, and is otherwise the sum of the distances of the two points from the origin, is sometimes called the Paris metric because navigation in this metric resembles that in the radial street plan of Paris: for almost all pairs of points, the shortest path passes through the center. The Paris metric, restricted to the unit disk, is a hedgehog space where K is the cardinality of the continuum. Kowalsky's theorem Kowalsky's theorem, named after Hans-Joachim Kowalsky, states that any metrizable space of weight K can be represented as a topological subspace of the product of countably many K-hedgehog spaces.

She was built as the combined ocean liner/cruise ship Vistafjord in 1973 by Swan Hunter Shipbuilders in the United Kingdom for the Norwegian America Line. In 1983 she was sold to Cunard Line, retaining her original name until 1999 when she was renamed Caronia. In 2004 she was sold to Saga and sailed as Saga Ruby until sold in 2014 for use as a floating hotel and renamed Oasia. This never came to fruition. Her owners went bankrupt, and in April 2017 she arrived at Alang, India for scrapping. Concept and construction Vistafjord was ordered by Norwegian America Line (NAL) from Swan Hunter Shipbuilders, Newcastle, United Kingdom. She was based on the company's 1965-built , but with an enlarged hull, additional superstructure deck and improved interior layout. However, as the cost of building Sagafjord had put her builders, Forges et Chantiers de la Mediterranee, out of business, Vistafjord had to be built at a different shipyard. She was launched on 15 May 1972 and delivered to the Norwegian America Line exactly a year later on 15 May 1973. She is the last cruise ship to have been built in the United Kingdom.  Service history  =Norwegian America Line= On 22 May 1973, Vistafjord set on her maiden voyage, a transatlantic crossing from Oslo to New York. In early 1980, the vessel was famously chartered by car manufacturer British Leyland to internally launch the Austin Metro to its British dealer network. Although their ships were high-rated, Norwegian America Line had trouble making profit.Ulrich. p. 221 =Cunard Line= In 1983 Trafalgar House, the owners of legendary Cunard Line, purchased NALWard (2008). p. 43 and in October 1983 Vistafjord joined the Cunard fleet together with her sister ship Sagafjord. She retained her original name and the grey NAL hull colour, but received Cunard Line funnel colours and was re-registered to the Bahamas. Despite the flag change she retained Norwegian command staff.Ulrich. pp. 188-189 During this time, both Vistafjord and Sagafjord, were considered to be amongst the most luxurious cruise ships in the world, sharing the top 5 in Berlitz Complete Guide to Cruising, together with her sister ship Sagafjord and Royal Viking Line's Royal Viking Star, Royal Viking Sky and Royal Viking Sea for several years. In 1999 the decision was made to rename Vistafjord with a more traditional Cunard Line name. On 10 December 1999 she was renamed Caronia and re-registered in the United Kingdom. =Saga Cruises= Saga Ruby in Stockholm 2011 She continued service with Cunard until November 2004, when she was sold to Saga Cruises. Following a ¬£17 million refit at Valletta, Malta Caronia reappeared as Saga Ruby in March 2005. In the Saga Cruises fleet she joined her former Norwegian America Line fleetmate Sagafjord (now named Saga Rose). It was reported in 2012 that Saga Cruises would retire Saga Ruby in 2014 and the Quest for Adventure would move back into the fleet as Saga Pearl II.http://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/7521-saga-to-retire-ruby.html  Farewell Voyage with Saga  She sailed her final world cruise in the first months of 2013. However it was marred by technical difficulties which kept the ship in Southampton until late February, which led to the cruise being renamed the 'Grand Voyage' visiting South America and South Africa. It was reported that Saga Ruby would depart on her final cruise with Saga Cruises on 7 December 2013 round trip from Southampton, England on a 31-day voyage to the Caribbean.http://travel.saga.co.uk/holidays/ocean-cruises/saga-ruby/the- farewell-cruise.aspxhttp://travel.saga.co.uk/holidays/ocean-cruises/saga- ruby/the-farewell-cruise/itinerary-details.aspx While on her final cruise she was forced to change her itinerary to a Western Mediterranean cruise finally returning to Southampton on January 7, 2014. The cruise returned to Southampton late due to poor weather in the Bay of Biscay, eventually arriving on 9 January 2014, with passengers disembarking on 10 January. =Floating Hotel Oasia= In January 2014 she was sold for $14M USD to Millennium View Ltd, a privately held company based in Singapore. The new owners planned to convert her into a floating hotel in Myanmar. In mid-February 2014 she sailed from Gibraltar as Oasia under Bahamas flag and management of FleetPro Ocean. In February 2017, it was announced that Oasia was being sold for scrap. This came as quite a surprise to many, as the ship, still SOLAS compliant, had recently undergone a US$10 million overhaul as a hotel and museum ship. She was found in Thailand, awaiting tow to scrapping, after having US$20 million invested in her.  Design  =Exterior design= Saga Ruby in 2013 Vistafjord was built with a very traditional ocean liner profile, with the funnel placed amidship and a notable sheer on her hull. The superstructure is terraced both at the fore and aft of the ship. In two refits during her Cunard Line career additional structures were added to the rear and top of the superstructure. In Norwegian America Line service Vistafjord carried the traditional NAL livery, with a grey hull, white superstructure, yellow mast and a yellow funnel with red, white and blue (colours of the flag of Norway) stripes. Following the sale to Cunard she retained the grey hull colour, but her funnel was painted in the red/black Cunard colours and her mast white. A red \\"Cunard\\" text was later added to her superstructure. Coinciding with her renaming into Caronia in 1999 the ship's hull was repainted black. As Saga Ruby her hull was repainted dark blue and her funnel yellow, with a dark blue top and a narrow white stripe separating the two colours.  Filming  Vistafjord was featured in the 1986 episode Countdown of MacGyver as the cruise ship SS Victoria.http://rdanderson.com/macgyver/lexicon/entries/victoria.htm References External links *Saga Ruby official site *Saga Ruby Tour at MaritimeMatters *short video clips of Saga Ruby *Vistafjord on Chris' Cunard Page *Saga Ruby at Piraeus *Newham Council Planning Application Category:Cruise ships Category:Ocean liners Category:1972 ships Category:Ships built by Swan Hunter Category:Ships built on the River Tyne ","title":"Saga Ruby"},{"id":"8016197","text":"The Battle of Tarentum in March 212 BC was a military engagement in the Second Punic War. Prelude The Romans had been waiting for a chance to strike at Capua, the capital of Campania in southern Italy, after it revolted against them following their defeat by the Carthaginian Hannibal at Cannae in 216 BC. Hannibal had made the city his winter headquarters, and his proximity deterred the Romans. In 212 BC, however, Hannibal was called south to Tarentum, giving the Romans a chance to strike. Hannibal hoped for a success big enough to risk the loss of Capua. His eyes had long been set on the city of Tarentum, the richest in the whole of southern Italy. Tarentum's dislike of Rome Hannibal had been in communication with a party of Tarentine citizens who were unhappy with Roman rule. A previous attempt had been made by the people of Tarentum to rid themselves of the Romans. However, it was thwarted by the precautions that the Roman commander of Brundisium had taken. He took effectual means for the defence of the city and sent some of the possible malcontents to Rome to serve as hostages for the good behaviour of the rest of the population. These hostages were later caught trying to escape, several of whom were then convicted by the quaestores parricidii and sentenced to be flung from the Tarpeian Rock. This act infuriated the people of Tarentum, who renewed their communications with Hannibal. Hannibal's assault Marcus Livius, the governor of the city, was a good soldier but is said to be a man of indolent and luxurious habits. On the night appointed by Hannibal for the attack he was feasting with friends and retired to rest, heavy with food and wine. In the middle of the night he was awakened when the conspirators blew the alarm on some Roman trumpets and found Hannibal and 10,000 of his soldiers already within the city. Many of the Roman soldiers were asleep or drunk and were cut down by the Carthaginians as they stumbled out into the streets. Hannibal kept control of his troops to the extent that there was no general looting. Committed to respecting Tarentine freedom, Hannibal asked the Tarentines to mark houses where Tarentines lived. Only those houses not so marked and thus belonging to Romans were looted. Marcus Livius managed to bring his surviving troops to the citadel where they held off the Carthaginians for the duration of the war. However, the city was lost. All the Greek towns in Southern Italy with the exception of Rhegium were now under Hannibal's control. Aftermath Southern Italy provided Hannibal with a powerful foothold on the peninsula. However, when he heard news that the Romans were besieging Capua he turned his army around and only days after capturing Tarentum he was outside Capua. In the First Battle of Capua the besieging armies were temporarily driven off. At this point in history Hannibal looked invincible, having allies in southern Gaul, and owning Southern Italy and Iberia. Cities in Sicily such as Syracuse had revolted as well. Hannibal was also promised the support (which never came) of the powerful army of King Philip V of Macedon across the Adriatic. However, Hannibal's successes were not enduring. The Romans soon re-established their siege of Capua, and took the city following the Second Battle of Capua the next year. In 209 BC, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus recaptured Tarentum through treachery. In the following years, Scipio Africanus rose to prominence in Rome's military campaigns, and by copying Hannibal's tactics, eventually gained victory over Carthage.

His visual poetry ran a full gamut from calligrams inspired by Apollinaire and other early 20th Century French poets to Lettrisme to the Minimalism and Op Art of the 1960s. As his work developed, Keith concentrated increasingly on African and African-American themes and sources. This development toward African roots and branches led away from the Roman alphabet and more toward the store of iconography and symbolism from Egypt to South Africa to the American diaspora. Consequently, Keith developed graphic techniques suggested by textiles, wood carvings, bronze casts, ceramics, and other indigenous arts. An example of Keith's recreation of the substance of his visual style and the very nature of his own particular artistic interventions would now be traced in his use of rhythmic patterns through repetitions of graphic elements from sources as diverse as road signs and zebra stripes. Keith's work as a whole became a celebration of the adventures of African sources as they moved and interacted with the rest of the world. Individual works may initially seem merely decorative, but familiarity reveals a call to the kinetics and dynamics of celebration. Upon his death, Keith was survived by his sons, Antar and Tarik, to whom he dedicated his book, \\"Pictographs.\\" Bibliography *Sphinx (Xerolage, 1992) *Wisdom (Runaway Spoon, 1993) *Pictographs (Left Hand Books, 1996) *Stalking the Minotaur (Koja Press, 2003) External links *Selected Openings of Pictographs * Tributes and Appreciations at Black Box magazine.

All books have been translated into English. The novels are generally considered to be among the best pieces of Swedish literature. Plot :For longer descriptions, see the individual wiki-pages of each novel. The novel-series describes the long and strenuous journey for a party of emigrants from the province of Sm√•land, Sweden, to the United States in 1850, coinciding with the beginning of the first significant wave of immigration to the United States from Sweden. The story focuses primarily on Karl-Oskar Nilsson and his wife, Kristina Johansdotter, a young married couple who live with their four small children; Anna, Johan, Lill-M√§rta, and Harald, as well as Karl-Oskar's parents and his rebellious younger brother Robert, who works as a hired farmhand for neighboring farmers. The family lives on a small farm at Korpamoen, where the soil is thin and rocky, making growing crops extremely difficult. It is Robert, together with his friend Arvid, who first comes across the prospect of going to America after being tired of being mistreated by the farmers who employ him. When he confronts Karl-Oskar about the idea, Karl-Oskar reveals that he too has come across pamphlets describing conditions in North America for farmers as being much better. Kristina, however, is adamantly against emigrating, not wanting to leave her homeland or wanting to risk the lives of her children by taking them across the ocean. However, things take yet another tragic turn for the family which causes Kristina to reconsider. In the winter of 1849, on the day of the christening of their youngest child, Harald, Kristina is preparing a large bowl of barley porridge. Their eldest child, four-year-old Anna, determined to have some even after being told she cannot, goes into the cellar where it is left to cool and helps herself to a very large amount of it, so much that she falls terribly ill from it. Karl-Oskar and Kristina send for Beata, a healing woman from Idemo, who upon seeing Anna tells them that after consuming so much porridge, Anna's stomach had burst. The child lingers in agony through the night before dying early the following morning, after which Kristina agrees for them to make the journey to America (Minnesota). In their preparation for their emigration to the United States, Karl-Oskar, Kristina, their three remaining children and Robert are joined by Kristina's uncle and aunt, Danjel and Inga-Lena Andreasson and their four children. Danjel, a preacher of the Akian sect, had suffered relentless persecution under the hands of the local parish and was seeking the religious freedom promised in the United States. He was joined by a dependent of his following, Ulrika of V√§sterg√∂hl, a former prostitute seeking to start a new life for herself and her illegitimate teenage daughter Elin, away from her dark past. Along with Ulrika and Elin, Danjel had also agreed to pay Arvid's passage to America after hiring him as a farmhand. The party was finally joined by Jonas Petter, a friend of Karl-Oskar who was fleeing an unhappy marriage. The party sets off by wagon for the Swedish port city of Karlshamn, on the Baltic coast, where they board the brig Charlotta, bound for New York with emigrants.

The screenplay, which took four years to be completed, was written by Hamburger, Adriana Falc√£o, Claudio Galperin, Anna Muylaert and Br√°ulio Mantovani. It was submitted by the Ministry of Culture for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. This choice was unexpected, since it was thought that Jos√© Padilha's Elite Squad would be submitted. Plot The story takes place entirely during a few months in 1970, in the city of S√£o Paulo. Mauro, a 12-year-old boy, is suddenly deprived of the company of his young parents, Bia and Daniel Stein, who are political activists on the run from the harsh military government, which was strongly repressing leftists all over the country. Against this backdrop of fear and political persecution, the country is at the same time bursting with enthusiasm for the coming World Cup, to be held in Mexico, the first one to be transmitted live via satellite. Unable to take care of their only child, the Steins, who live in Belo Horizonte, drive all the way to S√£o Paulo to deliver the boy to his paternal grandfather, M√≥tel, who is a barber. To their son, they say they will travel on vacation and promise to return for the World Cup games. Unfortunately, however, the grandfather dies on the same day the boy arrives, and he is left clueless and without support in Bom Retiro, a working- class neighborhood inhabited mainly by Jewish people, many of whom speak Yiddish, an unknown language to the boy. As his father is Jewish, the close- knit Bom Retiro community rally in support of the child and Shlomo, a solitary elder and religious Jew who was a close neighbor and friend of Mauro's grandfather, assumes the care of Mauro. Mauro is a football enthusiast and wants to be a goalkeeper. He gradually mixes in with other neighborhood children and becomes acquainted with a number of colorful characters, including Hanna, a girl his age; √çtalo, a politically active student from the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo; Irene, a beautiful female bartender and her boyfriend, the mulatto ace goalkeeper of one of the local football teams; the local rabbi and assorted Jewish elders, Italian immigrants, and so on. To Mauro's great disappointment, his parents neither appear as promised at the World Cup nor give any notice. Fearing the worst, Shlomo starts to investigate by himself and is arrested by the political police because of his meddling. Finally, he achieves the liberation of Mauro's mother, who is severely ill after the prison term. Her reunion with her child happens in the very same day of Brazil's final victory at the World Cup. (Mauro's father disappears while in the dictatorship's clutches, never to return.) At the end of the film, Mauro says farewell to his recent friends and playmates as he and his mother leave Bom Retiro and prepare to go into exile. Cast * Michel Joelsas as Mauro * Germano Haiut as Shlomo * Daniela Piepszyk as Hanna * Caio Blat as √çtalo * Liliana Castro as Irene * Paulo Autran as M√≥tel, Mauro's grandfather * Simone Spoladore as Bia, Mauro's mother * Eduardo Moreira as Daniel, Mauro's father Production The film is semi- autobiographical: The director's parents, physicists and professors of the University of S√£o Paulo, were briefly arrested by the military in the same year of 1970, accused of lending support to \\"subversives\\". The couple's five children -- including Cao Hamburger, the director, who was 8 years old -- came under the care of their grandmothers, one Jewish and one Italian Catholic. Critical reception The film has received mostly positive reviews. Based on 52 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of critics gave The Year My Parents Went on Vacation a positive review (43 \\"Fresh\\"; 9 \\"Rotten\\"), with an average rating of 7.1/10. Deborah Young of Variety hailed the film as \\"sensitive, delicate and involving\\", going on to say that \\"Hamburger feels no need (nor is there any) to underline the obvious. He has a magician's ability to keep the story light and believable\\". It also notes that \\"the humorous central part of the screenplay is bereft of surprises\\". The film was picked as Brazil's submission for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (and was shortlisted alongside nine other films), and was released on February 8, 2008 in the United States and Canada.

It is part of the Ortsbezirk S√ºd and is subdivided into the Stadtbezirke Niederrad-Nord, Niederrad-S√ºd and the new Niederrad-West. History The district is mainly designated as residential area. It includes the early social housing area of Bruchfeldstra√üe which was planned by the urban planners in the 1920s under the direction of Ernst May, the Adolf-Miersch housing area (1957/58) and the high- rise Mainfeld residential area (begun in 1963, built mainly during the early 1970s).https://frankfurt.de/frankfurt-entdecken-und- erleben/stadtportrait/stadtteile/niederrad In 1151 Niederrad was mentioned for the first time in a document, referring to it simply as \\"Rode\\" (literally: \\"the clearing\\") in the imperial forest between Sachsenhausen and Schwanheim.https://frankfurt.de/frankfurt-entdecken-und- erleben/stadtportrait/stadtgeschichte/chroniken-der-stadtteile/chronik-von- niederrad In 1193 the Sandhof, a (small) royal moated castle, is mentioned for the first time. In 1221 the Sandhof passes into the possession of the Teutonic Order (until 1809). In 1552 Niederrad and the Sandhof are put to the torch by Markgrave Alcibiades of Brandenburg. In 1616, another fire almost completely burns Niederrad to the ground. In 1726 the first protestant church is built (now: Paul-Gerhard-Gemeinde). Around 1750 the Sandhof gets a baroque architectural makeover. Between 1761 and 74 the Frauenhof is built. The building is first used for a cotton printing factory by the merchant Johann Friedrich M√ºller. Around 1850 Niederrad's population increases to 2,000 people. In 1866 Niederrad, like Frankfurt am Main, is annected by Prussia, as a result of the Austro-Prussian War. In 1871 Niederrad's first catholic church is built. In 1887 the Sandhof, who came into possession of the city government in 1884, is turned into a (part of) a hospital that would later become the hospital of the Frankfurt University. On July 1st of 1900 Niederrad is officially integrated into the city of Frankfurt. (Population at the time: 8,800 people.) Before, it was only part of the surrounding district. In 1930 Niederrad reaches a population of 14,000 people. At the same time the psychiatric clinic is built by Ernst May and Professor Els√§sser. In 1932/33 a new catholic church is built. In 1944 the Sandhof is destroyed by allied bombardment. Other parts of Niederrad are also severely damaged. In 1950 Niederrad's population reaches 18,000 people. As of 2019, Niederrad had a population of 26,488 people.https://frankfurt.de/-/media/frankfurtde/service- und-rathaus/zahlen-daten-fakten/pdf/pdf- fsa/2020/2020_03-bevoelkerung-2019.ashx Situation Niederrad is the site of the western part of the University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt naming of some important institutions, but the racecourse Niederrad is located administratively in the district of Sachsenhausen and the Niederrad business district \\"B√ºrostadt\\" belongs almost exclusively to the District Schwanheim, more precisely, its settlement Goldstein.

It has the same technical base as the Walther OSP and thus is almost identical in outward appearance, albeit slightly longer and heavier than the OSP. The GSP was introduced on the world market in 1968 and was chambered for .22 Long Rifle. At the end of 1971, Walther began offering the pistol in .32 S&W.; Regardless of its original caliber, conversion units for the other caliber are available and easily interchangeable. The anatomical, adjustable walnut grips were also available, on order from Walther, for left- handed shooters. In 1988, Walther introduced a fully adjustable (for pull, stop, and angle) two-stage trigger that athletes could retrofit their pistols with. Variants Some of the very early GSPs were missing the slide stop lever which wasn't incorporated until the 1970s. The early model GSPs, from 1968 to 1977, had a manual safety catch on the left side of the frame. This feature was omitted in 1977 because it was an unnecessary feature on a competition pistol. Also throughout the years, the design of the ergonomic grips underwent several changes. The GSP chambered for .32 S&W; Long WC, sometime referred to as the GSP-C, was intended for use in competitions that only allowed centerfire cartridges. In 1976, Walther offered the GSP MV, which stands for matt vernickelt (matte nickel finish). The MV models were available in both .22 lr and .32 S&W; Long calibers. In 1992, Walther had a special limited edition of the GSP designated as the 25 Jahre (25th Anniversary Edition). The frame of this model had a nickel finish and the bolt had a gold titanium finish. At the time, these sold for 2,549 Deutsche Marks. In 1996, Walther produced a GSP Atlanta model commemorating the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta. These ones also had the gold titanium finish on the bolt. Today, there is also a more accurate version available known as the GSP Expert which has a vibration-absorbing Aluminum sleeve, containing inertial dampers, around the barrel. The Walther GSP is a popular choice for the various 25 m pistol shooting events governed by the ISSF (some contested at the Olympic games). The .22 short variant was used in rapid fire pistol. The .22 LR variant was used for the 25 m Pistol (formerly \\"Sport Pistol\\"), 25 m Standard Pistol while the .32 caliber variant was used in the 25 m Center-Fire Pistol event. Under the N.Y Safe Act the Walther GSP is now classified as an assault weapon under N.Y state law. It is also classified as an assault weapon under Chicago and Cook County laws due to the magazine being outside of the pistol grip.

It is the most prominent member of the epipolythiopiperazines, a large class of natural products featuring a diketopiperazine with di- or polysulfide linkage. These highly bioactive compounds have been the subject of numerous studies aimed at new therapeutics. Gliotoxin was originally isolated from Gliocladium fimbriatum, and was named accordingly. It is an epipolythiodioxopiperazine metabolite. Occurrence The compound is produced by human pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus, and also by species of Trichoderma, and Penicillium. Gliotoxin has also been reported from yeasts of the genus Candida, but results from other studies have cast doubt on the production of this metabolite by Candida fungi... Mechanism of action Gliotoxin is suspected to be an important virulence factor in Aspergillus fungus. Gliotoxin possesses immunosuppressive properties that may suppress and cause apoptosis in certain cells of the immune system, including neutrophils, eosinophils, granulocytes, macrophages, and thymocytes. Specifically, neutrophils exposed to gliotoxin release less reactive oxygen species (ROS) and complete fewer phagocytic activities. Gliotoxin is also believed to interfere with T-cell activation. Additionally, gliotoxin acts as an inhibitor of farnesyl transferase. It noncompetitively inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome. In vivo gliotoxin displays anti-inflammatory activity. It was investigated as an antibiotic and antifungal in the 1940s and as an antiviral agent. Gliotoxin inactivates many different enzymes, including nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B), NADPH oxidase, and glutaredoxin. The inhibition of NF-Œ∫B leads prevents cytokine release and induction of the inflammatory response. The immunosuppressive properties of gliotoxin are due to the disulfide bridge within its structure. Interactions occur between sulfur molecules that make up the disulfide bridge and thiol groups contained in cysteine residues. Gliotoxin acts by blocking thiol residues in the cell membrane. Gliotoxin also activates a member of the Bcl-2 family called Bak in order to mediate cell apoptosis. Activated Bak then causes the release of ROS, which form pores within the mitochondrial membrane. These pores allow the release of cytochrome C and AIF, which initiate apoptosis within the cell. Biosynthesis In Aspergillus fumigatus, the enzymes needed for gliotoxin biosynthesis are encoded in 13 genes within the gli gene cluster. When this gene cluster is activated, these enzymes mediate the production of gliotoxin from serine and phenylalanine residues. Enzymes Involved in Biosynthesis (in order of activity) :GliZ: transcription factor that regulates expression of gli gene cluster :GliP: facilitates formation of cyclo-phenylalanyl-serine intermediate from serine and :phenylalanine residues :GliC: adds hydroxyl group to the alpha carbon of the phenylalanine residue in the :cyclo-phenylalanyl-serine intermediate :GliG: glutathione S-transferase (GST) that adds two glutathione molecules forming a :bis-glutathionylated intermediate :GliK: gamma-glutamyl transferase that removes gamma-glutamyl moieties from :glutathione additions :GliN: adds a methyl group to nitrogen to form the dithiol gliotoxin intermediate :GliT: oxidoreductase that mediates closure of the disulfide-bridge Conversion of dithiol gliotoxin to gliotoxin by the enzyme GliT. :GliA: Major Facilitator Superfamily transporter that secretes gliotoxin across cell membrane :Enzymes GliJ, GliI, GliF, and GliH are necessary for biosynthesis, but their exact function is unknown. Regulation of Biosynthesis Some gliotoxin molecules are not secreted by GliA and remain in the cell. This intracellular gliotoxin activates the transcription factor GliZ, facilitating gli gene cluster expression, and an enzyme called GtmA. GtmA acts as a negative regulator for gliotoxin biosynthesis by adding methyl groups to the two sulfur residues on the dithiol gliotoxin intermediate. These additions prevent the formation of the disulfide bridge by GliT, inhibiting gliotoxin formation. Exposure and health effects = Environmental exposure = Exposure to fungal species that secrete gliotoxin is common because airborne Aspergillus fungal spores are ubiquitous in many environments. Regular environmental exposure does not typically cause illness, but can cause serious infections in immunosuppressed individuals or those suffering from chronic respiratory illnesses. Infections caused by Aspergillus fungus are called aspergillosis. There are many types of aspergillosis, but infections typically affect the lungs or the sinuses.The Aspergillosis Website . (n.d.). Aspergillus & Aspergillosis Website. Retrieved May 08, 2017, from http://www.aspergillus.org.uk/content/aspergillosis-2 Gliotoxin is hypothesized to be an important virulence factor in Aspergillus fumigatus. Experiments have demonstrated that gliotoxin is isolated in the highest concentrations from Aspergillus fumigatus in comparison to other Aspergillus species. This species of fungi is the most common cause of aspergillosis in humans. Gliotoxin is also the only toxin that has been isolated from the sera of patients suffering from invasive aspergillosis. These results suggest a link between gliotoxin secretion and fungal pathogenicity. While not enough data exists to definitively tie chronic gliotoxin exposure to the development of cancer, chronic exposure to other immunosuppressive agents has been linked to the development of lymphomas and mammary tumors. Individuals taking immunosuppressive medications or with previous or current exposure to chemotherapy radiation are at higher risk for the development of these tumors. = Clinical exposure = Gliotoxin is toxic if swallowed or inhaled, and can cause skin and eye irritation if exposure occurs to these areas. The oral of gliotoxin is 67 mg/kg. Acute symptoms of gliotoxin start rapidly after ingestion.

Club career =Metz= Born in Metz, France, Gorius started his career at FC Metz since he was five and progressed through the youth team and reserve side. Gorius then made his Metz debut on 23 May 2004, where he played 20 minutes after coming on as a substitute in the second half, in a 3‚Äì1 loss against Ajaccio on the last game of the season. Following this, Gorius signed his first professional contract with the club. However, Gorius struggled to make a breakthrough in the first team, as well as, facing his own injury concerns. At the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season, with just made three appearance in all competitions, the club decided against extending his contract. Following this, Gorius, along with Jean-Philippe Caillet, went on trial at FC Saarbr√ºcken and played a match. =Brussels= In July 2005, Gorius moved to Belgium when he was signed for Brussels by Manager Albert Cartier and was a replacement for Bj√∏rn Helge Riise, who moved back to his native country. Gorius made his Brussels debut, in the opening game of the season, where he played the whole game, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Beveren. Gorius then scored his first goal for Brussels on 19 November 2005, in a 3‚Äì1 win over Standard Li√®ge.

It wasn‚Äôt until on 17 March 2007 when he scored again, in a 4‚Äì1 loss against Club Brugge. After scoring two more league goals against Roeselare and Genk., Gorius went on to score eight goals in thirty‚Äìfour appearances in all competitions. Following this, Gorius extended a contract with the club for another three years. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Gorius started the season well when he scored his first goal of the season, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Sint-Truidense on 22 September 2007. By the end of 2007, Gorius went on to score two more goals against Dender and Cercle Brugge. Gorius then scored a brace on 19 January 2008, in a 7‚Äì2 loss against Westerlo and later added two more goals later in the season against Mons and Mechelen Despite the club‚Äôs struggles in the top‚Äìflight league, ultimately resulted in their relegation, Gorius went on to score seven times (in which he was the club‚Äôs top‚Äìscorer in the 2007‚Äì08 season) in thirty‚Äìtwo appearances in all competitions, although he suffered setback, due to injury and suspension. In the summer transfer of 2008, Gorius invoked a clause that can allowed him to leave the club, as he expressed not to play in the Second Division. =KV Mechelen= On 18 July 2008, Gorius returned to top‚Äìflight football when he joined KV Mechelen, signing a four‚Äìyear contract with the club. Previously, he hinted that he would stay in Belgium, although he was linked with a move back in his homeland. Gorius made his Mechelen debut, in the opening game of the season, where he made his first start and played 80 minutes, in a 3‚Äì1 loss against Mouscron. It wasn‚Äôt until on 20 September 2008 when he scored his first goal, as well as, setting up a goal, in a 2‚Äì1 win over Gent.

Gorius scored again on 27 February 2009, in a 2‚Äì1 win over Genk, followed up by scoring in a 1‚Äì0 win over Westerlo on 7 March 2009. Gorius‚Äô fifth goal later came on 4 April 2009, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Kortrijk and finished his first season at Mechelen, making thirty‚Äìfour appearance and scoring five times in all competitions. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, Gorius started the season when he scored in the opening game of the season, in a 4‚Äì1 win over Westerlo and scored two more goals by the end of August. By the first half of the season, Gorius made twenty appearance and scoring five times in all competitions. Gorius then scored on 16 January 2010, in a 2‚Äì1 win over Roeselare, followed up by scoring twice, in a 3‚Äì2 win over Westerlo in the quarter‚Äìfinal of the Beker van Belgi√´ first leg. Later in the 2009‚Äì10 season, Gorius went on to score five more goals in all competitions. By the end of the season, he made thirty‚Äìeight appearance and scoring fourteen times in all competitions, making him the club‚Äôs top scorer this season. For his performance, Gorius was awarded the Most Deserving Player of the Year by the club‚Äôs supporters. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Gorius continued to impress at the start of the season for the club when he scored in the opening game of the season, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Lokeren. Despite suffering an injury that resulted him wearing a mask, Gorius then scored seven goals by the first half of the season in all competitions against Club Brugge, Cercle Brugge, Westerlo, Germinal Beerschot (twice) and Racing Waregem (twice). For his performance with the club in the first half of the season, Gorius signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2014. Following this, Gorius scored six goals in five appearance in all competitions throughout February against Kortrijk, Cercle Brugge and Lierse.

By the end of 2012, Gorius later scored against RAEC Mons, Lierse and Zulte Waregem. Gorius struggled to score in the past few months and then ended his ten match goal drought on 9 March 2013, in a 3‚Äì2 win over Gent, followed up, with a 5‚Äì1 win over RAEC Mons. After scoring against Standard Liege on 16 May 2013, Gorius finished his first season, making fifty‚Äìfour appearances and scoring eight times in all competitions. During the season, Gorius also helped the club win the Belgium Cup final after beating Cercle Brugge 2‚Äì0.

However, in a match against Mechelen on 23 November 2014, Gorius suffered an injury and was substituted in the first half, which saw him sidelined throughout the whole year. Despite being sidelined twice later in the 2014‚Äì15 season, due to injuries, Gorius remained in the first team and then scored again on 2 May 2015, as well as, setting up one of the goals, in a 7‚Äì1 win over Waasland-Beveren.

Gorius then scored his first Changchun Yatai goal to score the only goal in the game, in a 1‚Äì0 win over Shijiazhuang Ever Bright on 29 May 2016. However, with twelve appearance and scoring once, Gorius was sent to the reserve to keep himself fit for the rest of the season following the arrivals of new foreigner players, Mislav Or≈°iƒá and Bruno Meneghel in the summer. At the end of the season, Gorius was released by the club after spending one season there. After leaving China, Gorius later reflecting his time at China, stating that it was difficult to do well there. Following this, Gorius was linked a return move to Belgium when both of his former clubs, Mechelen and Genk, were keen on signing him. =OH Leuven= On 13 June 2017 Oud-Heverlee Leuven, playing in the Belgian First Division B, announced they had signed Gorius on a two year deal.

Shark was sunk during the Battle of Jutland on the evening of 31 May 1916. Design and construction Under the 1911‚Äì1912 shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy, the British Admiralty ordered 20 s, with 12 to the standard Admiralty design and 8 more builder's specials, with detailed design left to the builders. Swan, Hunter & Wigham Richardson received an order for one destroyer, HMS Shark, to be built to the Admiralty design. The Acastas were larger and more powerful than the s ordered under the previous year's programme. Greater speed was wanted to match large fast destroyers building for foreign navies, while a larger radius of action was desired. The destroyers built to the Admiralty standard design were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was Normal and Deep load. Four Yarrow boilers fed steam to direct drive Parsons steam turbines rated at and driving two shafts. This gave a speed of . Three funnels were fitted. The ship had an endurance of at . Armament consisted of three guns mounted on the ship's centreline, with one forward and two aft, with 120 rounds of ammunition carried per gun, together with two torpedo tubes. Two reload torpedoes were carried. The ship had a crew of 73 officers and ratings. Shark was laid down at Swan Hunter's Wallsend shipyard on 27 October 1911 and was launched on 30 July 1912. In 1913 the Admiralty decided to reclassify the Royal Navy's destroyers into alphabetical classes, with the Acasta class becoming the K class. New names were allocated to the ships of the K class, with the name Kestrel being reserved for Shark, but the ships were not renamed. Shark was completed in April 1913. Service Following commissioning, as with the rest of her class, Shark joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla based at Portsmouth. On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the 4th Flotilla, including Shark, became part of the Grand Fleet based at Scapa Flow in the Orkneys. =German raid on Scarborough= On 15 December 1914, German battlecruisers, supported by the battleships of the main German High Seas Fleet set out on a raid against the coastal towns of Scarborough, Whitby and Hartlepool, with the intent of drawing out units of the British Grand Fleet, where they could be engaged by the battleships of the High Seas Fleet. The British, aware from radio intercepts that the Germans were planning a raid with their battlecruisers (but not that they were supported by the whole of the High Seas Fleet), sent out the battlecruiser squadron under Vice Admiral David Beatty with four battlecruisers and the Second Battle Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender, with six battleships, to oppose the raid. Shark was one of seven destroyers that sailed in support of the British battlecruiser squadron. At 05:15 on 16 December, the lead ship of the British destroyers, , spotted a German destroyer, (part of the screen of the High Seas Fleet) and set off with the other destroyers in pursuit of the German ship. In a brief exchange of fire, V155 hit both Lynx and , forcing both to break off. Soon afterwards, Shark and encountered the German light cruiser . After Hardy was badly damaged by shells from Hamburg, Shark and the remaining British destroyers resumed station screening the British battlecruisers. They encountered five German destroyers at about 06:03, which they chased away, and at about 06:50 encountered the German cruiser , screened by destroyers, and shadowed them, while reporting their position by radio, but when Shark attempted to lead her division in a torpedo attack against the German cruiser, the appearance of two more German cruisers, and Hamburg, and were forced to break off the attack with the German cruisers in pursuit, before losing contact with the Germans due to poor visibility. =The Battle of Jutland= During the Battle of Jutland, the 4th Flotilla was attached to Admiral David Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet based at Rosyth, and assigned to cover the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron. During the battle, at around 6 pm, Shark led an unsuccessful torpedo attack by the flotilla on the German 2nd Scouting Group. The other three destroyers escaped with little damage, but Shark was crippled by gunfire. The forecastle gun was completely blown away with most of its gun crew shortly before the captain, Commander Loftus Jones, declined an offer of assistance from the destroyer . Soon afterwards the aft 4-inch gun was also destroyed and the bridge wrecked. Jones and three seamen continued working the midship gun, engaging nearby German destroyers and leading to the sinking of . The German destroyers closed on the ship and returned heavy fire, during which Jones lost a leg. Shortly before 7 pm he ordered the ship to be abandoned and around thirty of the crew got onto the rafts. Only seven were picked up six hours later by a Danish ship, but one died soon afterwards. Although there are reports that Jones went down with the ship, survivors told his wife that he was put onto a raft. In total, 86 men out of a crew of 92 were killed. Loss At 7 pm, the destroyer was sunk by a torpedo launched by the German torpedo boat and which hit her abreast of the aft funnel. In March 1917, Jones was gazetted with a posthumous Victoria Cross.

The gƒßonnella, pronounced \\"awe-nel-la\\" (pl. gƒßenienel, pronounced \\"eh-nee-nal\\"), sometimes referred to as a Faldetta, was a form of women's head dress and shawl, or hooded cloak, unique to the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo. It originated, and has some similarities, to the Turkish charshaf, but distinguishly had a piece of cardboard sewn inside (hooded), at the top part above the head. There was a different blue version in the south-east of Malta, and it was referred to as xurqana. Another in the village of Gƒßargƒßur was referred to as stamijna. It was generally made of cotton or silk, and usually black or some other dark colour, although from the sixteenth century onwards, noble women and women from wealthier households frequently wore white or brightly coloured gƒßenienel. The gƒßonnella covered the head, and framed but did not cover the face. The upper part of the gƒßonnella was starched quite stiffly, and given a broad, rounded frame, formed by means of a board, cane, or whalebone. From a practical perspective, this broad bonnet captured much needed cooling breezes during the hot Maltese summer. On cooler days, the wearer could wrap the gƒßonnella around her face more tightly, by making a slight adjustment. The lower part of the gƒßonnella could be worn loosely draped around the wearer's bodice and hips, or more tightly wrapped in the case of inclement weather. It would typically fall to mid-calf length. While walking, the wearer would hold one or both sides of the gƒßonnella clasped in her right hand.  Origins  Republic Square (then Queen's Square) in Valletta in 1910 The origins of the gƒßonnella are unknown. It has been described as a \\"western garment, worn in an eastern fashion.\\"The Chamber's Journal (1840). Translated by Robert Attard, \\"Faldetta (1772)\\" in Malta: A Collection of Tales and Narratives (The Edward De Bono Foundation: Malta, 2001), at pp. 37-9. Maltese historians Ciantar and Abela were of the view that the gƒßonnella had evolved from traditional Sicilian dress: > \\"One cannot deny that the frequent interchange made between the Maltese and > Sicilians influenced local customs. Sicilian influence may be discovered > both in the eating habits of the Maltese as well as in the costumes worn in > Malta. The garb worn by the Maltese women is a case in point.

Translated by Robert Attard, \\"Faldetta (1772)\\" in Malta: A > Collection of Tales and Narratives (The Edward De Bono Foundation: Malta, > 2001), at pp. 37-9. A Lady in a Faldetta According to local legend, the gƒßonnella was first introduced to Malta in 1224 C.E. as a sign of mourning by the women of Celano in the Abruzzi region of Italy, who were said to have been expelled - first to Sicily, and then to Malta - by Enrico de Morra, acting on the orders of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, following the massacre of their husbands. There is some historical evidence of this event recorded in the chronicles of Riccardo di San Germano: > \\"Henricus de Morra iussu imperiali Celanenses reuocat ubique dispersos, ut > ad propria redeant, et redeuntes capit et in Siciliam mittit, quos apud > Maltam dirigit Imperator.\\"Riccardi de Sancto Germano notarii Chronica, ed. > C. Garufi, Rerum Italicarum Scriptores, ns. vii part 2 (Bologna, 1938), > quoted by Anthony Luttrell in \\"Giliberto Abbate's Report on Malta: circa > 1241\\", Proceedings of History Week (1993) at 1-29. Online at: > www.geocities.com/thierenswilliam/proceedingsofhistoryweek1993 An alternate legend, which plays on the similarity between the Faldetta and a traditional nun's habit, suggests that the women of Malta adopted this costume in 1798, to ward off the unwanted advances of Napoleon Bonaparte's troops. However, this theory was dismissed as a fairy tale in a National Geographic essay about Malta (1935).Sir Harry Luke, \\"The Maltese Islands\\", The National Geographic Magazine, 1935. According to yet another legend, the gƒßonnella developed due to the strict Canonical requirement (pre-Vatican Council II) that women veil their head before entering a Catholic church. It is said that poorer country girls, who could not afford a cloak or shawl, met the veiling requirement by placing a spare skirt over their head, which gradually evolved into the gƒßonnella. Others speculate that it is a vernacular modification of the eastern veil; it could also be a local variation of the Spanish mantilla.Frank Scicluna, \\"Legends, Customs and Beliefs\\" (1999: Adelaide, Australia), online at allmalta.com Ghonnella from Italian Gonnella, diminutive for Gonna = Skirt. There are references to the gƒßonnella in the early records of the Knights of St. John (Order of Malta), and in eighteenth century travel books. Louis De Boiseglin, historian of the Knights of Malta wrote as follows: > \\"The Maltese women are little, and have beautiful hands and feet. They have > fine black eyes, though they sometimes appear to squint, owing to their > always looking out of the same eye; half of the face being covered with a > sort of veil made of silk called Faldetta, which they twist about very > gracefully, and arrange with much elegance.

De Boiseglin, > The History of the Knights of Malta, first published 1804. Translated by > Robert Attard, \\"Wearing it Could Make You Squint (1800)\\" in Malta: A > Collection of Tales and Narratives (The Edward De Bono Foundation: Malta, > 2001), at pp. 39. Victorian illustrator and traveller, William Henry Bartlett, was clearly intrigued by the Faldetta, describing it as follows in 1851: > \\"Next, tripping lightly down the steps behind, is a Maltese lady, enveloped > in her elegant black silk mantilla, a costume of which it may be said that > it renders even the ugly attractive, while the pretty become positively > irresistible: so grave, and yet so piquante, so nun-like, and yet so > coquettish, are its rustling folds, tastefully drawn round the head, so as > to throw additional expression into a deep dark eye, and to relieve a white- > gloved hand, and taper Andalusian foot.\\"W.H. Bartlett, Gleanings, Pictorial > and Antiquarian, on the Overland Route (Hall, Virtue & Co.: London, 1851).  Disappearance of the Gƒßonnella  For centuries, the gƒßonnella was ubiquitous throughout Malta, worn by virtually all adult Maltese women. It was so popular that there were many seamstresses whose sole job was to design, cut and sew gƒßenienel. However, it rapidly fell into disuse in the 1940s and 1950s, following World War II. By the 1970s, it was rarely seen, except among the older members of the Maltese lay missionary movement, the Societas Doctrin√¶ Christian√¶ (M.U.S.E.U.M.). The gƒßonnella completely disappeared by the end of the 20th century; one of the last women to wear it was ƒäensa Vella from Victoria, Gozo, who wore the garment until early 1991. The hooded garment took a lot of space, and for this reason it became impractical to wear on Maltese public buses.

The first definite mention of the area in a cricket connection is a 1735 match on nearby Bromley Common between Kent and London Cricket Club.

With hatchet in hand, Richard P. Robinson in on the left. Helen Jewett (October 18, 1813 ‚Äì April 10, 1836) was an American prostitute in New York City who was brutally murdered. One of her regular clients, Richard P. Robinson, was tried and sensationally acquitted of her murder. Jewett's murder and Robinson's subsequent trial was one of the first sex scandals to receive detailed press reporting, notably in the New York Herald. Public opinion was divided between those who felt that Jewett had deserved her fate, and others claiming that Robinson had escaped justice through powerful connections. Early history Jewett was born Dorcas DoyenThe trial of Richard P. Robinson for the murder of Helen Jewett. New York City, 1836 In American state trials / John D.Lawson, editor pp 426-487 Wilmington, Del. : Scholarly Resources, 1972 in Temple, Maine, into a working- class family. Her father was an alcoholic; her mother died when Jewett was young. From the age of 12 or 13, Jewett was employed as a servant girl in the home of Chief Justice Nathan Weston of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Upon reaching the age of 18, Jewett left the Weston home at the first opportunity. She moved to Portland, Maine, where she worked as a prostitute under an assumed name. She subsequently moved to Boston and finally New York under a succession of fake names. The murder Jewett's body was discovered by the matron of the brothel, Rosina Townsend, at 3 a.m. on April 10, 1836. The murder had taken place sometime after midnight. Jewett was struck on the head three times with a sharp object. (The coroner's report called it a 'hatchet'.) Based on the position of the corpse in bed, the coroner concluded that the blows were not expected: there were no signs of struggle. After inflicting the lethal blows, the murderer then set fire to Jewett's bed. Townsend discovered the room full of smoke, and Jewett's body charred on one side. The trial Based on the testimony of the women who lived in the brothel, the police arrested 19-year-old Richard P. Robinson on suspicion of Jewett's murder. Robinson, a repeat customer of the victim, flatly denied killing her, and did not display much emotion even when confronted with the still warm corpse. Nevertheless, based on the testimony of various witnesses and the recovery of a cloak that resembled Robinson's, the coroner's jury, hastily assembled on the scene and made up of on-lookers, concluded that Jewett met her end \\"by blows ... inflicted ... with a hatchet by the hand of Richard P. Robinson.\\" This was enough to gain an initial indictment. On June 2, 1836, Robinson's trial for murder began. Ex-D.A. of New York Ogden Hoffman appeared for the defence. After days of testimony from several witnesses, including Rosina Townsend, the judge gave the jury its instructions. As most of the witnesses were other prostitutes, the judge ordered his jury to disregard their testimony. Presented primarily with circumstantial evidence against Robinson, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty in less than a half hour. The press Jewett's murder excited the press and the public. The coverage of the murder and trial was highly polarized, with reporters either sympathizing with Jewett and vilifying Robinson or attacking Jewett as a seductress who deserved her fate. The New York Herald, edited by James Gordon Bennett, Sr., provided the most complete (if not unbiased) coverage of the sensational murder. Almost from the beginning and throughout the trial, Bennett insisted that Robinson was the innocent victim of a vicious conspiracy launched by the police and Jewett's madam. He also emphasized the sensational nature of the story and worked to exploit the sexual, violent details of Jewett's death. The New York Sun, on the other hand, whose readers tended to come from the working class, argued that Robinson was guilty and that he was able to use money and the influence of wealthy relatives and his employer to buy an acquittal. This theory continued to gain traction for many years later.New York Times, 6 August 1899: ‚ÄòGLIMPSE OF OLD NEW YORK: John H. Welsh, Who Has Lived Here Seventy-five Years, Reminiscent.: ...The house Helen Jewett was murdered in, 41 Thomas Street, is standing yet...Richard P. Robinson, who was clerk for Joseph Hoxie at 100 Maiden Lane, was tried for it, but acquitted. He had influential and rich relations and was a leader of the fast set of his day.‚Äô Most notably, the trial was largely responsible for nationwide changes in the approach to sex and scandal coverage by American journalists.Sensationalism and the New York Press / John D. Stevens / New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1991 Prior to the case, coverage of such topics by major newspapers was nearly nonexistent. Additionally, some historians credit Bennett with the first journalistic interview, namely that of Rosina Townsend.The Origins of the Interview. In : Journalism Quarterly 48 / Niles G. Nilsson, pp 101-13, 1971 Other historians, however, argue that Bennett never actually talked to Townsend and that his reported interview was a hoax.Tucher 1994, pp. 35-36. Post trial Personal letters of Robinson's that became public after the trial undercut some of his claims and showed him to be capable of vicious and (for the time) deviant sexual behavior and the public turned against him, including some who had been his vocal supporters. Robinson eventually moved to Texas where he became a respected frontier citizen. References in popular culture Jewett and Robinson are the subject of The Lives of Helen Jewett, And Richard P. Robinson, an 1849 novel by journalist George Wilkes. The novel was originally published in serial form in Wilkes' newspaper the National Police Gazette. This story is a fictionalized narrative based around the stories about Jewett and Robinson that circulated after the murder. Jewett is a character in the novel Burr by Gore Vidal‚Äîbeing the love interest of the narrator. Although her murder is peripheral to the story, it is foreshadowed throughout by the title character's having secured, in a notorious trial at the turn of the century, the acquittal of Levi Weeks, the apparent murderer of Elma Sands.

It is the first part of The Emigrants series.  Plot  The story takes place in the 1840s up to 1850. The first part of the novel describes the hardships faced by rural families in Sweden. Karl Oskar Nilsson and his wife, Kristina, own a farm in Ljuder socken in Sm√•land. They have four children and work hard to make a living, but the poor harvests lead to famine, a catalyst for the beginnings of emigration to the United States in search of a better life. Karl Oskar and his brother Robert want to go, but Kristina doesn't want to leave her home country, knowing that she will never see the rest of their family again. But after the death of their oldest child, she accepts her husband's plans when she realizes that they are in just as much danger from their lives in Sweden as on the big sea and in a New World. They pack up all their belongings and book passage in a group with others from their parish. The characters illustrate some of the motives that prompted people to leave Sweden in the 19th century. The travelers include: * Karl-Oskar, Kristina and their children ‚Äì seeking to escape poverty and famine and finding a place where their work pays off. * Robert, Karl Oskar's adventurous brother ‚Äì landless, as the second son of a farmer whose holdings are too small to sub-divide. He seeks escape from the harsh conditions of being a hired farmhand. * Danjel Andreasson with family, Kristina's maternal uncle, who has been banished from the country due to his religious \\"delusions.\\" The state Lutheran church was very powerful, and dissent, even in the simple form of home Bible study, is not tolerated. They bring their farmhand Arvid, who is a friend of Robert. * Jonas Petter Albrektsson, who seeks to escape from an unhappy marriage at a time when divorce was not possible. * Ulrika of V√§sterg√∂hl, a former prostitute, looking to leave her past behind and start afresh with her daughter Elin. The second part of the book tells how they board the ship in Karlshamn, and then how the life goes on during the ten weeks they spend on board ‚Äì battling sea-sickness and scurvy, travelling across the Atlantic Ocean before finally reaching New York City in midsummer of 1850. The novel ends with the travellers marvelling at the technological wonders of their new home, emblematised in the almost- complete Hudson River Railroad (which would grow into the New York Central) finally opened October 3, 1851.

Written by John Ostrander and comedian Del Close, the series lasted 18 issues.  Publication history  Ostrander and Close had previously worked together on a selection of Munden's Bar backup stories in Ostrander's Grimjack title, published by First Comics. Editor Mike Gold, coming to DC from First, suggested that Ostrander and Close work together again in creating Wasteland.Fiffe, Michel. \\"WASTELAND: The John Ostrander Interview,\\" Factual Opinion (March 6, 2012). Each issue (with the exception of the book-length final issue) consisted of three unrelated stories written by Ostrander and/or Close. For the most part each issue featured a team of four artists, one of whom would illustrate each of the three stories, the fourth supplying that month's cover (which would bear no, or at most only a thematic, connection to the interior contents). Initially, these duties rotated among Don Simpson, David Lloyd, William Messner-Loebs, and George Freeman; by issue 13 Freeman, Lloyd and Loebs had all left the series (though Loebs returned for the last two issues). Later issues featured Bill Wray as a regular and guest artists like Timothy Truman, Joe Orlando and Ty Templeton. In a famous mix-up, issue #5 was originally released with the cover meant for issue #6. Besides bearing the wrong issue number, this meant that Freeman, credited on the cover, didn't actually appear in the initial release of that issue, and also made nonsense of the issue's letter column. Issue #5 was reprinted the following week with the correct cover (by Freeman) and the next month, issue 6 came out with a blank white cover, \\"The Real No. 6\\" where the issue number would normally appear, and a text piece on the inside cover explaining what had happened. Thanks to the blank cover, this was the only issue in which Don Simpson's artwork did not appear, though the cover did carry the usual credit for him.  Overview  For the most part, the series avoided the sort of gory shock associated with the twist ending horror comics typified by Tales from the Crypt and The Twilight Zone television series, in favor of more unpredictable and ambivalent stories. The themes of alienation and psychological dread often occurred, mixed with grotesque black humor, absurdism and social and political commentary in the form of satire. A text page in the first issue mentioned a desire to improve upon what the creators felt didn't work in DC's own House of Mystery, which had twice folded at the time. The stories did not take place in the DC Universe. No established DC characters appeared, and in one story, \\"Paper Hero\\", Captain Marvel was clearly a fictional comic-book character.Ostrander, John and Close, Del, writers; Messner-Loebs, William, artist. \\"Paper Hero,\\" Wasteland #6 (DC Comics, May 1988). The only exceptions came in a story entitled \\"Big Crossover Issue,\\" in which a few DC characters (and another of Ostrander's creations, GrimJack) appeared in a metafictional context;Ostrander, John, and Close, Del, writers; Lloyd, David, art. \\"Big Crossover Issue,\\" Wasteland #5 (DC Comics, April 1988). and in the series' final issue, in which the entire run of the series (including \\"Crossover\\") was \\"rewound\\" to the beginning of the very first story.Ostrander, John, and Close, Del, writers; Simpson, Don, pencils; Wray, Bill, and Messner-Loebs, William, inks. \\"The Casebook of the Dead Detective: '86,'\\" Wasteland #18 (DC Comics, May 1989). Indeed, some stories were clearly meant to take place in the real world. One portrayed the death of H. P. Lovecraft. Another, \\"American Squalor,\\" pastiched the autobiographical comics series American Splendor by Harvey Pekar, with Don Simpson imitating the drawing style of Robert Crumb. This story portrayed a thinly guised version of Pekar in one of his acrimonious appearances on Late Night with David Letterman, in which Pekar had denounced General Electric. Late Night with David Letterman (July 31, 1987). (The narrative was also influenced by a 1961 monologue by Close's comedian colleague Severn Darden.)

Equivalently, a topological space X is a Moore space if the following conditions hold: * Any two distinct points can be separated by neighbourhoods, and any closed set and any point in its complement can be separated by neighbourhoods. (X is a regular Hausdorff space.) * There is a countable collection of open covers of X, such that for any closed set C and any point p in its complement there exists a cover in the collection such that every neighbourhood of p in the cover is disjoint from C. (X is a developable space.) Moore spaces are generally interesting in mathematics because they may be applied to prove interesting metrization theorems. The concept of a Moore space was formulated by R. L. Moore in the earlier part of the 20th century. Examples and properties #Every metrizable space, X, is a Moore space. If {A(n)x} is the open cover of X (indexed by x in X) by all balls of radius 1/n, then the collection of all such open covers as n varies over the positive integers is a development of X. Since all metrizable spaces are normal, all metric spaces are Moore spaces. #Moore spaces are a lot like regular spaces and different from normal spaces in the sense that every subspace of a Moore space is also a Moore space. #The image of a Moore space under an injective, continuous open map is always a Moore space. The image of a regular space under an injective, continuous open map is always regular. #Both examples 2 and 3 suggest that Moore spaces are a lot similar to regular spaces. #Neither the Sorgenfrey line nor the Sorgenfrey plane are Moore spaces because they are normal and not second countable. #The Moore plane (also known as the Niemytski space) is an example of a non- metrizable Moore space. #Every metacompact, separable, normal Moore space is metrizable. This theorem is known as Traylor‚Äôs theorem. #Every locally compact, locally connected space, normal Moore space is metrizable. This theorem was proved by Reed and Zenor. #If 2^{\\\\aleph_0}<2^{\\\\aleph_1}, then every separable normal Moore space is metrizable. This theorem is known as Jones‚Äô theorem. Normal Moore space conjecture For a long time, topologists were trying to prove the so-called normal Moore space conjecture: every normal Moore space is metrizable. This was inspired by the fact that all known Moore spaces that were not metrizable were also not normal. This would have been a nice metrization theorem. There were some nice partial results at first; namely properties 7, 8 and 9 as given in the previous section. Here we see that we drop metacompactness from Traylor's theorem, but at the cost of a set- theoretic assumption. Another example of this is Fleissner's theorem that the axiom of constructibility implies that locally compact, normal Moore spaces are metrizable. On the other hand, under the Continuum hypothesis (CH) and also under Martin's Axiom and not CH, there are several examples of non- metrizable normal Moore spaces. Nyikos proved that, under the so-called PMEA (Product Measure Extension Axiom), which needs a large cardinal, all normal Moore spaces are metrizable. Finally, it was shown later that any model of ZFC in which the conjecture holds, implies the existence of a model with a large cardinal. So large cardinals are needed essentially. gave an example of a pseudonormal Moore space that is not metrizable, so the conjecture cannot be weakened in this way. Moore himself proved the theorem that a collectionwise normal Moore space is metrizable, so strengthening normality is another way to settle the matter. References * Lynn Arthur Steen and J.

The school serves students from overseas and Indian students who plan to do their post-primary education overseas. The school is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) and the Council of International Schools (CIS). The Elementary School accepts students between the ages of 3 and 11 years of age. The Secondary School includes Grades 6 - 12, and is divided between the Middle School and the High School. Students in Grades 9 and 10 generally study the curriculum of the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) Cambridge Examination. Students in Grades 11 and 12 generally study the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), although ISH also offers its own independent program, the ISH Diploma Programme (ISHDP). The student body consists of about 400 students from over 23 nationalities, the majority being U.S. citizens. ISH focuses on preparing students for university abroad and most graduates attend universities in the North America and Great Britain. At present, the teaching faculty includes teachers from 9 nationalities. History The school was established by a group of parents in 1972. In 1982 the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) received permission to operate a school to provide education for children of expatriates and Indians from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It also became its major sponsor, funding the purpose-built school on the former site of the ICRISAT Staff Recreation Club in the Banjara Hills area of the city. As the student body grew in size, the Principal and board constructed a new group of buildings on the ICRISAT campus in Patancheru, on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The Secondary School moved into the new building in 2007. Construction on a new canteen was completed in 2009. In 2009, construction began on two new buildings: a building to house the Elementary School and a building to house Administration (such as Admissions, Finance, Purchasing, Administrators and School Nurse).  Academics  ISH provides a range of curriculums. The elementary school curriculum is developed and internally certified by the Council of International School (CIS) and the New England Association of Schools (NEASC). The middle school curriculum is an amalgamation of different teaching practices to ensure proper education, physical, and mental growth. ISH is a certified center for Cambridge International Examinations (CIE), a part of the prestigious University of Cambridge in the UK. CIE oversees the curriculum in Grade 9 and Grade 10 leading to the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE). IGCSE provides a strong foundation for higher level further education courses like the International Baccalaureate and is recognized by schools and universities around the world. ISH offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) for its grade 11 and 12. It is the most widely recognized international qualification for university. A good performance in the IBDP generally improves a student‚Äôs competitiveness for admission to universities around the world, Some universities also offer credits for college level courses if students achieve certain scores on the IBDP. ISH also has an independent diploma programme (ISHDP).  Campus Features and Facilities  The core campus of the school occupies 5 acres within a 3600-acre secondary campus that is owned by ICRISAT. Its location on the ICRISAT campus enables ISH to have access to other learning environments that the ICRISAT campus can offer. The elementary and secondary schools each have their own buildings. Each building houses a library, music rooms, laboratories, computer rooms, language rooms, and playground. ISH offers a wide variety of sports facilities. The school has the best sports facilities in Hyderabad. ISH has a multipurpose hall (gymnasium), two outdoor basketball courts, four outdoor grass courts for other sports, and has access to a 25 meter pool. This allows ISH to hold annual Sports Days along with practices to take part in competitions such as TAISI. Link to ICRISAT ICRISAT continues to play a role in supporting and helping to develop the school and its facilities. The formal responsibility of managing the School lies with the Director General of ICRISAT. The Director General has delegated this responsibility to the Principal and the Special Advisor to the Director General of ICRISAT for Educational Affairs.

History According to Tertullian, as quoted by Saint Jerome, in year 92, St John the Evangelist survived martyrdom at Rome under the Emperor Domitian by being immersed in a vat of boiling oil, from which he emerged unharmed. He was later exiled to island of Patmos. This event was traditionally said to have occurred at the Latin Gate (located on the southern portion of the Roman wall). The nearby chapel of San Giovanni in Oleo is said to be on this very spot. The event was referred to in the Roman Martyrology, which was begun in the seventh century, when already there was a celebration of the event. A feast in the Roman calendar also celebrated the event until 1960, when Pope John XXIII removed most second feasts of a single saint.See General Roman Calendar of 1960 The tradition for the building of the Basilica of St. John at the Latin Gate places its construction during the pontificate of Pope Gelasius I (492‚Äì496). This is consistent with the oldest of the roof tiles, which have the imprint of a taxation stamp for the Ostrogoth King and ruler of Italy Theodoric the Great (reigned 493‚Äì526). One of these ancient roof tiles is now used in the Basilica as a lectern. Entrance to the adjacent Collegio Rosmini In the 8th century, the Basilica was restored by Pope Adrian I, and later the bell-tower and portico were added, and at the end of the 12th century the Basilica was reconsecrated by Pope Celestine III. In the 16th and 17th centuries, a Baroque ceiling and other Baroque features were added to the interior. In the years 1940‚Äì1941, the Baroque features were removed and the Basilica was returned to a more primitive simplicity. This last renovation was carried out by the Rosminian Fathers, who, in 1938, were given care of the Basilica and the nearby building, where they opened the Collegio Missionario Antonio Rosmini which houses their International House of Studies. This church is notable for having been the location of one of the earliest documented same-sex weddings in western Europe. Michel de Montaigne, a French philosopher and prominent essayist of the 16th century, noted in his journal that, > On my return from Saint Peter's I met a man who informed me...that on this > same day [March 18, 1581] the [Holy Week] station was at San Giovanni Porta > Latina, in which church a few years before certain Portuguese had entered > into a strange brotherhood. They married one another, male to male, at Mass, > with the same ceremonies with which we perform our marriages, read the same > marriage gospel service, and then went to bed and lived together. The Roman > wits said that because in the other conjunction, of male and female, this > circumstance of marriage alone makes it legitimate, it had seemed to these > sharp folk that this other action would become equally legitimate if they > authorized it with ceremonies and mysteries of the Church. Description The entrance to the Basilica is fronted by a small square with an 8th-century well-head, nearly reproducing the aspect of the Basilica that would have been seen at the reconsecration by Pope Celestine III in the 12th century. The portico (or porch) of the Basilica is supported by four re-used classical columns (each of a different marble) supporting five arches. The main door is framed with a simple mosaic of red and green porphyry. The well- head, from the time of Pope Adrian I, has a double row circular design around its barrel and a Latin inscription completely around its crown: :IN NOMINE PAT[RIS] ET FILII ET SPI[RITUS SANT]I \\"In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\\" and a quote from the Prophet Isaiah: :OMN[E]S SITIE[NTES VENITE AD AQUAS] \\"All you who are thirsty come to the water\\" and the name of the stone-carver: :EGO STEFANUS \\"I Stephen\\". The interior of the Basilica is divided into three naves, divided by two rows of columns on which rest semi-circular arches. The two columns closest to the sanctuary are of white marble with deep fluting. The other columns are of various types of marble and granite, capped with a diverse collection of Ionic capitals. The central nave terminates with a half-hexagon apse. Each of the three sides of the apse opens with a large window filled with honey-coloured onyx. Occupying the ledge of the central window is a carved wooden crucifixion scene including Saint John the Evangelist and the Blessed Virgin Mary. In front of the altar is a mosaic pavement in Cosmatesque style. The geometric pattern of red and green porphyry is framed in white marble (as well are reused fragments of white marble with Latin lettering) is thought to have been created before the 12th century. Inserted in the front step of the altar, is the titulus of the basilica, of ancient origin, discovered during the renovations of 1940: :TIT. S. IOANNIS ANTE PORTAM LA[TINAM] In the years 1913‚Äì1915, then recently discovered frescoes were restored of above the main altar. After this work, another search of the along the face of the central nave revealed the presence of a full circle of medieval frescoes. The restoration of these frescos was completed with the full restoration of the Basilica in 1940‚Äì1941. The central nave is decorated with about 50 scenes representing the Old and New Testaments, from the creation of the world to the glorious apocalypse of the New Jerusalem. The frescoes were executed by several artists under the direction of one master.

He was born in New York City, the fourth of eight children of John Bigelow, lawyer, statesman, and co-owner of the New York Evening Post, and his wife Jane Tunis Poultney.Bigelow, Patricia, The Bigelow Family Genealogy, the Bigelow Society, Flint, Michigan, 1986, vol II, p. 224; #16312.74. In 1861, at the beginning of the Civil War, when Bigelow was six years old, his father was appointed United States consul in Paris, and subsequently (1865) Minister to France, and Poultney was sent to a Potsdam preparatory school. While there he became a friend of Prince Wilhelm and his younger brother, Prince Henry, playing \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" with them in the schoolyard. His friendship and correspondence with the Kaiser continued throughout their lives, though their relations became somewhat more reserved just before World War I as a result of some of the opinions expressed in Bigelow's articles. For a time, Bigelow was an admirer of both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini ‚Äî an admiration which ended when they demonstrated their violent natures. Bigelow entered Yale College in 1873. For reasons of health, he took a two-year leave from studies, sailing for the Orient, which left him shipwrecked off the coast of Japan. He returned to Yale and graduated in 1879. He obtained a law degree from Columbia Law School and practiced briefly. His chief occupation from the 1880s till his retirement in 1906 was as an author and journalist. He traveled extensively, and wrote often on the subject. He was a London correspondent for several American publications and was correspondent for The Times (of London) in Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He was a voluminous correspondent with the leading figures of the day, including Roger Casement, Henry George, Mark Twain, Geraldine Farrar, Percy Grainger, Frederic Remington, Kaiser Wilhelm II, Israel Zangwill and George S. Viereck. He was the author of eleven books, including a two-volume autobiography, and several on history and colonial administration. He founded the first American magazine devoted to amateur sports, Outing, in 1885. Bigelow married twice. His first wife, with whom he had three daughters, was Edith Evelyn Joffrey (Jaffray)[1889 NY Social Register]. They married 16 April 1884, and divorced in 1902. His second wife, Lillian Pritchard, was a librarian in the library founded by John Bigelow at Malden. She died on 1 December 1932. He retired to his family's home at Malden-on-Hudson. In 1930, at the age of 74, he noted that \\"it's hell to live so long\\", but still made annual trips to visit the former Kaiser at Doorn. He entered the Dale Sanitarium on 14 January 1954, where he died at the age of 98, at which time he was Yale's oldest alumnus, and the oldest member of the Athenaeum of London. Panama Canal controversy In January 1906, Poultney Bigelow published an article in The Independent (New York City) describing neglect and mismanagement in the isthmus of Panama related to the building of the Panama Canal. There was a heated and immediate response from then Secretary of War William Howard Taft, as well as a significant back and forth in the press. Bigelow was subpoenaed to appear before the Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals on Jan 18 1906. In Nov 1906 Theodore Roosevelt visited Panama, where he was to make an investigation of labor conditions in particular. Asked about Bigelow's criticisms, Roosevelt was dismissive, stating, \\"in every large work there was always someone to find something that was not done as it should have been; but the employees should on no account pay attention to such criticisms, as the critics would sink out of sight, while the work (...) would remain long after all criticism had been forgotten.‚Äù Although dismissed by Taft and Roosevelt, several historians have suggested that Bigelow's article was instrumental in Roosevelt visiting the canal, the first time a US President had traveled outside the US during the presidency, and to ultimately improve working conditions at the canal project.

WCED broadcasts with a power output of 5,000 watts non-directional day and 5 watts at night using a two-tower directional antenna system. WCED and its FM sister station WDSN are owned and operated by Priority Communications of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. History For much of its existence, WCED was the sister station of FM station WOWQ, also licensed to DuBois, which had a country music format and was known by the moniker Q102. The stations were owned by Derrick Publishing, of Oil City, Pennsylvania, which did business as Tri-County Broadcasting and also published the Oil City Derrick newspaper. WCED became known for its full-service approach to local programming for both DuBois and the tri-county area, which includes Clearfield, Jefferson, and Elk counties. It also became the local radio outlet for ABC News, airing Paul Harvey and other full-service network program offerings. The station also offered music formats such as CHR, oldies, nostalgia, and some talk, but the station would go to a news and talk format after its sale to Priority Communications. WCED and WOWQ were among the first stations in the country to use computer-based hard-disk audio storage technology in the early 1990s. In 1999, both stations were sold to Vox Media. Vox sold WOWQ to First Media and then WCED in 2003 to Priority Communications, which had been operating competitor WDSN since its first air date on February 14, 1990. First Media had been operating WCED under an LMA, but had no interest in owning it. WCED moved to a new, nearby building and vacated the former DuBois Lumber Company office building after the sale to Priority. The purchase price for WCED was $150,000, according to FCC records. In 2003, WCED moved from 80 North Park Place to 51 West Long Avenue in DuBois, where it shared space with WDSN temporarily until a new facility conducive to a news/talk formatted radio station could be found. Priority Communications negotiated a deal for an old bank building at 12 West Long Avenue, down the street from its original location. Both stations were moved into the new, state-of-the-art facility by the end of 2004. Operations Although WCED is licensed to DuBois, the transmitter is located in the Falls Creek/Washington Twp area of Jefferson County. The station utilizes translators on 96.7 in Rockton (as W244CH) and 107.9 FM in DuBois (as W300BR) to extend the coverage. The station operates a two tower array, but for years before, operated with three towers. One tower collapsed due to high winds in a March 2005 storm and was not replaced. The phasors and feed system were modified, and the nighttime power level was significantly reduced from the original 500 watts. It now radiates a cardioid pattern into the DuBois local area only at night, while continuing to operate daytime-non-directional at the rated 5,000 watts. Programming Originally billed as News Talk Radio WCED, the station airs local and syndicated talk programming during the daytime hours and Fox Sports Radio during the evening hours. While the program offerings are relatively the same, the station now acknowledges its FM translators at 96.7 and 107.9, and puts them at the forefront of all marketing efforts, hence the new moniker \\"Connect FM\\". Morning News airs Monday through Friday for three hours. The lineup of syndicated talk show hosts includes Jim Bohannon, Bob Brinker, Dr. Joy Browne, Bill Cunningham, Mike Gallagher, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Dennis Prager, and Dave Ramsey.

WDSN broadcasts at the assigned frequency of 106.5 MHz at an effective radiated power of 3,000 Watts. WDSN and its AM sister station, WCED, are owned and operated by Priority Communications of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. History This station was first assigned the call letters WDDH, the last three as the initials of Elk County industrialist Dennis Heindl, who had applied for the construction permit in his wife Paula's name in the late 1980s. Heindl, who had owned WLMI in Kane, sold both WLMI and the construction permit for WDDH to separate owners. WLMI came under the control of a new owner in 1989, and the WDDH construction permit was sold in 1990 to Pittsburgh radio entrepreneur Jay Phillipone, who would build a small empire out of Priority Communications for himself with this station as his flagship, as he acquired more properties over the years. WDSN first began broadcasting on 99.5 FM from studios on West Long Avenue in DuBois. It later moved to 106.5 as part of a strategic move to accommodate another station (WKQL 103.3 FM) to go on the air in Brookville, about ten miles west of Reynoldsville. WDSN acquired an AM station, WCED, in 2003 from Vox Media. WCED joined its new FM sister at 51 West Long Avenue in downtown DuBois. Needing more room to better accommodate a News/Talk formatted radio station, WDSN and WCED moved across and down the street to a former bank building at 12 West Long Avenue, where they continue to operate today. The station operated a translator in Punxsutawney on 94.7 FM (W234AV, Now simulcasting WEIR). They also operated a translator on 105.9 (W290BO) in Brookville, PA. As of November 10, 2011 a different translator frequency was applied for, it is 98.7 for Brookville. It is operational, and 105.9 is dark.

It is sited at a crossing point of the River Esk, in Eskdale which is within the North York Moors National Park. It is by road from the nearest town of Whitby, and approximately from both Middlesbrough and Scarborough. The village is typical of those found all across the North York Moors which straddle the main through-routes along the valley bottoms. It is mostly built of local stone with pantiled or slate roofs. Settlement around modern-day Lealholm can be traced back to the Domesday Book of 1086, with entries concerning the Manor of Crumbeclive and \\"Lelum\\" at the site of Lealholm Hall, Lealholmside. Lealholmside is a hamlet by Lealholm, and was a popular location with the photographer Francis Meadow Sutcliffe. A honeypot during the summer months, Lealholm is located midway along the Esk valley between the villages of Glaisdale, to the east and Danby to the west. Lealholm is on the route of the Esk valley railway line, which runs from Whitby to Middlesbrough, and is served by Lealholm railway station. A large part of the community is involved in farming due to the high fertility of the slopes in Eskdale, whilst other members of the community are involved in tourism or commute to industrial centres such as Middlesbrough. This led to the economy of the area being hard hit by the 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis. Lealhom was a place of affection for Irish-born poet John Castillo, who wrote \\"Ah lovely Lealholm! Where shall I begin. To say what thou art now and once hast been?\\". History Former Water Mill St. James the Greater Methodist Chapel The origins of this community stretch back to a period when farming and the movement of stock was almost exclusively the main source of activity. Lealholm was a convenient place for travellers to cross the River Esk. People set up residence here in the hope and expectation of earning a living from such travellers. The etymology of the Lealholm name is uncertain but \\"l«£l\\" was the word for a willow twig or withy in the Old English language and holm was a settlement, thus the settlement by or near the willow trees. At the time of the Domesday survey, the site of the current village was heavily wooded, but with five charcoal-hungry iron smelting furnaces operating at the manor by 1274 A.D, the valley floor was cleared quickly of trees enabling drainage, cultivation and settlement of the land. Fulling mills, hostelries and other traders set up bases around this river crossing and thereby formed the nucleus of today's village centre. Until the middle of the 19th century Lealholm was the main centre of the parish of Glaisdale and many of the parish offices and functions were administered from here. Lealholm was home to at least one mill for centuries, and the earliest records show a water mill located within the village in 1336 belonging to the Lord of the Manor, William le Latimer, 3rd Baron of Danby. As the mill was fed by the small Cow Beck, water could have been in short supply during dry summer months, and by 1709 it was demolished. A Quaker, Thomas Whatson, built a new mill on the old site, constructing a long mill-race from Crunkly Ghyll through the village to join Cow Beck. The mill-race now forms the boundary of the cricket pitch surrounding it on most sides as it passes the mill. The mill owners had the authority to clean and remove any woodland, earth or rubbish within of the mill-race. Also, \\"all persons that shall grind corn and grain at the mill\\" had the right \\"to sieve and sift on two parcels of ground called Adam Rigg and Ellergates\\". Thus, the outcrop of hillside rising towards the station became known as Oatmeal Hill. When the semi-detached houses at 3 and 4 Railway Cottages were purchased 1970, they were combined and the building became known as \\"Oatmill Cottage\\". The village also had a paper mill, which employed up to 20 people in its heyday. The site is now a garden centre, known as \\"Poet's Cottage\\" after John Castillo, who lived in a cottage on the site, now demolished. In more recent times, a mill, owned by the Nelson family, was used as the village hall, and became known as Nelson Hall. In the late 1980s it was sold and converted into a house. The historic Shepherds Hall was built in 1873 and was a meeting place for the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds Friendly Society. It is a unique building housing a tea rooms and riverside tea gardens. The way of life in the village changed little over the centuries as the farming was always the mixed inbyland and open moors system. Village craftsmen such as blacksmiths and joiners provided for the needs of their own farming community and combined their specialist skills with subsistence farming. An 1823 trade directory lists 17 farmers, four shoemakers, three corn millers, two blacksmiths, two butchers, two victuallers (one also a tallow chandler), a tailor, a wheelwright, and a \\"blue, brown, and shop paper manufacturer\\" in Lealholm. The Industrial Revolution absorbed some of the local population as the nearby boom town of Middlesbrough expanded its iron and steel industry but essentially, in this remote area, the farming economy survived until after the Second World War and the mechanisation of agriculture. Despite Queen Elizabeth I's Penal laws, Catholicism flourished across many parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire during the 1600s, thanks to the support of local gentry and priests such as Fr. Nicholas Postgate. Today, Catholic churches are sited at both Lealholm and Egton Bridge along the Esk Valley. On Friday 27 April 1979, an USAF Phantom aircraft from Alconbury was performing low level tactical reconnaissance over the North York Moors when the engine stalled. The aircraft banked left, striking the ground to the west of Lealholmside before cartwheeling in a fireball across fields for almost half a mile below the houses. Pilot Major Donald Lee Schuyler and Navigator Lt Thomas Wheeler were killed in the crash. It is believed that the crew carefully guided the stricken craft away from the village where the local primary school was full of children, who began classes just half an hour before the accident. A memorial stone, erected by villagers, stands on the site of the crash alongside the road between Lealholm and Lealholmside. Governance Lealhom's first tier of local government is Glaisdale Parish Council, where Lealholm ward elects three of the seven councillors, the others representing Glaisdale ward. Unusually, the two wards are represented separately at the next tier of government, the borough (non- metropolitan district). Lealholm is in the non-metropolitan district of Scarborough, within which it is in the Danby ward, represented as of May 2008 by one Conservative councillor. It is in North Yorkshire non-metropolitan county, within which it is in the Esk Valley electoral district, represented as of May 2008 by one Conservative councillor. Lealholm is in the Scarborough and Whitby parliamentary constituency, currently represented by Conservative Robert Goodwill, who won the seat from Labour in 2005. It is in the European constituency of Yorkshire and the Humber, represented since 2004 by two Labour, two Conservative, one Liberal Democrat and one UKIP MEPs. Geography Lealholm and Lealholmside View across to Crunkly Ghyll Steppingstones across the Esk At the head of the village stands the woodland and steep sided valley of Crunkly Ghyll, a ravine carved by the River Esk through the hillside where the river drops from the valley above to reach the village. It was formed during the last great ice age as a huge wall of ice moved across the landscape carving out what is now the Esk Valley as far as Lealholm. At its head it formed a massive dam blocking the flow of water from above and creating a lake running back up the valley to Commondale. As the ice melted, the river forced its way out carving the present-day ravine. The main village of Lealholm is situated at the bottom of Crunkly Ghyll (sometimes spelled \\"Crunkley\\" and \\"Gill\\"), a deep cutting where the river emerges into the flat bottom of a glacial U-shaped valley. This was crucial to its development as a settlement, becoming an important crossing point over the River Esk where the valley flattens out, becoming shallow at end of a sharp bend in the river before slowing to a deeper meandering course further downstream. The remains of the fording point are still visible next to the arched bridge used today, which dates back to the 17th century. Three roads lead from the centre of the village, one follows the river up the valley towards Danby; the second heads north past the hamlet of Lealholmside and across the moors towards Whitby; and the third leads south, towards Fryup and Rosedale. Typical of the area are the medieval cruck-built longhouses of Lealholm. These were constructed as single storey combined dwelling and beast houses and made of the local Jurassic limestone. Originally they had ling thatched roofs, but they were mostly re-roofed in the 19th century with slate or pantiles. Despite having less than 50 houses within the boundaries of the main settlement, Lealholm has a selection of amenities, including a village shop, post office, petrol station and farm goods store. It also has the Forge Art Gallery (formerly a pottery), an Infant and Primary School, a cricket and football pitch, and three churches. The historic Shepherds Hall housing a tea rooms and riverside tea gardens. A village green, where the local team play quoits, sits alongside the river. The Ley Hall is the venue for public gatherings. It is used for the local playgroup, young farmers, the parish council and the WI among others. The Board Inn public house - a former coaching inn. \\\\- dates from the 18th century, and as the only public house in the village and it is a popular venue and regularly holds domino drives. Lealholm is in the Anglican parish of Glaisdale, within the deanery of Whitby, the Archdeaconry of Cleveland, and the Diocese of York. There are three churches located within the main settlement, the Roman Catholic church of \\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart\\", the Church of England church of St James the Greater, and a Methodist Chapel. Close to the chapel, between the River Esk and the mill race stands a Quaker Friends Burial Ground, donated by Thomas Whatson. =Climate= As part of the United Kingdom, the North York Moors area, in which Lealholm lies, generally has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary from day to day as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. The temperature is usually lower at night and January is the coldest time of the year. The two dominant influences on the climate of Lealholm are the shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the higher ground and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, chilly springs and cool summers are a feature of the area but there are often spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring mists or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the area. Within the area variations in climate are brought about by local differences in altitude, aspect and shelter. Snowfall is variable from year to year. Heavy falls are associated with north-easterly winds off the North Sea. =River Esk= The River Esk dog-legs through the village. In the centre stands the bridge which crosses the Esk a few yards south of the old fording point. further upstream lies a set of stepping stones. Between these two the river becomes very deep as it bends sharply to the right. Due to its proximity to the river Esk and its tributaries, flooding has long been a problem for some of the lower lying houses in the village. Marks carved into the side wall of the Methodist chapel show the heights of floods in the past. At the lowest level, the floods in November 2000 stand just short of the floods in July 1840. However, these were low compared to major flooding on 23 July 1930 when the Methodist chapel stood more than a metre under water, even though the chapel itself stands approximately above the normal water level of the river. This same flood caused the collapse of bridges over the river at Glaisdale, Egton and Sleights, further down the valley. =Lealholmside= Overlooking the village stands the hamlet of Lealholmside - a row of approximately 25 houses running along the side of the valley. It was a popular location with the photographer Francis Meadow Sutcliffe, who took many pictures in the area, although few of the village itself are in publication. It is here that the site of Lelum was located, at or near the present site of Lealholm Hall and home to the de Lelum family in 1274. Demography Figures for the population of Lealholm alone are not readily available. The population of the parish of Glaisdale (including settlements of Glaisdale, Houlsyke, Lealholm and Street) was 974 living in 404 households in the UK 2001 Census. Of this number, 73% live in the 1% of the area which is classified as \\"urban\\", while 27% of the population lives in the 99% \\"rural\\" area. At the 2011 Census, figures for the E00141687 output area, which includes all of Lealholm as well as Houlsyke and a large rural area, indicated a population of 383. Economy Produce on Display Lealholm remained a traditional, labour-intensive, mixed farming community until the 1970s. In the second half of twentieth century increasing mechanization of farming operations led to a rapid decline of employment opportunities in agriculture in the surrounding area. However, the rise in the ownership of cars brought tourism into the North York Moors area and the village is a tourist honeypot in the summer months. Employment in tourism has risen rapidly and the village now has guest houses, holiday cottages, bed and breakfast accommodation and catering establishments providing jobs and income along with services and retailers. Lealholm had a typical NER goods shed and coal yard close to the railway station, which became a factory base when the company Lightspeed panels were set up in 1972. They produced the Magenta kit car, a fiberglass body kit based on an MG 1100. Today the site is a car repair garage. Culture and community Lealholm Show Sports Duck Race There is a choir based in Lealholm which performs at venues in the surrounding area. The Board Inn is the base for the village football and cricket teams as well as hosting dominoes and darts matches. The River Esk is used for angling, with salmon and sea trout being caught in abundance. Lealholm Village Show and sports day is held by the Lealholm Farm Produce and Horticultural Society on the first Saturday in September. The show, known as the Lealholm Agricultural Show, takes place on the village sports field, usually reserved for cricket during the summer months, and football during winter. It held its 87th show in 2007. There was no show in 1970, and in 2001 the organisers decided it would be inappropriate to hold the show due to the Foot and mouth outbreak. In 2008, the show was cancelled for the first time in its history. Due to bad weather, the cricket pitch became waterlogged after weeks of heavy rain and a torrential downpour in the days leading up to the show. The show has over 200 exhibitions of crafts, wine making, fruit, vegetables and farm produce for competition including categories for children. Children's sports and a fancy dress parade are held on the cricket pitch and are always well supported, although there usually has to be a lot of persuasion for entries into the adult's \\"Twice round the field\\" competition. Side stalls include \\"Bowl for a Goose\\", where competitors attempt to bowl five balls through holes in a frame at the end of a short but bumpy pitch. The winner can take home a live goose, have it delivered for Christmas or receive a cash prize. In the past few years the village show has been expanded to feature displays of steam engines, fire safety and brass band performances, demonstrations by St John Ambulance and a bouncy castle. Entries to the show's various competitions are made during the morning ready for judging prior to the show opening to the public in the afternoon. A Domino Drive in aid of show funds is usually held the Thursday evening following the village show at the Board Inn public house in the village. The biggest event of the afternoon is the Grand Duck Race on the River Esk, where 1,000 numbered plastic ducks are launched along the river towards a finishing point some downstream. The six fastest ducks are then picked out at the finishing line to win cash prizes. The ducks are launched from the top of the village bridge. Media The Esk Valley is served by local newspaper The Whitby Gazette, published on a Tuesday and Friday, as well as the Middlesbrough & Teesside based daily - The Evening Gazette. Despite being located in North Yorkshire, Lealholm's location at the bottom of the valley prevents BBC Local Radio transmissions broadcast by Radio York, which serves the rest of the region, being received. Instead, local radio broadcast service is relayed on BBC Tees from Bilsdale to the south-west. Due to the same geographic restrictions, regional terrestrial television is provided by Tyne Tees Television and BBC North East and Cumbria from Newcastle upon Tyne. Digital radio stations and digital television channels are also broadcast from Bilsdale but reception is often difficult also due to the village's geography. Reception of television for most houses in the bottom of the valley comes from the Limber Hill relay transmitter, between Egton and Glaisdale further down the valley. Independent Local Radio is provided from Bilsdale by TFM, Capital North East and Heart North East. Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire Coast is also available locally; broadcast from Scarborough via the Whitby transmitter. Education The non-denominational Lealholm Primary School educates children from the age of five until they leave at the age of eleven. In 2008 there were 52 pupils at the school, including 20 infants. The school received one outstanding and four other good grades in its 2013 Ofsted inspection report. Older pupils travel to secondary schools and a college in Whitby. Notable people John Castillo (1792‚Äì1845), poet and lay preacher, often referred to as \\"The Bard of the Dales\\", lived in Lealholm on the site now known as \\"Poets Cottage\\", which today operates as a plant nursery. John Davidson (1889‚Äì1988), \\"The Chronicler of Lealholm\\", chronicled the history of the village in books and correspondence in the Whitby Gazette. He was a shipbroker originally from Stockton-on-Tees, who held a great deal of affection for the village and carried out much research on the area. His published books include The Manor, Lordship and Castle of Danby and Chronicles of Lealholm & Glaisdale. The books are out of print, but his painstaking research has been much copied and there are various publications in print today covering the history of the village.

The magazine was founded by the actor and playwright H. J. Byron in competition with Punch magazine. Fun ceased publication in 1901, when it was absorbed into Sketchy Bits. Description Caricature of Darwin contemplating a bustle, from Fun, 16th Nov, 1872 Like Punch, the journal published satiric verse and parodies, as well as political and literary criticism, sports and travel information. These were often illustrated or accompanied by topical cartoons (often of a political nature). The Punch mascot, Mr. Punch, and his dog Toby were lampooned by Fun's jester, Mr. Fun, and his cat.Fun (1861‚Äì1901), Bodleian Library, accessed 21 July 2012 The magazine was aimed at a well- educated readership interested in politics, literature, and theatre.Vann, J. Don, \\"Comic Periodicals,\\" in Victorian Periodicals & Victorian Society (Aldershot: Scholar Press, 1994), pp. 284-5) Fun was sold for a penny and was sometimes characterised as a 'poor man's Punch'. Thackeray called it \\"Funch\\".Sullivan, Alvin, British Literary Magazines: The Victorian and Edwardian Age, 1837-1913 (London: Greenwood Press, 1984), p. 135) Fun silenced its critics by publishing lively fare, whereas Punch was criticised as dull and tired. One area in which Fun clearly bested its rival was in its close connection to popular theatre. Byron and his successor as editor, Tom Hood, the son of the first Punch contributor, assembled a vivacious, bohemian and progressive staff. Notable contributors included playwrights Tom Robertson, Hood, Clement Scott, F. C. Burnand (who defected to Punch in 1862), satirist Ambrose Bierce, G. R. Sims and especially W. S. Gilbert, whose Bab Ballads were almost all published in its pages, among other articles, poems, illustrations and drama criticism over a ten-year period., p.11 Cartoonists included Arthur Boyd Houghton, Matt Morgan and James Francis Sullivan (1852‚Äì1936). The Fun gang frequented the Arundel Club, the Savage Club, and especially Evans's caf√©, where they had a table in competition with the Punch 'Round table'.See Schoch, Richard, Performing Bohemia (2004) (accessed March 13, 2007). See also Tom Robertson's play Society, which fictionalised the evenings in Evans's caf√© in one scene. Even though Fun was seen as liberal in comparison with the increasingly conservative Punch, it could cast satirical scorn or praise on either side of the political spectrum. For instance, Disraeli, whose unorthodox character and ethnic lineage made him a popular focus of attack, was praised in the magazine, including for his Reform Bill of 1867. History Byron ceded the editorship of the paper to Hood in 1865 and sold Fun to engravers and publishers George and Edward Dalziel in 1870, who had previously engraved drawings for Punch. Two years later they transferred it to their nephew Gilbert Dalziel (1853‚Äì1930). After the death of Hood and the end of contributions from Gilbert by 1874, the quality of the content began a slow decline. During the 1870s, the circulation of Fun is estimated at 20,000, compared with Punch's 40,000.Ellegard, Alvar, \\"The Readership of the Periodical Press in Mid-Victorian Britain,\\" in Victorian Periodicals Newsletter, 3 (September, 1971), p. 20) Hood was succeeded as editor by Henry Sampson until 1878, and then the editorship devolved to Charles Dalziel.Publisher and editor data In 1893, the Dalziels withdrew from the journal.

Overseas, his compositions have been presented in New Zealand, Germany, France, Austria, the UK, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United States, Japan, Malaysia, Canada and Thailand, and have been featured at such key events as the 1994 and 2000 Gaudeamus Music WeeksMuziek Centrum Nederland in Amsterdam, the 1997 ISCM Festival in Copenhagen and the 1998 Paris Composers Rostrum. His music often displays influences of popular music styles within a classical music context, and, as a result, musical elements such as driving repeated rhythms and high dynamic levels are typically found in his works. Indeed, directness and immediacy are common features in much of his music. One of his most notable works, Speed (1996), was thought by some to be inspired by the 1994 hit film Speed; however, Hindson has denied this connection. In 1999 Hindson was the attached composer to the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Works written during this attachment include Boom-Box and In Memoriam: Amplified Cello Concerto (the latter was subsequently nominated for an APRA-AMC award for Best Orchestral Work of 2001). He was also the attached composer with the Sydney Youth Orchestra in the same year, for which he was commissioned to write a violin concerto. In 2002 he was the featured composer with Musica Viva Australia for which he has written a number of new commissions for Kristjan J√§rvi's Absolute Ensemble, baroque violinist Andrew Manze, the Australian oboist Diana Doherty and the Belcea String Quartet, and Duo Sol. In May 2002, the Sydney Dance Company toured Australia to much acclaim with a new 90-minute production, Ellipse, choreographed by their Artistic Director, Graeme Murphy, and danced entirely to Hindson's music. Playing to packed houses, it broke box-office records for the SDC. They toured it to the US in 2004. In September 2003, Hindson was a featured composer at the Vale of Glamorgan Festival in Wales, during which fourteen of his works were performed by a variety of ensembles. He was the attached composer to The Queensland Orchestra in 2003/2004, one result of which was his Percussion Concerto, written for Dame Evelyn Glennie and premiered in Brisbane in 2006. In addition, his music was set to a full-evening dance presentation by Ballett Schindowski in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, in January 2004. Other compositions include two works for the Orchestras of Australia Network, a flute concerto entitled House Music for American flautist Marina Piccinini, premiered with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in December 2006, a Concerto for Two Pianos written for Pascal and Ami Rog√©, and two ballets commissioned by Birmingham Royal Ballet for David Bintley. Matthew Hindson's music is published by Faber Music (UK). A disc of three of his orchestral pieces was recorded by Trust Records with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and released in August 2008. As well as working as a composer, Hindson lectures in the Arts Music Unit and is Associate Professor and Chair of Composition at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. He has recently co-authored a book entitled \\"Music Composition Toolbox\\", published by Science Press. Hindson is the artistic director of the Aurora Festival, a new festival of contemporary music based in Western Sydney which premiered in April 2006. Honours Matthew Hindson was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2006, for \\"service to the arts as a leading Australian composer and teacher of music, and through the wide promotion of

She served in the 13th Destroyer Flotilla of the Grand Fleet and was sunk on 31 May 1916 at the Battle of Jutland. The Wreck is designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 Battle of Jutland Nestor took part in an attack upon the German battlecruiser squadron commanded by Admiral Franz von Hipper, which was engaged by the British battlecruiser squadron under Admiral David Beatty at the start of the battle of Jutland. Twelve destroyers were despatched to approach the line of German battlecruisers and attack with torpedoes. Nestor was lead ship in the attack, followed immediately by . The attack was met part-way to their target by a German destroyer squadron which exchanged fire as the ships passed. The German battlecruisers turned away, so Nestor also turned back towards the British battlecruisers. However, it now became clear the German battlecruisers had altered course to align with the main German High Seas Fleet, which was now just visible. Accompanied by and , Nestor approached to 3000 yards of the battleships, receiving increasing fire as more German ships brought guns to bear on the destroyers. Nestor was hit and disabled, requiring Nicator to veer off at the last minute from firing its torpedoes so as to avoid a collision. Nicator then broke off and returned to the British squadron. Nestor and Nomad, both disabled after their attack on the battlecruisers, were left to face the approach of the entire German battle fleet. The two ships fired their remaining torpedoes at the approaching enemy, before inevitably being sunk. Nomad was closest, so was attacked first and sank after a few minutes receiving fire. Her surviving crew were picked up by German ships. Commander Edward Bingham ordered all charts and confidential books to be destroyed, and the ship's boats and rafts to be provided with water and biscuits and to be launched. He then ordered his crew to lay out cables, as if in anticipation of a tow, simply as an exercise to keep them occupied. German ships opened fire when they reached a range of five miles. The last torpedo was launched, but after only two or three minutes fire, the ship was sinking rapidly and was abandoned. Nestor sank at approximately 5.30 pm.

The other guns were carried on the centreline; one between the first and second funnels, one after the searchlight platform and one on a bandstand on the quarterdeck. All the guns had half-shields.

To-date, she is the only ship of the Royal Navy to have been named Totem. Totem was sold to Israel in 1965 and commissioned into the Israeli Sea Corps in 1967 as INS Dakar. She sank whilst on passage from the United Kingdom to Israel in January 1968.HMS Totem, Uboat.net As HMS Totem HMS Totem in September 1945 ‚Äì two of the three rear-facing external torpedo tubes are clearly visible Totem in September 1945. Her totem pole is the cross-like object on the forward part of the bridge The submarine was presented with a totem pole by the Cowichan Tribes in 1945, which was stolen during the 1950s when the boat was visiting Halifax, Canada. The pole was fitted to the front of the bridge fin when the submarine was in harbour. At the end of the war, all surviving T-class Group 1 and Group 2 boats were scrapped, but the Group 3 boats (which were of welded rather than riveted construction) were retained and fitted with snorkel masts. In January 1948 it was formally acknowledged that the main operational function of the British submarine fleet would now be to intercept Soviet submarines slipping out of their bases in Northern Russia to attack British and Allied merchant vessels. The following April, the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff, Rear-Admiral Geoffrey Oliver circulated a paper in which he proposed that British submarines take a more offensive role by attacking Soviet submarines off the Northern Russian coast and mining the waters in the area. With the surface fleet dramatically reduced following the end of the Second World War, he commented that this was one of the few methods the Royal Navy had for \\"getting to the enemy on his home ground\\". To fulfil this new role, Totem was one of eight boats which were extensively modified to become \\"super T-conversions\\", giving them higher speed and quieter operation underwater. Five further T-class submarines were given much less extensive streamlining improvements. The work on Totem was done between 1951 and May 1953 at Chatham Dockyard (which carried out all eight super T-conversions), and involved inserting an additional hull section long to accommodate extra switchgear and an extra pair of electric motors and replacing the batteries. The hull was streamlined, which included the removal of the deck gun and the replacement of the bridge fin with one which was taller, enclosing the periscopes and masts. The radar and sonar were updated at the same time. After the submarine had returned to service, her top speed exceeded , aided by the unofficial removal in the dockyard at Malta of the housing for the airguard radar aerial which added 3/4 knot to her top speed.Hennessy and Jinks 2016, p. 98. Totem pole carried by Totem Her captain at the time, Commander John Coote, reported that the modifications made evading her hunters during exercises easy, since the submarine could cover a mile in four minutes at , and following another ten minutes running silently at could be away from the escort. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15 June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden During early 1955 Totem carried out \\"Operation Defiant\\", a six-week patrol in the Barents Sea to gather Signals intelligence on Soviet naval forces. Towards the end of the mission, Totem was heavily depth charged, damaging the ship's periscope and dived to a depth of to evade the attacks, drifting into a minefield in the process before escaping.Hennessy and Jinks 2016, pp. 105‚Äì108. Totem was refitted at Malta from December 1961 to January 1963, and then returned to home waters, recommissioning at Portsmouth with a new crew on 28 January 1963 before joining the 1st Submarine Flotilla at Gosport.  INS Dakar The submarine was purchased by Israel in 1965, along with two of her T-class sisters ‚Äì and . She was commissioned into the Israeli Sea Corps on 10 November 1967 as INS Dakar (◊ì◊ß◊®, Grouper) under the command of Lieutenant Commander Ya'acov Ra'anan. British shipyards had modified the boat with a airlock to allow for underwater debarkation of naval commandos. On 9 January 1968, Dakar departed from Portsmouth for Haifa. She was overloaded with sixty-nine aboard, well in excess of her normal crew of sixty. On the morning of 15 January, Dakar put into Gibraltar, departing at midnight, and proceeded across the Mediterranean Sea underwater using her snorkel mast. Her last position report was at 0610 on 24 January, when she gave a location just east of Crete. There were three further routine messages which did not provide a position, the last being at 0002 on 25 January. Despite an extensive search, no trace was found of the vessel. Her stern emergency marker buoy washed ashore on the coast of Khan Yunis, an Arab town southwest of Gaza, just over a year later, on 9 February 1969. The wreck was finally discovered on 24 May 1999 at a depth of 3,000 meters (9,800 ft). The precise cause of the accident is not known, but as no emergency measures appear to have been carried out. It appears that the submarine dived suddenly and rapidly past her maximum depth limit and suffered a catastrophic hull rupture. The emergency buoy was released by the violence of the hull collapse, and washed ashore after drifting for a year. On 11 October 2000, Dakar‚Äôs bridge and the forward edge of her sail were raised, and now stand as a memorial in the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum in Haifa.

Since April 2020 Dyankov is policy director at the Financial Markets Group at the London School of Economics. Biography Covered Bridge in Lovech Dyankov was born in Lovech, Bulgaria on July 13, 1970, Dyankov attended high school \\"Ekzarh Yosif I\\" in Lovech (1984‚Äì89). In 1989, he passed the entrance exam to the formerly named \\"Karl Marx Institute of Economics\\" (today University of National and World Economy) . Simeon Dyankov also holds a 1997 doctorate from the University of Michigan, on the topic \\"Three Essays on the Economics of Transition.\\" His main thesis advisor was Alan Deardorff. During his tenure at the University of Michigan and the World Bank, Dyankov published over 70 articles in professional journals. Journals include the American Economic Review, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the Journal of Political Economy, the Journal of Finance, the Journal of Financial Economics. His co-authors include Nobel Prize winner Oliver Hart (economist), John Bates Clark Medal winner Andrei Shleifer, and MacArthur Fellows Program winner Sendhil Mullainathan. He has also co-edited the book \\"The Resolution of Financial Distress\\" with Stijn Claessens and Ashoka Mody. The book focuses on the principles of and practical approaches to addressing the public policy trade-off involved in systemic corporate and financial sector crises and the lessons learned from the changes taking place in bankruptcy frameworks around the world. It includes research on recent public policy initiatives for distress resolution or market-based restructuring. Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz was a contributing author. In 2016, Dyankov was asked to chair the 25th Anniversary event of EBRD in London and conference in Budapest. The anniversary event involved also Vaira Vike-Freiberga, former President of Latvia and Minister Imad Najib Fakhoury, EBRD Governor for Jordan. The conference on Reinvigorating Growth featured a debate with Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev, EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis and EBRD President Sir Suma Chakrabarti. Academic life =Harvard Kennedy School= After leaving the government of Boyko Borisov, Simeon Dyankov joined the Harvard Kennedy School as visiting faculty. His teaching is focused on the politics of development. During his time at Harvard, Dyankov edited a special issue of the Journal of Comparative Economics on the 25th anniversary from the start of transition in Eastern Europe. Jointly with Anders Aslund at the Atlantic Council, he also co- authored a book on the transformation from communism.The Great Rebirth: Lessons from the Victory of Capitalism over Communism The book contains chapters by Leszek Balcerowicz on Poland, Vaclav Klaus on the Czech Republic, Lajos Bokros on Hungary, Ivan Miklos on Slovakia, and Mart Laar on Estonia. Memorial Hall, Harvard University =New Economic School= On October 2, 2013 it was announced that the board of directors of private Moscow-based university New Economic School (NES) also known as the Russian Economic School had approved Simeon Dyankov as its rector.Bulgaria's Ex-Finance Minister Djankov Appointed Rector of Private University in Moscow The New Economic School has Russia's premier economics graduate program, which had produced over 350 PhD economists since 1993. It is privately funded, and was established by Harvard economics professors Zvi Griliches and Nobel Prize winner Eric Maskin. During the tenure of Dyankov as Rector, the New Economic School was relocated to a new campus in the Skolkovo Innovation Center. =London School of Economics= The Financial Markets Group was founded by Charles Goodhart and Mervyn King in 1986 to study the development of banking and non-bank financial institutions. Dyankov's appointment as director serves to expand the focus of research to emerging markets. His latest research is on the effects of Brexit on the City of London, as presented in \\"EU Attitudes towards Brexit\\" and written up in \\"The City of London after Brexit\\". His views on Brexit are that a soft exit of Great Britain from the European Union will be in the interest of all Europeans. The point of these statistics is to state the obvious: politicians in the UK and the rest of the EU should be constructive about Brexit. If financial service companies move out of London, it is unlikely that many would relocate to another EU city. Financial centers outside of the EU would be more likely to attract the business because other EU financial centers rank so much lower. Dyankov argues that London will not lose its crown as Europe's financial capital. There are three reasons for this continued dominance over European financial services: The pre-eminence of the British court system in upholding the rule of law, including the protection of creditor and shareholder rights; The superiority of the UK's university education in economics and finance over its continental counterparts ; and the UK's tax and employment regulation that is conducive to the industry's health and profits. Still, Brexit's Effect on the City will be noticeable, reducing revenues by 12‚Äì18% and employment by 7‚Äì8%. Dyankov has proposed a Brexit readiness index to gauge progress towards eventual separation from the European Union. The Brexit Readiness Score is updated quarterly. Think Tanks =Ideas 42= In June 2008, Dyankov established the think-tank Ideas42, jointly with Antoinette Schoar (MIT Sloan), Eldar Shafir (Princeton) and Sendhil Mullainathan (Harvard), a Harvard University-International Finance Corporation venture.Handicapping the John Bates Clark Medal The Wall Street Journal April 12, 2012 The think tank applies the latest analysis to studying the economic lives of the poor, the development of small businesses, and access to finance. Several projects are co-sponsored with the Gates Foundation and the Institute for Financial Management and Research in India. A December 2007 paper studies corruption in obtaining driving licenses in Delhi. On the average, individuals pay about twice the official amount to obtain a license and very few take the legally required driving test, resulting in many unqualified but licensed drivers. The magnitude of distortions in the allocation of licenses increases with citizens' willing to pay for licenses. The results support the view that corruption does not only transfer from citizens to bureaucrats but also distorts allocation. The paper also shows that partial anti-corruption measures have only a limited impact because players in this system adapt to the new environment. Specifically, a ban on agents at one regional transport office is associated with a high percentage of unqualified drivers overcoming the residency requirement and obtaining licenses at other license offices. =Peterson Institute for International Economics= Dyankov joined the Peterson Institute for International Economics in 2013 and has written extensively on Brexit, Russia, Viktor Orb√°n, postcommunist economies, public procurement, and economic growth. His book on Inside the Euro Crisis details his days in office. Dyankov's views on whether Brexit Will Hurt the City of London have been extensively covered in the media. He also edited a book on China's New Silk Road Initiative. In 2017, Dyankov wrote a study on Trump's Corporate Tax Cut Proposal that casts doubt on the likelihood of such reform. Another study looks at The United States Unique Tax Structure.Greece's Eurozone woes have also been the subject of various editorials and media events. World Bank Simeon Dyankov has had a long and distinguished career at the World Bank, starting in 1995. He has worked in over 100 countries, including Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Macedonia, Moldova, Paraguay, Slovakia, Slovenia and Yemen. =Work in Georgia= Tbilisi, Georgia In 1997, Simeon Dyankov participated in a World Bank enterprise restructuring project in Georgia. For the next year, the project surveyed most of the manufacturing enterprises in Georgia, identifying those with good export opportunities. Since 2004, after the Rose Revolution, Simeon Dyankov has visited Georgia frequently and worked with the government on reforming the business environment. Zurab Nogaideli, prime minister between 2005 and 2007, won a Reformer of the Year award in 2007. Dyankov worked closely with Kakha Bendukidze, the main architect of Georgia's economic reforms. =Principal Author, World Development Report= In 2000‚Äì2001, Simeon Dyankov was principal author of the World Development Report \\"Building Institutions for Markets.\\" The report was guided by Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz. =The Doing Business project= Ease of doing business index Simeon Dyankov is the creator of the annual Doing Business report, the top-selling publication of the World Bank Group. The report came out of joint research work with Professor Andrei Shleifer at Harvard University, and was inspired by Dyankov's experience in overly-regulated socialist economies. The Regulation of Entry paper is one of the most-cited papers in all of economics, with 913 references in academic journals and 3,400 citations in working papers and official reports. Since its initial publication in November 2003, Doing Business has generated 9,750,000 media citations, and over 7 million copies sold or downloaded. The Doing Business report recently had its 17th annual book published. In a 2016 article for the Journal of Economic Perspectives Dyankov explains how Doing Business started. An example of his empirical research supporting the Doing Business report is a paper on business regulation and poverty, published in Economics Letters. A November 2017 EconTalk explains the origins and influence of the Doing Business report. A summary of reforms during the 15-year anniversary lists the main achievements. The methodology in the Doing Business report has been used by teams managed by Simeon Dyankov to develop other World Bank indices, for example the Human Capital Index. =Chief Economist, Finance and Private Sector= As Chief Economist, Dyankov initiated the work on subnational Doing Business analyses, gave the start of Women, Business and the Law series, and managed the Enterprise Surveys. =Women, Business and the Law= Together with Amanda Ellis, Dyankov established the Women, Business and the Law series in 2008, which published its sixth edition in January 2020. His research on gendered laws shows that equal opportunity laws increase labor force participation by women. =Director, World Development Report= In 2018, Dyankov ran the World Development Report 2019, which became the most downloaded World Bank publication within a week of its launch. The study is the first World Bank product downloaded more than 1.5 million times, in six languages. Political career =Minister of Finance of Bulgaria= On July 27, 2009, Simeon Dyankov became Minister of Finance of Bulgaria. Minister Dyankov reduced budget spending and managed to cut the budget deficit for 2009 to 4.4%. In 2010 it met the Maastricht criteria ‚Äì 3%, falling to 2% in 2011 and 0.45% in 2012.Crime Crackdown Boosts Budget Crackdown in Bulgaria The Wall Street Journal January 12, 2010 On December 1, 2009, Standard&Poors; upgraded Bulgaria's investment outlook from \\"negative\\" to \\"stable,\\" the only country in the European Union to receive an upgrade that year.Standard & Poor's Upgrades Bulgaria's Outlook to Stable In January 2010 Moody's followed with an upgrade of its rating perspective from \\"stable\\" to \\"positive,\\" and a year later upgraded it one notch ‚Äì Bulgaria being the only European Union member with an upgrade during 2008‚Äì2012. Republic of Bulgaria Coat of Arms On numerous occasions, Minister Dyankov stated that two successive terms are needed to complete the reforms that would lead Bulgaria from poorest to middle-income country by Central European standards.Bulgaria Ruling Party GERB Eyes Second Term, Clear Majority, January 10, 2010 Soon after, Parliament adopted the so- called Golden Rules in the organic budget law: the government cannot surpass a deficit of 2% of GDP and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 40% in any given year. Dyankov was a member of the GERB cabinet, but not a party member.Bulgaria Finance Minister Rejects Presidential Bid Rumors, May 2, 2010 At the second GERB party congress Dyankov urged delegates to lead such policies that the party wins a second term with full majority in parliament. This is needed, he said, to complete the reforms that would lead Bulgaria from poorest to middle-income country by Central European standards.Bulgaria Ruling Party GERB Eyes Second Term, Clear Majority, January 10, 2010 Soon after, Parliament adopted the so- called Golden Rules in the organic budget law: the government cannot surpass a deficit of 2% of GDP and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 40% in any given year. Dyankov believes in his role as an expert rather than a politician and even though he is a member of the GERB cabinet, he is not a member of the GERB party.Bulgaria Finance Minister Rejects Presidential Bid Rumors, May 2, 2010 Dyankov was the second-youngest finance minister in the European Union, after the UK's George Osborne. He champions low taxes as a way to come out of the global economic crisis. In May 2012, he became Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). This is the first time the Chair is held by a finance minister from the former socialist bloc. In June 2012 Simeon Dyankov has been invited to join the World Bank Knowledge Advisory Council.Bulgaria's FinMin to Join World Bank Knowledge Council, Novinite, June 11, 2012 Dyankov championed low taxes as a way to come out of the global economic crisis. In May 2012, he became Chair of the Supervisory Board of the EBRD. This is the first time the Chair is held by a finance minister from the former socialist bloc. In June 2012 Simeon Dyankov has been invited to join the World Bank Knowledge Advisory Council.Bulgaria's FinMin to Join World Bank Knowledge Council, Novinite, June 11, 2012 On February 18, 2013 Dyankov resigned in protest of the decision by Prime Minister Boyko Borisov to advance subsidies to farmers.Protests Pressure Bulgarian Government The Wall Street Journal February 19, 2013 On February 20, 2013, PM Borisov announced the resignation of the government due to increasing levels of violence in the protests due to high electricity prices.Bulgaria Government Quits The Wall Street Journal February 20, 2013After Bulgarian Protests, Prime Minister Resigns The New York Times Feb 20, 2013 Dyankov continued to serve as finance minister until a caretaker government was formed a month later. =Deputy Prime Minister= As Deputy Prime Minister, Dyankov was responsible for the reforms in the public administration, healthcare, higher education, and pensions. In July 2010, the results of the first year of administrative reform were reported. The number of public officials was reduced by 11%, and the number of government institutions by 8%. This is the first time since the fall of communism that administrative reform has resulted in an actual optimization in government. In 2012 since the beginning of his term the number of public officials was reduced by 15%, and the number of government institutions by 9%. Also, the new Law on Public Officials (adopted by Parliament in April 2012) introduced a unified pay scale for all public servants, annulled 72 special laws that previously gave special treatment to some categories of public servants, and eliminated the annual bonus for seniority. Under the new law pay depends fully on merit. The latter change met stiff opposition by the labor unions who have repeatedly called for Dyankov's resignation. In 2012, another part of the administrative reform started: moving some government agencies from the capital city to other regional hubs. The first two government decrees moved the headquarters of the tourism directorates to Plovdiv, and the Agency for Fisheries to Burgas. The rationale for this decentralization is to spread the administrative capacity in Bulgaria more evenly, and to link university education with the needs of the administration. Views =Post-Communist Transition= Simeon Dyankov's main body of work is on post-communist transition. His 2014 book The Great Rebirth analyzes the experience of Eastern Europe and Russia in the quarter century since the fall of communism. Dyankov is put alongside Leszek Balcerowicz, Vaclav Klaus and Mart Laar as one of the architects of post-communist economic restructuring. =On the Eurozone Crisis= Dyankov's views on the Eurozone crisis are presented in a number of publications, and summarized in a recent article.Europe Needs a Smarter Austerity Debate The Wall Street Journal April 17, 2013 He also published a book on the subject titled Inside the Euro Crisis.New Faculty Feature: Adjunct Lecturer Simeon Djankov, Kennedy School, Harvard, July 24, 2013 The main argument is that Europe needs a frank discussion about competitiveness.Inside the Euro Crisis: An Eyewitness Account, Peterson Institute for International Economics, June 2014 A third book, Europe's Growth Challenge, suggests ways in which the continent can compete with the United States and Asia. European society benefits from equality in income, excellent healthcare and basic education, good infrastructure, and developed institutions for the rule of law. But Europe has entered a period of economic stagnation and is distracted by multiple challenges. Economic and political strains have stalled vital reforms, while the threat of disunion is evident. By focusing on what works in Europe and the great variations within Europe, Dyankov shows how Europe can develop a strategy for higher economic growth. These steps a reduction of the fiscal role of the state, an opening up of services and digital trade, an easing of the regulatory and tax burdens on labor, an improved environment for startups and innovation, pension reform, and the development of Europe's energy union. Europe's Growth Challenge is finalist for The Hayek Prize for 2018. =Foreign relations= His attitude and wording concerning Russia has become famous for his firmness. On September 27, 2012 he stated that if needed Russian nuclear-power companies would be slammed in the talks about future possible building of nuclear plant at Belene if their conditions were not satisfactory for Bulgaria.Bulgaria Lashes Out at Russia over Increased Belene NPP Claim, SNA, September 27, 2012. Retrieved January 29, 2013. As deputy prime minister, Simeon Dyankov was also responsible for canceling the oil- pipeline project connecting the ports of Burgas and Alexandroupolis. At the same time, as minister Dyankov was supportive of easing Russian tourism into Bulgaria and increasing cultural ties. For example, on January 23, 2013, during a visit to Moscow he stated that in fact \\"Bulgaria bets on Russian investment\\". The visa regime was in fact eased after Dyankov's intervention, so that Russian tourists who already have Schengen visas were no longer required to obtain Bulgarian visas. The same new rule applies for citizens of Turkey and Ukraine. =Corporate Taxation= Corporate income tax rates in advanced economies have fallen from an average of 46 percent in 1987 to 23 percent in 2017. Professor Dyankov's research suggests that tax convergence will take place by 2020, with the United States, France and Germany also lowering their tax rate to below 25 percent. This trend reduces tax competition across jurisdictions. =Brexit= Brexit started as a messy divorce from the European Union and the UK government still gets a low readiness score on its preparation for breaking away. =Future of Work= The study conducted by Dyankov World Development Report 2019 finds that the fears of mass unemployment due to technology are unfounded. Personal life Dyankov is married to the Columbia University economist Caroline Freund, and has two children. In 2016 Freund published Rich People, Poor Countries, a widely acclaimed book on superstar global companies. His father-in-law is the theoretical physicist Peter Freund of the University of Chicago. Freund was one of the originators of two-component duality which gave the original impetus to what then developed into string theory. He pioneered the modern unification of physics through the introduction of extra dimensions of space and found mechanisms by which the extra dimensions curl up. Professor Freund made significant contributions, to the theory of magnetic monopoles, to supersymmetry and supergravity, to number-theoretic aspects of string theory, as well as to the phenomenology of hadrons. The Archaeological Museum in Sofia Dyankov has a passion for antique and old historic and finance books, history of Bulgarian finance, etc. While in the Bulgarian government, Dyankov started a program for restoring cultural heritage sites from the Thracian, Roman and early Bulgarian history. Together with Bozhidar Dimitrov, director of the National Historical Museum (Bulgaria), the state invested in over 80 archaeological sites.A Sainted Discovery The Economist August 19, 2010 Simeon Dyankov was called once \\"Bulgaria's Top Archaeologist\\" by a fellow minister. In 2012, he received the title of Honorary Citizen of Sozopol.

It is on the Via della Conciliazione, the primary road of the Roman Rione of Borgo. Pope Sixtus V designated the church as a cardinalitial titulus on 13 April 1587.David M.

The current cardinal of Santa Maria in Traspontina is the former Archbishop of Quebec, Marc Ouellet, who supports Opus Dei,Cardinal Ouellet and Opus Dei Retrieved: 2016-03-20. and is the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops of the Roman Curia. He was Cardinal Priest from 2003 to 2018, and continued there when co-opted to suburbicarian rank.  History  The first church named Santa Maria in Traspontina, which lay much nearer to the Tiber than today's church, was demolished during the pontificate of Pius IV (1559‚Äì1565) to clear the line of fire for the cannons of the Castel Sant' Angelo, who wished to exercise shooting on the Gianicolo Hill, which otherwise would have been hidden behind the church. Designs by Giovanni Sallustio Peruzzi (with contributions by Ottaviano Nonni and Francesco Peparelli) for a replacement church were in place by 1566, though the papal artillery officers insisted that its dome be as low as possible to avoid a recurrence of the previous problem -- for this reason this is the only church in Rome whose dome does not lie on a drum. The new church was erected along the North side of Borgo Nuovo, which was at that time - and until its destruction in 1937 - the main road of Borgo. The inscriptions found in Santa Maria in Traspontina, a valuable source illustrating the history of the church, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.V. Forcella, Inscrizioni delle chiese e d' altre edifici di Roma, dal secolo XI fino al secolo XVI Volume VI (Roma: Fratelli Bencini, 1873), pp. 345-375. On 21 October 2019 Alexander Tschugguel and an accomplice stole five statues, reportedly of Inca fertility goddess Pachamama, from the church and threw them into the Tiber. The statues were on display in one of the church's side chapels as part of an educational installment about Amazonian culture during the Amazon Synod. =Interior= The church has four chapels on each side of the nave. The first on the right, is dedicated to Saint Barbara (the patron saint of gunners). This chapel has an altarpiece of Santa Barbara (c. 1597) by Cavalier d'Arpino, with frescoed scenes (1610‚Äì20) from the life of the saint by Cesare Rossetti. The second chapel has an Ecstasy of S. Canuto (1686) by Daniele Seyter, with frescoed ceiling and lunettes by Alessandro Francesi. The fourth chapel has a Madonna & St. John Evangelist (1587) by Cesare Conti with frescoes of the Passion (1649) by Bernardino Gagliardi. The fifth is dedicated to S.Alberto and the frescoed stories were by Niccol√≤ Circignani. The crossing to the right, has an Apparition of the Trinity and 3 saints (1639) by Giovanni Domenico Cerrini. The main altar (1674) was designed by Carlo Fontana, and has a medieval icon. The statues (1695) around the altar are by Alessandro Rondoni, Giacomo Antonio Lavaggi, Vincenzo Felici, and Michel Maille. The chorus has canvases (1760) by Angelo Papi, while the ceiling of the left crossing (1697) was frescoed by Biagio Puccini. The fifth chapel to the left has an altarpiece by Giovanni Battista Ricci of Preaching by San Angelo Martire (1612) and stories of the saint. In the fourth chapel, a painting of the Ecstasy of Santa Teresa (1698) by Antonio Gherardi while the third has a Flagellation of Saints Peter and Paul by Ricci, the second Santa Elia with St Anthony Abbot and the blessed Franco da Siena painted by Giacinto Calandrucci. One chapel contains the two columns to which Peter and Paul were said to have been bound prior to their martyrdom in the circus of Nero nearby.

War service Originally ordered by Chile, Tipperary and her sisters were bought by the Royal Navy at the outbreak of World War I. Initially, Tipperary served as the second flotilla leader with the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in the Harwich Force, arriving there in June 1915. Late in that same year, she took charge of a detachment of destroyers from the 2nd Flotilla, while in March 1916, Tipperary had rejoined the Harwich Force, being attached to the Fifth Light Cruiser Squadron. For a while during the war she was commanded by Captain (later Admiral) Sir Barry Domvile. In May 1916 Tipperary was made the leader of the 4th Flotilla, a formation which directly supported the Grand Fleet. =Sinking= About 21:58 GMT 31 May 1916 while 4th Destroyer Flotilla was searching for the German High Seas Fleet in the North Sea during Battle of Jutland she encountered the enemy's 7th Flotilla (destroyers). The Imperial German Naval vessels launched torpedoes at the British ships, none of which hit, and 7th Flotilla then turned away. Nicholas Jellicoe's account states that \\"Between 23:15 and 23:20 a lookout [on HMS Garland] ... saw what he thought were enemy ships on the starboard quarter\\".Jellicoe, 239. A few minutes later Tipperary flashed the recognition signal and was immediately lit up by the searchlights of three German battleships and three light cruisers.Jellicoe, 239 From 23:30 to about 23:34 around 150 5.9-inch shells from and were fired at Tipperary; she was badly stricken by this fire, which left her bridge damaged and most of her forward crew casualties, including her commander, Captain Wintour. At about 02:00 GMT 1 June 1916 she was abandoned, and sank in the following hours due to battle damage.Jellicoe, 239. 150 of her crew of 197 were killed in the action, a number of the survivors were rescued from the sea by the Imperial German Navy and transported back to Germany as prisoners of war. Stoker David Eunson described the sinking: \\"As we floated away on that awful night, many died of sheer exhaustion and suffering. After drifting for well nigh 5 hours we were picked up at dawn. I saw the Tipperary, a mass of flames, keel over\\". Aftermath The wrecksite is designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

In Buddhism, symbolic offerings are made to the Triple Gem, giving rise to contemplative gratitude and inspiration.See, for instance, Harvey (1990), pp. 172-3. Typical material offerings involve simple objects such as a lit candle or oil lamp,Indaratana (2002), pp. iv, v; Kapleau (1989), p. 193; Khantipalo (1982); Lee & Thanissaro (1998). burning incense,Indaratana (2002), pp. 11-12. flowers,See, for instance, Indaratana (2002), pp. 11-12. Harvey (1990), p. 173, and Kariyawasam (1995), chapter 1, both maintain that flowers are the most common form of offering. food, fruit, water or drinks.Kapleau (1989), p. 193; Khantipalo (1982); and, Harvey (1990), p. 175, particularly in regards to Northern Buddhism. Within the traditional Buddhist framework of karma and rebirth, offerings lead to the accumulation of merit, which leads to: :* a better rebirth in the cycle of birth and death (Pali: vattagamini- kusala) :* progress towards release from suffering (Pali: vivattagamini- kusala).Lee & Thanissaro (1998). See also Harvey (1990), p. 173, who in discussing \\"offerings\\" states: \\"Such acts consequently generate 'merit'.\\" These offerings often act as preparation for meditation.See, for instance, Indaratana (2002), p. v; Kapleau (1989), pp. 191ff.; and Khantipalo (1982). Theravada practices Material offerings nurture generosity (Pali:dƒÅna) and virtue (Pali: sƒ´la).See, for instance, Lee & Thanissaro (1998). The act further honors the Triple Gem (the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha), deepening one's commitment to the Buddha's path. For instance, traditional chants (in English and Pali) when offering lit candles (padƒ´pa p≈´jƒÅ) and incense (sugandha p≈´jƒÅ) to an image of the Buddha are: { style=\\"text-align:left; margin:0px 5px 0px 5px\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" -----  With lights brightly shining Abolishing this gloom I adore the Enlightened One, The Light of the three worlds. With perfumed incense And fragrant smoke I worship the Exalted One, Who is great and worthy of worship.Indaratana (2002), p. 11. See also Harvey (1990), p. 175, who translates the light-offering verse in part as describing the Buddha as \\"the lamp of the three worlds, dispeller of darkness.\\"  ' ' ' ' ' ' ' 'Indaratana (2002), p. 12. } Similarly, a traditional Pali incense-lighting verse speaks of the Buddha's \\"fragrant body and fragrant face, fragrant with infinite virtues.\\"Harvey (1990), p. 175. By contemplating on an offering, one tangibly sees life's impermanence (Pali: anicca), one of the three characteristics of all things upon which the Buddha encouraged his disciplines to recollect. For instance, the end of a traditional chant (in English and Pali) when offering flowers (puppha p≈´jƒÅ) to an image of the Buddha is: { style=\\"text-align:left; margin:0px 5px 0px 5px\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" -----  I worship the Buddha with these flowers; May this virtue be helpful for my emancipation; Just as these flowers fade, Our body will undergo decay.Indaratana (2002), p. 11. Similarly, see Harvey (1990), p. 173; and, Kariyawasam (1995), ch. 1, sect. 2, \\"Personal Worship.\\"  ' ' ' ' } Mahayana practices Burning of incense before the thumb Mahayana material offerings might be imbued with the following symbology: *the lighting of a candle or an oil lamp represents the light of wisdom illuminating the darkness of ignorance. *the burning of incense represents the fragrant scent of morality. *flowers represents the aspiration to achieve the body of the Buddha with the thirty-two marks of the Buddha as well as the teaching of impermanence. Alternately, a Zen verse expresses the desire for the mind's \\"flowers\\" to \\"bloom in the springtime of enlightenment.\\"Harvey (1990), p. 173. *food, fruit, water, drinks represents the nectar of Dharma and the wish to achieve it. In Northern Buddhism, sacred images have set before them: * water (representing hospitality, to wash the face and feet) * scarves (Tib. kha- btags, offering friendship) * flowers, incense, lamps, perfume and food (representing one's devoting all their senses to their spiritual practice). Non-material offerings In some traditions, two different types of offerings are identified: *material or hospitality offerings (Pali: amisa- pujaLee & Thanissaro (1998). or sakkara-pujaKhantipalo (1982).)See also Alms#Buddhism regarding the traditional Theravada offering of providing daily alms to bhikkhus. *practice offerings (Pali: patipatti-pujaKhantipalo (1982); Lee & Thanissaro (1998).) In this context, material offerings are considered external offerings of \\"words and deeds.\\" Practice offerings may be manifested by practicing: * giving (Pali: dƒÅna) * moral conduct (sƒ´la) * meditation (samƒÅdhi) * wisdom (pa√±√±a)Khantipalo (1982); and, Nyanaponika (2000), pp. 298-299. On the other hand, Lee & Thanissaro (1998) identify only meditation as patipatti-puja. In the Pali Canon, the Buddha declared practice offerings as \\"the best way of honoring the Buddha\\"Kantipalo (1982), n. 1. and as the \\"supreme\\" offering. This is primarily an internal offering for mental development (Pali: citta, bhƒÅvanƒÅ and samƒÅdhi).

He was previously a Democratic State Representative for Ohio House District 80 and had been a member of the Ohio House since 1999. During the 2012 general election, he was again elected to serve as State Representative for the newly drawn 89th District.Blade Staff. \\"Redfern wins Ohio House Seat\\". The Toledo Blade. November 2012 Political career Redfern is the only Ohio Democratic Party Chairman on record to have served as chairman when the Democratic Party won gubernatorial, U.S. Senate, and presidential elections. In 2008, The Columbus Dispatch wrote:\\"Democrats made history -- marking the first time a party that did not draw the district lines was ever able to take control of the House chamber.\\" Following President Barack Obama's successful 2012 re- election, Redfern became the only State Party Chairman in Ohio's history to help a Democratic presidential candidate carry Ohio twice with more than 50% of the vote. Since taking office in late 2005, Redfern has helped raise more than $100,000,000 for Ohio Democrats. Before becoming party chairman, he was the Minority Leader in the Ohio House of Representatives.Williamson, Dan. \\"Nice guys finish last.\\" Columbus Monthly. May 2007 During Redfern's term as Minority Leader, he was the first Democratic Leader to oversee multiple gains in the Ohio House of Representatives (during the 2004 election) since former Speaker of the Ohio House Vern Riffe.http://ohiohousedems.com/index.php?page=display&id;=127 Redfern was also an Ottawa County commissioner from 1993 to 1999 - the youngest in the state when his term began in 1993. In 2008, Redfern set the party‚Äôs sights on the general election and began constructing the largest field operation ever envisioned by a state political party. Together, the Campaign for Change and the Ohio Democratic Party registered 105,862 new Ohio voters and engaged in 3,552,486 conversations with Ohioans at their doors or on the phone. Fueling these record-breaking figures were the efforts of more than 60,000 volunteers from neighborhoods across Ohio. On Election Day, Ohio Democrats delivered a decisive victory for Barack Obama and picked up three new congressional seats. Democrats also captured the Ohio House on a legislative map drawn by state Republicans, a feat never before seen in Ohio history. Following a national Republican wave in 2010, Redfern led Ohio Democrats back to victory in 2012 by championing one of the largest campaign investments in Ohio's history. Between the Ohio Democratic Party and the President's Ohio campaign, Democrats made an unprecedented 16,261,643 attempts to talk to Ohio voters from more than 170 field offices, staffed by more than 750 paid employees and tens of thousands of volunteers across the state. On election night, Redfern's gamble paid off as Barack Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1940 to carry more than fifty percent of Ohio voters' support twice. Ohio Democrats' early investment was also successful for Senator Sherrod Brown who was able to overcome an unprecedented $40 million spent against him in attack ads in part because of the infrastructure his campaign and the Ohio Democratic Party put in place. Despite a redistricting period controlled by the opposing party where three Democratic State House incumbent seats were eliminated, Ohio Democrats also won races that were supposed to be out of reach, and overcame a 3-1 financial disadvantage and for the first time in 12 years, Democrats won a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court. Redfern attended Bowling Green State University where he earned both a bachelor's degree and then his master's degree in state and local government. He received the BGSU Accomplished Graduate Award in 2004. Redfern lives on Catawba Island and in 2014 opened Rocky Point Winery in Marblehead, a boutique winery and inn specializing in Lake Erie region wines.

The station is owned by The Berkshire Broadcasting Corp, along with sister stations WLAD and WAXB. WDAQ broadcasts on 98.3 MHz with 1.3 kW (1,300 watts) ERP (Effective Radiated Power). History WDAQ first signed on in 1948 as WLAD-FM, one of the first Class A FM stations to sign on in the United States and the first to sign on in the Danbury area (over a decade prior to the sign on of the higher-powered WINE- FM). Originally, the station was part of the Rural Radio Network as one of two Connecticut affiliates of the New York-based network. This programming would last until the 1950s when WLAD-FM evolved into an extension of its then daytime-only sister station, WLAD. In the mid 1960s, spurred on by FCC regulations forcing FM stations to create formats separate from their AM sister stations, WLAD-FM upgraded to a stereo signal and flipped to an easy listening format, which was automated in 1975. In 1979, the call letters were changed to WDAQ, competing with WEZN from Bridgeport, Connecticut and WHUD from Peekskill, New York for Greater Danbury's easy listening audience. In the mid-eighties, the station shifted to soft adult contemporary, rebranded as \\"Lite 98\\" and shed the easy listening instrumentals. By the late 1980s, WDAQ faced a more crowded market of adult contemporary signals. WEBE108 FM Westport/Bridgeport, Connecticut adopted the A/C format in 1984 and then WEZN contemporized its easy listening format in 1987. Seeing an opportunity between teen formatted WKCI-FM, mainstream A/C WEBE and soft A/C WEZN, WDAQ was reborn as Hot A/C 98Q in September, 1989. The station's initial music mix relied heavily on 1970s titles that had not been played on the radio for several years. Within a year, WDAQ shot to #1 beating sister full-service WLAD and crosstown rocker WRKI. During its more than 30 years as \\"98Q,\\" the station has finished first in virtually every Danbury Arbitron/Nielsen ratings survey. The station continues its hyper-focus on Greater Danbury as opposed to the more regional approaches of the other FM stations in the area. On August 7, 2015, WDAQ upgraded to HD Radio, and launched a new Alternative station on 103.7 MHz, fed by its HD2 subchannel, as \\"103.7 Danbury's New Rock Alternative\\", which launched on the 10th at Noon after stunting with loops of songs that changed each hour, with songs like \\"Rapper's Delight\\" and \\"Drunk on a Plane\\".

The dam is in Washington state, while Ross Lake extends north to British Columbia, Canada. Both dam and reservoir are located in Ross Lake National Recreation Area, is bordered on both sides by Stephen Mather Wilderness and combined with Lake Chelan National Recreation Area they make up North Cascades National Park Complex. Built as part of the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project by Seattle City Light, the dam is part of a series of three dams through the Skagit Gorge that were built primarily to generate hydroelectricity from the massive elevation drop of over from the Canada-U.S. border to Newhalem. The other two dams are Diablo Dam, directly below Ross Dam, and Gorge Dam, further downstream. Ross Dam can generate up to 460 MW of electricity. Hydro-electric dams provide approximately 92 percent of the electricity used in Seattle. History =Planning and early construction= Prior to construction of the dam the Skagit Gorge upstream of the dam was a wild, free flowing, completely undeveloped area. The canyon held an intact ancient forest of Douglas Fir, Western Hemlock and Western Redcedar, estimated to be millable into up to 340 million usable board feet of timber. With the creation of the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project in the 1910s, the first two dams, Gorge Dam and Diablo Dam, were constructed downstream of the Ross Dam site. In 1937, construction began on the dam, originally slated to be called Ruby Dam, on the first two of four planned construction phases. The name originates from Ruby Creek, a Skagit River tributary that flows southwest to meet the Skagit just upstream of the dam site. By 1940, phases 1 and 2 of the dam were complete, and the dam stood above the river. While the reservoir filled, the Decco-Walton Logging Company was formed in 1945 with the awarding of a contract from Seattle City Light. Decco-Walton logged the Skagit Gorge as Ross Lake slowly rose, and floated logs up the river to British Columbia, where it was hauled to the Fraser River. By the time Ross Lake filled, only 30 million board feet remained in the basin, less than 10% of the original timber. =Third phase= Ross Dam third construction phase, 1947 In 1939, superintendent of the Skagit Hydroelectric Project James Delmage Ross has died, so Ruby Dam was renamed Ross Dam in his memory. In 1943 a consortium of contractors including Morrison-Knudsen, which had previously participated in construction of Hoover Dam, began new construction on the dam ultimately raising its height to . Energy demands during World War II coincided with an energy shortage in Seattle, requiring that the dam be constructed quickly, but the dam did not generate any power until many years after the war ended. This third phase was finished in 1949, to . This height would cause the reservoir at full pool to extend slightly past the Washington-British Columbia border. The reservoir, however, did not fill past the national border until 1954. As compensation for the flooded land, which totals about , Seattle City Light paid the Province of British Columbia $250,000, as well as an annual payment of $5,000. Two years prior to the reservoir reaching full pool, construction of the Ross Dam power plant began, and two turbines first went on line in 1956, generating 360 MW of power. Another two generators were added later, increasing the capacity to its current 460 MW. =High Ross Dam= The upper map shows what the dimensions of the reservoir would have been if the high dam had been built. The lower map shows the existing dimensions of the reservoir. Dam is at left in both maps. A controversy later arose over the planned fourth stage of the construction of Ross Dam. This argument over land became known as the High Ross Dam Controversy. The dam was built with the potential to be raised further, bringing the total height of the dam to and raising the reservoir to approximately above sea level. The stepped \\"concrete waffle\\" facing on the front of the dam was designed to accommodate this addition to the height. This would have flooded land into Canada approximately further, also extending up the Klesilkwa River, a Skagit River tributary, and provided the opportunity to generate about 272 MW of extra power, bringing the generating capacity to 732 MW. It wasn't until the 1970s when the High Ross project was finally ended. On the US side, the North Cascades Conservation Council inventoried the ancient forest of Big Beaver Creek which would have been flooded, and showed that City Light's statements that no unique forest environments would be lost were not true. On the Canadian side the raising of the dam was halted primarily by the extensive work by Curley Chittenden - logger turned environmentalist, who worked tirelessly to rally opposition to this additional flooding of the upper Skagit River basin. Ultimately a treaty was signed between the City of Seattle and Province of British Columbia to supply Seattle with the equivalent amount of power from other, existing dams in British Columbia in exchange for Seattle not raising the dam. The Skagit Environmental Endowment Commission was created at this time to oversee joint USA/Canada stewardship of the upper Skagit River watershed. Description The Ross Dam is situated in the gorge of the Skagit River about midway along its length, and south of the Canada‚ÄìUS border. It is a concrete thin arch dam high and about long, stretching across one of the narrowest spots in the Skagit Gorge. The North Cascades mountains rise nearly vertically from the floor of the canyon and surround it on both sides. Directly upstream of the dam, Ruby Creek flows into the reservoir, forming the Ruby Arm of Ross Lake. Directly downstream, Diablo Dam forms Diablo Lake, much smaller than Ross Lake. Other creeks that flow into Ross Lake include Little Beaver Creek and Big Beaver Creek from the west, and Lightning Creek from the east. North Cascades Highway, also known as Washington State Route 20, follows the Skagit River to where it turns away from the river at Ross Dam and follows Ruby Creek instead. The power plant of Ross Dam is located just downstream of its base and produces 460 MW of power from four hydroelectric turbines. The dam has two over-the-crest spillways on its flanks, each with six individual spillway bays. The capacity of each individual spillway bay at full pool is rated at , for a total discharge capacity of just over .

Route description All of State Route 89 is located within the eastern half of Ashland County. No segment of this highway is included within the National Highway System, a network of routes deemed most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country. History At the 1923 Ohio state highway renumbering, the State Route 89 designation was applied to the roadway between Aurora and Brimfield. This roadway was made part of State Route 43 in 1927 and the State Route 89 designation was assigned to the current route, which had previously been part of State Route 58. In its original 1927 alignment, State Route 89 included a brief stretch of what is now State Route 95 between State Route 179 southeast of Hayesville and State Route 89's current southern terminus, along with the entirety of the current routing of State Route 89. Five years after its inception, State Route 89 was extended to the southwest along the present routing of State Route 95 from State Route 179 to a new southern terminus at State Route 39 in Perrysville. In 1939, State Route 95 was extended northeasterly from its prior eastern terminus in Butler to the Wooster vicinity. Consequently, State Route 89 was scaled back to its present southern terminus, as all of the former State Route 89 southwest of that point became a part of the newly extended State Route 95.

Even though Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704 brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver pieces of eight (Spanish dollars and later Mexican dollars) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century. Britain adopted the gold standard in 1821 and an imperial order-in-council of 1838 resulted in Dominica formally adopting the sterling currency in the year 1842. However, despite the circulation of British silver coins in Dominica, the silver pieces of eight continued to circulate alongside them, and the private sector continued to use dollar accounts for reckoning. The international silver crisis of 1873 signalled the end of the silver dollar era in the West Indies and silver dollars were demonetized in Dominica in the wake of this crisis for fear that a silver standard might return. Even though the British sterling coins were made of silver, they were fractional coins of the British gold sovereign and hence they maintained their gold value. This left a state of affairs, in which the British coinage circulated, being reckoned in dollar accounts at an automatic conversion rate of 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. From 1949, with the introduction of the British West Indies dollar, the currency of Dominica became officially tied up with that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. The fixed exchange rate of $4.80 = ¬£1 sterling (equivalent to the old $1 = ¬£4 2s 0d) continued right up until 1976. Early history The first dollar consisted of various cut or holed Spanish dollars and other Spanish colonial coins. The dollar was subdivided into bits (worth 9 pence). Before 1813, there were 11 bits to the holed dollar (12¬Ω bits to an unholed dollar). After 1813, there were 16 bits to the holed dollar (18 bits to an unholed dollar). In 1842, sterling was established as the official currency of the island. The first series of coins was produced between 1791 and 1798 in denominations of 1¬Ω, 5¬Ω and 11 bits, with the 5¬Ω bits holed 4 reales coins, the 11 bits holed 8 reales coins and the 1¬Ω bits the plugs from producing the 11 bits coins. The second series was issued in 1813 and consisted of 3, 4, 6, 12 and 16 bits. The 12 and 16 bits were holed 8 reales coins, with the plugs from the 12 bits used to make the other coins. Whole plugs made the 6 bits, halved plugs made the 3 bits and the plugs were themselves holed to make the 4 bits. The third series was issued between 1816 and 1818 and consisted of 2 bits and 2 shillings 6 pence (marked 2/6, equal to 3‚Öì bits). The 2 bits were holed 2 reales coins whilst the 2/6 coins were quartered 8 reales coins. In 1913, the first private banknotes were issued, denominated in dollars. From 1920, some of these notes were also denominated in sterling, with 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. In 1935, the British West Indies dollar was introduced, equal in value to the Dominican dollar and other dollars circulating in the British West Indies. Private banks continued to issue notes until 1941. The British West Indies dollar was replaced in 1965 by the East Caribbean dollar. =Banknotes= The Royal Bank of Canada introduced 5 dollar notes in 1913, continuing to issue them until 1938. The Colonial Bank issued 5 dollars notes until 1926, after which Barclays Bank (which had taken over the Colonial Bank) began issuing 5 dollars notes and continued until 1941.

Previously, the product was called Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE). It was designed for a short period of time by York University and continued at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto, to support knowledge building pedagogies, practices and research designated in this area. In 1983, CSILE was prototyped in a university course and in 1986 it was used for the first time in an elementary school, as a full version. CSILE was considered the first networked system designed for collaborative learning (Carl Bereiter webpage). The main contributors were Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter. In 1995, the software was redesigned in accordance to World Wide Web philosophy by OISE in cooperation with Learning in Motion.http://www.learn.motion.com The new generation was called Knowledge Forum (KF). Knowledge Forum is an asynchronous Computer-mediated communication (CMC) technology that provides a shared discourse environment. It facilitates collaborative knowledge-building strategies, textual and graphical representation of ideas, and reorganization of knowledge artifacts. The product is now used in a variety of social contexts in 19 countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The Institute for Knowledge Innovation and Technology (IKIT) from OISE is the research group that takes charge of future developments of Knowledge Forum.  Specifications Knowledge Forum (KF) Server is implemented for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms, while the latest version (KF 4.8) has a Client written in as a hybrid of Java applet and web pages. KF can be used as an e-learning system or as an in-class technology. For each class and course there is a database, individually assigned for each entity. The main feature of the product is called note. With notes, users can do the followings: * Offer various options of finding for existing notes * Write a new note * Co-author, when more users share the authorship for the same note * Reference and quote an existing note * Annotate allows users to comment on an existing note without creating a new one. * Reply (built-on) on a specific note. * Rise-above notes which subsume sets of related notes. The main technique that KF uses is called scaffolding (Scardamalia, 2004). Learners use a specific set of scaffolds that directs other toward cognitive operations that will help them to improve their understanding. The basic set of scaffolds is the following one: * My theory * I need to understand * New information * This theory cannot explain * A better theory * Putting our knowledge together Software features Knowledge Forum has some basic components that all Learning Management Systems have. It has facilities for posting messages, searching for notes, uploading documents, and online assignments. However, KF is not a typical LMS. Some features (such as grade book, live chat, student information, and the integration into a larger network of users) are not implemented. Knowledge Forum is not committed to be a traditional LMS. According with its purposes, KF is grounded on knowledge building theory. The software helps students in their effort to acquire new meaning and nurture knowledge building communities. In consequence, Knowledge Forum requires that learners and instructors take an approach in concordance with knowledge building theory. Currently in version 4.8 in beta-testing the major version 5 is in progress.  Pedagogical approaches Knowledge Forum can be used in different areas such as: * Education, from grade 1 to graduate students * Healthcare * Business According to Bereiter and Scardamalia (2003) \\"a comprehensive knowledge building environment would provide a means of initiating students into a knowledge-creating culture‚Äîto make them feel a part of humankind‚Äôs long-term effort to understand their world and gain some control over their destiny\\" (p. 18).

Built in a Romanian Br√¢ncovenesc style, a synthesis of Renaissance and Byzantine architecture, it lies on the Avram Iancu Square, together with the Cluj-Napoca National Theatre and the Avram Iancu Statue. The Cathedral is the seat of the Metropolitan of Cluj, Alba, Cri»ôana and Maramure»ô. It is dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos (Romanian: Adormirea Maicii Domnului). History The cathedral was built between 1923 and 1933, after the Union of Transylvania with the Romanian Old Kingdom. Nicolae Ivan (1855-1936), the first bishop of the Bishopric of Cluj, had a very important contribution in suggesting the location of the cathedral and in obtaining the necessary funds for its construction, which began on 10 September 1923. The project of the cathedral was developed by the architects George Cristinel and Constantin Pomponiu, who also designed the Mausoleum of MƒÉrƒÉ≈üe≈üti. On 5 November 1933 the Cathedral was officially opened by Miron Cristea, the Patriarch of All Romania, Nicolae BƒÉlan, the Metropolitan of Transylvania and Nicolae Ivan, the Bishop of Cluj. The opening ceremony was also attended, among many others, by King Carol II and Crown Prince Michael I. Decoration The main dome of the Cathedral, inspired by the dome of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, is surrounded by 4 Romanian Br√¢ncovenesc style towers. The 18 large columns supporting the dome are sculpted in stone. The main material used for the construction of the Cathedral was stone extracted from Baciu and Bompotoc. The interior murals were painted between 1928 and 1933 by artists Anastasie Demian and , both professors at the local Art Academy.

He left MPACUK in September 2015 citing frustration at the lack of Muslim activism and support in the UK. David Irving Controversy In 2006, it was reported that Bukhari had sent the English Holocaust denier David Irving a ¬£60 cheque and a letter headed with a quote attributed to John Locke, \\"All that is needed for evil to triumph is for good people to stand idle\\". In one email Bukhari wrote to Irving: \\"You may feel like you are on your own but rest assured many people are with you in your fight for the Truth!\\". He told The Observer: \\"At the time [in 2000] I was of the belief he [Irving] was anti-Zionist, being smeared for nothing more being anti-Zionist\\" and that the \\"pro-Israeli lobby often accuse[s] people of anti-Semitism\\". Bukhari then published an audiocast in which he stated: \\"David Irving claimed he was not anti-Semitic and was in fact being attacked by the powerful pro-Israeli lobby; in short, being smeared ... I believed him, it's as simple as that ... I would not have supported anyone who is anti-Semitic\\". \\"Everyone knew about Irving‚Äôs Holocaust denying but Mr Bukhari somehow managed to miss it\\", wrote David Aaronovitch in The Times shortly after the article in The Observer was published. Facebook comments on Israel and jihad During the Gaza War, Bukhari wrote in a Facebook thread: \\"Muslims who fight against the occupation of their lands are 'Mujahadeen' and are blessed by Allah. And any Muslim who fights and dies against Israel and dies is a martyr and will be granted paradise\\". He also wrote that \\"The concept of jihad is a beautiful thing, and logical to those with a sincere heart\\".

Aisha Patel of the New York Daily Sun criticized the BBC for inviting Bukhari to give his opinion and said \\"Asghar Bukhari is not representative of Muslims. He is a representative of political Islam which has no place in British politics in the hothead, extremist form personified by Bukhari\\". Comments on Charlie Hebdo On 8 January 2015, in a live Sky News broadcast the day after 12 people were murdered in the offices of the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, Bukhari repeatedly said the murdered cartoonists of the publication were racists.On Air Debate, Sky News Broadcast, 8 January 2015, UK Facebook and YouTube posts on Shoe Theft In June 2015, Bukhari posted on Facebook saying that \\"Zionists\\" had tried to intimidate him by entering his home and stealing one shoe. He went on to say that it is possible that these tactics are used by various organisations for intimidation purposes. The hashtag \\"Mossad Stole My Shoe\\" was trending on Twitter. Bukhari's post to Facebook on 12 June 2015: :ARE ZIONISTS TRYING TO INTIMIDATE ME: :Someone came into my home yesterday, while I was asleep. I dont know how they got in, but they didn't break in - the only thing they took was one shoe. Now think about that, the only thing they took was a single shoe - they left one shoe behind to let me know someone had been there. :Of course I cant prove anything and thats part of the intimidation. The game is simple - to make me feel vulnerable in my own home. Its Psychological. Neither can I do much about it. :It is not the first time I have heard this happening. I have had another Muslim leader call me a year or so ago, in tears - she told me they had been coming into her house and re- arranging things - just to let her know they had been there. :There is one good thing that comes out of all oppression however - for those who are smart - from my misfortune, others can learn how they operate. Share this widely, for if it is happening to me, I am sure it happening to many, many others who have not exposed it. On 19 June 2015, Bukhari posted a 10-minute YouTube video in which he says his shoe/slipper was found by his neighbors in their garden, but the people who are \\"poo-pooing\\" his theory that the Zionists are behind the shoe going missing are wrong because it was the Zionists. Various memes cropped up mocking Bukhari's allegations, but his shoe also became the subject of a Twitter account and a jokey Change.org petition demanding its return which was signed by several hundred people. Israel's ambassador to South Africa, Arthur Lenk, tweeted: \\"We have your shoe, @AsgharBukhari. Call me.\\" Maajid Nawaz, a former radical Islamist turned liberal activist and chairman of the anti-extremist Quilliam think-tank said in an interview with the BBC that there is an unhealthy anti-Semitic strand to Bukhari's thinking.

It resembles the classic knapsack problem, in which the items to be placed in the container are indivisible; however, the continuous knapsack problem may be solved in polynomial time whereas the classic knapsack problem is NP-hard. It is a classic example of how a seemingly small change in the formulation of a problem can have a large impact on its computational complexity. Problem definition An instance of either the continuous or classic knapsack problems may be specified by the numerical capacity W of the knapsack, together with a collection of materials, each of which has two numbers associated with it: the weight wi of material that is available to be selected and the total value vi of that material. The goal is to choose an amount xi ‚â§ wi of each material, subject to the capacity constraint :\\\\sum_i x_iw_i \\\\le W and maximizing the total benefit :\\\\sum_i x_iv_i. In the classic knapsack problem, each of the amounts xi must be either zero or wi; the continuous knapsack problem differs by allowing xi to range continuously from zero to wi. Some formulations of this problem rescale the variables xi to be in the range from 0 to 1. In this case the capacity constraint becomes :\\\\sum_i x_i w_i \\\\leq W, and the goal is to maximize the total benefit :\\\\sum_i x_i v_i. Solution technique The continuous knapsack problem may be solved by a greedy algorithm, first published in 1957 by George Dantzig,. that considers the materials in sorted order by their values per unit weight. For each material, the amount xi is chosen to be as large as possible: *If the sum of the choices made so far equals the capacity W, then the algorithm sets xi = 0\\\\. *If the difference d between the sum of the choices made so far and W is smaller than wi, then the algorithm sets xi = d. *In the remaining case, the algorithm chooses xi = wi. Because of the need to sort the materials, this algorithm takes time O(n log n) on inputs with n materials. However, by adapting an algorithm for finding weighted medians, it is possible to solve the problem in time O(n).

It is consistently rated among the best schools of public health in the country, receiving recent rankings of 3rd for its doctoral program in epidemiology. YSPH has a unique hybrid existence with the Yale School of Medicine, as it is both a department (established in 1915) within the School of Medicine as well as an independent, CEPH-certified school of public health (established in 1946). According to the school's website, the community benefits greatly from the Yale School of Public Health's dual roles of providing a world‚Äìclass education as an accredited, fully functioning school, and by conducting cutting‚Äìedge, interdisciplinary research through its collaborative departmental partnerships at the School of Medicine and across the Yale campus. Curricula The Yale School of Public Health provides a public health education program with a low student to faculty ratio. YSPH awards Master of Public Health degrees as well as Master of Science and Ph.D degrees through the Yale Graduate School. Programs of study include biostatistics, chronic disease epidemiology, environmental health sciences, epidemiology of microbial diseases, health care management, health policy, and social and behavioral sciences. YSPH also offers a global health concentration, public health modeling concentration, climate change and health concentration, and US health and justice concentration as well as a track in regulatory affairs, which are taken in conjunction with one of the core programs. The school also offers a one-year Advanced Professional MPH program for students who have already attained an advanced degree, a 22-month joint MPH and MBA with the Yale School of Management, and a five-year BA/MPH program for students of Yale College and Yale-NUS College. In addition, the School of Public Health offers joint degrees in divinity (MDIV/MPH and MAR/MPH), forestry and environmental studies (MF/MPH, MFS/MPH, MESC/MPH, and MEM/MPH), law (JD/MPH), management (MBA/MPH), nursing (MSN/MPH), international and development economics (MA/MPH), international affairs and cultural studies (MA/MPH with the MacMillan Center), and physician associate studies (MMSC/MPH). YSPH students may take classes at the College and several of the University's graduate or professional schools if they find them relevant to their course of study. This includes the Yale Divinity School, Yale Law School, Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, Yale School of Nursing, Yale School of Drama, and Yale School of Management. Admissions Admissions to the Yale School of Public Health is extremely competitive and class sizes are the smallest among top-tier graduate public health programs around the country. Total enrollment in 2008 was 246 students (65 male, 181 female), with 98% maintaining full-time status. The incoming MPH class of 2009 consisted of 125 students (36% male, 64% female, 15% students of color, and 18% international), and represented 88 schools and 31 states. The incoming MPH class of 2018 consisted of 155 students (34% male, 66% female, 14% diversity population, and 26% international), and represented 95 schools and 39 states. YSPH does not report average GPA or GRE scores of incoming students, though unofficial reports report an average admitted GPA of 3.85 out of 4.00, making it one of the most selective public health schools in the nation. Academics The Yale School of Public Health offers a number of specialty certificates in addition to students' departmental studies in a number of interdisciplinary concentrations, tracks and programs. Programs are offered in: Global Health, Public Health Modeling, Climate Change and Health, US Health and Justice, and the Regulatory Affairs Track. All courses taken outside of YSPH must be graded (H, HP, P) in order to receive a course unit. Students are allowed to enroll in courses in other Yale schools if there is space available and if the instructor agrees. Courses taken at Yale College (undergraduate) must typically be at the 300-series level or above in order to receive a course unit toward the M.P.H. degree. Some 200-series courses at Yale College may count if approved by the student's faculty adviser. The YSPH grading system is designed to foster an atmosphere of cooperative learning. Consequently, YSPH does not compute the grade point average (GPA) or class rank of its students. Students are graded only to provide them with a formal evaluation of their understanding of the concepts presented in their courses. The Internship, seminars, and colloquia receive a grade of Satisfactory (S) upon successful completion. The grade of ‚ÄúQ‚Äù indicates courses for which a student has received a course exemption. 1\\\\. A grade of Honors should be assigned for performance that is distinguished. This reflects contributions that go beyond the requirements for the course, either in terms of the creativity of their application, the complexity of the settings in which the ideas are applied, or their ability to build on the methods and ideas taught in the class. Recognized grade equivalent: A+ 2\\\\. A grade of High Pass should be assigned for students who have demonstrated a proficiency in the use of class material. Students earning this grade not only understand the material that was taught but can also deploy it in constructive ways for new problems. Recognized grade equivalent: A 3\\\\. A grade of Pass should be assigned for students who have demonstrated an understanding of the class material. They must be able to accurately describe ideas and methods and identify contexts in which they are appropriately used. Passing grades indicate that students are capable of performing competently in this domain as public health professionals. Recognized grade equivalent range: B-C 4\\\\. A grade of Fail should be assigned to students who cannot demonstrate an acceptable understanding of the core ideas, methods, or other class material and thus lack competence in this domain of public health. Mission statement The School of Public Health at Yale University provides leadership to protect and improve the health of the public. Through innovative education, research, policy analysis and practice that draws upon interdisciplinary scholarship from across the graduate and professional programs at Yale, the school serves local, national and international communities with its knowledge and expertise. We foster health equity, social justice and respectful discourse to enrich our teaching and scholarship, as well as empower the communities that we serve. History Founded in 1915, Yale's School of Public Health is one of the oldest of the nationally accredited schools of public health. It began when, in 1914, the University received an endowment from the Lauder Greenway Family to establish a chair in public health at the Yale Medical School. This chair was filled a year later by Charles-Edward Amory Winslow, who was and is still considered to be the ‚Äúfounder of public health‚Äù at Yale. In its early years, Winslow's Department of Public Health at Yale was a catalyst for public health reform in Connecticut, and the health surveys prepared by him and his faculty and students led to considerable improvements in public health organization. He also successfully campaigned to improve health laws in Connecticut, as well as for the passage of a bill that created the State Department of Public Health. Drawing on principles and expertise in existing departments at the School of Medicine to supplement public health courses, Winslow focused on educating undergraduate medical students in the context of preventive medicine. He established a one‚Äìyear program leading to a Certificate in Public Health and a comprehensive non‚Äìmedical program that graduated eighteen students with a Certificate in Public Health, ten with a Ph.D., and four with a Dr.P.H. by 1925. His students specialized in administration, bacteriology, or statistics. Due to three decades of Winslow's leadership and innovative foresight and commitment to interdisciplinary education, the department's academic programs earned recognition as a nationally accredited School of Public Health in 1946. In 1946, the Yale School of Public Health received its inaugural status as an accredited \\"school of public health.\\" Because of this accreditation, Yale is in a unique situation of assuming the identities of both a department of the Yale School of Medicine and an autonomous school of public health. In the 1960s the Yale Department of Public Health merged with the Section of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, a unit within the Department of Internal Medicine at the Medical School, resulting in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health (EPH). In 1964, EPH moved into its own building, the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Public Health (LEPH), which was designed by Philip Johnson and continues as the primary location for teaching and research. In 1964, the Arbovirus Research Unit of the Rockefeller Foundation moved to the Yale School of Public Health. It was at the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit (YARU) that Jordi Casals discovered and named the Lassa virus in 1969. He went on to describe and classify over a thousand viruses, and was considered an authority in viral taxonomy. As of February 2017, the dean of the Yale School of Public Health is Sten Vermund (MD, PhD), formerly a professor of pediatrics, medicine, health policy, and obstetrics and gynecology at Vanderbilt University.

Books Kazmi (ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÑ€Å ÿπŸÑ€å€Å) these books: Milad un Nabi (ÿµŸÑ ÿ£ ŸÑŸÑŸá ÿπŸÑŸäŸá Ÿàÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ) Tawhid or Shirk Hayat un Nabi (ÿµŸÑ ÿ£ ŸÑŸÑŸá ÿπŸÑŸäŸá Ÿàÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ) Gustakh e Rasool (ÿµŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿπŸÑŸäŸá Ÿàÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ) ki Saza Migration to Multan Nafir Alam was a Sufi saint who used to celebrate the urs of Khawja Moin-ud-Din Chishti Ajmeri in Multan. He invited young Ahmad Saeed to debate in Multan. When he listened to his speech, he was impressed. So he continuously requested Ahmad Saeed to permanently shift to Multan. Therefore, Kazmi migrated to Multan in the early 1935. In Multan, Kazmi started teaching in his own home near Tinan Wali Khoi. In November 1935 he started giving lectures in Masjid Hafiz Fateh Sher Outside Lohari Gate, which continued for 18 years. After that He started Dars-e-Hadith in Hazrat Chup Shah's Mosque and completed Mishkat al-Masabih followed by Sahih al- Bukhari. In that era, Muslims of India were demanding independence and their major party was Muslim League. Ahmad Saeed was impressed by the Muslim League's program therefore he joined. In the area of Southern Punjab, he worked to spread political awareness among Muslims and to bring them to the platform of Muslim League. He never met with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, yet he was connected with him through mail. On the request of nawab of Bahawalpur and nawab of Kalabagh Hazoor Ghazali e zaman accepted the post of Shaikh ul Hadith in Islamia university of Bahawalpur, and he taught there for long time.

The Battle of Fort Brooke was a minor engagement fought October 16-18, 1863, near Tampa, Florida, during the American Civil War. Battle Two Union Navy ships, and , bombarded Fort Brooke on October 16, 1863. Two days later, on October 18, 1863, as conflict continued, the Battle of Ballast Point took place. A Union raiding party, under Acting Master T.R. Harris, disembarked at Ballast Point, landing at the current intersection of Gandy Boulevard and Bayshore Boulevard. Under the protracted diversionary bombardment of the city of Tampa and Fort Brooke by two ships, USS Tahoma and USS Adela, the Union divisions marched to the Hillsborough River to the location of the Jean Street Shipyard near the site of today's Lowry Park Zoo. The two ships were at the shipyard to have their bottoms cleaned. The Union troops surprised, captured, and burned McKay's two notorious ships, the blockade runner Scottish Chief, a steamship, and the sloop Kate Dale a few miles up the river. The ships and shipyard were owned by the future mayor of Tampa, James McKay. Escaping capture by mere minutes, with members of his crew in tow, James McKay sped to the city of Tampa and warned all of the landing party and the fate of his ships. After the burning of the ships, the Confederate forces were alerted to the raiding party's location, and commenced pursuit. Harris's Union forces were surprised by a detachment of the garrison, the 2nd Florida Infantry Battalion. A brief but sharp exchange resulted in a few casualties before the Union troops returned to sea. A Confederate cavalry unit, the Oklawaha Rangers, finally caught up with the Union raiders, and a full engagement ensued. The union soldiers came under direct fire as they boarded their dinghies in a tactical retreat. The Confederate defenders destroyed the steamer A.B. Noyes to preclude her capture. The remains of Kate Dale are sunk near the west side of Jean Street Shipyard, while Scottish Chief remained afloat while it burned. It was towed back to Tampa and stripped and destroyed.

It is hosted by Candice Olson, one of Canada's top designers. In the show, Olson heads a team of artisans and skilled labourers that includes Paul Daly (carpenter), Lorne Hogan (carpenter), Chico Garc√≠a (electrician), Edmond Joseph (seamster), Terry Edward Briceland (seamster), and Andrew Downward (painter). The half-hour show features Olson's step-by-step interior redesign of a client's living space mixed with campy comedy shorts before each commercial break. Reruns of the show are seen on Yes TV. Show format At the start of each show, Candice meets the home owners and discusses the issues with the room. Next, Candice reveals her point of inspiration, illustrations and colour scheme to the audience. The room is cleared of all contents, then the walls are painted. Next, the lights are installed. The carpenter generally constructs at least one new custom piece in addition to helping to reset the room with all new furniture. Occasionally, Candice will use the room's existing furniture‚Äîif she does, she generally re-upholsters it. Then, the seamster hangs curtains and makes accent pillows. Finally, the room is accessorized. At the end of the show, the room is \\"revealed\\" to the homeowners. Usually before or after ads, small comedic skits are performed, such as one episode where she is seen swinging Tarzan style from lighting wiring (episode number unknown). Throughout the program, Candice chooses a handful of specific pieces or techniques to highlight. She refers to her \\"elevations\\" and room illustrations to help guide viewers through her vision. Candice often dislikes matching furniture sets, which she calls \\"matchy, matchy.\\" For example, she will often choose two very different looking nightstands for a bedroom. Candice prefers to use recessed lighting in almost all cases, using spotlights to highlight artwork or other focal points.

It is associated with a just-in-time and kanban production approach, and calls for an ongoing examination and improvement efforts which ultimately requires integration of all elements of the production system. The goal is an optimally balanced production line with little waste, the lowest possible cost, on-time and defect-free production. This strategy is typically applied in discrete manufacturing as an attempt to handle production volumes comprising discrete units of product in a flow which is more naturally found in process manufacturing. The basic fact is that in most cases, discrete units of a solid product cannot be handled in the same way as continuous quantities of liquid, gas or powder. Discrete manufacturing is more likely to be performed in batches of product units that are routed from process to process in the factory. Each process may add value to the batch during a run-time or work- time. There is usually some time spent waiting for the process during a queue- time or wait-time. The larger the batch, the longer each unit has to wait for the rest of the batch to be completed, before it can go forward to the next process. This queue-time is waste, Muda, and represents time lost that is not value-added in the eyes of the customer. This waste is one of the most important elements targeted for reduction and elimination in lean manufacturing. Reducing the batch size in discrete manufacturing is therefore a desirable goal: it improves the speed of response to the customer, whilst improving the ratio of value-added to non value-added work. However, it should be balanced against the finite capacity of resources at the value-adding processes. Capacity is consumed by changeover whenever a process is required to perform work on a different part or product model than the preceding one. Time consumed in changeover is also considered waste, and it reduces the amount of resource capacity that is available to perform value-adding work. Reducing batch sizes can also increase handling time, risk and complexity in planning and controlling production. The paradigm aim is to achieve single- piece flow where a single discrete unit of product flows from process to process. In effect, the batch quantity is one. If there is no change in part or product model, then this objective needs to be balanced against the additional handling time, and the work-centres that perform the process will typically have to be arranged in close proximity to one another in a flow- line. This is often a characteristic of Repetitive-flow manufacturing and most manual assembly work is performed this way in the modern factory. If there is a change in part or product model, then the process engineer should also consider to balance the changeover time with run-time. If the changeover time is long, as it might be on a machine, batch size reduction is typically preceded with setup reduction techniques such as Single-Minute Exchange of Die. One methodology for Repetitive-flow manufacturing is Demand Flow Technology which combines the principles of Repetitive-flow and demand-driven manufacturing. The production planning and control is linked to a pull signal that is triggered from a customer order or consumption of finished goods stock. A pull signal can also link a process to the down-stream, and synchronize the flow to the demand of the customer.

Until recently, it was thought to be one of only two species of flying lemurs, the other being the Philippine flying lemur, which is found only in the Philippines. This species can be found throughout Southeast Asia ranging from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, southern Vietnam, southern Burma, and Singapore.Nasir, M. D., & Abdullah, M. T. (2010). Distribution of the Sunda Colugo (Galeopterus variegatus) in Malaysia (Peninsular, Sabah, Sarawak). Tropical life sciences research, 21(2), 69‚Äì83. The Sunda flying lemur is not a lemur and does not fly. Instead, it glides as it leaps among trees. It is strictly arboreal, is active at night, and feeds on soft plant parts such as young leaves, shoots, flowers, and fruits. After a 60-day gestation period, a single offspring is carried on the mother's abdomen held by a large skin membrane. It is a forest-dependent species. The head-body length of Sunda flying lemur is about . Its tail length measures , and its weight is . The Sunda flying lemur is protected by national legislation. The Sunda flying lemurs are often hunted by locals with spears or other lethal equipment for various reasons such as food and fur. Habitat loss is known to occur intermittently, particularly in developing countries such as Malaysia. In addition to deforestation and loss of habitat, local subsistence hunting poses a serious threat to this animal. Competition with the plantain squirrel (Callosciurus notatus) represents another challenge for this species. More information is needed on population declines, but at present, the rate of the decline is not believed to merit listing in any category lower than least concern.  Classification and evolution  Skull Jaw with teeth The Sunda flying lemurs' two forms are not morphologically distinct from one another; the large form occurs on the mainland of the Sunda Shelf area and the mainland of Southeast Asia, while the dwarf form occurs in central Laos and some other adjacent islands. The Laos specimen is smaller (about 20%) than the other known mainland population. Despite the large and dwarf forms, four subspecies are known: G. v. variegatus (Java), G. v. temminckii (Sumatra), G. v. borneanus (Borneo), and G. v. peninsulae (Peninsular Malaysia and mainland of Southeast Asia) incorporating on the genetic species concept due to geographic isolation and genetic divergence. Recent molecular and morphological data provide the evidence that the mainland, Javan, and Bornean Sunda flying lemur subspecies may be recognised as three separate species in the genus Galeopterus.  Habits and lifestyle  Sunda flying lemurs live either solitary or in small groups that are loosely connected. They can be territorial in foraging and sleeping areas. They are mainly nocturnal. They are strictly arboreal and in the daytime, they sleep high within dense foliage in the treetops or in holes in trees. With all four of their feet, they cling on to the trunk of a tree or the underside of branches. Climbing involves stretching out their two front legs and then bringing up their two back legs, which results in an awkward hopping. They can glide more than 100 m with minimal loss in elevation. When threatened, they either climb higher up or remain motionless. These animals are quite helpless if on the forest floor.  Behaviour and ecology  The Sunda flying lemur is a skillful climber, but is helpless when on the ground.Vaughan, T.A. (1986). Mammalogy. 3rd edition. Saunders College Publishing, Philadelphia. Its gliding membrane connects from the neck, extending along the limbs to the tips of the fingers, toes, and nails.Feldhamer, G.A., Drickamer, L.C., Vessey, S.H. and Merritt, J.F. (2003). Mammalogy: adaptation, diversity, and ecology. 2nd edition. McGraw-Hill Companies Inc., New York. This kite-shaped skin is known as a patagium, which is expanded for gliding. It can glide over a distance of 100 m with a loss of fewer than 10 m in elevation. It can maneuver and navigate while gliding, but strong rain and wind can affect its ability to glide. Gliding usually occurs in open areas or high in the canopy, especially in dense tropical rainforest. The Sunda flying lemur needs a certain distance to glide and to land to avoid injury. The highest landing forces are experienced after short glides; longer glides lead to softer landings, due to the colugo's ability to break its glide aerodynamically. The ability to glide increases a colugo's access to scattered food resources in the rainforest, without increasing exposure to terrestrial or arboreal predators. In general, the diet of the Sunda flying lemur consists mainly of leaves. It usually consumes leaves with less potassium and nitrogen- containing compounds, but with higher tannin. It also feeds on buds,Yasuma, S. and Andau, M. (2000). Mammals of Sabah Part-2, habitat and ecology. Tian Sing Printing Co.

It can also be seen licking tree bark of selected tree species to obtain water, nutrients, salts, and minerals.Lim, N.T-L. (2007). Colugo: The flying lemur of South-East Asia. Draco Publishing and Distribution Pte Ltd., Singapore. Though the Sunda flying lemur has been reported to also occur in gardens and plantations, the species resides in forests primarily.  Distributions and habitats  The Sunda flying lemur is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, ranging from the Sunda Shelf mainland to other islands ‚Äì Northern Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia (Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak), Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia (Kalimantan, Sumatra, Bali, Java),Corbet, G.B. and Hill, J.E.

Stobie claimed that, in a separate incident, the Special Branch had framed him by planting guns at his home.

In the February 1982 Irish general election Sinn F√©in - The Workers' Party had won three seats and found themselves in a position of power. The three TDs voted for Charles Haughey of Fianna F√°il as opposed to Garret FitzGerald of Fine Gael. After the election Ed Moloney wrote two articles on Sinn F√©in - The Workers' Party for the Irish Times. The first dealt with the party's political journey and appeared. The second, which dealt with the continuing existence of the Official IRA and its criminal activities, did not. An unknown member of the Irish Times passed Moloney's article to the Official IRA. Ed Moloney said that this part \\"never appeared and I was never officially informed nor given any explanation by the Irish Times. I cannot even say whether my copy was even shown above the level of sub-editor\\". Ed Moloney then passed on his research to Magill, edited then by Vincent Browne. A two-part series was published in the March and April 1982 issues and they sold out. It was embarrassing for Sinn F√©in - The Workers' Party. The Official IRA set Moloney up to be murdered, though it isn't clear if this was done before or after the publication of the Magill articles. Two members of SFWP told the Ulster Defence Association that Moloney was in the Irish National Liberation Army. Ed Moloney ended up in the UDA HQ in Gawn Street, facing John McMichael, Davy Payne and a third member of the UDA Inner Council that Moloney did not name, but who was still alive in May 2020. Payne in particular had a history of involvement with sectarian torture and murder. Cathal Goulding and the Official IRA must have known that if the UDA had fallen for their allegations, the latter would have abducted and tortured Ed Moloney before murdering him, with Davy Payne as most likely choice for interrogator. Moloney was told that the UDA Inner Council didn't believe the allegations. Although Moloney did not record the date of his confrontation with the UDA, he said he handed over material to Magill \\"some time after\\" the encounter. The assassination attempt was thus meant to kill him and suppress information that had not been published by the Irish Times.

Hughes in 1964), concertos for various instruments (including violin), a symphonic poem entitled Haunted Hills (1953), and the chamber opera The Young Kabbarli (1964; libretto by Maie Casey). A severe stroke in 1969 ended her composing career. Despite the emphasis on non-vocal works in her total output, one of Margaret Sutherland's most recognised pieces is \\"In the Dim Counties\\" (1936) for voice and piano accompaniment from Five Songs. Sutherland sets her music to the poetry of Shaw Neilson, considered a ‚Äò\\"pastoral\\" lyric poet‚Äô from Australia whose verse has ‚Äòsimplicity of form and restraint of utterance‚Äô. Sutherland captures this through sharp rhythms, light instrumentation and ‚Äòeven musical balance‚Äô. Five Songs has been recorded by numerous Australian female artists such as Helen Noonan. Personal life In 1927 Margaret Sutherland married a Melbourne physician and psychiatrist, Norman Arthur Albiston. They had a son (Mark, 1928) and a daughter (Jennifer, 1930, who predeceased her mother).Ch√©rie Watters-Cowan, Margaret Sutherland: Experiences as a music student, teacher and performer.

It shakes and weakens the rocks leaving them open to attack from hydraulic action and abrasion. Eroded material gets carried away by the wave. Wave pounding is particularly fierce in a storm, where the waves are exceptionally large, and have a lot of energy. It is an important engineering consideration in the construction of structures such as seawalls and dams. Wave pounding is a force of erosion along coast lines. The effects of wave pounding are influenced by wave shape, ocean chemistry, rock type, and morphology of the coastal landscape. There are three different types of waves to consider in this process: spilling, plunging, and surging waves. Spilling waves have the least amount of energy associated with them due to their shallow ocean floor. Plunging and surging waves contain the energy associated with wave pounding. Plunging and surging waves occur on moderate to steep angled beach plains. Along with energy, the water chemistry will also affect the rock exposed to the erosion. Salt, calcium, and acid levels in the ocean have adverse effects on specific rock types. The chemical weathering due to wave processes is part of why wave pounding is so damaging. Wave pounding is not primarily caused by tectonic margins. Wave pounding will occur any place around the world as long as the angle of the beach plain is steep enough to generate the plunging and surging waves. The action of wave pounding is the kinetic energy delivered by waves fracturing or removing rock and or sand from land sea margins. Any solid material not fully removed by this action will be hydraulically fractured as well. The surging water fills the existing cracks and physically wedges the rock apart. One specific rock is particularly susceptible to the hydraulic action. Chert rock, or any other rock which has fractured and has had siliceous material fill in the cracks, seems to be very weak to wave action. The water can get into the bubbles and voids in the quartz fracture lines. Some beaches in northern California have broken cliff side with these same fracture patterns on the break line. Some shorelines with wave pounding have large sand deposits and loosely consolidated sand cliffs. Waves in these areas can be extra damaging due to the suspended sand material in the water. These sand cliff faces do not fracture in the same way that solid rock will. Examples on the northern California coast line suggest that the water erodes the weakest veins of sand on the cliff face. This effectively carves out notches and weak points of the cliff leaving a large scale of sandstone ready to fall. A sandy cliff with wave pounding action present will appear as a large sand cliff with deep grooves carved laterally and slumped scales of sand mounding on the bottom edge of the cliff. Wave pounding can be a seasonal event or even a daily event depending on the beach. Specific beaches around the world have seasonal changes in the beach angle due to long shore sand drift patterns. These phenomena will affect the strength that a wave will hit the cliff face. The rise and fall of tides also can mean the difference between a wave spilling onto the beach surface rather than into the cliff face. Wave pounding will affect most jetties and man made outcrops as well. The title of the wave will be different due to the depth of the water at the specific location. The waves do possess the power to damage or move stone on jetties. The steep edges of the jetties allow the waves to crash onto the rock.

As of the 2010 census, the neighborhood had a population of 1,743. The ZIP Codes serving the neighborhood are 33602, 33603, and 33605. The central Tampa area now known as V.M. Ybor, a National Historic Landmark District and now part of the local historic district Barrio Latino, was settled soon after Ybor City was founded in 1885. Ybor City itself was annexed by the city of Tampa in 1887. The \\"V.M.\\" in the name stands for \\"Vicente Martinez\\", as in Vicente Martinez Ybor, the Spanish cigar manufacturer who founded Ybor City in 1885. The area is officially classified as a separate neighborhood from the Ybor City Historic District . History For several decades, many Cuban, Spanish, and Italian cigar workers, managers, accountants and other business owners lived in the middle-class neighborhood just a few blocks north of the commercial district of Ybor City that centered on 7th Avenue. Mid-century, changes in the economics and business ventures of the cigar industry caused many residents to move to other parts of Tampa. Despite this, and the urban renewal that took place in nearby Ybor City during the 1960s, many historic homes and structures in V.M. Ybor maintain their historic framework. Today, many homes, commercial buildings, and cigar factories built in the early 1900s still stand with some functioning as architectural firms, social media and technology businesses as well as design consulting corporations. The early part of the aughts (00s) brought an influx of new homeowners and residents eager to restore the neighborhood to its glory in central Tampa. Geography V.M. Ybor boundaries are Interstate 4 to the south, 26th Avenue to the north, East Tampa (15th St.) to the east, and Interstate 275 to the west. Demographics Source: Hillsborough County Atlas According to the census of 2010, there was a population of 1,743 with 609 households identified in the neighborhood. The population density was 7,236/mi¬≤. The ethnic makeup according to the census of 2010 was 58% non-Hispanic or Latino with 42% identifying as Hispanic or Latino.The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 43% White, 44% African American and 12% identifying as other. . Nearly half (47%) of the residents were between the ages of 18-49. One quarter of the community's residents (25%) were children under the age of 18. The majority of households were married couples, with individually led households constituting 29% of the population and non family households of two or more people making up 14% of the population.

Critical historiography is used by various scholars in recent decades to emphasize the ambiguous relationship between the past and the writing of history. Specifically, it is used as a method by which one understands the past and can be applied in various fields of academic work.  Concept  While historiography is concerned with the theory and history of historical writing, including the study of the developmental trajectory of history as a discipline, critical historiography addresses how historians or historical authors have been influenced by their own groups and loyalties. Here, there is an assumption that historical sources should not be taken at face value and has to be examined critically according to scholarly criteria. A critique of historiography warns against a tendency to focus on past greatness so that it opposes the present as demonstrated in the emphasis on dead traditions that paralyze present life. This view holds that critical historiography can also condemn the past and reveal the effects of repression and mistaken possibilities, among others. For instance, there is the case of the counter discourse to the so-called hegemonic epistemologies that previously defined and dominated the Black experience in America. Some authors trace the origin of this field in nineteenth-century Germany, particularly with Leopold von Ranke, one of the proponents of the concept of Wissenschaft, which means \\"critical history\\" or \\"scientific history\\", which viewed historiography as a rigorous, critical inquiry. For instance, in the application of Wissenschaft to the study of Judaism, it is maintained that there is an implied criticism of the stand of those advocating Orthodoxy. It is said to reveal the tendency of nationalist historians to favor the pious affirmation of the orthodox in attempts to restore pride in Jewish history. A type of critical historiography can be seen in the work of Harold Bloom. In Map of Misreading, Bloom argued that poets should not be seen as autonomous agents of creativity, but rather as part of a history that transcends their own production and that to a large degree gives it shape. The historian can try to stabilize poetic production so as to better understand the work of art, but can never completely extract the historical subject from history. Also among those who argue for the primacy of historiography is the architectural historian Mark Jarzombek. The focus of this work is on disciplinary production rather than poetic production, as was the case with Bloom. Since psychology ‚Äì which became a more or less official science in the 1880s ‚Äì is now so pervasive, Jarzombek argued, but yet so difficult to pinpoint, the traditional dualism of subjectivity and objectivity has become not only highly ambiguous, but also the site of a complex negotiation that needs to take place between the historian and the discipline. The issue, for Jarzombek, is particular poignant in the fields of art and architectural history, the principal subject of the book. Pierre Nora's notion of \\"ego-histories\\" also moves in the direction of critical historiography. The idea of these histories is to bring into focus the relationship between the personality of historians and their life choices in the process of writing of history. It is also proposed that, in architecture, critical historiography involves a strategic choice to approach the position of architecture within the given Symbolic order. This is demonstrated in the way Kenneth Frampton and Manfredo Tafuri associated Marxism with the Frankfurt School's critical theory. A critique of critical historiography cites the risk of judging the realities of the past by the yardstick of what is true in the present so that it becomes illusory and can obscure identity.

He was responsible for free public libraries in Birmingham and was the original proponent of the Birmingham Art Gallery funded from the profits of the gas company. Free education Early on, Collings had shown an interest in education by helping to found the Devon and Exeter Boys Industrial School in 1862. He visited America to study its education system and published An Outline of the American School System in 1868. This pamphlet recommended that a similar free and non-sectarian (non- denominational) form of school education to that of the USA should be set up in England and Wales. Collings' pamphlet led directly to the formation of the National Education League by Birmingham Liberals in 1869, with George Dixon as President and Jesse Collings as Secretary. The League became a major campaigning organisation, but Forster's Education Act retained the dominance of Church Schools in providing education for the young in England, Wales and Ireland. Collings called for Local Authorities to be obliged to set up sufficient schools to enable all children to attend; these schools should be inspected by the state and managed by local government; they should be free; and attendance should be compulsory. Land reform Collings' background in Devon gave him an appreciation of the problems of the agricultural worker and small-scale farmer rare in a major industrial city like Birmingham. He was a friend of Joseph Arch, the founder of the National Agricultural Labourers Union, who lived in Barford, Warwickshire, near Birmingham. Collings believed that education was essential to improving the conditions of agricultural workers and that it needed to be free. The National Agricultural Workers Union joined the National Education League. Collings ensured that Chamberlain, Mayor of Birmingham and a millionaire industrialist, chaired the meeting in Birmingham to support the Agricultural Workers' first strike. When Chamberlain became President of the Board of Trade, Collings acted as his unofficial advisor on agricultural matters affecting peasants in Britain and Ireland. Collings advocated land reform through providing allotments and small holdings for the rural poor, landless peasants, and even the industrial poor. He cited the Chartist settlement at Great Dodford as a successful example of what could be achieved.Great Dodford and the later history of the Chartist Land Scheme, P Searby, Agricultural History Review 1968 p44 The slogan for Collings' 1885 land-reform campaign Three Acres and a Cow became the battle cry of land reform and the fight against rural poverty. Three acres and a cow was seen as being sufficient for a family to live on, particularly when compared to the rural poverty common at that time.Hurst, M. C. (1962) Jesse Collings and West Midlands Politics, 1886‚Äì95. To some, however, this slogan was backward looking and the source of amusement amongst many Conservatives and farmers. Joseph Chamberlain adapted the Three Acres and a Cow slogan for his own Radical Programme: he urged the purchase by local authorities of land to provide garden and field allotments for all labourers who might desire them, to be let at fair rents in plots of up to of arable and three to of pasture. Hardy, D. (2000) Utopian England: Community Experiments 1900‚Äì1945, London: E&F; N Spon Collings founded the Allotments Extension Association in 1883 to promote the formation of allotments and smallholdings. he also collaborated closely with the Highland Land Reform Association. The 1882 Allotments Extension Act was put through Parliament by Collings. By 1886 there were 394,517 allotments of under and 272,000 garden allotments (Haywood, 1991). In 1886, Collings' work defeated Lord Salisbury's Government, which lost the vote on the Queen's speech, when Collings moved his 'Small Holdings Amendment Act'. A Liberal Government under William Ewart Gladstone took its place. Collings' work also led to 1908 Small Holdings and Allotments Act (which led to 30,000 families being resettled on the land) and the 1919 Land Settlement Act. However, the programme of land reform via allotments and small holdings never made a considerable impact upon the countryside, either in Collings' time or in the interwar period.Hayward, H. (1991) Attitudes to the Ownership and Distribution of Land in Britain 1500‚Äì1930, Cambridge: Jubilee Centre Research Paper Member of Parliament caricature of Jesse Collings in Vanity Fair, 1888. The caption was \\"3 acres and a cow\\". He was Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich from 1880 until he was unseated on petition in April 1886, and then for Birmingham Bordesley from 1886 until 1918 (until 1912 as a Liberal Unionist, when the party was wound up, thereafter as a Conservative). On Chamberlain's recommendation, Collings served in Gladstone's administration as Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Government Board in 1886, although at a reduced salary.Powell, J.E. (1977) Joseph Chamberlain, London: Thames and Hudson Collings joined the Liberal Unionist group set up by Chamberlain in 1886 as a result of the split with the Gladstonian Liberals over Ireland. Collings served in Salisbury's government as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1895‚Äì1902. Although he served in Parliament from 1880 (with a small interruption) and was a junior minister in two Governments, he was most influential outside Parliament ‚Äì his ministerial posts were not connected to his lifelong advocacy of free education and land reform. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1892. As a Liberal Unionist The concern of Liberal Unionists was that what they perceived as the need for important reforms was being subordinated to a preoccupation with Ireland. The land reform movement was split. Joseph Arch remained a Gladstonian Liberal and ensured that Collings was deposed from the Allotments Extension Association. Collings later set up the Rural Labourers' League, which supported land reform and advocated tariffs on imported food to support the rural economy. Collings proposed a system of vocational education through free schools in rural areas. Erroneously or not, Collings along with Chamberlain and others believed that land reform in Ireland would give the peasants a stake in the country and reduce poverty, but convinced neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives to attempt it. He was made an Honorary Freeman of the City of Birmingham in 1911. Collings published Land Reform in 1906 and in 1914 The Colonization of Rural Britain. He also published The Great War: Its Lessons and Warnings in 1915. Collings continued to be active in promoting land reform until 1918, when he retired from Parliament on the abolition of his seat when he was then aged 87 and oldest member of the House. He died in November 1920 aged 88.  Portrait  A portrait of Collings, painted circa 1885, by Jonathan Pratt (1835‚Äì1911), hangs in Birmingham Council House.

History =Origins of the clan= The name Maitland is of Norman origin and was originally spelt Mautalent, Mautalen, Matulant or Matalan, it translates as \\"evil genius\\". It is claimed that the Maitlands descend from one of the companions of William the Conqueror who later settled in Northumberland. The name is found on numerous early charters as Matulant, Mautalant and Maltalant. It has been suggested that it was a nickname meaning 'bad' or 'poor wit', however Alexander Nisbet gives Quasi mutilatus in bello which means As if mutilated in war. During the reign of Alexander III of Scotland, Sir Richard Matulant acquired the lands of Thirleston, Blyth and Hedderwick. He became one of the most considerable barons in the Scottish Borders. He had come into ownership of Thirlestane by his marriage to Avicia, heiress to Thomas de Thirlestane. =Wars of Scottish Independence= Sir William Mautlant de Thirlstane supported Robert the Bruce in the cause of Scottish independence and was present at the Scottish victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. His son was Sir Robert Maitland who inherited his father's lands as well as receiving a charter for the lands of Letherington near Haddington, from Sir John Gifford in about 1345. He was survived by three sons: John, William and Robert of Shivas. Robert is the ancestor of the Aberdeenshire branch of the Clan Maitland, whose senior line lived at Balhargardy near Inverurie. William's successors were styled as \\"of Letherington\\", while the eldest son John became involved in the conspiracies of George Dunbar I, Earl of March who was his kinsman. William's son, Robert Maitland, surrendered Dunbar Castle to the Earl of Douglas and as a result escaped from being involved in the ruin of his uncle, John. The heir of Sir Robert Maitland was William Maitland of Letherington who received a charter confirming his lands of Blyth, Hedderwick and Tollus. =16th century and Anglo-Scottish wars= William Maitland's great-grandson was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. The heir of the Maitland knight killed at Flodden was Sir Richard Maitland who was appointed a judge of the Court of Session and Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland. Sir Richard Maitland's eldest son was William Maitland who has passed into Scottish history as Secretary Letherington, confidante of Mary, Queen of Scots. However he fell from favour for his involvement in the murder of David Rizzio who was Mary' secretary, although he was allowed to return to court a year later. He supported Mary's marriage to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, but later joined the nobles who opposed the queen at the Battle of Carberry Hill and also the Battle of Langside. Maitland attended the coronation of the infant James VI of Scotland in 1567 but kept in secret communication with the queen during her escape from Loch Leven Castle. As a result Maitland was declared a traitor by Parliament in June 1573 and as his son died without issue he was succeeded by his brother, John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane. Sir John Maitland was created the 1st Lord of Thirlestane and married the heiress of Lord Fleming. He was Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland in the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, and his son was created the first Earl of Lauderdale. His sister, Anne married Robert, Lord Seton son of the 1st Earl of Winton. Through frequent marriages with the families of Fleming and Clan Seton the Clan Maitland became loyal adherents to Mary, Queen of Scots, even when her fortunes were at their lowest. =17th century and Civil War= Thirlestane Castle, historic seat of the chiefs of Clan Maitland. It was converted into a renaissance palace by John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale. The only son of John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane was created the first Earl of Lauderdale in 1616. John Maitland, 1st Earl of Lauderdale was President of the Council and a Lord of Session. His son was John Maitland, 2nd Earl of Lauderdale who was created Duke of Lauderdale in 1672. The Duke had fought for Charles II of England at the Battle of Worcester in 1651 where he was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London for nine years. After the Restoration he had rose to become the most powerful man in Scotland and was created a Duke in 1672. However he was also the first and last Duke of Lauderdale. The Duke employed Sir William Bruce to convert his Thirlestane Castle into a renaissance palace. =18th century and Jacobite risings= During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Jacobite leader, Charles Edward Stuart stayed at Thirlestane and his army camped in the parklands after their victory at the Battle of Prestonpans, however the Maitlands were not noted Jacobites and as a result escaped forfeiture. =19th century and Napoleonic wars= At the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, General Sir Peregrine Maitland commanded the Foot Guards. Napoleon later surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland of the Royal Navy. In 1828 the Maitland Club was founded which was a text publication society named after Richard Maitland who was chief of the clan in the 16th century. Clan Chief After the death on 2 December 2008 of The Rt. Hon. Sir Patrick Francis Maitland, the chiefdom passed to his son Ian Maitland, Bt, The 18th Earl of Lauderdale, Viscount of Lauderdale, Viscount of Maitland, Lord Maitland of Thirlestane, Lord Thirlestane and Boltoun, 14th Baronet Maitland, Chief of Maitland.Standing Council of the Baronetage: the official roll of the baronets Clan Castles *Thirlestane Castle is the prime Maitland property in Scotland. *Tibbers Castle lands were granted 23 August 1369 to john Mautaland of Thirlestane by the Earl of March, whose sister Agnes he married at about that time.

It developed from an area of low pressure in the southeast Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Keys, and moved across the state of Florida. As it entered the warm waters of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, it began to rapidly intensify, exhibiting traits of a tropical system, including the formation of an eye. It attained a pressure of 970 millibars on December 23 and 24, and after moving northward, it came ashore near New York City on Christmas Eve. Because of the uncertain nature of the storm, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not classify it as a tropical cyclone. Heavy rain from the developing storm contributed to significant flooding in South Carolina. Much of the rest of the East Coast was affected by high winds, coastal flooding, and beach erosion. New York State and New England bore the brunt of the storm; damage was extensive on Long Island, and in Connecticut, 130,000 households lost electric power during the storm. Widespread damage and power outages also occurred throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where the storm generated waves along the coast. Because of the warm weather pattern that contributed to the storm's development, precipitation was limited to rain. Two people were killed, and damage amounted to at least $21 million. Meteorological history alt=A map depicting a storm near Florida The storm originated in an upper-level low pressure system that moved southeastward from the central Great Plains into the Deep South of the United States. After reaching the southeast Gulf of Mexico, the disturbance underwent cyclogenesis, and the resultant system moved through Florida on December 22 in response to an approaching trough. National Hurricane Center forecaster Jack Beven noted that \\"as it moved out into the Bahamas, it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm.\\" The uncertain nature of the storm prevented the NHC from issuing advisories on it, and forecasters lacked sufficient data to fully assess the cyclone for potential tropical characteristics. The same trough that pushed the storm across Florida had moved to the north, allowing for high pressure to develop in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Deemed a \\"hybrid storm\\", the cyclone rapidly intensified in warm waters of up to from the Gulf Stream combined with a cold air mass over the United States. The system continued to rapidly intensify while moving within the Gulf Stream; it developed central convection, an unusual trait for an extratropical cyclone, and at one point exhibited an eye. Despite these indications of tropical characteristics, \\"There was no front associated with it and it had a warm core, but the radius of maximum winds was more than , so under the standard NHC criteria it didn't qualify as a tropical storm.\\" On December 23 and 24, the nor'easter intensified to attain a barometric pressure of . An upper-level low pressure system that developed behind the storm began to intensify and grew to be larger in size than the original disturbance. In an interaction known as the Fujiwhara effect, the broad circulation of the secondary low swung the primary nor'easter northwestward towards southern New York and New England. The original low passed along the south shore of Long Island, and made landfall near New York City on December 24. Subsequently, it moved over southeastern New York State. On December 25, the system began to rapidly weaken as it moved towards Nova Scotia, before the pair of low pressure systems moved out to sea in tandem in the early hours of December 26. Effects =Southeast United States= In South Carolina, flooding associated with the cyclone was considered to be the worst since 1943. Over of rainfall was reported, while winds brought down trees and ripped awnings. In addition, the coast suffered the effects of beach erosion. Thousands of electric customers in the state lost power. As a result of the heavy rainfall, several dams became overwhelmed by rising waters. Extensive flooding of roads and highways was reported, many of which were closed as a result. Up to of water flooded some homes in the region. Approximately 300 people in Florence County were forced to evacuate because of the flooding, and at least 200 homes were damaged. Two deaths were reported in the state. One woman was killed when her vehicle hydroplaned and struck a tree, and another person drowned after her car was struck by another vehicle. Total damage in South Carolina amounted to at least $4 million. alt=A map depicting two large storms near the United States Strong winds occurred along the North Carolina coast. Diamond Shoals reported sustained winds of , and offshore, winds gusted to . On Wrightsville Beach, rough surf eroded an ledge into the beach. On Carolina Beach, dunes were breached and some roads, including portions of North Carolina Highway 12, were closed. =Mid- Atlantic= As the primary storm entered New England, the secondary low produced minor coastal flooding in the Tidewater region of Virginia on December 23. Winds of and tides to above normal were reported. In Sandbridge, Virginia Beach, Virginia, a beachfront home collapsed into the sea. Several roads throughout the region suffered minor flooding. Strong winds resulting from the tight pressure gradient between the nor'easter and an area of high pressure located over the United States brought down a few utility poles, which sparked a brush fire on December 24. The fire, quickly spread by the wind, burned a field. The winds brought down several trees. Damage was light in Maryland. Some sand dunes and wooden structures were damaged, and above- normal tides occurred. In New Jersey, high winds caused power outages and knocked down trees and power lines. Minor coastal flooding of streets and houses was reported. Otherwise, damage in the state was minor. The storm brought heavy rainfall and high winds to New York State and New York City on December 23 and 24. Gusts of downed hundreds of trees and many power lines on Long Island. Several homes, in addition to many cars, sustained damage. Roughly 112,000 Long Island Lighting Company customers experienced power outages at some point during the storm. As the cyclone progressed northward into New York State, high winds occurred in the Hudson Valley region. Throughout Columbia, Ulster and Rensselaer Counties, trees, tree limbs, and power lines were downed by the winds. At Stephentown, a gust of was reported. Ulster County suffered substantial impacts, with large trees being uprooted and striking homes. Across eastern New York State, 25,000 households lost power as a result of the nor'easter. On the North Fork of Long Island, in Southold, a seaside home partially collapsed into the water. =New England= In Connecticut, the storm was described as being more significant than anticipated. Gale-force wind gusts, reaching , blew across the state from the northeast and later from the east. Trees, tree limbs, and power lines were downed, causing damage to property and vehicles. The high winds caused widespread power outages, affecting up to 130,000 electric customers. As a result, electric companies sought help from as far as Pennsylvania and Maine to restore electricity. Bruno Ranniello, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, reported that \\"We've had outages in virtually every community.\\" In New Haven, the nor'easter ripped three barges from their moorings. One of the barges traveled across the Long Island Sound and ran aground near Port Jefferson, New York. A man in Milford was killed indirectly when a tree that was partially downed by the storm fell on him during an attempt to remove it from a relative's yard. Northeast Utilities, which reported the majority of the power outages, estimated storm damage in the state to be about $6‚Äì$8 million (1994 USD; $8.8‚Äì$11.8 million 2008 USD). Effects were less severe in New Hampshire and Vermont. In southern New Hampshire, a line of thunderstorms produced torrential rainfall, causing flooding on parts of New Hampshire Route 13. Flash flooding of several tributaries feeding into the Piscataquog River was reported. In Maine, the storm brought high winds and heavy rain. Along the coast of southern Maine and New Hampshire, beach erosion was reported. Additionally, minor flooding was reported across the region, as a result of heavy surface runoff and small ice jams. In Rhode Island, the power outages were the worst since Hurricane Bob of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Throughout the state, approximately 40,000 customers were without electric power. As with Massachusetts, downed trees and property damage were widespread. There were many reports of roof shingles being blown off roofs and of damage to gutters. In Warwick, several small boats were damaged after being knocked into other boats. The highest reported wind gust in the state was at Ashaway, Rhode Island. Statewide damage totaled about $5 million. Massachusetts, particularly Cape Cod and Nantucket, bore the brunt of the nor'easter. Reportedly, wind gusts approached on Cape Cod and, offshore, waves reached . At Walpole, wind gusts peaked at , while on Nantucket gusts of were reported. The winds left 30,000 electric customers without power during the storm, primarily in the eastern part of the state. Power was out for some as long as 48 hours. Property damage was widespread and many trees, signs, and billboards were blown down. A large tent used by the New England Patriots was ripped and blown off its foundation. The winds also spread a deadly house fire in North Attleboro. Although not directly related to the storm, it caused seven fatalities. Because tides were low, little coastal flooding occurred. Outside the Prudential Tower Center in Boston, the storm toppled a Christmas tree. Rainfall of was recorded throughout the eastern part of the state, contributing to heavy runoff that washed away a section of a highway. Total damage in Massachusetts was estimated at about $5 million.

It is an artificial, freshwater dam with a capacity of 300 million cubic meters. It is 23 km upstream of Manavgat town 40 km east of city of Antalya in southern Turkey and located on the Manavgat River which runs into the Mediterranean. Description The dam has four underground turbines with a total capacity of 540 megawatts. When built in 1984 it was the third largest dam in Turkey. As more dams have been built, it is the fifth largest. Because of the arch design, the force of water pushing against the dam compacts the dam and strengthens it. The weight of the dam structure pushes it down firmly into the underlying rock. This design is ideal for dams built in rocky narrow gorges. Construction The dam was designed in the USSR and built by Bilfinger Berger and completed in 1984.

History  Kamp SchoorlKamp Schoorl was built in 1939 as a Dutch army camp. The Netherlands became occupied by Nazi Germany in May 1940. War memorial of Kamp Schoorl Among the prisoners were also people from England, Belgium and France. After a few months the French and the Belgians were released. In September 1940 the English prisoners were transferred to a German camp in the Polish town of Toszek. The first Jews captured during the razzia (pogrom) of 22 and 23 February 1941 in Amsterdam () were transferred in an army truck to the camp. The group of 425 people only stayed for four days after which they were transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp where in June 1941 they were again are transferred to Mauthausen concentration camp. Only two of this group survived the war. For about 1,900 people the camp was their first camp before being transferred to other camps. More than 1,000 of them never returned, mainly Jews and political prisoners. The regime in the camp was mild compared to the other Dutch camps. There was no heavy labour and there was enough food. The camp was closed by the Germans because the camp was too small and located between the dunes. It was not easy to enlarge it. In October 1941 the camp was closed. Some of the prisoners were released, but most were transferred to Kamp Amersfoort, and 25 women were transported directly to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Until the end of the war, militia of the Wehrmacht and the Organisation Todt used the camp as a base. After the war the camp was used to imprison members of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands and was finally demolished in 1950.

History The union was founded in 1889 by Andrew Hall and Arthur Humphrey in West Ham, late in 1889, Navvies, Bricklayers' Labourers and General Labourers' Union.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of British Trade Unions, vol.3, p.124 John Ward had been attempting to found a similar organisation in Battersea, and in May 1890 he was persuaded to join the new union, winning election in June as its first president. The union grew rapidly, and by 1892 claimed 5,000 members. The union gradually spread across England and South Wales, developing particular strength in the port at Barry. In 1897, Ward and Humphrey both resigned, in protest at the union's London-based executive refusing to increase their travel allowances. Ward was appointed as leader of a new South Wales and South Western district, and led a successful strike in Barry. He was elected as the union's general secretary, and moved the headquarters to Barry, although he returned them to London two years later. While Ward remained leader of the union, he was away throughout World War I, leading a labour battalion, and he then led it as an anti-Soviet force in the Russian Civil War. The lack of leadership led much of the union's membership to defect to its main rivals, National Association of Builders' Labourers, the United Order of General Labourers of Great Britain and Ireland, and the United Builders' Labourers Union. In 1920, the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives arranged a merger conference between the four unions of labourers, but Ward returned and withdrew the union from them. He renamed the union as the Public Workers and Constructional Operatives' Union, but it never became a significant force again. In 1929, its Staffordshire district merged into the Transport and General Workers' Union, and the last remnant of the union, still led by Ward, disappeared in 1933.

She was one of the great early women cricketers in England, and captained England for 17 years. In 1973 she was president of the Women's Cricket Association. Early life Molly Hide was born in Shanghai, China and came to England at the age of six. She learned to play cricket at the girls' school of Wycombe Abbey and later studied agriculture at Reading University. Career Hide represented Worcestershire in representative matches in 1932 and 1933 and toured Australia and New Zealand with Betty Archdale's first English women touring team to those countries. She scored a hundred in the Christchurch Test, where England defeated New Zealand in a one-sided match. Hide was given the captaincy of the South of England team in 1936 and, one year later, that of England against the touring Australian women. The series ended 1-1, Hide's major contribution was 5 for 20 in the second innings at Blackpool where England won by 25 runs. During World War II, she worked in her father's farm in Haslemere. Test cricket resumed after 11 years with a tour of Australia which England lost 0-1. Hide scored 63 & 124* in the drawn match at Sydney. She scored five hundreds in the tour including one in Colombo. She also captained England at home against Australia in 1951 and New Zealand in 1954. Hide was a quick scoring right-handed batsman and bowled medium-paced off-spinners. In her youth she also played lacrosse for England and was thus a dual international for England. Hide never married. According to G. D.

The mall, managed by Simon Property Group, which manages 25% of it, has a parking deck on the northwestern side. Its anchor stores are Belk, Dillard's, Forever 21, and JCPenney. Other stores located at the mall include Aldo, H&M;, LOFT, MAC, LUSH Fresh Handmade Cosmetics, Jos. A. Bank, The Buckle, Express, PacSun, Skechers, and The Walking Company.  History  The mall opened on September 26, 1990 with JCPenney, Maison Blanche (originally slated to open as May- Cohen's/May Florida), and Sears, followed by the opening of Dillard's (first proposed as Ivey's, which was purchased on June 4) in 1991. Furthermore, Parisian was dedicated in 1994, which was also done a year later at the brand new Seminole Towne Center. Maison Blanche changed twice-first to Gayfers in early 1992 and then Belk in late 1998. A major renovation in 2005 featured a new entrance with stained glass, neutral paint colors to complement Italian limestone on the ground floor, replacing restrooms, ceilings, lighting, benches, lounge chairs, modernizing the glass elevator, and a new children's play area. Nearly $10.5 million was spent and the changes were completed in April. On August 2, 2006, Saks Incorporated announced an agreement to sell its Parisian specialty department store business to Belk, Inc. Shortly thereafter, the Avenues Parisian store was briefly closed and converted into the men's and children's store, with the women's departments staying in the existing store, where Belk consolidated all of its departments in February 2010. On November 18, 2010, Forever 21 opened its doors in the location formerly occupied by the Belk Men and Kids store. This is Forever 21's second-largest location in the country and largest in the entire state of Florida, at 116,000 square feet (at the time, the space represented 8.8% of the mall's 1.1 million square feet). On August 31, 2019, Sears announced that it would be closing this location as part of a plan to close 85 stores nationwide. The store closed in December 2019.

It is dedicated to Saint Boniface of Tarsus and (originally only) Saint Alexius. It lies on Piazza Sant‚ÄôAlessio 23, near the historical gardens of St. Alexius and Via di santa Sabina.  Basilica  Icon of Madonna di Sant‚Äô Alessio (Madonna of St. Alexis; Madonna of Intercession) The Chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament and Madonna di Sant'Alessio in Basilica of the Saints Bonifacio and Alexis Founded between the 3rd and 4th centuries, it was restored in 1216 by Pope Honorius III (some columns of his building survive in the present building's eastern apse); in 1582; in the 1750s by Tommaso De Marchis (his main altar survives); and between 1852 and 1860 by the Somaschi, which congregation still serves it as a rectory church. The 16th century style facade, elaborated from the De Marchis phase, is built onto the medieval-style quadriportico. The church has a Romanesque campanile. On the south side of the nave is the funerary monument Eleonora Boncompagni Borghese of 1693, to a design of Giovan Contini Batiste, and in the south transept the Chapel of Charles IV of Spain, with the icon Madonna di sant'Alessio, an Edessa icon of the Intercession of the Madonna dating from the 12-13th centuries, thought to have been painted by St Luke the Evangelist and brought from the East by St Alexius. The church also contains the tombstone of Peter Savelli (of the same family as Pope Honorius III). In a Romanesque crypt that survives below the church, the main altar contains relics of St Thomas of Canterbury. The crypt's 12th-century wall of frescoes depicts the Agnus Dei and symbols of the Four Evangelists, and on the north aisle St Gerolamo Emiliani introducing orphans to the Virgin by Jean Francois De Troy, and at the end of the aisle The Holy Steps and the titular church of Saint Alexius in wood and stucco by Andrea Bergondi. Connected to the basilica are the buildings of the former monastery, which now belong to the Italian state. In 2015 and again on June 29 2019, it was noticed by the Italian press the discovery of a Middle Age fresco in an exceptional state of preservation and integrity. The painting has been restored and its subject has been identified by the Italian art historian Claudia Viggiani with Christ the Pilgrim. The fresco was firstly discovered in 1965 by the Italian Genio Civile during the stabilization's works of the bell tower, and then discarded for forty years, until 2005. = Burials = * Giovanni Vincenzo Gonzaga  Cardinal title  The basilica has been a titular church for Cardinal-priests (the second order) from 1587, originally called Sant'Alessio.

Biographical information As she states in the Memorias, Leonor L√≥pez de C√≥rdoba was born circa 1362 in Calatayud at the home of Pedro I of Castile (Peter the Cruel). Since her godmothers were daughters of the King, she spent her childhood at the court, along with her mother, Sancha Carrillo, who was Pedro's kinswoman, Alfonso XI‚Äôs niece. After her mother‚Äôs early death, Leonor‚Äôs father, Mart√≠n L√≥pez de C√≥rdoba, \\"maestre\\" [grand master] of the chivalric orders of Calatrava and Alc√°ntara, promised her in marriage to Ruy Guti√©rrez de Henestrosa, son of Juan Fern√°ndez de Henestrosa, King Pedro's head valet and head majordomo of Queen Blanca (Blanche de Bourbon). Following their marriage, Ruy and Leonor moved to Carmona, a fortified city in the south of Spain, near Seville with the rest of the family. While they lived there, Pedro I was killed by his half-brother, who assumed the crown as Enrique II, and besieged Carmona, because Mart√≠n L√≥pez and his family were partisans of the murdered king. After several attempts to capture the city, Mart√≠n L√≥pez finally surrendered to Enrique in 1371 under a promise of safe conduct out of the country. However, the king did not keep his promise and killed the maestre and imprisoned his family in the Atarazanas of Seville. Leonor was only nine years old at the time she and her family were imprisoned. After eight years of hardship, all of her relatives except her husband had died in prison. They were finally set free by a provision in Enrique II's will. Leonor then went to the house of her aunt, Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Carrillo, in C√≥rdoba, while her husband tried in vain to recover their lost properties. On her husband's return after seven years of wandering, having recovered nothing, Leonor asked her aunt for a place of her own to dwell. It was in that place that she built both a home and a chapel. When the Black Death struck C√≥rdoba, in 1392, Leonor and her family fled to Santa Ella and later to Aguilar, where a son died of the plague. Afraid of becoming infected, her aunt's family asked her to leave, and Leonor returned to C√≥rdoba. In the years after 1403, Leonor dwelt at the court of Enrique III and his queen Catalina of Lancaster, to whom she became a close advisor. The chronicle of Juan II's reign writes of Leonor that \\"Catalina trusted her so much, and loved her in such a way, that nothing was done without her advice‚Äù (Estow, 35). Eventually, however, around 1412, Leonor lost the queen's favour and was banished from the court, under threat of being burnt at the stake if she ever returned. She lived in C√≥rdoba until her death in 1420. Work Memorias (Memoirs) are at present considered the earliest extant autobiography in Spanish. The original manuscript, formerly at the convent of San Pablo at Cordova, is lost. The text has been transcribed and published from eighteenth century copies, one of which is today at the Biblioteca Capitular y Colombina at Seville. It is a short narrative of around nine pages, cast as a notarial document (‚ÄúSepan cuantos esta escriptura vieren [‚Ä¶],‚ÄùLet those who see this writing know [‚Ä¶]), and although she claims to be the writer of the text, the abundance of legal terms suggests she dictated it to a notary. Written after her fall from favour at court, the narrative is cast as a testimony of devotion, in which she shows the efficacy of prayer to the Virgin Mary. It is also an apology for her father‚Äôs and her own actions. What begins as an act of piety develops into a defense of her family's good name. The prayers included in the Memorias are intended to certify the veracity of Leonor's story, as the favours with which the Virgin Mary has rewarded them must argue that her father's disgrace, imprisonment and death must be unjust, recasting family shame in the light of subsequent divine protection. The story of physical and spiritual survival in the Memorias constitutes a form of cultural testimony. They may also constitute an alegato (legal pleading) for lost family property.

He is notable for his idylic classical European renderings of such locales as Venice, Lake Como, and the Amalfi Coast in Italy. Early years Bob Pejman was surrounded by art and music from an early age. The son of an operatic composer and a concert musician, he spent his early childhood in Vienna and then, by way of England, moved to the United States in 1976. Pejman began painting by the age of seven and pursued his art education through high school. However, despite his art instructor's insistence for him to pursue an education and career in art, Pejman decided to enter the field of business management. Upon graduating from Rutgers University and after numerous years of employment at software companies such as Control Data Corporation, Pejman secured a position as Vice President of Marketing at Information Resources, Inc., a global market research company. In 1988, Pejman decided to return to the art world by opening a gallery in Short Hills, New Jersey called Pejman Gallery Inc. As a result of his direct exposure to fine art and contact with European masters whom he was representing at the gallery, he decided to start painting again. In 1991 he began his two-year formal studies with the Russian artist, Anatoly Ivanov. Later he attended the Art Students League of New York as well as furthering his studies with the contemporary Impressionist artist, Ovanes Berberian. Among his art instructors, Ivanov influenced Pejman the most by inspiring him to use the techniques of old masters such as Michelangelo and Raphael. Employing these techniques, Pejman blends them with impressionistic colors to achieve a classical but yet contemporary style. Artistic style and influences Pejman's style from the late 1980s onward can be characterized as Romantic Realism or Neo Romantic Realism, which is a style based on Classical Realism. As described by Sarah Seamark, senior editor of Art World News in an article on Bob Pejman that was published in the November 2004 issue, \\"Inspiration for his style, that likens to romantic realism, comes from the Hudson River School, the classic landscapes of Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, the utopias of Maxfield Parrish, and above all, from the Victorian artist Lawrence Alma-Tadema, known for his theatrical paintings of Roman ruins. While the influence of these masters is evident in Pejman's works, it is through his unique arrangement and depiction of the subject matters that he achieves a distinctive style. It is the effect of beauty and solitude together that creates this romantic mood that Pejman wishes to offer collectors of his work.\\" Pejman's style has been likened to theatrical set designs by many art critics. This design element together with his combination of classical painting style and use of contemporary colors make Pejman's works notable in the school of Classical Realism. Art critic Eileen Watkins, in her review of a Pejman exhibition in The Newark Star Ledger that was published on October 27, 1995 stated, \\"Many of these works resemble theatrical sets, with the nearer elements framing dramatic vistas.\\" In describing one of Pejman's works, she goes on to say, \\"'Spring Time in Persepolis' features a ruined temple, its gray stone columns and walls carved with animals and soldiers. A slab in the foreground, however, displays spring flowers in a cracked vase, lush, dewy fruit and a colorful bird -- the meticulous details suggest a 17th Century Dutch still life, but without the gloomy lighting.\\" In a review and interview published in the March 1997 issue of Heritage Magazine, art critic and contributing writer Anna Ahkami describes Bob Pejman's style as, \\"Blending realism, impressionism and fantasy, Bob Pejman's paintings offer a modern look at the ancient ruins of the Mediterranean and Middle East. Fragments of stone temples, majestic villas and overgrown gardens, some of which no longer exist, are painted in direct, clear-cut detail. Pejman relies upon his vivid imagination to rebuild these relics showing the impact centuries of wind, nature and man's own destruction have had upon them. Using bright, contemporary luminescent colors viewers are welcomed into such lush yet forgotten places as Persepolis, Babylon and Pompeii.\\" National publication reviews and articles *Art World News, May 2004, article by Sarah Seamark (senior editor) *Art Business News, April 2002 article by Audrey S.

He cemented his social standing with the construction of the Palais Strousberg in Berlin's Wilhelmstrasse, built in 1867‚Äì68 according to plans designed by August Orth, which later became the seat of the British Embassy. Life Baruch Hirsch Strausberg was born at Neidenburg (present-day Nidzica, Poland) in the Province of East Prussia, he changed his first names to Barthel Heinrich whilst attending the Gymnasium (Secondary School) in K√∂nigsberg. After the early death of his father, he moved to London in September 1839, where he initially lived with his mother's brother Peter Gottheimer, who jointly owned a fancy goods business with his brother Lesser. A third brother, Berton Gottheimer, was also in London in the same business. Strousberg Anglicized his name to Bethel Henry and converted to Christianity. On 13 March 1845 he married Mary Ann Swan at St Bride's Church in Fleet Street. In July 1847 Strousberg was working as an agent for several building societies and entrusted to handle member's payments. For some reason, he took an amount of money and booked a passage to America, but was found out when the steamer had to return to Southampton having loaded the wrong grade of coal. Strousberg was tried, found guilty, and served six months imprisonment with hard labour. A year after his release the Strousberg's first son, Bethel Henry Jun., was born; and in January 1849 the three of them travelled to the USA returning in April 1850. Their second son Arthur was born in the autumn of that year. By 1854 Strousberg had become a successful publisher and journalist and was also a manager of an insurance company. Socially he was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Strousberg and his family, painting by Ludwig Knaus, 1870 By the early 1860s he had gone back to Germany and embarked on a second career as a railway entrepreneur and industrialist. With good contacts to the Prussian state government and backed by British financiers, he acquired the licence to build the East Prussian Southern Railway line from Tilsit to Insterburg in 1862, followed by the Berlin‚ÄìG√∂rlitz railway line opened in 1866/67. He also founded the Hanover-Altenbeken Railway and the Halle-Sorau- Guben Railway companies in 1868. Strousberg engaged general contractors responsible for the construction of the railway lines, whom he paid with block of shares in instalments according to the building progress. He himself had to raise less capital while Strousberg's stockholders initially generated high profits, however, the nominal value of the shares reached dubious heights with regard to the actual costs of constructing. In 1868 he also purchased the iron foundry and engineering works of Georg Egestorff in Hanover, predecessor of Hanomag, and operated the Berlin cattle market. Strousberg was generally known as a fair and caring employer. From 1867 to 1871 he was a member of the North German Reichstag for the constituency K√∂nigsberg 9, also including Allenstein and R√∂ssel.Reichstag des Norddeutschen Bundes 1867-1870.

Though a member of the Prussian Conservative Party he did not join any faction in the Reichstag.Fritz Specht and Paul Schwabe, Die Reichstagswahlen von 1867 bis 1903. Eine Statistik der Reichstagswahlen nebst den Programmen der Parteien und einem Verzeichnis der gew√§hlten Abgeordneten, 2nd ed., Berlin: Carl Heymann, 1904, p. 6. No ISBN. In 1868 he acquired the castle of Miro≈°ov (Mir√∂schau) and the fiefdom of Zbiroh (Sbirow) in Bohemia. August Orth, engaged to build his Berlin city palace, was Strousberg's favoured architect and was also responsible for the G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof entrance building and the renovation work at Zbirow Castle. The castle is now an hotel and conference venue with guided tours of the restored building. His business empire began a terminal decline during the Franco- Prussian War (1870‚Äì71). Strousberg suffered a first setback after he reached a licence by the Hohenzollern prince Karl Eitel Friedrich, ruler of the Romanian United Principalities as Carol I since 1866, for another railway project bypassing the navigation on the Danube river largely controlled by Austria. The settlement with the Romanian government turned out to be ruinous, as Strousberg, due to several technical and financial difficulties, was not able to fulfil the railway contracts. He had to withdrew from Romania with major losses and was forced into liquidation in 1872. His political opponents, led by the National Liberal Eduard Lasker, openly denounced his financing methods and his ties with the state government, enforcing the Prussian trade minister Count Itzenplitz to resign in 1873. Though Strousberg came out of the Panic of 1873 unscathed, he was declared bankrupt in 1875, with Adolph von Hansemann and Gerson von Bleichr√∂der snapping up the majority of his railways for fractions of their worth.Roth, Ralf & al. The city and the railway in Europe. Ashgate Publishing, 2003. Accessed 9 Sept 2010. After having fled to Saint Petersburg, he had to stand trial in Russia for alleged fraudulent transactions with the cashing of due bills and granting of credits in 1876. He was deported and returned to Berlin, dividing his time between London and at the manor of his son-in-law in Bromberg, whilst attempting his social rehabilitation with various projects and writing his memoirs. Strousberg family plot Strousberg died of a heart attack in Berlin, in hard economic circumstances. His mausoleum is preserved on the Protestant Old St. Matthew's Cemetery in the Sch√∂neberg district of Berlin.

General features The species in the genus Macrourus have large broad heads which are over four times as deep as it is long with a snout which varies from rounded to bluntly pointed, with a substantial modified spiny scale at its tip. They have a strong, suborbital ridge that extends onto preopercle and ends with a sharp point. The eyes have a diameter of around one third of the length of the head. It has small teeth which are set in in moderate to broad bands in the premaxilla which taper posteriorly and ending well short of ends of the lips; the mandibular band is either 3 or 4 teeth wide at the symphysis, narrowing to 1 row posteriorly and extending to about the end of the lips. They have a serrated spiny dorsal fin ray; the pelvic fin usually has 8 or 9 rays. The anus is at the anal fin, there is no photophore. Their maximum size is probably around 100cm. Habitat, distribution and biology The species of Macrourus are found on the upper- to middle continental slope which are restricted to cold temperate and polar waters in both the North and South Atlantic as well as in the Southern Ocean. They are found at depths from around 200 m to greater than 3,000m. They normally prefer temperatures of between 1¬∞C and 4¬∞C, although on species, the Antarctic roughhead (Macrourus whitsoni), has been collected at temperatures which were slightly below 0¬∞C. Fisheries Macrourus species are important food fishes in the North Atlantic and off the Patagonian coast of Argentina. They are normally considered as bycatch in the north eastern Atlantic but they are landed and the weight of catches landed between 1990 and 2015 varied from almost none to 4,000 tonnes. Taxonomy and species There is a controversy about the identification of the type species of this genus, Macrourus rupestris was named as the type species by Bloch but this name is a synonym of Coryphaenoides rupestris. In 1917 Jordan proposed that Macrourus berglax be designated the type species but this also lacks clarity as Sundevall was of the view that the fish named as berglax by Gunnerus was in fact C. rupestris and that M. berglax should be named M. fabricii. This is still to be resolved by the ICZN. There are currently five recognized species in this genus: * Macrourus berglax Lac√©p√®de, 1801 (Roughhead grenadier) * Macrourus caml P. J.

The family was also largely responsible for the growth of Methodism in the town during the 19th century.  Soap and alkali business  In 1816 Thomas Hazlehurst senior (27 February 1779 ‚Äì 18 February 1842) established a soapery (a factory making soap) on the north bank of the Bridgewater Canal between the canal and High Street in Runcorn, called Camden Works. Initially the alkali necessary for the production of soap would have been made from natural sources, such as kelp. However by 1830 it was manufactured synthetically by the Leblanc process.Vardy, Peter I. (2005‚Äì2006) 'Thomas Hazlehurst and his family: Methodism and the Early Chemical Industry in Runcorn in the Nineteenth Century', Cheshire History:45, pp. 67‚Äì82. In 1836 an enormous chimney at least high was built at the factoryChester Courant, 13 December 1836, quoted by to disperse the pollution resulting from the use of this process. The business was very successful and in 1832 it was in the top 20 of the soap-making businesses in the United Kingdom. Thomas Hazlehurst senior died in 1842 and the business was continued by his four sons, William (c. 1801‚Äì2 August 1859), John (12 March 1803 ‚Äì 29 August 1885), Thomas junior (17 April 1816 ‚Äì 14 July 1876) and Charles (27 November 1819 ‚Äì 14 December 1878). William retired from the business in 1849 and John retired in 1857 leaving Thomas junior and Charles to run it. The day-to-day business was conducted mainly by Charles, while Thomas junior concentrated on his religious interests (see below). It continued to thrive and in 1866, their best year, each brother 'took home' a profit of ¬£11,570. Following the deaths of Thomas junior and Charles the business was run by a board of directors. In 1891, in common with most of the other factories using the Leblanc process, the firm became part of the United Alkali Company. The firm's soaps continued to win awards at various international exhibitions until in 1911 the business was sold to Lever Brothers. Soap and alkali making then ceased and the factory was taken over and used as a tannery (Camden Tannery). The trade name continued to be used by Lever Brothers until the 1930s. Thomas Hazlehurst junior  Methodism  In 1806 Thomas Hazlehurst senior was converted from the Church of England to Methodism following the death of an infant daughter, Eliza. At this time there were very few Methodists in the town. However, largely due to his influence, the movement grew and in 1827 it was sufficiently prosperous to build a substantial chapel, Brunswick Chapel, in the town. All four sons were influential in the Methodist movement in the town, in particular Thomas Hazlehurst junior. In addition to his chapel duties, Thomas Hazlehurst junior wrote and distributed free of charge a large number of sermons. He also paid, wholly or substantially, for the building of some 11-12 Methodist chapels and 2-3 schools in Widnes, Runcorn and the villages of north Cheshire, including Frodsham and Kingsley. He was frequently invited to lay the foundation stones of Wesleyan chapels and schools. On each occasion he made a rousing speech and gave a generous donation and received in return a silver commemorative trowel or mallet. In all he collected around 100 of these items.  Civic matters  While Thomas junior concentrated mainly on religious matters, his father and brothers were all involved to a greater or lesser degree in the civic concerns of the town. Thomas senior was a member of the Select Vestry and involved with numerous committees responsible for running the town. William and Charles were both appointed as Improvement commissioners when the Board of Commissioners (effectively the town council) was instituted in 1852.

Thousand Parsec is a framework for creating a specific group of games, which are often called 4X games, from the main phases of gameplay that arise: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate. Some examples of games from which Thousand Parsec draws ideas are Reach for the Stars, Stars!, VGA Planets, Master of Orion and Galactic Civilizations. Unlike commercial alternatives, it is designed for long games supporting universes as large as the player's computer can handle. It allows a high degree of player customization, and features a flexible technology system, where new technologies may be introduced mid-game. History Development of the project (under a different name) was started in January 2002 by Tim Ansell. Originally it was going to be a simple clone of Stars!. Later, Tim decided to try starting a full open source project to become the \\"Worldforge\\" of space empire games. He hoped that this would encourage other people who didn't want to just clone Stars! to help out with the project and give it a broader appeal. After the announcement of the project Lee Begg was the only person who joined it. Lee remained the only other major contributor until early 2007. By the year 2006 Thousand Parsec had not reached the envisioned goals. Partly the problem had been in the underestimation of the amount of work needed and partly because the project did not initially attract any new developers. Despite these setbacks, Thousand Parsec has a huge code base of framework; according to the Ohloh project stats, the project has produced 95,000 lines of code, while Thousand Parsec's own code count puts it at 90,000. The number of features left before full games of the complexity of Stars! can be produced is extremely small. According to the software analysis website Ohloh the project has had 47 individual contributors. Progress since late 2006 and early 2007 has been increasing rapidly with a number of new developers joining the project. The project also went on a recruitment drive by running an AI programming competition and active promotion during linux.conf.au. In 2007 Thousand Parsec was allocated 3 slots in the 2007 Google Summer of Code. In 2008 Thousand Parsec was fortunate enough to be allocated 8 slots for Google Summer of Code. Projects include three new rulesets, a 3D client, three AI-related projects, and a project to extend the server and create a single-player mode. In 2009 Thousand Parsec again participated in the Google Summer of Code, being given 7 slots.

The most recent and the most powerful surge took place on 20 September 2002, resulting in the death of at least 125 people. Morphology Topography of the glacier's surroundings. There are only a small number of glaciers in the Genaldon River's basin, the largest being Maili at approximately in area. The Kolka Glacier, located next to Maili, is a cirque / valley glacier, with some hanging parts. Kolka is fed by avalanches and collapses of firn and ice all year round. Its lowest and highest points are located at and above mean sea level respectively. More than two-thirds of the ablation zone's surface is covered by a morainal layer up to thick. This and other features, such as relatively gentle slopes, a deep cirque and the presence of a lateral moraine restricting the ice flow and forcing it to make a sharp turn, makes the glacier very prone to accumulation of subglacial meltwater. History of surges Historically, the local population have been well aware of the dangers associated with the glacier, which is evident in the unusual locations of the auls. Most settlements of the Caucasian Mountain valleys were built on the valley floor, however, all the old auls of the Karmadon Valley were built on the valley slopes or even on the crests of the nearby ridges. More recently however, a number of settlements have been built on the valley floor. =1902 surge= Aftermath of the 1902 surge near the Tmenikau aul. The first well-documented surge occurred on July 3, 1902, in the midst of an unusually hot summer, when the mean temperature was 2.7 ¬∞–° higher than normal. A series of heavy rains occurred in June and early July, filling the river basins with rain and melt water and by the middle of June, a tongue of the Kolka glacier was on the move. Loud crackling was heard in the nearby settlements and, at times, the Genaldon river was turned into a stream of black mud. By the end of June, the heavily cracked glacier tongue was seen in a narrow gorge next to the Maili glacier. The tongue then partially collapsed, temporarily damming the river. A pulp of ice, water and morainal material then formed a mudflow which streamed down the river's course, stopping near the Tmenikau aul high on the valley slope. The glacier, which was still on the move, then blocked the gorge causing it to fill up with meltwater. A second mudflow surge occurred on July 6 when a 9 km stretch of the valley floor was buried underneath a mass of ice and rocks. Its thickness at times approached 50 m, the scouring of the valley slopes reaching a height of 100 m. The estimated volume of ice that was ejected into the valley, obstructing the gorge, was in excess of 100 million m3. The mudflow speed averaged 60‚Äì70 km/h, peaking at 100 km/h. At least 32 people were killed. =1969 surge= Another notable surge started on September 28, 1969. Because its onset occurred during a colder season with minimal presence of meltwater in the glacier's basin, the event was not catastrophic. By October 4, Kolka's tongue again reached the Maili glacier, having moved 1.3 km. After a month of relative calm, the glacier was on the move again by the beginning of November. A mass of fractured ice, 100‚Äì130 m thick, blocked the Upper Karmadon Springs and moved into the upper parts of the Glenadon valley, travelling at 20‚Äì50 m per day. By January 1970 it had stopped but, by then, the glacier had extended its length by 4.1 km and descended 800 m. =2002 surge= Aftermath of the 2002 surge. The most catastrophic surge to date occurred on September 20, 2002, when a mass of ice, water and rocks streamed down a 4 km stretch of the valley with an icy mudflow travelling a further 12 km. Ice within the debris began to melt almost immediately, creating new lakes and flooding some settlements which, contrary to the old traditions, had been built on the valley floor. The height of the mudflow peaked at 140 m, with the height of the debris near the wall of the Skalisty Ridge reaching 100 m. The village Nizhniy Karmadon, along with several rest houses beside the river were obliterated. At least 125 people were killed and many others were injured. The village has not been rebuilt. The surge resulted in the complete destruction of the glacier leaving behind an empty cirque, a phenomenon not previously observed anywhere else. The large amount of subglacial water resulted in a surge so powerful, that the glacier was practically ejected from its basin. Nonetheless, it reappeared only 2 years later and is currently growing again.

It was used on B-29s during World War II in the Pacific theater for high altitude area bombing, search and navigation. Computation for bombing could be performed by an impact predictor. A range unit permitted a high degree of accuracy in locating beacons. The radome was carried on the aircraft belly between the bomb bays and was partially retractable on early models. The radar operated at a frequency of 9375 ¬± 45 megahertz and used a superheterodyne receiver. Weather radar use The AN/APQ-13 radar was the first military radar converted to civilian use as a weather warning radar. About 30 systems were converted, starting in late 1945. They were installed at military bases.Historical Electronics Museum . The last operational APQ-13 was removed from the Fort Sill, Oklahoma post weather station in October 1977 for display at what is now the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

It is obtained from an interpretation in a multi-valued logic of axioms usually expressing the notion of subalgebra of a given algebraic structure.  Definition  Consider a first order language for algebraic structures with a monadic predicate symbol S. Then a fuzzy subalgebra is a fuzzy model of a theory containing, for any n-ary operation h, the axioms \\\\forall x_1, ..., \\\\forall x_n (S(x_1) \\\\land ..... \\\\land S(x_n) \\\\rightarrow S(h(x_1, ..., x_n)) and, for any constant c, S(c). The first axiom expresses the closure of S with respect to the operation h, and the second expresses the fact that c is an element in S. As an example, assume that the valuation structure is defined in [0,1] and denote by \\\\odot the operation in [0,1] used to interpret the conjunction. Then a fuzzy subalgebra of an algebraic structure whose domain is D is defined by a fuzzy subset of D such that, for every d1,...,dn in D, if h is the interpretation of the n-ary operation symbol h, then * s(d_1) \\\\odot... \\\\odot s(d_n) \\\\leq s(\\\\mathbf{h}(d_1,...,d_n)) Moreover, if c is the interpretation of a constant c such that s(c) = 1. A largely studied class of fuzzy subalgebras is the one in which the operation \\\\odot coincides with the minimum. In such a case it is immediate to prove the following proposition. Proposition. A fuzzy subset s of an algebraic structure defines a fuzzy subalgebra if and only if for every Œª in [0,1], the closed cut {x ‚àà D : s(x)‚â• Œª} of s is a subalgebra.  Fuzzy subgroups and submonoids  The fuzzy subgroups and the fuzzy submonoids are particularly interesting classes of fuzzy subalgebras. In such a case a fuzzy subset s of a monoid (M,‚Ä¢,u) is a fuzzy submonoid if and only if # s(\\\\mathbf{u})=1 # s(x) \\\\odot s(y) \\\\leq s(x \\\\cdot y) where u is the neutral element in A. Given a group G, a fuzzy subgroup of G is a fuzzy submonoid s of G such that * s(x) ‚â§ s(x‚àí1). It is possible to prove that the notion of fuzzy subgroup is strictly related with the notions of fuzzy equivalence. In fact, assume that S is a set, G a group of transformations in S and (G,s) a fuzzy subgroup of G. Then, by setting * e(x,y) = Sup{s(h) : h is an element in G such that h(x) = y} we obtain a fuzzy equivalence. Conversely, let e be a fuzzy equivalence in S and, for every transformation h of S, set * s(h)= Inf{e(x,h(x)): x‚ààS}. Then s defines a fuzzy subgroup of transformation in S. In a similar way we can relate the fuzzy submonoids with the fuzzy orders.

Keller with J. Gilmour Sherman, Carolina Bori, and Rodolpho Azzi in the middle 1960s as an innovative method of instruction for the then-new University of Bras√≠lia.Keller, F. S. (1967). Engineering personalized instruction in the classroom. Revista Interamericana de Psicologia/Interamerican Journal of Psychology, 1(3). PSI was conceived of as an application of Skinner's theories of learning, grounded in operant conditioning strategies of behaviorism. Principles Keller argued that effective instruction should incorporate five principles, the essential elements of the Keller Plan:Keller, F. S. (1968). Goodbye teacher‚Ä¶ Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis 1, 79-89http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context;=physicspsikeller * Written materials‚ÄîThe primary presentation of new content should be through written texts. Given the forms of media available at the time when the Keller Plan was developed (e.g., lectures, movies, audio records, television, radio, paper-based text, etc.), paper-based texts gave students the greatest freedom; books and texts are portable, can be read at one's own pace, can be started and stopped at any time, can be easily reviewed, and can be marked by the reader. As an application of behaviorism, the Keller Plan was meant to maximize the number of operant behaviors that could be reinforced; this could best be done with written materials rather than have the learner be a passive observer of other media. Digital media available today could provide the same kinds of learner control and presumably could be incorporated in a contemporary implementation of PSI. * Units of content‚ÄîSubject matter material should be broken down into separable, meaningful units. These units could have various kinds of relationships; for example, one could provide prerequisites for understanding a second, or the second could provide deeper elaboration of a proceeding unit. In any case, specific learning objectives should be definable for each discrete unit of content. * Self-paced instruction‚ÄîStudents should be allowed to advance through the course material at their own pace. While an instructor might specify the order in which learning units are completed, the learners should decide when and at what rate they learn. Learners could move through a course as quickly or slowly as they choose. * Unit mastery‚ÄîStudents must satisfy a mastery requirement in one unit before proceeding to the next. Typically, a unit in PSI would have more than one equivalent form of assessment‚Äîfor example, three quizzes of equal difficulty or three primary sources or data sets to be analyzed. Students must demonstrate mastery of a unit's objectives to a certain level of quality. If the student does not reach the threshold, they are redirected to unit materials (or supplements if provided) and then take an equivalent form of the unit assessment. From the point of view of behaviorism, demonstrating mastery and being allowed to continue to a subsequent unit was presumed to be reinforcing * Proctors‚ÄîHuman proctors are an important part of the Keller Plan. The proctors could be \\"external\\" to the course (adults or peers brought to the course from external sources) or \\"internal\\" (advanced students in the course who are doing well, have completed all units to date, and have good interpersonal skills). Proctors were the arbiters of unit mastery; they would \\"certify\\" mastery, discuss areas of weakness, and direct students to the next units. Behaviorists were always concerned about bringing conditioned behaviors under the control of \\"natural\\" reinforcers; interactions with the proctors were presumed to provide natural social reinforcers that encouraged learning behaviors and perseverance in the course. While traditional teaching is \\"same pace, different learning\\", a key distinguishing factor of PSI is that it instead advocates \\"different pace, same learning\\". A traditional course might have all students follow the same weekly lectures, exercises, etc., and then sit an end-of-course exam at the same date ‚Äî but possibly with huge variation in learning outcomes (e.g., 95% achievement for a strong student, but just 55% for a weak one). In a course run according to PSI, all students must pass a high threshold of achievement on each module within the course (for instance 90%). The difference between weak and strong students would then be that the stronger ones be able to finish the course quicker, while the weaker ones would need more time.Buskist, W., Cush, D., & DeGrandpre, R. J. (1991). The life and times of PSI. Journal of Behavioral Education, 1(2), 215-234. Application The Keller Plan has mainly been used in higher education, particularly as a more personalized form of instruction in large classes, but there is nothing inherent in Keller's formulation to restrict its application to particular grade levels, content, or types of courses; for instance the papers Klishis, M. J., Hursh, D. C., & Klishis, L. A. (1980). Individualized spelling: An application and evaluation of PSI in the elementary school. Journal of Personalized Instruction, 4, 148-156. and Callahan, C., & Smith, R. M. (1990). Keller's personalized system of instruction in a junior high gifted program. Roeper Review, 13(1), 39-44. report on usage in elementary school and junior high school, respectively. There has been a good deal of research on the effectiveness of PSI which indicated that it had robust, significantly positive effects on learning when compared to more traditional lecture-based formats.Kulik, J. A., Kulik, C. L. C., & Cohen, P. A. (1979). A meta-analysis of outcome studies of Keller's personalized system of instruction. American Psychologist, 34(4), 307.Ironsmith, M., & Eppler, M. A. (2007). Faculty forum: Mastery learning benefits low-aptitude students. Teaching of Psychology, 34(1), 28-31. However, in some cases, self-pacing was also seen to have problems with student withdrawal and procrastination.Reiser, R. A., & Sullivan, H. J. (1977). Effects of self-pacing and instructor-pacing in a PSI course. The Journal of Educational Research, 71(1), 8-12.Semb, G., Glick, D. M., & Spencer, R. E. (1979). Student withdrawals and delayed work patterns in self-paced psychology courses. Teaching of psychology, 6(1), 23-25. In spite of much documented success, PSI has not taken off massively. Education is still dominated by \\"same pace, different learning\\" approaches, and the number of new research publications about PSI gradually declined after its heyday in the 70's. Several possible reasons are given for this, not the least that PSI represented a too radical deviation from established teaching practices and educational management routines.Sherman, J. G. (1992). Reflections on PSI: Good news and bad. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 25(1), 59-64. Other explanations include conflicts within the PSI movement and the challenge that PSI demands more teaching effort.Grant, L. K., & Spencer, R. E. (2003). The personalized system of instruction: Review and applications to distance education. The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 4(2). However, it has been speculated that PSI might see a revival with modern educational technology, as information technology could gradually alleviate teacher burdens related to frequent testing and feedback, as well as mitigate the increased administrative complexity that courses with student self-pacing have over those with instructor-set pace.Eyre, H. L. (2007). Keller's Personalized System of Instruction: Was it a Fleeting Fancy or is there a Revival on the Horizon?. The Behavior Analyst Today, 8(3), 317.

Life Morris was born in Penrhos Lugwy, Anglesey, one of four notable brothers whose surviving correspondence is a valuable record of the time. They were brought up by Morris Prichard and Margaret Owen. The brothers were writers and collectors of literature and patrons of the contemporary poet Goronwy (or Gronwy) Owen. Richard Morris set off for London on 1 August 1722, and only ever returned to Anglesey once. By 1728 he was well known in the London Welsh community, and was a steward at the annual St David's Day dinner of the \\"Society of Antient [sic] Britons\\". Richard got married in 1729. His brother Lewis came to London to work soon after he did; their brother William visited them in 1730, and their youngest brother John, who was a sailor, in 1735. In 1734 Richard got into difficulty after standing surety for a friend who went bankrupt; as a result he spent some time in the King's Bench Prison. His brother Lewis blamed this on the way \\"he neglected his wife and children to help others\\". Eventually he was given a loan by Owen Meyrick of Bodorgan, who seems to have helped him back into employment. His wife died in 1740, and he married again the following year. From one of his marriages he had a daughter called Marian. By the 1740s, Morris was being employed by the Bishop of Bangor as a proof-reader for Welsh pamphlets. He also obtained a post as a clerk in the navy office, where he ultimately became chief clerk of foreign accounts in 1757. His second wife died in 1750 and he married again, his third wife's name being Elizabeth. He is believed to have had ten children from this third marriage, two of whom were daughters named Angharad and Margaret. A son, Richard (born 1762), was sent to be brought up by an aunt in Wales. In the 1760s he is recorded as selling books from his place of work, on behalf of Thomas Pennant, who shared his profits with the Welsh charity school in Clerkenwell, London. He had a house in Stepney, but in 1763 he moved his family to the precincts of the Tower of London, close to where his office was. While working at the Navy Office, Morris became close friends with fellow clerk Wil(l)iam Parry, who was also from Anglesey and would become secretary to the Cymmrodorion Society in 1755. Parry and Morris worked closely together in the Department of Foreign Accounts. Richard's eldest brother, Lewis Morris, died in 1765, and in the following year Richard Morris made his only visit home, when he called on his brother Lewis's widow at Penbryn. After Elizabeth's death in 1772, Richard Morris married for a fourth time, to a Stepney widow named Mary Major. As his health began to fail, he was allowed to take lodgings at the Welsh School in Gray's Inn Road. Work Morris was involved in preparing the editions of the Welsh Bible printed in 1746 and 1752. These were issued by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, in answer to the appeal of Griffith Jones of Llanddowror, Carmarthenshire, for a supply of bibles for his travelling free schools. Rhisiart Morys not only supervised the orthography, but added tables of Jewish weights and measures. He also issued an illustrated translation into Welsh of the Book of Common Prayer. He was a leading figure among London Welshmen, and on the establishment of the original Cymmrodorion Society in September 1751 became its president. He employed Goronwy Owen to translate the rules of the society into Welsh. Sir William Jones employed Morris himself to catalogue the library of Moses Williams. His son, Richard, was involved in the posthumous publication of Lewis Morris's Celtic Remains. Death and legacy After long service, Morris was able to retire, and he died at the Tower of London in 1779. William Parry was named as the executor of his will, but predeceased him. Richard Morris was buried at the church of St George in the East, alongside his third wife Elizabeth and some of their children. He left his collection of manuscripts to the Welsh School and they were later given to the British Library. Following his death, the Society of Cymmdodorion offered a silver medal for the best elegy on its late President; the contest has been as a forerunner of the National Eisteddfod of Wales.

Geography It covers an area of and has a population of 1624 people (2010). History of the Tiszaroff Reformed Church More than three hundred years ago Tiszaroff was located to the North about from the present location. Its church building was made of \\"weaved rod and mud\\" called \\"patics\\" [potits]. It had been repaired in 1713. Because of the flood of the Tisza river the whole village had moved out to its present location. In 1726 Mihaly Borbely the new landlord gave to the Reformed Church the granary that had been built by the dynasty of Rakoczi to be as a chapel. Since that time it has been called \\"Rakoczi's bread house.\\" This chapel was restructured to church building in 1757 by making it higher by 1.5 meter (5 feet) and bigger to the East by 4.5 meters (15 feet); two small churchyards was built to it and on West side a choir was built, which is the \\"boys choir\\". The ceiling was a wooden painted panel ceiling. It can be still seen in the churchyards (now those are under renovation). During the anti-reformation period the Protestants were not allowed to build towers to their church buildings, therefore the Tiszaroff Reformed Church got a permission to build only a \\"watchtower\\" near the church. So there is 6 meters (20 feet) distance between the tower and the church. It is said \\"The church is engaged with the tower.\\" Originally both buildings were shingled roof. In 1802 the first reconstruction work on the buildings began. In 1816 the painted wooden panel ceiling was replaced. In 1846 and 1878 they put a new shingled roof onto the buildings. In 1910 the shingled roofs were replaced by tin plate. The last major reconstruction was in 1968. The first church-clock was repaired in 1818, but we do not know when it was made. The present clock was made in 1894. It is famous for the functions of its hands are mixed up: the hour hand shows the minutes and minute hand shows the hours! There are three bells in the tower. The first organ was built in 1882 with its choir in the East side of the church. The present organ was built in 1941 by master John Barakovics from Budapest. Its style is late Baroque.

It was directed by Anthony Asquith and starred Michael Redgrave. In 1994, a remake was made starring Albert Finney. Plot Andrew Crocker-Harris is an ageing Classics master at an English public school, and is forced into retirement by his increasing ill health. The film, in common with the original stage play, follows the schoolmaster's final few days in his post, as he comes to terms with his sense of failure as a teacher, a sense of weakness exacerbated by his wife's infidelity and the realisation that he is despised by both pupils and staff of the school. The emotional turning-point for the cold Crocker-Harris is his pupil Taplow's unexpected parting gift, Robert Browning's translation of the Agamemnon, which he has inscribed with the Greek phrase that translates as \\"God from afar looks graciously upon a gentle master.\\" =Differences between play and film= Rattigan extends the screenplay far from his own one-act play, which ends on Crocker-Harris's tearful reaction to Taplow's gift. Therefore, the play ends well before Crocker-Harris's farewell speech to the school; the film shows the speech, in which he discards his notes and admits his failings, to be received with enthusiastic applause and cheers by the boys. The film ends with a conversation between Crocker-Harris and Taplow, and the suggestion that Crocker-Harris will complete his translation of the Agamemnon. Cast * Michael Redgrave as Andrew Crocker-Harris * Jean Kent as his wife Millie * Nigel Patrick as her lover Frank Hunter, Andrew's fellow schoolmaster who eventually rejects Millie for her cruelty towards her husband * Ronald Howard as Gilbert, Crocker-Harris's successor * Wilfrid Hyde-White as the Headmaster * Brian Smith as Taplow * Bill Travers as Fletcher * Judith Furse as Mrs. Williamson * Peter Jones as Carstairs * Sarah Lawson as Betty Carstairs * Scott Harold as Rev. Williamson * Paul Medland as Wilson * Ivan Samson as Lord Baxter * Josephine Middleton as Mrs. Frobisher Production Rattigan and Asquith encountered a lack of enthusiasm from producers to turn the play into a film until they met Earl St John at Rank. \\"I started out as manager of a small out-of-town cinema, and I viewed films from the out-of-London angle\\", said St John. \\"This experience made me realise that the ordinary people in the remotest places in the country were entitled to see the works of the best modern British playwrights.\\" Eric Portman originated the role on stage but turned down the film role. Margaret Lockwood was originally meant to play the role of Millie but turned down the part. Jean Kent played it instead. (Kent often stepped into roles originally envisioned for Lockwood.) The film was shot at Pinewood Studios in 1950 and generally released in April, 1951. The school exteriors were filmed on location at Sherborne School in Sherborne, Dorset. The Greek text that appears on the blackboard in Crocker-Harris's classroom is from the Agamemnon. Apparently a description of Menelaus's despair after his abandonment by Helen, the lines were translated by Robert Browning thus: \\"And, through desire of one across the main, A ghost will seem within the house to reign. And hateful to the husband is the grace Of well-shaped statues: from‚Äîin place of eyes Those blanks‚Äîall Aphrodite dies.\\" Reception The film was popular at the British box office.

He received tenure in 1977, and he became the co-director of the Institute for European & Comparative Studies (1987‚Äì1990), and the director of the film studies program (1986‚Äì1989). Many of Ulmer's theories grow out of his home-spun \\"puncepts\\" like textshop, choragraphy, applied grammatology, mystory, heuretics, and post(e)-pedagogy. His explorations into what he refers to as an \\"anticipatory consciousness\\" designed to utilize the force of intuition as a way to invent emergent forms of knowledge, are methodologically remixed by Ulmerian disciples all over the world.

FRSL (18 January 1912 - 20 April 1976) was a British novelist, travel and short story writer known for his highly descriptive prose style. Profile Sansom was born in London, the third son of Ernest Brooks Sansom, M.I.N.A., a naval architect, by his wife Mabel (n√©e Clark).Who Was Who, A. & C. Black, 1971.World Authors, 1900‚Äì1950, volume 4, H. W. Wilson, 1996, p. 2296. He was educated at Uppingham School, Rutland, before moving to Bonn to learn German. Named 'Norman Trevor' at birth, he was called 'William' as a child and used this name throughout his life. From 1930 Sansom worked in international banking for the British chapter of a German bank, and in 1935 he moved to an advertising company where he worked until the outbreak of World War II. Then he became a full-time London firefighter, serving throughout The Blitz. His experiences during that time inspired much of his writing, including many of the stories in the celebrated collection Fireman Flower. He also appeared in Humphrey Jennings's famous film about the Blitz, Fires Were Started, as the fireman who plays the piano. After the war, Sansom became a full-time writer. In 1946 and 1947 he was awarded two literary prizes by the Society of Authors, and in 1951 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 1954, he married actress Ruth Grundy, daughter of Norman Grundy, FCA. They had two sons, Sean (adopted by Sansom; the son of Ruth Grundy's previous marriage to Grey Wilson BlakeEverett Aaker, Encyclopedia of Early Television Crime Fighters, McFarland, 2006, p. 172.) and Nicholas. As well as exploring war-torn London, Sansom's writing deals with romance (The Face of Innocence), murder (\\"Various Temptations\\"), comedy (\\"A Last Word\\") and supernatural horror (\\"A Woman Seldom Found\\"). The latter, perhaps his most anthologized story, combines detailed description with narrative tension to unravel a young man's encounter with a bizarre creature in Rome.

It is adjacent to the University of Minnesota's St. Paul Campus (in Falcon Heights), bordering Southeast Minneapolis on the west, the Minnesota State Fairgrounds on the east (in Falcon Heights), and the suburbs of Falcon Heights and Lauderdale to the north. History St. Anthony Park was formed by the merger of two neighborhoods. North St. Anthony Park, centered around Como Avenue, was originally an independent city established in the late 19th century as a streetcar suburb, consisting of estates for the wealthy of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. South St. Anthony Park is centered around Raymond Avenue near University Avenue, and was built mostly as workers' housing for people employed on the many nearby railroads. Although the two areas have very different histories and housing stock, they have grown more similar over the 20th and 21st centuries due to their proximity and convenience for commuters to both downtowns and to the University of Minnesota. Both are now middle- class neighborhoods with diverse populations and large numbers of professors and academics. Saint Anthony Park was home to three Minnesota governors (William Rainey Marshall, 1866-70; Andrew Ryan McGill, 1887-1889; and Elmer L. Andersen, 1961-63), all members of the Republican Party. In the middle of the 20th century, St. Anthony Park was one of Saint Paul's most conservative neighborhoods. Today, it is one of the city's strongest neighborhoods for the Minnesota DFL. The Hampden Park Co-op, a landmark in the South St. Anthony Park neighborhood. The St. Anthony Park Community Council, which represents the neighborhood in an official capacity before the city, is among Saint Paul's oldest neighborhood organizations. It was formed in the early 1960s in response to pressure from the St. Paul Port Authority and others to expand industrial development into residential areas of South St. Anthony Park, as well as a perceived decline in the standard of housing in the tonier areas of North St. Anthony Park. The organization allowed women to join as voting members in 1972, and a few years later became recognized by the City of Saint Paul as part of its District Council system. The neighborhood's largest park, Langford Park, is named for former Saint Anthony Park resident Nathaniel P. Langford, who helped create the world's first national park, Yellowstone National Park. Other well-known former Saint Anthony Park residents include author, humorist and radio show host Garrison Keillor; Nobel Peace Prize- winning scientist Norman Borlaug;Norman Borlaug: one of us, Park Bugle Nobel Prize-winning author Saul Bellow; children's author Carol Ryrie Brink; John F. Kennedy Chairman of Council of Economic Advisors Walter Heller; physician, poet, etymologist, and essayist Lewis Thomas; psychologist B.F. Skinner; presidential advisor Eugene Z. Young; and architect Sarah Susanka. Saint Anthony Park hosts its own Independence Day parade, which is followed by an all-day, all-neighborhood party in Langford Park. The park includes a recreation center offering hockey, baseball, basketball, indoor and outdoor soccer and tennis, and contains a playground, two tennis courts, indoor and outdoor basketball courts, and two baseball fields that are flooded in the winter to make two hockey rinks and one general skating rink. Transportation The METRO Green Line light rail, which opened on June 14, 2014, serves the neighborhood with stops on University Avenue at Raymond Avenue and Westgate. Minnesota State Highway 280 runs through the neighborhood on its western border. Education Commonwealth Park, in North St. Anthony Park, during winter.

Portrait image of Marianos Biography Mariano was born in S√£o Paulo. In June 1957 the American trombone player Melba Liston invited thirteen-year-old Mariano to participate in her concert at a jazz club in Rio de Janeiro, and he appeared in a program on Rio's Globo Radio called \\"The Boy Prodigy Who Plays Jazz\\". Thar same year, Mariano met Johnny Alf, who went to live with Mariano's family due to their great friendship. Together at the family home in S√£o Paulo, Mariano became familiar with arranging, composing, and the arts of cinema and theatre, thanks to Johnny Alf's encouragement. Through his own instincts, tenacity and raw talent, Mariano formed amateur instrumental and vocal groups, when TV Record in S√£o Paulo invited him for a special called \\"Passport to Stardom\\" (Passaporte para o Estrelato). In the early 1960s, a teenaged Mariano became famous for his ability to swing and for his legendary left hand. His ensembles of that era, notably Sambalan√ßo Trio and Som Tr√™s, are regarded today as high points in Brazilian jazz; so for his 1981 album Samambaia, one of his thirty- plus instrumental albums. Mariano's collaborations with some of Brazil's most important singers like Wilson Simonal and Elis Regina, brought him global acclaim, such as the historic 1973 album Elis e Tom, recorded with Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, that featured Mariano as producer, pianist, and musical director. Since then, Mariano had worked with an international array of musical giants, from Yo-Yo Ma, to Blossom Dearie. He also composed a wealth of soundtrack music for film and TV. In April 1994, Mariano moved to the United States, where he lives with his wife until now. Mariano received the 2006 Latin Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award. From his first marriage with singer Marisa Vertullo Brand√£o, a.k.a. Gata Mansa, he had a son Marcelo Mariano, today an accomplished bass player. He was married to Brazilian superstar Elis Regina for 8 years and they had two children (Pedro Mariano and Maria Rita); today they are both established singers. From his third marriage of 30 years to Flavia Rodrigues Alves he has a daughter, Luisa Mariano (1986), a singer, vocal producer, music business professional and graduate from Berklee College of Music, who worked at Sony Music, Buddah Brown Entertainment, and currently works freelance as Tour Manager and Vocal Producer.

Left- handed and right-handed modes of practice may be evident in both orthodox and heterodox practices of Indian religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism and is a matter of taste, culture, proclivity, initiation, sadhana and dharmic \\"lineage\\" (parampara). Nomenclature and etymology N. N. Bhattacharyya explains the Sanskrit technical term ' as follows: > \\"[t]he means of spiritual attainment which varies from person to person > according to competence.... ƒÄcƒÅras are generally of seven kinds -- Veda, > Vai·π£·πáava, ≈öaiva, Dak·π£i·πáa, VƒÅma, SiddhƒÅ·πáta, and Kaula, falling into two broad > categories -- Dak·π£i·πáa and VƒÅma. Interpretations vary regarding the nature > and grouping of the ƒÅcƒÅras. It is generally held that those who participate > in the rituals of Five Ms belong to the category of VƒÅmƒÅcƒÅra.\\"Bhattacharyya > (1999) pp. 368-69. ' means \\"pleasant, lovable, agreeable\\" and ' means \\"south\\". Facing the rising sun towards east, ' would be the right side. For this reason, the term VƒÅmƒÅcƒÅra is often translated \\"Left-hand practice\\", while Dak·π£i·πáamƒÅrga is translated as \\"Right-hand practice\\". An alternate etymology is that it is possible that the first word of the expression VƒÅmƒÅcƒÅra is not vƒÅma or \\"left\\", but vƒÅmƒÅ or \\"woman\\". N. N. Bhattacharyya notes that a main feature of the Tantras is respect for the status of women as a representation of Shakti, and that if this was the original conception underlying VƒÅmƒÅcƒÅra the opposing term Dak·π£i·πáƒÅcara may have been a later development.Bhattacharyya (1999) p. 113. An alternate term VƒÅmamƒÅrga (\\"Left Path\\") is also used.Bhattacharyya (1999) pp. 81, 447. In this compound the ambiguity between vƒÅma and vƒÅmƒÅ is not present because the final \\"-a\\" in VƒÅmamƒÅrga is clearly short. Practices Vamachara is particularly associated with the pancha-makara or the \\"Five Ms\\", also known as the pancha-tattva. In literal terms they are: Madya (wine), Mamsa (meat), Matsya (fish), Mudra (cereal), and Maithuna (sexual intercourse).Bhattacharyya (1999) pp. 294, 296-7, 423-25. Mudra usually means ritual gestures, but as part of the five Ms it is parched cereal.Mahanirvana Tantra of the Great Liberation Vamachara traditions place strict ritual limits on the use of these literal forms and warn against nonsanctioned use. If so used they encourage the person to sin.TripurƒÅ Upani·π£adbhƒÅsya, v. 15. Practitioners of vamachara rituals may make symbolic substitutions for these literal things, which are not permitted in orthodox Hindu practice.Bhattacharyya (1999) pp. 86-7.Brooks (1990) p. 113. The fact that tantric practices can be done without involvement with the literal pancha-makara is emphasized by Swami Madhavananda, and said to have been practiced by numerous saints.Madhavananda, Swami. \\"The TƒÅntrika Mode of Worship\\" in: Prabhananda, Swami (2000), p. 5. =Aghori= Barrett (2008: p. 161) discusses the \\"charnel ground sadhana\\" of the Aghori pracitioners'Aghora' in Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary [Online].

Source: , (accessed: Monday February 22, 2010) p.161 View espoused in the Brahma Yamala The Brahma Yamala, a Tantric text (though oriented from a right-handed Vaishnava perspective), says there are three currents of tradition: dakshina, vama, and madhyama. These are characterized by the predominance of each of the three gunas: sattva, rajas, and tamas. According to this text, dakshina is characterized by sattva, and is pure; madhyama, characterized by rajas, is mixed; and vama, characterized by tamas, is impure. The Tantras of each class follow a particular line of spiritual practice.Bagchi, P. C. \\"Evolution of the Tantras\\" in: Prabhananda (2000) pp. 13-14. Iconography and tools of the left-handed trade Beer (2003: p. 102) relates how the symbolism of the kha·π≠vƒÅ≈Ñga that entered Vajrayana, particularly from Padmasambhava, was a direct borrowing from the Kapalikas of Shaivism who frequented places of austerity such as charnel grounds as a form of vamacharin spiritual practice. > The form of the Buddhist khatvanga derived from the emblematic staff of the > early Indian Shaivite yogins, known as kapalikas or 'skull-bearers'.

IPI's primary objective is to promote effective international responses to new and emerging issues and crises through research, analysis, and policy development.  History  The International Peace Institute was created with support from UN Secretary-General U Thant in 1970 , originally with the purpose of studying UN peacekeeping and developing peacekeeping doctrine, with strong financial backing from Ruth Forbes Paine Young . Its first President was Maj. Gen. Indar Jit Rikhye, Indian commanding officer of UN peacekeeping forces and a former military advisor to the UN Secretary-General. Under his tenure, IPI initiated an innovative program aimed at training civilians and military officers together for the challenges of preventing conflict and building peace. In 1990, under Olara Otunnu, a Ugandan diplomat and politician, IPI branched out into the political dimensions of war and peace. During this time, IPI became known for its case studies of UN field operations and for its forward-looking analysis on new roles for the UN in the security sphere. Otunnu also initiated IPI's Africa Program, currently its longest-running program. The next IPI President, in 1998, was David M. Malone, a Canadian scholar-diplomat. Malone took IPI more deeply into the realm both of scholarship and of policy advocacy, focused in part on the work of the UN Security Council. IPI broke new ground on the economics of war, on links between the causes of conflict and conflict prevention, the nexus of security and development and on new forms of international governance, such as transitional administration. It became a source of expertise for the media in which Malone and his IPI colleagues published frequent opinion and analytical pieces. Since 2005, IPI has been led by Terje R√∏d-Larsen, a principal architect of the 1990s Oslo Peace Accords (between the PLO and the Government of Israel) and a Norwegian sociologist and diplomat who has served the UN as its senior envoy in the Middle East.Greenberg, Joel & Joby Warrick, \\"U.S. sends officials to reassure nervous allies: Mullen, former U.S. ambassador meet with Jordan's King Abdullah II,\\" February 13, 2011, The Washington Post, retrieved May 5, 2017 IPI today focuses its work on crisis and the response capacity of international institutions, UN reform, state-building/peace-building, and has specific regional programs on the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Offices are currently located in Manama, the Kingdom of Bahrain (MENA), New York, and Vienna. Activities =General= The IPI out work in and on Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Central Asia that involves interacting with international diplomats, dignitaries and scholars (especially from the United Nations) to achieve its goals .

The IPI has convened discussion panels‚Äîparticularly \\"high-level panels\\" made up of international diplomats, dignitaries and scholars (especially from the United Nations) -- to discuss major issues in international affairs, particularly those directly affecting international peace and security. The organization publishes a wide range of reports relating to international diplomacy, peacekeeping and humanitarian responses to crisis. =Vienna Seminar= The International Peace Institute (IPI) Vienna Seminar on Peacemaking and Peacekeeping is an annual event, held in Vienna, Austria since 1970.

A colorless liquid, it is a precursor to many fluorophenyl compounds. Preparation PhF was first reported in 1886 by O. Wallach at the University of Bonn, who prepared the compound in two steps. Phenyldiazonium chloride was first converted to a triazene using piperidine: :[PhN2]Cl + 2 (CH2)5NH -> PhN=N-N(CH2)5 \\\\+ [(CH2)5NH2]Cl The triazine was then cleaved with hydrofluoric acid: :PhN=N-N(CH2)5 \\\\+ 2 HF -> PhF + N2 \\\\+ [(CH2)5NH2]F Historical note: in Wallach‚Äôs era, the element fluorine was symbolized with ‚ÄúFl‚Äù. Thus, his procedure is subtitled ‚ÄúFluorbenzol, C6H5Fl‚Äù.Wallach, O. ‚Äú√úber einen Weg zur leichten Gewinnung organischer Fluorverbindungen‚Äù (Concerning a method for easily preparing organic fluorine compounds) Justus Liebig's Annalen der Chemie, 1886, Volume 235, p. 255‚Äì271; On the laboratory scale, PhF is prepared by the thermal decomposition of the benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate: :PhN2BF4 -> PhF + BF3 \\\\+ N2 According to the procedure, solid [PhN2]BF4 is heated with a flame to initiate an exothermic reaction, which also affords boron trifluoride and nitrogen gas. Product PhF and BF3 are readily separated because of their differing boiling points.. The technical synthesis is by the reaction of cyclopentadiene with difluorocarbene. The initially formed cyclopropane undergoes a ring expansion and subsequent elimination of hydrogen fluoride. Reactions PhF behaves rather differently from other halobenzene derivatives owing to the pi-donor properties of fluoride. For example, the para position is more activated than benzene toward electrophiles. For this reason, it can be converted to 1-bromo-4-fluorobenzene with relatively high efficiency. Solvent properties :Structure of [(C5Me5)2Ti(FC6H5)]+, a coordination complex of fluorobenzene. PhF is a useful solvent for highly reactive species. Its melting point at -44 ¬∞C is lower than that of benzene. In contrast, the boiling points of PhF and benzene are very similar, differing by only 4 ¬∞C. It is considerably more polar than benzene, with a dielectric constant of 5.42 compared to 2.28 for benzene at 298 K. Fluorobenzene is a relatively inert compound reflecting the strength of the C‚ÄìF bond. Although it is usually considered a non-coordinating solvent, a metal complex of PhF has been crystallized.R.N.

Before this people in North America and Europe had wondered why there were no baby eels where they were fishing. Danish research vessel Dana leaving Copenhagen in 1928 at the start of the Dana Expedition Biography Schmidt was born at J√¶gerspris, Denmark. Schmidt began his studies of natural history at the University of Copenhagen under professor of botany Eugen Warming (1841‚Äì1924) ,and obtained an MS degree in biology in 1898. He obtained a grant from the Carlsberg Foundation to study the flora of the coastal areas of Ko Chang in then Siam, including both mangrove trees and microalgae. He made his doctoral thesis in biology and botany, on shoot architecture of mangrove trees and Eugen Warming served as faculty opponent in October 1903. Schmidt then more or less switched to marine zoology, working 1902‚Äì1909 part-time for the Botanical Institute of the University of Copenhagen, part-time for the Danish Commission for Investigation of the Sea. In 1909, he was made head of the department of physiology at the Carlsberg Laboratory, a post he held until his early death. Schmidt worked in parallel on phycology, where he described the genus Richelia (filamentous heterocyst- forming Cyanobacteria dwelling inside diatoms), on plant physiology and genetics, especially of hops, and on large-scale oceanography and ichthyology. Beginning in 1904, Johannes Schmidt led a series of expeditions into the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic to investigate eels. In 1928‚Äì1930, he led the Dana Expedition, funded by the Carlsberg Foundation, being a two-year voyage around the world's oceans. The discovery of the spawning place of the eel was one of the results of this expedition. A peculiar incident is worthy of notice: a paper on the life-history of the eel, published 1912 in Germany,Schmidt, J.

A full brother to 1965 U.S. Horse of the Year Moccasin, Ridan was the grandson of Nasrullah, a son of Nearco. Trainer Moody Jolley purchased him from Claiborne Farm as a yearling. Because the colt reminded Jolley of another Nasrullah colt named Nadir, he named him Ridan, which is Nadir spelled backwards. Ernest Woods and John L. Greer each bought a one-third interest in the horse. Trained by Jolley's son LeRoy, and ridden by future U.S. Hall of Fame jockey Bill Hartack, the two-year-old Ridan went unbeaten in seven starts in 1961 that included the important Arlington Futurity and Washington Park Futurity. Soreness in a foreleg cut short his season, and although he had handily beaten another two-year-old star, Crimson Satan, the 1961 U.S. Juvenile Champion honors went to Crimson Satan. The choice was hotly debated in racing circles. Hartack said Ridan was the best two-year-old he had ever ridden or seen. A number of expert racing observers agreed, saying that Ridan was the best two-year-old they had ever seen. The following year at age three, Ridan settled the issue, beating Crimson Satan seven more times by an average of eight lengths in each race and retiring without ever losing to him. In 1962, Ridan won the Hibiscus Stakes in record time, then won the Blue Grass Stakes and the Florida Derby. Made the heavy favorite going into the Kentucky Derby, Ridan wound up third after running wide in a hard-fought race in which he and Roman Line finished a neck behind upset winner Decidedly. Disappointment followed in the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown. Ridan lost by the then-narrowest, and still second-narrowest, margin in Preakness history, beaten by a nose by Brandywine Stable longshot Greek Money.  One of American Horse Racing's Top 100 Moments In the 1962 Travers Stakes at the Saratoga Race Course, Ridan lost by a fraction of a nose in track-record time to the George D. Widener Jr. colt Jaipur. Still written and talked about today, the race is listed in the 2006 book Horse Racing's Top 100 Moments, written by the staff of Blood-Horse Publications. The race result determined which colt was named the 1962 U.S. Champion Three-Year-Old Horse. At age four, Ridan raced only three times but got his revenge when he beat Jaipur, as well as the great Kelso, in the Palm Beach Handicap at Hialeah Park. An ankle injury brought Ridan's racing career to an end, and he was sent to stand at stud in Kentucky. Only moderately successful as a sire, Ridan was eventually sent to a breeding operation in Australia, where he died in 1977 from a twisted intestine.

This major coal-producing region contains one of the world's largest deposits of bituminous coal. The Basin contains much of the known Permian coal resources in Queensland including virtually all of the known mineable prime coking coal. It was named for the Bowen River, itself named after Queensland's first Governor, Sir George Bowen. The Bowen Basin covers an area of over 60,000 square kilometres in Central Queensland running from Collinsville to Theodore. There was a combined population of 41,973 people in the area in 2001. The ornamental snake is a small reptile native to the Bowen Basin region.  History  The Bowen Basin covers an area about 600 km long and 250 km wide extending from Collinsville in the north to south of Moura in Central Queensland. It contains about 70% of Queensland's coal. These are deposits of the Permian age and are the most important commercial deposits in the State, producing almost 100% of the State's coking coal and 60% of its thermal coal. In 2006-7, the State's top ten collieries for production were located in the Bowen Basin. Commercial exploitation of Bowen Basin coal began at Blair Athol in the 1890s. At the time, the main coal-producing area was the West Moreton coalfields. Some coal was also produced at the Burrum coalfields and on the Darling Downs. These mines supplied mostly thermal (steaming) coal to a domestic market; the Railway Department was a major customer. The success of mines depended on whether the coal was suitable for firing boilers and on their proximity to a railway line. Most early mines in the Bowen Basin struggled to remain commercially viable. Intensive exploration of the Bowen Basin coalfield began only after the crisis in the base metals industry due to falling prices from 1907. Tests on the Bowen River Coal Company's lease in 1912 and 1913 sparked a rush to the field. Five syndicates had registered 17 leases straddling the Bowen outcrops by the end of 1915. However, the election of Queensland's first stable Labor government led in August 1915 to Cabinet refusing the private applications and reserving the 6.4 square kilometre area involved for State operations. Competition for leases subsided into a long wait for railway construction to be completed. Construction of the 789 kilometres of railway took five years and the delay had exhausted most of the speculators long before the line opened in 1922. At the same time, by the end of 1919, a further nineteen leases had been forfeited to the State for non- payment of rent, and the surviving syndicates had amalgamated to form the Bowen Consolidated Coal Mining Company which established the Bowen Consolidated Colliery in Scottville.  Mining  A reclaimer operating at Kestrel coal mine, 2006 Most of the basin's open cut and underground coal mines are located in the north. The basin had 48 operational coal mines in August 2011. In mid-2011, evidence of a continuing mining boom was provided by state government figures which showed more than 50 mining projects are under consideration in the Bowen Basin. The Goonyella railway line is the main route for exports of coal via Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point. Exports are also sent via the Port of Gladstone. Rio Tinto Coal Australia's Kestrel coal mine, near Emerald was named after a bird found in the area. = Major coal mines = * Byerwen Mine while still under development employed 1,000 workers in August 2011. * Curragh coal mine employed 1,600 workers in August 2011. * Dawson Central Mine employed 1,560 workers in August 2011. * Goonyella Riverside Mine employed 2,360 workers in August 2011. * Hail Creek coal mine employed 1,270 workers in August 2011. * Peak Downs Mine employed 1,760 workers in August 2011. * Saraji coal mine employed 1,615 workers in August 2011. Other mines in the basin include Foxleigh coal mine, Coppabella coal mine, Collinsville coal mine, Blair Athol coal mine, Middlemount coal mine, Yarrabee coal mine, Poitrel coal mine, Daunia coal mine, South Walker Creek coal mine, Rolleston coal mine, Oaky Creek coal mine, Norwich Park coal mine, North Goonyella coal mine, Newlands coal mine, Moranbah North coal mine, Kestrel coal mine, Jellinbah coal mine, Gregory coal mine and German Creek coal mine. = Mining companies = * BHP Mitsubishi Alliance * BHP Mitsui Alliance * Felix Resources * Idemitsu Kosan * Macarthur Coal * Peabody Energy * QCoal * Vale * Wesfarmers * Glencore = History = Ludwig Leichhardt was the first European to discover coal deposits in the region in 1845. Robert Logan Jack was a Queensland Government geologist who reported coal deposits in the basin in 1878. The first attempt to mine coal in the basin was in 1892 at Tolmies. However, by 1900 the site was abandoned. The area around Collinsville was first explored for resources in the 1920s. Large scale coal exploration began in the Bowen Basin in the 1960s. In 2006, 60% of Australia's exported coking coal came out of the Bowen Basin. In 2010, nearly all the mines in the basin were affected by record flooding. Many mines were forced to declare force majeure, meaning they could not meet their contractual obligations.  Gas fields  = Fairview gas field = The Fairview gas field is developed by the Comet Ridge Project, a coal seam gas extraction project in the Bowen Basin. Fairview is PL 91 located in the Comet Ridge Project Area comprising PLs 90, 91, 92, 99,100, 232, 233,234, 235 and 236 and ATPs 526P, 653P, 655P and 745P, some 500-600 kilometres north-west of Brisbane or 100-200 kilometres north of Roma. Total area is approximately 5,000 square kilometres, stretching 175 kilometres to the north from Injune. The project is operated by Santos Limited, which has a net revenue interest of 76.07%, and a working interest of 79.5%. Santos acquired the Comet Ridge coal seam gas project comprising Fairview and 4,000 square kilometres of exploration acreage in 2005 through the acquisition and subsequent merger of Tipperary Corporation's Australian assets into the Santos gas portfolio. The remaining participants, which include origin parties, hold a combined net revenue interest of 22.93%, and a working interest of 20.5%. The discovery well, the Fairview 1, was drilled in August 1994, followed by a number of other wells which subsequently began dewatering to establish the technical and commercial viability of coal seam gas. Gas production started in January 1995, with first sales gas in February 1998. More than 100 wells have been drilled at year end 2005, with some 80 wells in the Fairview area. Of these, 57 are connected and producing to the gathering system with the remainder undergoing dewatering operations and/or awaiting completion and connection. Gas is gathered to two compressor sites (CS1 and CS2) where it is compressed and dehydrated before export as sales to the Fairview lateral of the Queensland Gas Pipeline system. Following the merger into Santos‚Äô operations on 28 October 2005 and the subsequent integration, extra compression has been brought on line and additional wells connected, which has increased sales gas production by 66%. Sales gas production is around 45 TJ/day, limited by the capacity of the export pipeline. Average well productivity is around 0.9 TJ/day, with a number of wells flowing in excess of 5 TJ/day. Development during 2006 includes the construction of a new 130 kilometre pipeline from CS2 to Wallumbilla, expansion of the gas processing facilities, and drilling and connection of additional wells. This will increase sales gas capacity to 70 TJ/day in 2007. In the longer term, additional development and facilities will enable sales gas production to be increased to approximately 200 TJ/day in 2012, with Santos share approximately 140 TJ/day. = Scotia gas field = The Scotia gas field is in the Bowen Basin, onshore Eastern Queensland, approximately 340 kilometres north-west of Brisbane and 145 kilometres north-east of Roma on the Burunga anticline within PL 176. The area of PL 176 is approximately 213 square kilometres. Santos has a 100% working interest in the project. The discovery well, the Scotia 3, was drilled in 1996. It was the first well drilled to test the late Permian coal seam gas play. Coal seam methane gas production started in 2002. Under a 15-year contract the field supplies CS Energy's gas-fired power station. Total investment to date is approximately A$65 million. The Scotia field comprises 25 connected wells gathered into a central processing facility. The processing includes water separation, glycol dehydration and four-stage compression. Sales gas is transported via a 111-kilometre Scotia/Peat lateral pipeline to join the Roma-Brisbane Pipeline, about 116 kilometres east of Wallumbilla.  Environmental concerns  Protests against processing and export via an enlarged Gladstone port at Curtis Island, escalated in 2012 and UNESCO have called for greater environmental assessment of the port proposal for the World Heritage Listed Great Barrier Reef. There are also concerns over the pollution of water from the Great Artesian Basin.

In 1800, during Lady Barin's 70th birthday, Yonglin, the Jiaqing Emperor's only full brother who was raised by Lady Barin, sent her birthday gifts. Lady Barin had no children of her own and had been leading a rather lonely life in the palace, so she was very happy to see Yonglin. However, the Jiaqing Emperor was furious when he found out, and he scolded his brother for not seeking his permission first. Lady Barin's birthday celebrations were thus rendered meaningless.

When confronted by users who had been adversely affected by the virus he used to reply with an argument about the level of handgun ownership in the United States. References *Norstad, John.

It was released in June 1986.  Background, concept and production  Cabe√ßa Dinossauro was the first Tit√£s album to be produced by Liminha, who was the director of WEA at the time of the album's recording, and the first of the band to receive a gold certification, in December 1986.Tit√£s - History It was recorded and mixed in one month. Its demo was recorded in just two days. Vocalist Arnaldo Antunes and guitarist Tony Bellotto's arrest for drug possession in 1985; the \\"relative failure\\" of previous album Televis√£o; and the will by the band to take a heavier direction influenced the music on this album. But they did not suddenly decide to turn punk. The ingredients, according to keyboardist and vocalist S√©rgio Britto, were already at the band previously. Bellotto says the band already showed signs of this new sound during shows Besides, then drummer Charles Gavin considered the troubled moments lived both by the band and by Brazil at that time were also influencing factors: Co-producer Pena Schmidt saw the album as \\"the moment of truth. Tit√£s had crisis between surrendering to phonographic perfection or to the rebellious statement. There the result balances track by track.\\" The album's front and back covers were taken from sketches by Leonardo da Vinci:Leonardo da Vinci in Tit√£s' album cover \\"The Expression a howling Man\\" and \\"Grotesque Head\\", respectively. Both acetates were brought straight outta Louvre by a friend of vocalist and keyboardist S√©rgio Britto's father. They replaced small reproductions the band had but could not use for the album due to low quality. He would say in 2006 that \\"the first 30,000 copies of the album were made in a mat and porous paper, much more expensive than the ordinary one. A gesture of generosity by Andr√© Midani, then president of Warner, which gave us total support before, during and after the recording sessions, complying with almost every of our requests.\\"  Song information  The musical material for the album was ready before the band got into the studio. The first track to be recorded was the single \\"AA UU\\". The last one was \\"O Qu√™\\". The title track was conceived during a bus trip. Vocalist and saxophonist Paulo Miklos showed his colleagues a tape with folk music by some Xingus. Over that base, someone improvised the verses \\"Cabe√ßa dinossauro/Cabe√ßa dinossauro/Cabe√ßa, cabe√ßa, cabe√ßa dinossauro\\" and soon the lyrics were all done. The percussion was performed by Liminha. After several elaborated attempts, he improvised with the walls, the floor and the pillars of the studio, and the \\"trance\\" performance was approved by all. The vocals of \\"A Face do Destruidor\\" was recorded over the base played backwards. According to Britto, \\"when we recorded, we had to think that it would be listened to that way\\". Some of Bellotto's solos were played with the musician alternating between the guitar pick and a big ring he was using. That way, he could play and simultaneously obtain percussive effects from his instrument. The song \\"Bichos Escrotos\\" had originally been written in 1982 and was supposed to be part of the band's debut album, but it was censored by the Brazilian military government, and the band was thus unable to release it until Cabe√ßa Dinossauro. Even after the song was finally released, radio airplay was still prohibited, but the radio stations were receiving so many requests that they decided to play the song anyway and face the fines afterwards, because the price was low enough compared to the profit to make it worth the disobedience. During a demo recording session in the early 1980s, songwriters Nando Reis, Britto and Antunes took a break as the other Tit√£s recorded some instrumentals and hung out around a courtyard. Eventually, Reis spotted a cockroach emerging from the drain and that inspired him and the other two to write a song about it. According to him, the song uses the animals cited in the lyrics (cockroaches, rats and fleas), which are considered marginal animals, as metaphors for Tit√£s themselves, who would keep themselves away from musical and moral patterns and stereotypes. \\"O Qu√™\\" was the most demanding track in the album, according to Britto: In a 2016 interview, coproducer Pena Schmidt considered that \\"the mantric perfection of 'O Qu√™' paved the way for some three subsequent releases. From there, they graduated in pop production and engineering, ready to take on their own career.\\"  Accolades, legacy and re- release  In a 2012 interview, guitarist Tony Bellotto revealed he made a bet with vocalist Branco Mello: he would buy him a bottle of Jack Daniel's in case the album sold over 100,000 copies, since he thought it would be a commercial failure. However, the album sold well, and Tony lost the bet. Until its first anniversary, the album sold 250,000 copies, with a total of 700,000 sold until 2016. In a 2006 article for the Brazilian Rolling Stone, Britto commented: In 1997, Bizz magazine elected Cabe√ßa Dinossauro as the best Brazilian pop rock album. In 2007, the Brazilian version of the magazine Rolling Stone elected it as the 19th greatest Brazilian album of all time. On September 2012, it was elected by the audience of Radio Eldorado FM, of Estadao.com e of Caderno C2+M√∫sica (both the latter belong to newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo) as the seventh best Brazilian album ever. In 2012, in order to celebrate the 25 years of the album's original release, Cabe√ßa Dinossauro was re-released, fully remastered and with a bonus disc containing the original demos for the songs, plus a previously unreleased track, \\"Vai pra Rua\\", an outtake of the album. The band also promoted a tour in which they performed the entire album respecting the original ordering of tracks. One of these performances was recorded and released as Cabe√ßa Dinossauro ao Vivo 2012. Performing the album would help define the sound of the band's then next album, Nheengatu. In the next year, the remaining members of the band recorded a video for the title song, using images from the movie Vai que D√° Certo. Both the movie and the video feature Brazilian actors and humorists F√°bio Porchat, Greg√≥rio Duvivier, Bruno Mazzeo, L√∫cio Mauro Filho, Danton Mello e Nat√°lia Lage.  Play and book  In 2016, celebrating 30 years of the album, a book with tales inspired by the album's tracks and a play inspired by the album were prepared, titled Cada um por si e Deus contra todos (Everyone for itself and God against all) and Cabe√ßa, respectively. The play, directed by Felipe Vidal, take eight actors to the stage where they perform the entire album. It features \\"the sign of urgency and its relation with youth\\" in two different years: 1986 (when the album was released) and 2016 (when the play was presented). Vidal considers that the sign in 1986 \\"provoked the urgency of living a newly-acquired liberty, with the end of the dictatorship, today [2016], it fights to guarantee such conquest, in a world scenery troubled by growing conservative forces. The book was released by publisher Tinta Negra, organized by Andr√© Tartarini and includes tales by authors such as Let√≠cia Novaes, Juliana Frank and Renato Lemos, besides an introduction by Bellotto.  Critical reception  By the time of the album's release, newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo's Alberto Villas stated that the album was \\"the great surprise of the year. [...] It's a shocking, punk, angry and very curious album. An album of poison- rock, a scream. An album of surprises.\\" Track listing ;Bonus track on 2012 re-issue =Covers= * Brazilian thrash metal band Sepultura made a cover of \\"Pol√≠cia\\", present on the B-side of their \\"Territory\\" single, the digipak and Brazilian pressings of their 1993 album Chaos A.D., and the compilation Blood- Rooted. * Biquini Cavad√£o covered \\"Estado Viol√™ncia\\" in their tribute album 80. * Pagode group Molejo covered the song \\"Fam√≠lia\\", adapting it to a samba rhythm.

It is cultivated for its large white flowers. Description =D. crenatus subsp. crenatus= The stem is erect to ascending, profusely branched, primary stems terete (tapering at both ends) or 3-angled for a short portion at base, becoming ligneous (woody), flat at most of their length, secondary stems flat, flattened portions to 60 cm long, to 6‚Äì10 cm wide, stiff and rather succulent. The leaves are lanceolate to long linear, acute or obtuse, median nerve rather thick, margins deeply or coarsely crenate, lobes oblique; areoles at the bases of stems sometimes bearing hairs or small bristles, internodes (plant stem part between nodes) narrow or broad. The Epidermis is green or almost grayish green, smooth. The flowers are up to 18‚Äì29 cm long and (10-)15‚Äì20 cm wide, nocturnal, but remaining open for several days, fragrant. The outer tepals are inserted within 2 cm of receptacle apex, (7-)10‚Äì12 cm long, broadly oblanceolate-linear, greenish yellow to tawny yellow or reddish amber, the outermost sometimes margined red or streaked; inner tepals as long as outer, spathulate to oblanceolate, acuminate to mucronate, white, creamy white or greenish yellow. The Pericarpel (hypanthium) is 5-angled, 3 cm long, 1,5-1,7 cm thick, with acute, long- decurrent podaria, bracteoles (small bracts) subtening 0-2 (-8) spines to 7 mm long, green. The receptacle is 10‚Äì12 cm long, about 1,5 cm thick at middle, green often reddish at apex or reddish throughout, bearing numerous linear to oblong, obtuse, ¬± keeled bracleoles 2‚Äì3 cm long, ¬± spreading. The nectaries are about 3‚Äì4 cm long, stamens numerous, declinate,Declinate: descending in a curve or drooping, Collins English Dictionary ‚Äì Complete and Unabridged. S.v. \\"declinate.\\" Retrieved 2011-05-09 from The Free Dictionary shorter than the tepals, inserted in two zones the lower one ca 4 cm long, from a point ca 4 cm from the ovary chamber, the upper zone forming a throat circle ca 2 cm above, filaments 5‚Äì7 cm long, pale yellow or pale greenish yellow; style 15‚Äì20 cm long, as long or longer than stamens, 2‚Äì3 mm thick, widest at base. The stigma lobes are white, 8-9, papillose (nipple-like). The fruit is oblong to globose (globe-shaped), the podaria long decurrent, acute. =D. crenatus subsp. kimnachii= This subspecies differs from the typical variety by: stems 4‚Äì6 cm wide, lobes usually semicircular; pericarpel and receptacle subterete (tapering at the bottom) in cross-section; pericarpel with subconical (somewhat cone shaped at the bottom) or obtuse, shortly decurrent podaria and with bracteoles subtending ca 6 (0-20) spines to 12 mm long; outer tepals usually inserted within 4‚Äì8 cm of tube apex; fruit globose, the podaria shortly decurrent, obtuse. Taxonomy The epithet crenatus means with crenations (wavy-toothed) and refers to the crenated stem margins. The subspecies epithet kimnachii honours Myron Kimnach (1922-2018), a botanist mainly working with epiphytic cacti and Crassulaceae, and for many years working at the University of California, Berkeley and Huntington Gardens. Kimnach was director of the Huntington Botanical Gardens for 25 years and editor of the Cactus and Succulent Society of America's Journal, and Managing Editor of its peer-reviewed, technical yearbook, Haseltonia for ten years.Cactus and Succulent Society of America, 2007 Convention Speakers, Cactus Lectures, Myron Kimnach. This species is very distinct. The flowers of Epiphyllum grandilobum are similar but the stem morphology is very different. Relationships and generic limits in the tribe Hylocereeae have long been unclear. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2016 showed that this species, which was then placed in the genus Epiphyllum was firmly nested within Disocactus. Distribution and habitat From Mexico (Oaxaca & Chiapas) to Honduras. Epiphytic (grows upon another plant) or lithophytic (grows on rocks) in moist or wet forests, sometimes in oak forests. 1.750 m alt. or less. Cultivation This species was shown at an exhibition at the Royal Horticultural Society's Garden in 1844 and won highest medal for a new introduction. It had been collected in Honduras five years earlier by Georges Ule Skinner and sent to Sir Charles Lemon who flowered it for the first time in 1843. Lindley thought it to have originated in the island of Antigua. D. crenatus is the only species of Disocactus that has been used in hybridization to any extent. Most of the colored hybrids have mainly Disocactus genes and are perhaps better referred to as Disocactus hybrids rather than epiphyllum hybrids. It is an easily cultivated, fast growing epiphyte. Needs compost containing plenty of humus and sufficient moisture in summer. Should not be kept under 12 ¬∞C (53,5 ¬∞F) in winter. Can be grown in semi-shade or full sun. Extra light in the early spring will stimulate budding. Flowers in late spring or early summer. The cultivar 'Cooperi' resembles D. crenatus subsp. kimnachii, differing only in having the outer petals at the apex of the tube. It was originally reported that 'Cooperi' was a hybrid involving Selenicereus, and Clive Innes stated that he \\"re-made\\" the cross between D. crenatus and Selenicereus grandiflorus, obtaining several plants identical with 'Cooperi'. However, it was shown in 1997 that this was not correct, DNA analysis showing no evidence of Selenicereus.Metz, Fr√∂hlich, Kimnach & Meyerowitz (1997), article in Haseltonia.

Roe, 429 U.S. 589 (1977), was a case brought before the Supreme Court of the United States.. The case involved a New York state law requiring reporting and storage of information concerning all Schedule II drug prescriptions. Physicians were required to report the name of the prescribing physician; the dispensing pharmacy; the drug and dosage; and the name, address, and age of the patient. This information was then stored by the New York Department of State. A group of patients, several doctors who prescribe such drugs, and two associations of physicians brought suit against the commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, seeking to enjoin the State from enforcing the Act. A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, held the statutes unconstitutional and enjoined enforcement of the challenged provisions. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the district court, holding that the statutes were within the state's police power. The Supreme Court held that the state need not show the State action was necessary to solve the identified problem and that there was no basis for assuming that the state security provisions would be improperly administered. The Court dismissed the plaintiff's key concerns, holding that the statutes would not significantly deter patients from seeking necessary medication nor would the statutes impair physicians' right to practice medicine free from unwarranted state interference.  Background and prior history In 1970, the New York Legislature created a special commission to evaluate the State's drug-control laws and their effectiveness in combating the illegal distribution and use of dangerous yet legal prescription drugs. The commission found that the existing law was ineffective in preventing the use of stolen or revised prescriptions, in preventing pharmacists from refilling exhausted prescriptions, in preventing drug users from obtaining multiple physicians' prescriptions, or in preventing doctors from over-prescribing. In 1972, the New York Legislature enacted a statutory scheme to address this problem. These statutes required that physicians write all prescriptions on an official form. This form included the physician‚Äôs name, the dispensing pharmacy, the drug and dosage; and the patient's name, address, and age. A copy of the form was to be forwarded to the New York State Department of Health. There the form would be recorded and the information would be stored for a period of five years. Public disclosure of the information was strictly prohibited and the state had certain safeguards in place to secure the data. Challenging the constitutionality of these statutes, a group of patients and doctors brought a cause of action seeking to enjoin the state from enforcing the statutes. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York held for the plaintiffs, finding that the statutes invaded the constitutionally protected zone of privacy of the doctor-patient relationship. The District Court enjoined the State from enforcing certain sections of the New York State Controlled Substance Act of 1972, to protect patient identity. The District Court based its ruling on the theory that the State had failed to show a necessity for the patient identification requirement and without a necessity, the State action unconstitutionally invaded personal privacy. Oral Arguments The Court heard oral arguments for the case on October 13th, 1976. Assistant Attorney General A. Seth Greenwald argued the case for the appellant, the State of New York. Attorneys H. Miles Jaffe and Michael Lesch argued for the appellees.  Majority opinion  In 1977 the United States Supreme Court reversed the District Court's holding. Justice Stevens wrote the opinion of the Court and held that State legislation is not unconstitutional merely because it is not found to be necessary. Rejecting the District Court's analysis of Lochner v. New York,. Justice Stevens held that it is within the State's police power to enact legislation that attempts to deal with crime, such as the drug distribution problem in this case. Justice Stevens identified two different privacy interests which may be constitutionally protected: the interest of controlling the disclosure of personal matters and the interest of being able to make certain personal decisions free from government influence. While Justice Stevens agreed with the Appellees that both of these interests may be affected by the statutes, Justice Stevens held that neither interest would be significantly impaired by the statutes. Looking at the evidence before the court, Justice Stevens found that the increased risk of public disclosure was minimal compared to existing law and that patients‚Äô decisions to receive these drugs would be largely unaffected by having to provide identifying information. Justice Stevens dismissed the group of doctors' arguments, stating that existing law already required doctors to prepare a written prescription with predominantly the same information. Justice Stevens goes on to hold that any other concerns about patient decisions and the doctor patient relationship were covered in his discussion of patient privacy interests. Finally, while acknowledging legitimate privacy concerns arising from government storage of citizens' personal information, Justice Stevens limited the holding to the specific facts in this case. He recognized that there might be valid constitutional issues should there be unwarranted disclosure of such private information, however this was not the case here. =Brennan's concurrence= While Justice Brennan agrees with the majority that the disclosure of patient information required by physicians pursuant to the New York statute to a limited number of public health officials has been historically prevalent and one not traditionally viewed as an invasion of privacy, he still expresses his concern with regards to the manner in which the statute mandates the information be stored-in a central computer. He concedes that simply because a new technology makes such information gathering more efficient, that alone cannot render the statute unconstitutional. However, in referring to the Fourth Amendment, he notes that there are constitutional limits to the kind of information that the State may collect and the manner in which it is collected. To Brennan, the development of computerized data and the ease with which computers can store large amounts of data poses an increased risk of misappropriation of such data. As such, Justice Brennan demonstrates his unwillingness to foreclose on the possibility that future circumstances might require similar limitations on technology in relation to privacy law as the Court has imposed on Fourth Amendment law. Nonetheless, Brennan points out that the New York statute had, based on the facts of the case before him, sufficiently protected the privacy interests of those patients in their information. Without an actual showing that the statute‚Äôs procedural safeguards have been ineffective in ensuring patients are not deprived of their privacy interests, the state could not be compelled to show that the collection of the data is absolutely necessary to control illegal drug use. =Stewart's concurrence= Justice Stewart points out that the Court noted in Katz v. United States that the Constitution does not provide individuals with any right to privacy. Rather, the constitution merely provides protection to individuals from government intrusion pursuant to the Fourth Amendment. As a result, Justice Stewart takes exception to Justice Brennan's implication that had there been some dissemination of the information collected in accordance with the New York statute the state would have to show that the statute is necessary to achieving its compelling state interest-curtailing illegal drug use. Stewart qualified his concurrence by indicating he agreed with the majority's decision but that he agreed based on the assumption that the majority's was not contravening its precedent in Katz: the Constitution does not afford individuals any right to privacy. =Subsequent developments= Brennan's concurrence was prescient in some regards as increasingly advanced computer technology continues to develop while generating growing concerns about how private information is collected, particularly pertaining to health and medical records. These concerns were reflected by Congress when it passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996. The Act's overall objective was to provide national standards for electronic healthcare transactions, but the relevant part of the Act is Title II, which regulates how personal medical information can be used and disclosed by specifically outlined entities under the Act, such as healthcare providers.

Career The group formed from a collection of folk singers who performed regularly at Washington Square in New York City during the mid-1950s, including Erik Darling and Bob Carey. \\"Eventually it became the Tarriers, with Bob, me, Karl Karlton and Alan Arkin,\\" Darling told Wayne Jancik in The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders. According to Darling, \\"Karl didn't really mesh\\" and left the group before the remaining trio secured a contract with Glory Records in 1956, where the Tarriers scored two hits.Wayne Jancik, The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders, expanded first edition (Billboard Books, 1998) , p. 28. The Tarriers appeared in a 1957 low-budget musical Calypso Heat Wave, in which they lip-synched to \\"The Banana Boat Song\\" and \\"Choucoune.\\" After completing a European tour in early 1958, Arkin left the group to pursue acting. His replacement was Clarence Cooper, a singer rooted in blues and gospel. In March 1958, Darling was recruited to replace Pete Seeger in The Weavers. Because The Weavers only performed sporadic concert dates and recording sessions, Darling continued working with The Tarriers until a November 1959 scheduling conflict forced his departure. His replacement was banjoist/singer Eric Weissberg, later of \\"Dueling Banjos\\" fame. Because of Carey's growing unreliability, Weissberg recruited his college friend Marshall Brickman to join the group. The Tarriers briefly worked as a quartet until late 1963, when Brickman, Cooper and Weissberg reluctantly dismissed Carey for missing shows. The group went into hiatus in 1964 while Cooper recovered from heart surgery and Weissberg honored his National Guard commitments. Brickman joined John Phillips and Michelle Phillips in The New Journeymen. When Cooper and Weissberg reformed the trio, Al Dana was Brickman's replacement. With the decline in popularity of folk music in the wake of the British Invasion, The Tarriers disbanded in 1964. During their career, the group in its various configurations recorded six albums. One for Glory Records, one for United Artists Records, one for Atlantic Records and three for Decca Records including The Tarriers at the Bitter End - Decca, and another on which they backed folksinger Oscar Brand - Folk Songs for Fun, Decca, 1962.

Costa Mesa Historical Society History The adobe was built between 1817 and 1823 to house the mayordomo and herdsmen who tended the cattle and horses from Mission San Juan Capistrano to the south, in Alta California. The way-station was strategically situated on the banks of the Santa Ana River, some six leguas (Spanish Leagues) north of the parent mission, and also served as a lookout post when the French privateer Hippolyte de Bouchard attacked San Juan Capistrano on December 14, 1818. By 1820 the building and its surrounding lands became an official estancia (mission station), where padres from the mission would visit regularly to bring \\"spiritual food\\" to the faithful.; p. 114 After the Mexican secularization act of 1833 the church lost the land and building to the originally Spanish, later Mexican-recognized land grant Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana. The adobe and its surrounding property, a portion of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, were deeded by the U.S. government to Diego Sep√∫lveda around 1868. He was a former alcalde of the Mexican era Pueblo of Los Angeles. Present day The adobe, which has been restored to its original style using original construction methods, is the second oldest building still standing in Orange County. The Mission San Juan Capistrano \\"Serra's Chapel\\" is the oldest. The building then became a local history museum, operated by the Costa Mesa Historical Society.

Having originally been a crossbencher, he took the Conservative whip in 2016. He was married to Shruti, Lady Rana. On 16 June 2004, he was created a life peer as Baron Rana, of Malone in the County of Antrim. Life He was born in Sanghol, India and is the oldest sibling of three brothers and two sisters. Lord Rana left Punjab in 1963 for England, but now has been a resident of Belfast since 1966. He had to repair his property portfolio over 25 times during the Troubles in Northern Ireland because of bombings and arson attacks. \\"Being an Indian I should not have had any loyalty to Northern Ireland; I stayed there despite the problem,\\" said Lord Rana. Today, he is a successful property developer, hotelier and president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He is director of Andras House, is a leading figure in the Indian community in Northern Ireland. He is India's honorary consul in Belfast. Lord Rana claims to promote business links between India and Northern Ireland and has been elected president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce. He led a trade mission of 13 companies to India to explore business opportunities for Northern Ireland companies. Awards and philanthropy Rana was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1996 Birthday Honours, for his contribution to the economic regeneration of the city of Belfast. Rana has set up a charitable trust of Rs. 50 million for a school and a college named Taxila, in his native village Sanghol, near Chandigarh, India. The new college has collaborative links with the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland. The university conferred an honorary doctorate on Rana who led a delegation of academics from the university to India to explore educational partnerships and help develop university links between India and Northern Ireland. Rana also received an Honorary Doctorate from Bengal Engineering and Science University in West Bengal in November 2008. Disputes A dispute has continued for many years over the redevelopment plans of the Tillie & Henderson factory site in Derry, this site is owned by Dijit Rana. The site was previously a shirt factory of historic importance but was damaged in multiple arson attacks including major ones in 2001, and 2002, and was subsequently demolished without permission in 2003. A budget hotel originally envisioned for the site was still at the planning stage in 2009. Rana stated in April 2009 that his designers \\"we're trying to get things right this time\\", and communication was ongoing with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, and he hoped that \\"there will be a general welcome for our plans in what is a prime location in the city\\". Rana was forced to comply with an Urgent Works Notice in 2003 from the Department of the Environment. It obliged him to carry out immediate repairs to Cairndhu House, near Larne. Rana was advised that the building would be taken from him if he did not comply with the works notice. Rana himself states that he has protected a lot of heritage buildings in Belfast, including: * The Oxford Street Church * Andras House (built in 1889) * The Lincoln Building * Renshaws Hotel.

Deer stone, Mongolia. Deer stones (also known as reindeer stones) are ancient megaliths carved with symbols found largely in Siberia and Mongolia. The name comes from their carved depictions of flying deer. There are many theories to the reasons behind their existence and the people who made them. Construction Deer stones are usually constructed from granite or greenstone, depending on which is the most abundant in the surrounding area. They have varying heights; most are over 3 feet tall, but some reach a height of 15 feet. The tops of the stones can be flat, round or smashed, suggesting that perhaps the original top had been deliberately destroyed. The stones are usually oriented with the decorated face to the east. The carvings and designs were most usually completed before the stone was erected, though some stones show signs of being carved in place. The designs were pecked or ground into the stone surface. Deep-grooved cuts and right-angle surfaces indicate the presence of metal tools. Stone tools were used to smooth the harsh cuts of some designs. Nearly all the stones were hand carved, however some unusual stones show signs that they could have been cut with a primitive type of mechanical drill.  Types of stones  V. V. Volkov, in his thirty years of research, classified three distinct types of deer stones. =Classic Mongolian= These stones are fairly detailed and more elegant in their depiction methods. They usually feature a belted warrior with a stylized flying reindeer on his torso. This type of stone is most prominent in southern Siberia and northern Mongolia. This concentration suggests that these stones were the origin of the deer stone tradition, and further types both simplified and elaborated on these. =West Asian-European= These stones feature a central region of the stone, sectioned off by two \\"belts\\", horizontal lines. There are also \\"earring hoops\\", large circles, diagonal slashes in groups of two and three known as \\"faces\\", and \\"necklaces\\", collection of stone pits resembling their namesake. =Sayan-Altai= The Sayan-Altai stones feature some of the West Asian-European markings, including free-floating, straight- legged animals, daggers and other tools. The appearance of deer motifs is markedly diminished, and those that do appear often do not emphasise the relationship between reindeer and flying. The Sayan-Altai stones can be sub- divided into two types: * The Gorno-Altai stones have simple warrior motifs, displaying tools in the belt region of the stone. Reindeer motifs appear but are few. * The Sayan-Tuva stones are similar to the Gorno-Altai but contain fewer images of animals. No deer motifs are present. The artistic style is much simpler, often consisting of only belts, necklaces, earrings and faces. File:Classic Mongolian.jpgClassic Mongolian File:West Asian-European.jpgWest Asian-European File:Sayan-Altai.jpgSayan-Altai Imagery Different applications of ornate antler detailing There are many common images that appear in deer stones, as well as a multitude of ways they are presented. =Reindeer= Reindeer feature prominently in nearly all of the deer stones. Early stones have very simple images of reindeer, and as time progresses, the designs increase in detail. A gap of 500 years results in the appearance of the complicated flying reindeer depiction. Reindeer are depicted as flying through the air, rather than merely running on land. Piers Vitebsky writes, \\"The reindeer is depicted with its neck outstretched and its legs flung out fore and aft, as if not merely galloping but leaping through the air.\\" The antlers, sometimes appearing in pairs, have become extremely ornate, utilizing vast spiral designs that can encompass the entire deer. These antlers sometimes hold a sun disc or other sun-related image. Other artwork from the same period further emphasizes the connection between the reindeer and the sun, which is a very common association in Siberian shamanism. Tattoos on buried warriors contain deer, featuring antlers embellished with small birds' heads. This reindeer-sun-bird imagery perhaps symbolizes the shaman's spiritual transformation from the earth to the sky: the passage from earthly life to heavenly life. As these deer images also appear in warrior tattoos, it is possible that reindeer were believed to offer protection from dangerous forces. Another theory is that the deer spirit served as a guide to assist the warrior soul to heaven. =Other animals= Particularly in the Sayan-Altai stones, a multitude of other animals are present in deer stone imagery. One can see depictions of tigers, pigs, cows, horse-like creatures, frogs and birds. Unlike the reindeer, however, these animals are depicted in a more natural style. This lack of ornate detailing indicates the lack of supernatural importance of such animals, taking an obvious backseat against the reindeer. The animals are often paired off with one another in confrontation, e.g. a tiger confronting a horse in a much more earthly activity. =Weapons and tools= Several sample stone differences Weapons and tools can be seen throughout all the stones, though weapons make a strong appearance in the Sayan-Altai stones. Bows and daggers crop up frequently, as well as typical Bronze-Age implements, such as fire-starters or chariot reins. The appearance of these tools helps date the stones to the Bronze Age. =Patterns= Chevron patterns crop up occasionally, usually in the upper regions of the stone. These patterns can be likened to military shields, suggesting the stones' connection to armed conflict. It has also been suggested that chevron patterns could be a shamanic emblem representing the skeleton. =Human faces= Human faces are a much rarer occurrence and are usually carved into the top of the stone. These faces are carved with an open mouth, as though singing. This also suggests a religious/shamanistic connection of the deer stone, as vocal expression is a common and important theme in shamanism. Geographic distribution Archaeologists have found over 1500 deer stones in Eurasia. Over 1300 of them were recorded in territory of modern Mongolia. –ñ. –ë–∞—è—Ä—Å–∞–π—Ö–∞–Ω –ú–æ–Ω–≥–æ–ª—ã–Ω –£–º–∞—Ä–¥ –Ω—É—Ç–≥–∏–π–Ω –±—É–≥–∞–Ω —Ö”©—à”©”©–¥ 2017 Similar images are found in a wider area, as far west as Kuban, Russia; the Southern Bug in the Ukraine; Dobruja, Bulgaria; and the Elbe, which flows through the Czech Republic and Germany. Origin and purpose Deer stones were probably originally erected by Bronze Age nomads around 1000 BCE though further research into the Cimmerian stone stelae-Kurgan stelae should be taken into much consideration. Later cultures have often reused the stones in their own burial mounds (known as kheregs√º√ºrs) and for other purposes. Modern vandals have also defaced and even looted the stones. In 1892, V.V. Radlov published a collection of drawings of deer stones in Mongolia. Radlov's drawings showed the highly stylized images of deer on the stones, as well as the settings in which they were placed. Radlov showed that in some instances the stones were set in patterns suggesting the walls of a grave, and in other instances, the deer stones were set in elaborate circular patterns, suggesting use in rituals of unknown significance. In 1954 A.P. Okladnikov published a study of a deer stone found in 1856 by D.P. Davydov near modern Ulan-Ude now known as the Ivolga stone, displayed in the Irkutsk State Historical Museum. Okladinkov identified the deer images as reindeer, dated the stone's carving to the 6th-7th Centuries BC, and concluded from its placement and other images that it was associated with funerary rituals, and was a monument to a warrior leader of high social prominence. A extensive 1981 study by V.V. Volkov identified two cultural conditions behind the deer stones. The eastern deer stones appear to be associated with cemeteries of the Slab Grave culture. The other cultural tradition is associated with the circular structures suggesting use as the center of rituals. There are several proposed theories for the purpose of the deer stones. There are different viewpoints about the origins of deer stone art. According to H.L. Chlyenova, the artistic deer image originated from the Sak tribe and its branches (Chlyenova 1962). Volkov believes that some of the methods of crafting deer stone art are closely related to Scythians (Volkov 1967), whereas Mongolian archaeologist D. Tseveendorj regards deer stone art as having originated in Mongolia during the Bronze Age and spread thereafter to Tuva and the Baikal area (Tseveendorj 1979). D. G. Savinov (1994) and M. H. Mannai-Ool (1970) have also studied deer stone art and have reached other conclusions. The stones do not occur alone, usually with several other stone monuments, sometimes carved, sometimes not. The soil around these gatherings often contains traces of animal remains, for example, horses. Such remains were placed underneath these auxiliary stones. Human remains, on the other hand, were not found at any of the sites, which discredits the theory that the stones could function as gravestones. The markings on the stones and the presence of sacrificial remains could suggest a religious purpose, perhaps a prime location for the occurrence of shamanistic rituals. Some stones include a circle at the top and stylised dagger and belt at the bottom, which has led some scholars, such as William Fitzhugh, to speculate that the stones could represent a spiritualized human body, particularly that of a prominent figure such as a warrior or leader. This theory is reinforced by the fact that the stones are all very different in construction and imagery, which could be because each stone tells a unique story for the individual it represents. In 2006, the Deer Stone Project of the Smithsonian Institution and Mongolian Academy of Sciences began to record the stones digitally with 3-D laser scanning.

Because of the hierarchical nature of the system, re-hashing is an incremental operation (done one bucket at a time, as needed). This means that time-sensitive applications are less affected by table growth than by standard full-table rehashes. Extendible hashing was described by Ronald Fagin in 1979. Practically all modern filesystems use either extendible hashing or B-trees. In particular, the Global File System, ZFS, and the SpadFS filesystem use extendible hashing. Mikul√°≈° Patocka. \\"Design and Implementation of the Spad Filesystem\\". Section \\"4.1.6 Extendible hashing: ZFS and GFS\\" and \\"Table 4.1: Directory organization in filesystems\\". 2006\\\\. Example Assume that the hash function h(k) returns a string of bits. The first i bits of each string will be used as indices to figure out where they will go in the \\"directory\\" (hash table). Additionally, i is the smallest number such that the index of every item in the table is unique. Keys to be used: :\\\\begin{align} h(k_1) = 100100\\\\\\\\\\\\ h(k_2) = 010110\\\\\\\\\\\\ h(k_3) = 110110 \\\\end{align} Let's assume that for this particular example, the bucket size is 1. The first two keys to be inserted, k1 and k2, can be distinguished by the most significant bit, and would be inserted into the table as follows: :200px Now, if k3 were to be hashed to the table, it wouldn't be enough to distinguish all three keys by one bit (because both k3 and k1 have 1 as their leftmost bit). Also, because the bucket size is one, the table would overflow. Because comparing the first two most significant bits would give each key a unique location, the directory size is doubled as follows: :200px And so now k1 and k3 have a unique location, being distinguished by the first two leftmost bits. Because k2 is in the top half of the table, both 00 and 01 point to it because there is no other key to compare to that begins with a 0. The above example is from . = Further detail = :h(k_4) = 011110 Now, k4 needs to be inserted, and it has the first two bits as 01..(1110), and using a 2 bit depth in the directory, this maps from 01 to Bucket A. Bucket A is full (max size 1), so it must be split; because there is more than one pointer to Bucket A, there is no need to increase the directory size. What is needed is information about: # The key size that maps the directory (the global depth), and # The key size that has previously mapped the bucket (the local depth) In order to distinguish the two action cases: # Doubling the directory when a bucket becomes full # Creating a new bucket, and re-distributing the entries between the old and the new bucket Examining the initial case of an extendible hash structure, if each directory entry points to one bucket, then the local depth should be equal to the global depth. The number of directory entries is equal to 2global depth, and the initial number of buckets is equal to 2local depth. Thus if global depth = local depth = 0, then 20 = 1, so an initial directory of one pointer to one bucket. Back to the two action cases; if the bucket is full: # If the local depth is equal to the global depth, then there is only one pointer to the bucket, and there is no other directory pointers that can map to the bucket, so the directory must be doubled. # If the local depth is less than the global depth, then there exists more than one pointer from the directory to the bucket, and the bucket can be split. :200px Key 01 points to Bucket A, and Bucket A's local depth of 1 is less than the directory's global depth of 2, which means keys hashed to Bucket A have only used a 1 bit prefix (i.e. 0), and the bucket needs to have its contents split using keys 1 + 1 = 2 bits in length; in general, for any local depth d where d is less than D, the global depth, then d must be incremented after a bucket split, and the new d used as the number of bits of each entry's key to redistribute the entries of the former bucket into the new buckets. :200px Now, :h(k_4) = 011110 is tried again, with 2 bits 01.., and now key 01 points to a new bucket but there is still in it (h(k_2) = 010110 and also begins with 01). If had been 000110, with key 00, there would have been no problem, because would have remained in the new bucket A' and bucket D would have been empty. (This would have been the most likely case by far when buckets are of greater size than 1 and the newly split buckets would be exceedingly unlikely to overflow, unless all the entries were all rehashed to one bucket again. But just to emphasize the role of the depth information, the example will be pursued logically to the end.) So Bucket D needs to be split, but a check of its local depth, which is 2, is the same as the global depth, which is 2, so the directory must be split again, in order to hold keys of sufficient detail, e.g. 3 bits. :200px # Bucket D needs to split due to being full. # As D's local depth = the global depth, the directory must double to increase bit detail of keys. # Global depth has incremented after directory split to 3. # The new entry is rekeyed with global depth 3 bits and ends up in D which has local depth 2, which can now be incremented to 3 and D can be split to D' and E. # The contents of the split bucket D, , has been re-keyed with 3 bits, and it ends up in D. # K4 is retried and it ends up in E which has a spare slot. :200px Now, h(k_2) = 010110 is in D and h(k_4) = 011110 is tried again, with 3 bits 011.., and it points to bucket D which already contains so is full; D's local depth is 2 but now the global depth is 3 after the directory doubling, so now D can be split into bucket's D' and E, the contents of D, has its h(k_2) retried with a new global depth bitmask of 3 and ends up in D', then the new entry is retried with h(k_4) bitmasked using the new global depth bit count of 3 and this gives 011 which now points to a new bucket E which is empty. So goes in Bucket E. Example implementation  Below is the extendible hashing algorithm in Python, with the disc block / memory page association, caching and consistency issues removed. Note a problem exists if the depth exceeds the bit size of an integer, because then doubling of the directory or splitting of a bucket won't allow entries to be rehashed to different buckets. The code uses the least significant bits, which makes it more efficient to expand the table, as the entire directory can be copied as one block (). = Python example = PAGE_SZ = 10 class Page(object): def __init__(self) -> None: self.m = [] self.d = 0 def full(self) -> bool: return len(self.m) >= PAGE_SZ def put(self, k, v) -> None: for i, (key, value) in enumerate(self.m): if key  k: del self.m[i] break self.m.append((k, v)) def get(self, k): for key, value in self.m: if key  k: return value class EH(object): def __init__(self) -> None: self.gd = 0 self.pp = [Page()] def get_page(self, k): h = hash(k) return self.pp[h & ((1 << self.gd) - 1)] def put(self, k, v) -> None: p = self.get_page(k) full = p.full() p.put(k, v) if full: if p.d  self.gd: self.pp *= 2 self.gd += 1 p0 = Page() p1 = Page() p0.d = p1.d = p.d + 1 bit = 1 << p.d for k2, v2 in p.m: h = hash(k2) new_p = p1 if h & bit else p0 new_p.put(k2, v2) for i in range(hash(k) & (bit - 1), len(self.pp), bit): self.pp[i] = p1 if i & bit else p0 def get(self, k): return self.get_page(k).get(k) if __name__  \\"__main__\\": eh = EH() N = 10088 l = list(range(N)) import random random.shuffle(l) for x in l: eh.put(x, x) print(l) for i in range(N): print(eh.get(i)) Notes  See also  * Trie * Hash table * Stable hashing * Consistent hashing * Linear hashing References   External links  * * Extendible Hashing notes at Arkansas State University * Extendible hashing notes *Slides from the database System Concepts book on extendible hashing for hash based dynamic indices Category:Search algorithms Category:Hashing ","title":"Extendible hashing"},{"id":"8019215","text":"Llanarth is a privately owned estate village and community within a conservation area in the Welsh county of Monmouthshire. Llanarth is roughly east of Abergavenny and west of Raglan. the community includes Llanvapley and Bettws Newydd. History One of the earliest mentions of the village is in the Book of Llandaff, written in 1125 CE, where it is rendered with the spelling \\"Llangarth\\". The village's name translates as either \\"church on the ridge of the hill‚Äù or possibly ‚Äúchurch with a garth (yard)‚Äù. Both attest to the presence of a chapel with resident priest (Llan). Settlement within the area potentially dates back to the 6th century CE. The Book of Llandaff states that the king of Gwent - Iddon son of , gave his mansion of \\"Llangarth\\" to Teilo, who was the Bishop of Llandaff between 512 and 566. In 880 a Bishop by the name of Nudd was resident within Llanarth. The Church of St Teilo in the village stands on the foundation of an older, previous church. In 1891 this church was restored, and for over a century catered to Anglican worshippers. Just over a century later, in 2013, the church was declared redundant, owing to the unsustainable cost of necessary repairs. The Llanarth estate and its forestry are notable for their numerous coast redwood and giant redwood conifer specimens, which were likely planted in the 19th century following sapling transportation from California.

Principle of Univariance In his lecture \\"Pigments and signals in colour vision\\" he stated it thus: \\"The output of a receptor depends upon its quantum catch, but not upon what quanta are caught.\\" This means that one and the same visual receptor cell can be excited by different combinations of wavelength and intensity, so that the brain can not know the colour of that point of the retinal picture. Psychical research Rushton held an interest in parapsychology. From 1969‚Äì1971 he was the President of the Society for Psychical Research. He was known for suggesting natural explanations for alleged paranormal phenomena. He revealed how the device of Ted Serios known as a \\"gizmo\\" could have been utilized to produce fraudulent psychic photographs. He suggested that it was light that formed the photographs from a luminous picture placed in front of the camera lens hidden in the gizmo. Rushton successfully replicated the Serios phenomenon by holding a little reflecting prism that contained a microfilm picture against the camera lens.

In this respect they differ from, for example, label printers which have a continuous supply feed. Card dimensions are usually 85.60 √ó 53.98 mm, standardized under ISO/IEC 7810 as ID-1. This format is also used in EC-cards, telephone cards, credit cards, driver's licenses and health insurance cards. This is commonly known as the bank card format. Card printers are controlled by corresponding printer drivers or by means of a specific programming language. Generally card printers are designed with laminating, striping, and punching functions, and use desktop or web- based software. The hardware features of a card printer differentiate a card printer from the more traditional printers, as ID cards are usually made of PVC plastic and require laminating and punching. Different card printers can accept different card thickness and dimensions.  Process  The principle is the same for practically all card printers: the plastic card is passed through a thermal print head at the same time as a color ribbon. The color from the ribbon is transferred onto the card through the heat given out from the print head. The standard performance for card printing is 300 dpi (300 dots per inch, equivalent to 11.8 dots per mm). There are different printing processes, which vary in their detail: ; Thermal transfer: Mainly used to personalize pre-printed plastic cards in monochrome. The color is \\"transferred\\" from the (monochrome) color ribbon onto the card. ; Dye sublimation: This process uses four panels of color according to the CMYK color ribbon. The card to be printed passes under the print head several times each time with the corresponding ribbon panel. Each color in turn is diffused (sublimated) directly onto the card. Thus it is possible to produce a high depth of color (up to 16 million shades) on the card. Afterwards a transparent overlay (O) also known as a topcoat (T) is placed over the card to protect it from mechanical wear and tear and to render the printed image UV resistant. ; Reverse image technology: The standard for high-security card applications that use contact and contactless smart chip cards. The technology prints images onto the underside of a special film that fuses to the surface of a card through heat and pressure. Since this process transfers dyes and resins directly onto a smooth, flexible film, the print-head never comes in contact with the card surface itself. As such, card surface interruptions such as smart chips, ridges caused by internal RFID antennae and debris do not affect print quality. Even printing over the edge is possible. ; Thermal rewrite print process: In contrast to the majority of other card printers, in the thermal rewrite process the card is not personalized through the use of a color ribbon, but by activating a thermal sensitive foil within the card itself. These cards can be repeatedly personalized, erased and rewritten. The most frequent use of these are in chip-based student identity cards, whose validity changes every semester. Common printing problems Many printing problems are caused by physical defects in the card material itself, such as deformation or warping of the card that is fed into the machine in the first place. Printing irregularities can also result from chip or antenna embedding that alters the thickness of the plastic and interferes with the printer's effectiveness. Other issues are often caused by operator errors, such as users attempting to feed non-compatible cards into the card printer, while other printing defects may result from environmental abnormalities such as dirt or contaminants on the card or in the printer.http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/IR-7056/Interoperability/Goyet- Interoperability.pdf Interoperability and Card Printing, a presentation by NIST Workshop on Storage and Processor Card-based Technologies, 2003. Pages 8-9. Accessed 9 March 2016. Reverse transfer printers are less vulnerable to common printing problems than direct-to-card printers, since with these printers the card does not come into direct contact with the printhead. Variation in card printers =Card printer types= Broadly speaking there are three main types of card printers, differing mainly by the method used to print onto the card. They are: *Near to Edge. This term designates the cheapest type of printing by card printers. These printers print up to 5 mm from the edge of the card stock. *Direct to Card, also known as \\"Edge to Edge Printing\\". The print-head comes in direct contact with the card. This printing type is the most popular nowadays, mostly due to cost factor. The majority of identification card printers today are of this type. *Reverse Transfer, also known as \\"High Definition Printing\\" or \\"Over the Edge Printing\\". The print- head prints to a transfer film backwards (hence the reverse) and then the printed film is rolled onto the card with intense heat (hence the transfer). The term \\"over the edge\\" is due to the fact that when the printer prints onto the film it has a \\"bleed\\", and when rolled onto the card the bleed extends to completely over the edge of the card, leaving no border. =Encoding Techniques= Different ID Card Printers use different encoding techniques to facilitate disparate business environments and to support security initiatives. Known encoding techniques are: *Contact Smart Card ‚Äì The Contact Smart Cards use RFID technology and require direct contact to a conductive plate to register admission or transfer of information. The transmission of commands, data, and card status held between the two physical contact points. *Contactless Smart Card ‚Äì Contactless Smart Cards exhibit integrated circuit that can store and process data while communicating with the terminal via Radio Frequency. Unlike Contact Smart Card, contact less cards feature intelligent re-writable microchip that can be transcribed through radio waves. *HiD Proximity ‚Äì HID's proximity technology allows fast, accurate reading while offering card or key tag read ranges from 4‚Äù to 24‚Äù inches (10 cm to 60.96 cm), dependent on the type of proximity reader being used. Since these cards and key tags do not require physical contact with the reader, they are virtually maintenance and wear-free. *ISO Magnetic Stripe - A magnetic stripe card is a type of card capable of storing data by modifying the magnetism of tiny iron-based magnetic particles on a band of magnetic material on the card. The magnetic stripe, sometimes called swipe card or magstripe, is read by physical contact and swiping past a magnetic reading head. =Software= There are basically two categories of card printer software: desktop-based, and web-based (online). The biggest difference between the two is whether or not a customer has a printer on their network that is capable of printing identification cards. If a business already owns an ID card printer, then a desktop-based badge maker is probably suitable for their needs. Typically, large organizations who have high employee turnover will have their own printer. A desktop-based badge maker is also required if a company needs their IDs make instantly. An example of this is the private construction site that has restricted access. However, if a company does not already have a local (or network) printer that has the features they need, then the web-based option is a perhaps a more affordable solution. The web-based solution is good for small businesses that don't anticipate a lot of rapid growth, or organizations who either can't afford a card printer, or don't have the resources to learn how to set up and use one. Generally speaking, desktop-based solutions involve software, a database (or spreadsheet) and can be installed on a single computer or network. = Other options = Alongside the basic function of printing cards, card printers can also read and encode magnetic stripes as well as contact and contact free RFID chip cards (smart cards). Thus card printers enable the encoding of plastic cards both visually and logically. Plastic cards can also be laminated after printing. Plastic cards are laminated after printing to achieve a considerable increase in durability and a greater degree of counterfeit prevention. Some card printers come with an option to print both sides at the same time, which cuts down the time taken to print and less margin of error. In such printers one side of id card is printed and then the card is flipped in the flip station and other side is printed.  Applications  Alongside the traditional uses in time attendance and access control (in particular with photo personalization), countless other applications have been found for plastic cards, e.g. for personalized customer and members‚Äô cards, for sports ticketing and in local public transport systems for the production of season tickets, for the production of school and college identity cards as well as for the production of national ID cards.

Neffs is located at the junction of Pennsylvania Routes 873 and 329, about one mile north of Schnecksville. Historically, the town was called Unionville after the Union Church that was established there in 1797. The town's first store was built in 1815. The current town name honors Abraham Neff, first postmaster of the Neffs post office. Abraham Neff laid out the village while running a coach business and local hotel. The area then became \\"Neffsville\\", a name that was later shortened to \\"Neffs\\". The current-day Neffs post office was built in 1967. At that time the first non-agricultural manufacturing plant was built in Neffs by Ted Ambrosino, who established Ambro Fashions. The town was so concerned about the influx of additional mail and post office activity that it applied for and won a federal grant to build an upgraded modern post office facility. The U.S. Postal Code (ZIP code) for Neffs, PA, is 18065. Neffs is in the 610 area code and is served by the 767 exchange in Slatington.

Lavender Hill forms the section of the A3036 as it rises eastwards out of the Falconbrook valley at Clapham Junction, and retains that name for approximately 1.3 km to the corner of Queenstown Road in Battersea, beyond which it is called Wandsworth Road towards Vauxhall. History =Origin of the name= The earliest known reference to the name 'Lavender Hill' is in 1774 when a Mr Porter, advertising a reward for the return of his lost pony, described it as having strayed or been stolen from 'a Field on Lavender-Hill', suggesting that the name was already widely known. The road formed part of the Southwark to Kingston Turnpike from 1717. The name refers to the commercial cultivation of lavender on the gentle north-facing slopes of this part of the Thames estuary ‚Äì helped by well-drained soil, fresh air and several natural springs. The first building to reflect the name was Lavender Hall on the south side of the road in 1790. The road itself, which ran just below the crest of the hill, was not widely referred to as Lavender Hill until the later 1800s. Several smaller streets developed in the Victoria era, including Lavender Gardens, Lavender Walk (an ancient farm lane) and Lavender Sweep, also reflect the area's historic lavender industry. =Early development= In an 1848 painting, the painter refers to Lavender Hill, although this cannot reasonably be said to be from the Lavender Hill (road), more the north slope of the topographic feature. Until the 1860s Lavender Hill was mostly an area of open farmland, with small-scale development at both ends. At the western end there was a crossing of the Falconbrook river with several farms. The Chestnuts, a farmhouse built in 1812, survived and has been incorporated into the modern street plan halfway along Mossbury Road.The Buildings of Clapham - The Clapham Society, edited by Alyson Wilson, page 189 The earliest reference to the still-existing Falcon public house at the west end of the street is in 1767. After the 1780s a few large villas were built on the hillside, owned by wealthy residents attracted by the expansive views over Battersea Fields and the Thames towards London. The earliest was Rush Hill House, developed in around 1770, whose fate was typical of many of these early buildings: as the area developed, its grounds were sold off in 1872 and developed as a new street and terrace of houses (Rush Hill Terrace), and the house itself survived until 1887 before being replaced by a further terrace of houses (Crombie Mews). Street name signs for \\"Lavender Hill\\" and \\"Lavender Place\\" are still visible at 16 Lavender Hill Lavender Place was developed in around 1826 as a row of cottages at the eastern end of what is now Lavender Hill. The clean air and supply of fresh water meant Lavender Place became home in the early-to-mid nineteenth century to several laundresses, who bleached and dried linen on the grassland behind the houses. Lavender Place extended some distance into what is now Wandsworth Road, and remained a separate street for many years (one ceramic street name for 'Lavender Place' is still visible). An acetic acid distillery, Beaufoy's Acetic Acid Works, was also located at the eastern end (for many years a public house called the Beaufoy remained at this end of Lavender Hill; the only surviving trace of the distillery is now a short street called Beaufoy Road).Vauxhall Civic Society - Beaufoy Vinegar Factory In the 1870s the houses on Lavender Terrace were adapted to form a terrace of shops, and the houses on Lavender Place were eventually renumbered to become part of Lavender Hill. =Victorian era= Battersea Town Hall The Grade II listed 1920 Battersea Reference Library extension The opening of Clapham Junction railway station in 1863 led to rapid residential and commercial development along the street, with construction of a large number of houses as well as many major civic and commercial buildings. By 1885 it was such a busy commercial district that Arding & Hobbs, the largest department store south of the River Thames, was built. The imposing Church of the Ascension, designed by James Brooks, was built in 1883 to cater to the growing population of the neighbouring Shaftesbury Estate.Parish Church of the Ascension on Lavender Hill A Welsh Methodist chapel was built on Beauchamp Road, reflecting what was once a significant Welsh population.Rootsweb listing of Welsh chapels in London, including Welsh chapel at 30 Beauchamp Road Battersea Central Library was opened in March 1890, following an architectural competition that was won by Edward William Mountford (who also designed the Old Bailey) with a mildly Flemish Renaissance design that was described as \\"inexpensively devised and designed to not needlessly clash with the adjoining houses which are of the speculating builders‚Äô type of work\\".Survey of London, Volume 49: Battersea - Chapter 1, Public Buildings - Bartlett School of Architecture It quickly proved popular and saw several subsequent extensions, notably with the addition in 1924 of a reference library on Altenburg Gardens (in a part of the original plot that had originally been intended for a museum) that was designed by Henry Hyams. Battersea Town Hall was opened in 1893, as the administrative headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, and the large Grade II* listed building is one of Lavender Hill's most prominent features. When the Borough was abolished in 1965, the Town Hall became redundant. After being threatened with demolition for some years, plans to build a new library and swimming pool on the site were finally rejected following a campaign by residents to save the building, and it was then converted into a community arts centre in 1974.Battersea Arts Centre - Our History The Battersea Arts Centre is now a major arts venue. The Shakespeare Theatre was built in 1896, next to the Town Hall. It was severely damaged in the Second World War, before being demolished in 1957 and replaced by an office building called Shakespeare House. A large Central Post Office, designed by Jasper Wager, was built in 1898, and extended with a sorting office designed by John Rutherford in around 1913British Post Office Buildings and Their Architects - Battersea Post Office (1898) (although the original buildings were replaced by a modern structure designed by an unknown architect at the Ministry of Works in 1961).British Post Office Buildings and Their Architects - Battersea Post Office (1961), 202 Lavender Hill In popular culture Film poster for the Lavender Hill MobThe street is known in popular culture thanks to the BAFTA Award-winning 1951 Ealing comedy The Lavender Hill Mob. The film was so-named because the lead character, Henry Holland, lives in a seedy boarding house on the street, the 'Balmoral Private Hotel' where he and fellow resident (and foundry owner) Alfred Pendlebury meet and hatch the 'perfect' plot to steal a load of gold bullion.Brit movie - Lavender Hill Mob - explaining naming after the street Lavender Hill is featured with a chapter of its own in the historical novel London by Edward Rutherfurd, with descriptions of it in the 18th century from the pre- industrial era. Lavender Hill featured as a site location for many British TV shows, including On the Buses and The Sweeney, in the 1970s. In 1967 the English group The Kinks recorded a whimsical song entitled \\"Lavender Hill\\" which may have been under consideration as a follow-up single to Waterloo Sunset,Doug Hinman, The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night (2004) p.104 but was rejected in favour of Autumn Almanac. The song was eventually released in the U.S. in 1973 on The Great Lost Kinks Album, and has been described as \\"a southerner's counterpoint to the Beatles' Penny Lane\\", despite the fact that the Kinks hailed from North London.Pop Archaeologist - The Kinks, Lavender Hill, 1967 Notable former inhabitant include Sarah, Duchess of York, who lived in a flat in Lavender Gardens before her marriage.Diana - Her True Story, The Commemorative Edition, Andrew Morton, Pocket Books, 1998, p. 210 The first black Mayor in London, John Archer, was elected at Battersea Town Hall in 1913 after serving as a councillor for the Battersea Latchmere ward, north of Lavender Hill. Contemporary Grand commercial architecture at Arding and Hobbs department store (now Debenhams) More modestly designed shops in the central section, many of which have since been converted to restaurants and cafes =Retail= Lavender Hill is now principally a shopping and restaurant street along much of its length, with around 200 retail units in total. The Lavender Hill Traders' Association runs the annual Lavender Festival, Lavender Hill Traders Association - mention of Lavender Festival to raise the profile of the street as a shopping and entertainment destination. The western end of the street has the highest footfall, due to large commuter flows towards Clapham Junction station. Its architecture is dominated by the landmark Arding & Hobbs building (the greater part of which is still a department store, now Debenhams), a number of restaurants and cafes (including a branch of Pizza Express with decoration loosely themed on The Lavender Hill Mob). There is a large Asda supermarket with an underground car park, and a branch of Whole Foods Market. This section also includes the Battersea central Post Office and telephone exchange, and the Grade II listed Battersea Reference Library.British Listed Buildings - Battersea District Reference Library, Wandsworth The flatter central section of the road, at the top of the hill, includes approximately 15 estate agents (including Courtenay, Winkworth and Foxtons), as well as Lavender Hill police station (the main police station for the Battersea area) and the Battersea Arts Centre. There is a concentration of restaurants and bars along the central section. The eastern end of the street is anchored by smaller branches of Sainsbury's and Tesco at the crossroads with Queenstown Road. It includes a wide variety of restaurants and bars, helped by wide pavements that provide outdoor seating. There are also clusters of shops from sectors including cycling, music equipment, interior design, decorators merchants, and contemporary furniture. This section of the road is dominated by independent businesses with relatively few national operators (with the exception of a few cafes such as Caff√® Nero). In 2011, Wandsworth Borough Council completed the first phase of the Clapham Junction Exemplar project, which extensively de-cluttered and upgraded the streetscape of the western part of Lavender Hill to make it a more attractive and welcoming retail environment. This included widening of pavements, new street lighting, safer pedestrian crossings, and extensive use of granite paving.Fresh new look for Clapham Junction - Wandsworth Borough Council, 13 August 2012 =Business= Although primarily residential, Lavender Hill includes significant office space, notably at the Battersea Business Centre, which provides workspace for around 140 businesses in a converted Victorian paper mill at 99-109 Lavender Hill.Wandsworth Chamber of Commerce - Workspace in Wandsworth Unit Management - Managed workspace - Battersea Business CentreOld Ordnance Survey Maps - Battersea & Clapham 1894 - London sheet 101 - The Godfrey Edition (reference to paper mill) The area around Lavender Hill included a small proportion of industrial land use (including the area now occupied by the Asda supermarket which was originally a rail yard). Some small sites continued into the early 2000s (with manufacturers such as Rotoplas precision engineering on Stormont Road); however, almost all industrial land has been converted to residential development as the area has gentrified. =Residential= Lavender Hill's more residential past is still visible: here, a house is sandwiched between a bar and an estate agent Lavender Hill is in the centre of a high density middle class residential neighbourhood, of predominantly Victorian architecture, including the large Shaftesbury Park Estate. There is a Travelodge hotel on Falcon Lane close to the western end of Lavender Hill, and a new Premier Inn has been constructed near the eastern end of Lavender Hill (in a former Temperance Hall at the junction with Wandsworth Road).Whitbread Trading Update, 9 September 2014 Transport One of Lavender Hill's cycle hire docking points, in front of the Church of the Ascension Lavender Hill has a Public transport accessibility level of 5 along most of its length, rising to the highest level of 6b at its westen end, indicating a high density of public transport.Public Transport Accessibility Level contour map Transport at the western end of Lavender Hill is dominated by Clapham Junction railway station, one of the busiest in Europe. The eastern end is an approximately ten-minute walk from several smaller stations, notably Wandsworth Road railway station, Clapham Common Underground station and Queenstown Road railway station. In the 1890s Lavender Hill was developed as a major tram route, with tram route 26 running along Lavender Hill on the way from Kew Bridge to London Bridge, and route 28 running from Harrow Road to Victoria. The tram lines were removed in the early 1950s and replaced by several bus services (currently including the 77, 87 and 156 buses). These services still follow the same route between Wandsworth and Vauxhall, and Lavender Hill has an eastbound bus lane along much of its length. There are three Santander Cycles public cycle hire docking stations on or close to Lavender Hill (on Dorothy Road at the western end, on Lavender Hill itself close to the junction with Sugden Road, and on Ashley Crescent at the eastern end). On 10 August 2017, a 77 bus left the road and collided with a shopfront on the street, injuring 10 people. The driver was described as having lost consciousness at the time of the crash.

Um 1815\\" A marriage proposal is an event where one person in a relationship asks for the other's hand in marriage. If accepted, it marks the initiation of engagement, a mutual promise of later marriage. It often has a ritual quality. In some Western cultures it is traditional for the man to make a proposal to the woman directly while genuflecting in front of her. The ritual often involves the formal asking of the question \\"Will you marry me, ...?\\" and the presentation of an engagement ring. It may include him putting the ring on her finger. Although most potential couples discuss their willingness to marry for a significant amount of time before a proposal occurs, and may schedule a specific time and place for the proposal to be made, it can also be intended as a surprise. A woman may decline a proposal for various reasons, and may not declare what the reasons are. If the woman accepts the proposal, she will typically assent to the man verbally and wear the ring during the time leading up to the wedding, known as the engagement. The average duration of preceding courtship varies considerably throughout the world. (See courtship duration.) In Scotland, Ireland and England, 29 February in a leap year is said to be the one day when a woman can propose to her partner. Finland has the same custom, with the addition that a man rejecting such a proposal was expected to buy his suitor enough cloth for a skirt as compensation. As a monarch, Queen Victoria had to propose to Prince Albert. Proposals by women have become more common in the English-speaking world in recent years, so jewelry companies have manufactured engagement rings for men. In the United States, about 5% of proposals are made by women. Younger people are less likely to approve of women proposing. In many cultures it is traditional for a man to ask permission from a woman's father, in private, before proposing to her, or if her father has already died and she is still young of a near relation of hers. In earlier times it was common for fathers to refuse proposals from men whom they considered unsuitable as husbands for their daughters. Although it is uncommon in the West these days, the parents of the couple may make a marriage arrangement, preceding or superseding the proposal. Arranged marriages were common between members of royal families throughout most of European history; such marriage contracts and proposals were made at great distances and often without first-hand contact between the parties prior to the engagement. Other customs of initiating a marriage may include formal introduction of the partners to each other, such as the Japanese traditional custom of Miai. In Wales following the acceptance of a proposal the suitor will often provide a gift of cheese for his new fiance. The number of types of cheese provided is said to reflect the strength of his love for his partner.

It is associated with the numerical response, which is the reproduction rate of a consumer as a function of food density. Following C. S. Holling, functional responses are generally classified into three types, which are called Holling's type I, II, and III. Types I, II, and III functional responses  Type I  Type I functional response assumes a linear increase in intake rate with food density, either for all food densities, or only for food densities up to a maximum, beyond which the intake rate is constant. The linear increase assumes that the time needed by the consumer to process a food item is negligible, or that consuming food does not interfere with searching for food. A functional response of type I is used in the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra predator‚Äìprey model. It was the first kind of functional response described and is also the simplest of the three functional responses currently detailed.  Type II  Type II functional response is characterized by a decelerating intake rate, which follows from the assumption that the consumer is limited by its capacity to process food. Type II functional response is often modeled by a rectangular hyperbola, for instance as by Holling's disc equation, which assumes that processing of food and searching for food are mutually exclusive behaviors. The equation is : \\\\begin{align} f(R) &= \\\\frac{a R}{1 + a h R} \\\\end{align} Wolves killing Caribou, by Arthur Robert Harding, 1909. If the number of wolves is held constant, the number of caribou killed increases, then levels off. where f denotes intake rate and R denotes food (or resource) density. The rate at which the consumer encounters food items per unit of food density is called the attack rate, a. The average time spent on processing a food item is called the handling time, h. Similar equations are the Monod equation for the growth of microorganisms and the Michaelis‚ÄìMenten equation for the rate of enzymatic reactions. In an example with wolves and caribou, as the number of caribou increases while holding wolves constant, the number of caribou kills increases and then levels off. This is because the proportion of caribou killed per wolf decreases as caribou density increases. The higher the density of caribou, the smaller the proportion of caribou killed per wolf. Explained slightly differently, at very high caribou densities, wolves need very little time to find prey and spend almost all their time handling prey and very little time searching. Wolves are then satiated and the total number of caribou kills reaches a plateau.  Type III  Type III functional response is similar to type II in that at high levels of prey density, saturation occurs. But now, at low prey density levels, the graphical relationship of number of prey consumed and the density of the prey population is a more than linearly increasing function of prey consumed by predators. This accelerating function is largely descriptive, and often justified by learning time, prey switching, or a combination of both phenomena, but the type III functional response lacks the rigorous theoretical underpinning of the type II functional response. Learning time is defined as the natural improvement of a predator's searching and attacking efficiency or the natural improvement in their handling efficiency as prey density increases. Imagine a prey density so small that the chance of a predator encountering that prey is extremely low. Because the predator finds prey so infrequently, it has not had enough experience to develop the best ways to capture and subdue that species of prey. Holling identified this mechanism in shrews and deer mice feeding on sawflies. At low numbers of sawfly cocoons per acre, deer mice especially experienced exponential growth in terms of the number of cocoons consumed per individual as the density of cocoons increased. The characteristic saturation point of the type III functional response was also observed in the deer mice. At a certain density of cocoons per acre, the consumption rate of the deer mice reached a saturation amount as the cocoon density continued to increase. Prey switching involves two or more prey species and one predator species. When all prey species are at equal prey densities, the predator will indiscriminately select between prey species. However, if the density of one of the prey species decreases, then the predator will start selecting the other, more common prey species with a higher frequency. Murdoch demonstrated this effect with guppy preying on tubificids and fruit flies. As fruit fly numbers decreased guppies switched from feeding on the fruit flies on the water's surface to feeding on the more abundant tubificids along the bed.

Early life Dacosta was born in Angra do Hero√≠smo and grew up on Terceira island, in the Azores. Although he had no formal art training, Dacosta drew and painted from an early age. He completed his studies at the Angra High School and in 1935 left Terceira to attend the Escola de Belas Artes (School of Fine Arts) in Lisbon. Strongly opposed to the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal and horrified by the violence of the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Nationalist victory, his painting took a menacing and surrealistic turn. He displayed his first paintings at Casa Repe in 1940 along with fellow painter Ant√≥nio Pedro and English sculptor, Pamela Boden. He also showed at the annual national Salon of Modern Art where he won the Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso Prize in 1942. He became one of the forerunners of the surrealistic movement in Portugal. Many of his surrealist paintings were lost in a fire in 1944 in the studio where he was working. The remaining paintings are owned by private collectors or Portuguese museums . Throughout the 1940s he wrote art criticism for Portuguese newspapers and illustrated books for several contemporary Portuguese authors. Paris Cena Aberta (1940) In 1947, the French government awarded him a grant to spend a year in Paris, where he stayed for the rest of his life. For the first time, he was in direct contact with original masterpieces as well as the works of contemporary international artists. Post-war creativity was a revelation to him and he began to doubt the importance of his own work. He progressively stopped painting but nonetheless in 1948 sent two paintings to the Surrealist Group Show in Lisbon. In 1952, his first successful one-man show (17 Paintings 1940 ‚Äì 1950) was held at the Galeria de Mar√ßo in Lisbon. By 1953, he was no longer painting. He became a reporter for a Brazilian newspaper O Estado, writing about the Paris art scene (theatre, literature and art exhibitions). These articles (as well as articles written for Portuguese magazines) were later published in book-form ¬´ Dacosta em Paris ¬ª by Assirio & Alvim (1999). Melancolia (1942) Dacosta is today considered a pioneer of Portuguese surrealist art. In the 1950s, many Portuguese artists, including Ren√© Bertholo, travelled to Paris in search of new ideas and Dacosta became a valuable inspiration for them and a source of information about Parisian artistic life. Return to Painting In 1969 Dacosta attended a retrospective of his works from 1939 to 1948 at the Galeria Buchholz in Lisbon and in 1978 his paintings were included in Portuguese Art since 1910 at the Royal Academy of London, a show that he visited with his friend and fellow-artist, J√∫lio Pomar. Rediscovering his earlier works at this show (he owned none of them) perhaps gave him an impetus to return to painting. In 1971 he moved with his wife, Miriam Rewald, the gallerist, and two young children to Janville, a small town south of Paris, where he started making little objects, ‚Äòthings,‚Äô as he liked to call them. Encouraged by artist friends, including the Surrealist, Manuel Alves, he timidly acquired painting material. Although he never tried to show his work publicly, word got around as he occasionally showed a new drawing or object to visitors. In the mid-1970s he stopped sending his articles to Brazil and, thanks to a grant from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, became free to paint. His surrealism disappeared and gave way to a completely new style, devoid of the uneasiness and aura of danger in his earlier works. He also began to utilise pagan- religious images from his childhood in the Azores. A peaceful and mystical element entered his paintings, a very personal style - figurative but not representative. Fonte de Sintra I (1980) In 1983 a one-man show at Galeria 111 in Lisbon revealed his recent paintings, which were all sold to private and public collections. This success encouraged Dacosta to create more work. He was awarded the national art prize by the Portuguese art critics‚Äô association in 1984 and honoured with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit by Portuguese President, M√°rio Soares, in 1988.

Final Years He was commissioned to decorate a wall in the new building of the Azorean Parliament in Horta. He spent several months in Horta, installing a series of fifty-four heads in bas-relief representing Azorean citizens. A monument designed by Dacosta was built and inaugurated in the Azores at the Sala Nobre da Secretaria Regional da Educa√ß√£o e Cultura Angra do Hero√≠smo in 1995. He began a series of drawings to decorate the walls of Cais do Sodr√©, a new subway station in Lisbon. However, due to increasing bad health, painting became difficult and the commission was completed under the auspices of his friend and fellow artist Pedro Morais and inaugurated in 1998.

The 7 BW is one of only two B-1B Lancer strategic bombardment wings in the United States Air Force, the other being the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota. Its origins date to the 1918 establishment of the 1st Army Observation Group (later 7th Bombardment Group), one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the United States Army before World War II. The 7th Operations Group carries the lineage and history of its highly decorated World War II predecessor unit. It operated initially in the Philippines as a B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber unit assigned to Fifth Air Force but after the fall of the Philippines in early 1942, operated primarily with the Tenth Air Force in India as a B-24 Liberator unit. Active for over 60 years, the 7 BW was a component wing of Strategic Air Command's heavy bomber deterrent force throughout the Cold War. The 7th Bomb Wing is commanded by Colonel Brandon Parker.

No. 44-92033, in flight YB-52 prototype bomber at Carswell AFB, 1955 shown with a 7th Bomb Wing B-36 On 17 November 1947, the 7th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy was organized at Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas as part of the United States Air Force's wing base reorganization, in which combat groups and all supporting units on a base were assigned to a single wing. The wing mission was to organize and train a force capable of immediate and sustained long range offensive warfare and operations in any part of the world. The 7th Bombardment Group, flying Boeing B-29 Superfortresses became its operational component. The wing's mission was to prepare for global strategic bombardment in the event of hostilities. Under various designations, the 7th Bomb Wing flew a wide variety of aircraft at the base until it moved in 1993. Starting in June 1948 the wing received the first five Convair B-36A Peacemakers. The B-36As were delivered unarmed and were used for training and crew conversion.Knaack, p. 21These planes were never operational as bombers. They were converted to RB-36 reconnaissance aircraft. Knaack, p. 21 The first B-36 was designated the \\"City of Fort Worth\\" (AF Serial No. 44-92015), and was assigned to the 492d Bombardment Squadron. When the wing base organization was made permanent in 1948, the wing was redesignated as the 7th Bombardment Wing, Heavy on 1 August. In November 1948, B-36B aircraft began to join the B-36As. On 7 December one of the new B-36Bs flew a nonstop simulated bombing mission to Hawaii, dropping a 10,000 lb simulated bombload in the ocean. The flight took over 35 and a half hours and covered more than 8,000 miles.Knaack, p. 25 The wing's last B-29 was transferred on 6 December to the 97th Bombardment Group at Biggs Air Force Base. For 10 years, the \\"Peacemaker\\" served as our nation's major deterrent weapons system. The 11th Bombardment Group was activated on 1 December 1948 with the 26th,Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 133‚Äì134 42d,Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 193-194 and 98th Bombardment Squadrons, Heavy assigned.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 53‚Äì54Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 326 The 11th Bomb Group was assigned to Eighth Air Force, but attached to the 7th wing and was also equipped with B-36As for training. A five ship B-36 formation was flown on 15 January 1949, in an air review over Washington, D.C., commemorating the inauguration of the President of the United States, Harry S. Truman. By December 1950 the wing and its attached groups had 38 B-36s on hand, including several B-36Ds with four General Electric J47 jet engines augmenting its six reciprocating engines and its B-36Bs began to be upgraded to B-36D standard. In January 1951, the 7th took part in a special training mission to the United Kingdom. This was the first flight of B-36s outside the continental United States since the simulated mission to Hawaii.Knaack, p. 32 The purpose of the mission was to evaluate the B-36D under simulated war plan conditions. Also, further evaluate the equivalent airspeed and compression tactics for heavy bombardment aircraft. The aircraft, staging through Limestone AFB, Maine, would land at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, following a night radar bombing attack on Helgoland, West Germany. From there the bombers would conduct a simulated bomb run on the Heston Bomb Plot, London, finally landing at[RAF Lakenheath. This was the first deployment of wing and SAC B-36 aircraft to England and Europe. For the next four days the flight flew sorties out of England. The aircraft redeployed to the states on 20 January arriving at Carswell on 21 January. By September 1952, the B-36s assigned to the 7th Wing and its companion 11th Wing comprised two thirds of SAC's intercontinental bomber force. On 1 September 1952, what was then thought to be a tornado rolled across the Carswell flight line, with winds over 90 miles per hour recorded at the control tower. By the time it had passed \\"the flight line was a tangle of airplanes, equipment and pieces of buildings.\\" None of the 82 bombers on the base escaped damage, and SAC declared the entire 19th Air Division at Carswell non-operational. Maintenance personnel of the 7th Wing went on an 84-hour weekly work schedule and began work to restore the least damaged aircraft to operational status. More heavily damaged aircraft were worked on by personnel from the San Antonio Air Materiel Area, where the depot for the B-36 was located. The planes that had been most heavily damaged were towed across the field to the Convair plant where they had been manufactured. Within a month, 51 of the base's Peacemakers had been returned to service and the wing was again declared operational. By May 1953, all but two of the planes had been returned to service.One plane was written off, another was bailed to Convair to be used for experiments with nuclear power. McGowan, p. 65. B-52 era On 10 December 1957, the 98th Bomb Squadron was detached from the wing and assigned to the newly activated 4123d Strategic Wing at Carswell. This would become the first Boeing B-52 Stratofortress unit at Carswell. During January 1958, the wing began transferring its B-36 bombers to various SAC wings. On 20 January, the wing transferred all B-52 equipment and property on hand to the 4123d Strategic Wing in order to facilitate that organization's conversion, which was scheduled several months ahead of the 7th Bomb Wing at Carswell. The 7th Bomb Wing officially became a B-52 organization with the adoption of manning documents and equipping authorizations on 1 February 1958. On 30 May, Memorial Day, the last of the B-36s in the wing were retired with appropriate ceremonies and an \\"Open House\\" event on the base. Air Force and civilian personnel of the base, their families, and civilians from surrounding communities were on hand to bid the \\"Peacemaker\\" a fond farewell. This last flight of a B-36 completely phased out B-36 operations in the wing. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the primary mission of the wing was training in global strategic bombardment and air refueling operations. On 13 April 1965, the 7 BW deployed its forces to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam to support SAC combat operations in Southeast Asia. Most of the wing's bombers and tankers, along with aircrews and some support personnel, were deployed. At Andersen AFB, the wing flew more than 1,300 missions over Vietnam, and returned to Carswell in December 1965. In 1964 and 1965, the wing's B-52Fs were selected for modification under programs South Bay and Sun Bath. These modifications enabled the wing's bombers to double their bomb load from 24 to 48 750 lb bombs by the installation of external bomb racks. With these modifications, the wing's planes, along with those of the 320th Bombardment Wing at Mather AFB, were the first to deploy to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam and the first to fly Arc Light bombing missions. The modified B-52Fs were the only SAC bombers to deploy for Arc Light missions until 1966, when the B-52Fs were replaced by B-52Ds with the Big Belly modification than enabled them to carry a larger and more varied bomb load.Knaack, pp. 256, 268 Later B-52 crews were sent through an intensive two-week course on the B-52D, making them eligible for duty in Southeast Asia. B-52Ds assigned to combat duty in Vietnam were painted in a modified camouflage scheme on the upper surfaces with the undersides, lower fuselage, and both sides of the vertical fin being painted in a glossy black. The USAF serial number was painted in red on the fin over a horizontal red stripe across the length of the fin. The B-52 effort was concentrated primarily against suspected Viet Cong targets in South Vietnam, but the Ho Chi Minh Trail and targets in Laos were also hit. During the relief of Khe Sanh, unbroken waves of six aircraft, attacking every three hours, dropped bombs as close as 900 feet from friendly lines. Cambodia was increasingly bombed by B-52s from March 1969 onward. By mid-1973 most wing KC-135 resources had redeployed, and most B-52 resources returned by January 1974. The wing resumed nuclear alert status on 3 January 1974. From 4 December 1973 to May 1975, the wing conducted B-52D replacement training, and from January 1974 also conducted B-52D combat crew training, i.e., providing B-52 flight training to novice crews. Beginning in June 1974 the wing also conducted B-52 and KC-135 Central Flight Instructors' courses. Participated in numerous USAF and NATO exercises worldwide. Used B-52s for ocean surveillance and ship identification in joint naval operations. Wing KC-135 aerial refuelers supported tanker task forces worldwide. In October ‚Äì November 1983, the wing supported the invasion of Grenada with aerial refueling. In the 1980s the base received several new weapons systems, including modified B-52H aircraft as the B-52D aircraft were retired. In 1983, B-52 crews began training with a new weapon system, the SRAM (Short Range Attack Missile) and later, in 1985, the ALCM (Air Launched Cruise Missile). Also, the wing flew numerous atmospheric sampling missions during 1986 and 1987 in response to the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident. Deployed air refueling personnel and equipment to provisional wings in Southwest Asia, August 1990 ‚Äì February 1992. The wing hosted the first Soviet START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) exhibition inspection team in September 1991. =Modern era= As \\"host unit\\" for Carswell AFB, the 7th Bomb Wing began preparations for BRAC-directed base realignment of Carswell AFB in January 1992 and transfer of most of the installation to the U.S. Navy as Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth / Carswell Field to replace nearby Naval Air Station Dallas, which was also being closed due to BRAC. Concurrent transfer of Carswell's remaining USAF-specific aspects to the Air Force Reserve Command's tenant activities at Carswell, Headquarters, 10th Air Force (10AF) and the 301st Fighter Wing (301 FW), was also accomplished. 7th Bomb Wing was released of all operational capabilities at Carswell AFB on 1 January 1993. The 7th Bomb Wing closed Carswell AFB on 30 September 1993, transferring the installation to the U.S. Navy as NAS JRB Fort Worth and to AFRC as Carswell Air Reserve Station and moved to Dyess AFB, Texas without personnel or equipment on 1 October 1993. At Dyess, the became the 7th Wing (7 WG), a composite wing equipped with B-1B and C-130 aircraft. In 1997, the wing assumed responsibility for all B-1B initial qualification and instructor upgrade training for Air Combat Command. On 1 April 1997, the wing again became the 7th Bomb Wing when the C-130 airlift mission transferred to Air Mobility Command (AMC). Since 2000, the 7th Bomb Wing has provided bombing, training and combat support to combatant commanders. In the spring of 2015, the Department of the Air Force announced effective 1 October 2015, the 7th Bomb Wing, along with the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, would be realigned under Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), reuniting all the Air Force's bomber and strategic missiles under a single command for the first time since Strategic Air Command (SAC) was disestablished 23 years earlier.

It is considered to be one of several transpersonal disciplines.Walsh, Roger. \\"The Transpersonal Movement: A History and State of the Art\\". Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 1993, Vol. 25, No.2Walsh, R. & Vaughan, F. \\"On transpersonal definitions\\". Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 25 (2) 125-182, 1993. The field is associated with the work of Bruce W. Scotton, David Lukoff and Francis Lu. Definition and context According to Walsh and Vaughan, who conducted an extensive review of transpersonal definitions, transpersonal psychiatry is the area of psychiatry that focuses on the study of transpersonal experiences and related phenomena. Its focus is similar to transpersonal psychology, but with a particular interest in the clinical and biomedical aspects of transpersonal phenomena. The close relationship between the two disciplines is reflected in the title of the first standard introductory book to the field; the Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology, which was published by Basic Books in 1996.Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. New York: Basic Books.. In the textbook Scotton provided an \\"Introduction and definition of Transpersonal psychiatry\\" and stated that Transpersonal psychiatry is a psychiatry that seeks to foster development, correct developmental arrests, and heal traumas at all levels of development, including transpersonal levels. It extends the standard biopsychosocial model of psychiatry to a biopsychosocial-spiritiual one in which the later stages of human development are concerned with development beyond, or transcendent of, the individual.Scotton B.W. Introduction and definition of Transpersonal psychiatry\\", in Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. New York: Basic Books In the same publication Chinen described the origins of the fields of Transpersonal psychiatry and Transpersonal psychology in a fashion that illustrated how the emergence of the two fields are intertwined with each other.Chinen, A.B. The emergence of Transpersonal psychiatry, in Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. New York: Basic Books. History According to MillerMiller, J.J. Book Review: Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. Psychiatric Services, April 01, 1998 https://doi.org/10.1176/ps.49.4.541 there are precursors to clinical work in the transpersonal field. He mentions the work of William James, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Abraham Maslow, and Roberto Assagioli. In his review of the \\"Emergence of Transpersonal psychiatry\\" Chinen traced the common origin of the fields of transpersonal psychiatry and psychology to the counterculture of the 1960s, and the Humanistic psychology movement of the same period. The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology was founded in 1969 and became an important forum for the development of transpersonal theory. Clinicians participated in the transpersonal literature from the early rise of the field. In 1992 the Menninger Clinic organized its first symposium on transpersonal psychiatry. The conference was well attended. A few years later, in 1994, the American Psychiatric Association included a new diagnostic category in its official manual (DSM-IV), following a proposal from clinicians associated with transpersonal psychology and psychiatry.Grof, P. Book review: Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, June 1998, Volume 43, Number 5. https://doi.org/10.1177/070674379804300513 The category was called Religious or Spiritual Problem.American Psychiatric Association. (1994). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association. Among the coauthors of the new category was David Lukoff.Lukoff, D. (2014). From personal experience to clinical practice to research: A career path leading to public policy changes in integrating spirituality into mental health. Spirituality in Clinical Practice, 1(2), 145- 152, American Psychological Association. https://doi.org/10.1037/scp0000016 In 1995 John Hiatt founded the transpersonal care program at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Francisco. The program was intended to address spiritual issues in the health care of veterans.Moran, Lisa A. Innovations: Transpersonal Psychiatry at VA Medical Center. Psychiatric Services, April 2000, vol. 51, No. 4. In 1996 Basic Books published the Textbook of Transpersonal psychiatry and psychology, marking the first comprehensive textbook introduction to the field.de Rios, Marlene Dobkin.

PsycCRITIQUES, 43(2):144‚Äì145, Feb. 1998 https://doi.org/10.1037/001527 the book does not differentiate clearly between the two areas of transpersonal psychiatry and transpersonal psychology. However, in the August 1999 issue of Psychiatric Annals a distinction was made, and special attention was paid to the area of transpersonal psychiatry. In 2001 the American Psychiatric Association introduced the topic of transpersonal psychiatry to their Annual Meeting Course Guide.Philadelphia, May 18‚Äì23: The 21st-Century Psychiatrist.

The courses included direction from Bruce W. Scotton and Allan B. Chinen. Course Faculty included John R. Battista, Francis G. Lu, Roger Walsh, William W. Foote, Lewis Mehl-Madrona, John F. Hiatt and Bruce S. Victor. In 2007 educators at the University of California (Davis) presented a new academic program for its psychiatric residents. The program was designed to improve culturally appropriate diagnosis and treatment in the Sacramento area. It included training in religion and spirituality, as well as insights from transpersonal psychiatry, as part of the PGY-residency.Bender, Eve. \\"Cultural Diversity Curriculum Covers All Residency Years.\\" psychnews.psychiatryonline.org, Retrieved on March 20, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1176/pn.42.9.0007 The integration of transpersonal psychiatry in psychiatric residency training programs has earlier been suggested by Francis Lu. Contribution to academic theory and clinical work Transpersonal psychiatry's contribution to the field of psychiatry is the actualization of spiritual and transpersonal dimensions in clinical work. Several clinicians have engaged with this issue. In 1991 psychiatrist John Nelson published the book Healing the Split. In a review of the book Publishers Weekly described it as a \\"synthesis of transpersonal psychology, medical psychiatry and neuroscience\\".Publishers Weekly Book Review. John L. Nelson - Healing the Split. Reviewed on: 02/04/1991, publishersweekly.com. Retrieved on March 20, 2019. Nelson interpreted several major psychiatric disorders as altered states of consciousness, involving expansion of the self- concept, and, in some instances, contact with a spiritual dimension. Other clinicians that have engaged with transpersonal approaches include Bruce Scotton, Bruce Victor, David Lukoff, Francis Lu and John Hiatt, who all contributed to Psychiatric Annals, Volume 29.

Also, since all levels of development are prone to developing pathology, transpersonal psychiatry can, according to theory, provide models for therapeutic intervention at all stages of maturation, including trans-egoic stages.

Among the problems associated with the area of religion was: loss or questioning of faith; change in denominational membership or conversion to a new religion; intensification of adherence to the beliefs and practices of one's own faith; joining, participating in, or leaving a new religious movement or cult. Among the problems associated with the area of spirituality was: distress related to a mystical experience; distress related to a near- death experience; distress related to a spiritual emergence or emergency; distress related to meditation.

Moran, who reported on the program in 2000, noted that the treatment included individual psychotherapy, medication clinics, and group therapy. According to Mick Collins,Collins, M. Spiritual Emergency: Transpersonal, Personal, and Political Dimensions. Psychother. Politics. Int. 6(1): 3‚Äì16 (2008). https://doi.org/10.1002/ppi.147 who addressed the topic of spiritual emergency from a social-political perspective, Transpersonal psychiatry provides a much needed impetus for establishing differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment for those people who need additional support through a spiritual- transformational crisis. The concept of transpersonal psychiatry is also featured in the construction of psychological instruments. In 2008 Grabovac, Clark and McKenna Grabovac A.; Clark N.; McKenna M. Pilot study and evaluation of postgraduate course on \\"the interface between spirituality, religion and psychiatry\\". Academic Psychiatry, 2008, Jul-Aug;32(4):332-7. https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ap.32.4.332 developed the Course Impact Questionnaire as part of their effort to evaluate the ‚ÄúInterface between Psychiatry, Religion and Spirituality‚Äù in an academic curriculum. The instrument (questionnaire) had three items on transpersonal psychiatry. Reception - recognition and criticism In his review of the Textbook of Transpersonal psychiatry and psychology Paul Grof notes that the field has been subjected to criticism. He suggests that this criticism is the result of misunderstandings. However, commentators have offered both recognition and skepticism towards the concept of transpersonal psychiatry. In 1999 the journal Psychiatric Annals dedicated a large portion of its August issue to the topic of transpersonal psychiatry. The Issue was guest edited by Bruce W. Scotton.Fawcett, J. Will a \\"Real\\" Psychiatrist Please Step Forward? Psychiatric Annals, 1999;29(8):447 https://doi.org/10.3928/0048-5713-19990801-03About the Guest Editor - Bruce W. Scotton, MD. Psychiatric Annals, 1999;29(8):448 https://doi.org/10.3928/0048-5713-19990801-04 According to the editor at the time of publication, Jan Fawcett, the issue discussed transpersonal psychiatry and encouraged its readers to broaden their \\"concept of psychiatry to include such issues as cultural norms, religious meanings, and spiritual issues\\" in their practice of psychiatry. The issue resulted in both positive and negative reactions from readers. Jay Liss (MD) dismissed the theories of transpersonal theory and suggested that it was not \\"clinically appropriate to consider aberrations of the brain as spiritual or religious\\". On the other hand, Wells Goodrich (MD) welcomed the inititative from transpersonal psychiatry. He found that a transpersonal approach worked well with a small number of informed patients.Liss, Jay L, Scotton, B.W; Goodrich, W. Transpersonal psychiatry/Guest editor responds.

Novi Sad, commonly just Vojvoƒëanska banka was a bank based in Novi Sad, Serbia. It was a universal bank, with functions of commercial and investment banking. In December 2017, it became a member of OTP Bank Group and merged with OTP banka Srbija, which later changed name to Vojvoƒëanska banka. History The first branch of Vojvodjanska banka was founded in 1868 in Sombor as a credit cooperative. Later, in 1962, Vojvodjanska banka was repackaged as Privredna banka; soon after, Privredna banka was joined by Komercijalna banka Senta, Komercijalna banka Baƒçka Topola, Sremska banka Sremska Mitrovica, Kreditna banka Kula and Banatska banka Zrenjanin. In 1973, Privredna banka became Vojvoƒëanska banka, the largest banking institution in the province of Vojvodina and one of the largest in the country. It had 16 branches. In the end of the 1970s, Bank opened three independent representative offices in New York City, London and Frankfurt; and joint representative offices established in Moscow, Beijing and Tehran. In the 1980s, Vojvoƒëanska Bank became a member of the Yugoslav Banking Consortium for the realization of the first loan granted by IFC for the development of small companies; and Associate Bank realized 70% of the total foreign exchange operations of Vojvodina economy. In 1989, the Bank split up into 9 equal successors; the Head Office and 8 branches. Later, during the 1990s, Bank started to open more branches in Central Serbia, Banja Luka (in Republika Srpska) and in Podgorica (Montenegro). The branch office in Banja Luka became an independent bank with the major equity share in private ownership. Vojvodjanska banka was the co-founder and shareholder of VB Banja Luka. On 30 May 1995, Vojvodjanska banka d.d. became Vojvodjanska banka a.d. (joint-stock company) and was registered within the Serbian Agency for Business Registers.

Plot summary  An army of Spanish soldiers is searching for the Tree of Life. Father Avila feels that their long journey is about to serve its purpose when he notices that a symbol on a blade he is carrying matches a symbol drawn in the sky, as well as on the ground. He presumes this must be the location of the Mayan temple that houses the Tree of Life. The soldiers accompanying him are reluctant and feel that his theories will only add to the loss of soldiers they have had. The soldiers begin their assault on the temple only to be met by the Mayan warriors who are protecting the temple. Father Avila advances up the temple and is met by a Mayan priest who slowly emerges from the temple. Dr. Thomas Creo is fatigued, sitting at a computer. He is about to perform surgery on a monkey that has a tumor. His colleagues tell him the surgery is canceled and they are going to euthanize the animal.

The plot concerns Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) buying an apothecary table from Pottery Barn and trying to keep roommate Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) from finding out that she bought it from a chain store. The episode was directed by Kevin S. Bright, written by Brian Boyle (from a story by Zachary Rosenblatt) and guest-stars Elle Macpherson in her final appearance as recurring character Janine Lecroix. The episode and producers attracted criticism for the blatant product placement present in the story. Plot After Rachel buys an apothecary table from Pottery Barn for her and Phoebe's apartment, she learns from Monica that Phoebe hates Pottery Barn and its mass-produced products, because she believes there is no symbolical history behind them. In order to keep the table, Rachel tells her that she purchased it from the flea market at a surprising discount, making it antique in Phoebe's eyes. The plan is eventually ruined when, at Ross's place, Phoebe notices an exactly identical apothecary table, and Ross, having at first decided not to tell Phoebe, gets angry when she spills wine on a new sheet, also from Pottery Barn, and tells the truth. To cover for this, Rachel claims that Pottery Barn ripped off their table's design; and later ends up buying a collection of items from Pottery Barn, claiming they are antiques. Ross, fed up with her lying, makes Rachel take Phoebe to the flea market to get some antique furniture. They do not find any there, but on the way home, Phoebe glances at a window display from Pottery Barn, and instantly realizes that Rachel had bought all their stuff from there and becomes angry with her. However, she falls into liking a lamp from Pottery Barn, which is the only piece of furniture that Rachel has not bought from there. She intentionally coerces Rachel into threatening to move out unless she buys her that lamp. Meanwhile, Joey convinces his roommate, Janine, to go double dating with Chandler and Monica; but without Monica and Chandler's knowledge, Janine criticizes the whole experience to Joey, disliking Chandler's funny quotes and Monica's loud behavior. He is forced to admit this to them after she dodges another double date; they become angry at her but Joey manages to convince them to give her another chance. After the second double date, Chandler and Monica overhear Janine's true feelings about them and the situation escalates into an argument between them. Joey, torn between his feelings for Janine and respect for his best friends, demands that Janine try to get along with them, threatening to break up with her if she does not. Janine agrees and apologizes to Monica. However, she then quietly insults her, which culminates in an off- screen fight between the two. Joey, angry and upset, breaks up with Janine, and she moves out. Reception Entertainment Weekly rates the episode B+, describing Janine's criticism of Monica and Chandler as inspired, and enjoying the mockery of the \\"omnipresent\\" Pottery Barn. The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends point out that viewers are aware that new characters will not remain on the series for long, citing Paolo, Julie, Richard Burke and Emily Waltham as examples. They further describe Janine's character as lacking personality, suggesting it is either bad writing or bad acting by MacPherson. In a 2004 feature to mark the end of the series, EW compiled a \\"best product placement\\" list, placing this episode at number one. When questioned in 2000 about why there was product placement in the episode, Peter Roth of Warner Bros. played down the criticism by stating that the deal struck with Pottery Barn \\"offset the high cost of production\\", and while Pottery Barn donated pieces for the episode they denied paying for any product placement.So Apparently THAT Episode Of \\"Friends\\" Was Secretly Product Placement For Pottery Barn And We're All Living A Lie. BuzzFeed. 20 April 2018. The episode had lasting effects for Pottery Barn; in a 2004 interview Patrick Connolly of Williams Sonoma said the \\"phones light up with catalog requests every time it airs\\" in syndication.

The southern terminus of SR 96 is at a T-intersection with SR 98 nearly northeast of Bucyrus. Its eastern terminus is at an interchange with US 42 and US 250 in the eastern portion of Ashland. Route description SR 96 passes through the counties of Crawford, Richland and Ashland. There are no stretches of the highway that are included within the National Highway System, a system of highways identified as being most pertinent for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. History 1923 marked the year in which SR 96 was established. Originally, the highway consisted of the majority of what its easternmost stretch today, running between downtown Shelby and downtown Ashland. A westward extension of SR 96 happened in 1939. This extension followed the existing SR 96 west out of Shelby, along with what is now Crawford County Road 45 (Stetzer Road) west- southwesterly to a new western terminus in the eastern end of Bucyrus at Old Lincoln Highway, which at the time designated as US 30N. In 1971, coinciding with the completion of the US 30N (now mainline US 30) freeway bypass of Bucyrus, SR 96 was re-routed onto its present alignment through eastern Crawford County to its current western terminus at SR 98 northeast of Bucyrus. Jurisdiction of the former alignment into Bucyrus was turned back to Crawford County, which designated it as County Road 45. Then, by 1992, SR 96 was extended slightly on the eastern end. With the re-routing of US 250 onto a northern bypass of Ashland that tied with the US 42 eastern bypass of the city, SR 96 was extended into the eastern end of Ashland along the former routing of US 250 to a new eastern terminus where US 250 re-joined its former alignment at the US 42 interchange.

Plan The plan is a five-point blueprint for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. The plan calls for: * an immediate ceasefire, * an exchange of prisoners, * an international peace conference (similar to the Madrid Conference of 1991, which was held by Spain and led to the Oslo Accords), while it also * backs a prospective Palestinian unity government, and * an international mission in the Gaza Strip to monitor the ceasefire. Reaction Senior Palestinian National Authority negotiator Saeb Erekat welcomed the plan in principle, but added that there was no need for a new initiative, but rather that it could serve as a realistic political track to a two-state solution. An Israeli official said parts of the plan were being discussed, but that it was not being taken seriously as it was not coordinated with the EU or Israel.

He grew up in the small town of Minden in Webster Parish, some thirty miles east of Shreveport. The house where athlete David Lee grew up in Minden, Louisiana The family home was a short walk from the Minden High School stadium, then a new structure, where Lee made his first successful mark in football between 1957 and 1960. Not only was Lee All-District and All-State in football in his senior year, the fall of 1960, but he excelled similarly in basketball (1961), baseball (1959‚Äì1961), and track (1958‚Äì1961). He was also elected by his peers to the Student Council during his senior year.

It is one of the few schools that offer an education in Chinese culture in addition to the regular curricula required by Department of Education Culture and Sports and by private schools, in combination with the ideals of a Catholic education. The academy is under the direction of the Divine Word Missionaries and was primarily established for the benefit of the Catholics of Chinese descent, residing in Dagupan City and around the country. However, the school equally welcomes all children regardless of race, color and religious creed. Its director is Rev. Fr. Edgar L. Calunod, SVD.  History  Bishop Therode Schu, SVD, expelled from China by the Communists because he preached the Word, found himself in the Philippines in 1953. Still driven to serve the Chinese, his vision was to keep the Word alive by establishing a parish and a school to take care of the apostolic needs of the Chinese. Eduardo Kang Tan, Sr., a prominent Chinese in Dagupan convinced Bishop Schu to establish the parish and school in Dagupan City. In 1955, the Parish of Saint Therese was officially established with Father Joseph Kwo as the first parish priest. At the same time, plans for the school were made with the assistance of concerned citizens led by Eduardo Kang Tan, Sr. In 1957, the school opened its doors to students from kindergarten to first year high school. It was then known as St. Therese Chinese Academy with 130 enrollees and eight teachers. The first director was Fr. Richard Hartwich, SVD. The other administrative officials were Fr. Peter Joseph Kwo, school treasurer, and Fr. Matthias Ning, school disciplinarian. In 1958, Fr. Aloysius Yang, SVD became the acting school director but was replaced after a while by Fr. Hubert Lohrbach, SVD. In 1960, the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) took over the ownership and administration of the school. Henceforth, the school was known as the Divine Word Academy of Dagupan (DWAD). In 1961, Fr. Henry Schmitz, SVD became the school director, a position he was to hold for 15 years. The year also saw the High School Department holding its first Commencement exercise with eight graduates. In 1976, Fr. Matthias Ning, SVD became the school director, a position he held for 11 years.

He is introduced as the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Stamford branch of paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin in the third- season premiere when Jim Halpert transfers, ultimately merging with the Scranton branch in the episode \\"The Merger\\" later in the season. He becomes Regional Manager at the Scranton branch courtesy of Robert California in the eighth-season premiere following the departure of Michael Scott and Deangelo Vickers, although temporarily is fired and replaced by Nellie Bertram before his reinstatement by new CEO David Wallace. Throughout the ninth season, Andy's relationship with Wallace deteriorates from Andy's lack of focus and professionalism, eventually culminating in Andy's voluntary resignation, to his reinstatement as a salesman to his eventual firing again, after Andy's vulgar actions cause David Wallace to fire him, which he uses to his advantage in order to pursue a career in entertainment. This all happens over the course of one day in \\"Livin' the Dream\\". Andy has no counterpart in the original British version of the series. However, from season eight onwards, some of his traits (such as his position as the Regional Manager, his ineptitude in management and his failed attempt at a career in entertainment after being fired) are reminiscent of David Brent, the British counterpart of Michael Scott. His character is insecure, seemingly due to a strained parental relationship, yet demonstrates self-centered and arrogant attitudes. Despite this, he has been shown to act very kindly to his co-workers on occasion, at times even acting like a brother. In Season 6 Episode 17, Andy reveals that his parents originally named him Walter Jr., but after his baby brother was born when he was 6, his parents felt that the brother better represented the Walter Jr. name. His parents then changed his name to Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book. He often references his education at Cornell University, where he was a part of an a cappella group, which contributed to his love for theatrical singing. Andy demonstrates a sycophantic attitude toward his superiors as well as severe anger management issues. He becomes involved in a long-term but failed relationship with accountant Angela Martin, but later finds a deeper connection with receptionist Erin Hannon. However, the relationship starts to sour throughout the ninth season and finally ends in \\"Couples Discount\\" when Erin gets fed up with Andy's neglect and selfishness. Although Helms received praise for his performance, the character received a mixed reception. Andy was named one of the most annoying TV characters of 2011 by Vulture; in contrast, Nerve ranked him the second funniest character on the series, behind only Michael Scott. The character is named after American economist Andrew Bernard, professor of international economics at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. Biography Andy claims to have been born and raised in Simsbury, Connecticut. His birth name was Walter Bernard Jr., but after his younger brother was born, his parents decided that the new baby better embodied that name and should be named after his father instead. Thus, the original Walter was renamed Andrew, a name taken from a book of baby names. He claims to have been an obese child, though he never talks about it. Andy's family was considerably wealthy growing up, and he admits that whenever anybody wanted something they would write it on a list for the housekeeper to get. Andy is a 1995 alumnus of Cornell University, which he often brags about to his peers, and minored in History. In a talking-head interview, he brags that he graduated in four years, having never studied once, been drunk the whole time, and sung in the a cappella group \\"Here Comes Treble\\", which he mentions often. Andy is descended from a well-heeled line of WASPs, that he claims \\"goes all the way back to Moses\\", and his family purportedly gained their wealth by transporting slaves. Andy often refers to himself by his nickname, \\"the 'Nard Dog\\". Within \\"Here Comes Treble\\", his nickname is \\"Boner Champ,\\" which he earned after engaging in coitus with a snowman to completion. He enjoys singing in a high falsetto voice, occasionally to the accompaniment of his banjo. He has experimented with the sitar, eventually learning to play \\"Deck the Halls\\". He also plays piano and guitar. Prior to his employment at Dunder Mifflin, Andy worked at Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns (both of which went under in 2008), AIG (which received massive government aid in 2008 to stave off bankruptcy), and Enron (which collapsed in 2001). It is also revealed that Andy suffers from irritable bowel syndrome. When first seen on the show in 2006, Andy was the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Dunder Mifflin Stamford branch. Andy worked with fellow salesmen Jim and Karen, under the direction of Josh Porter. Upon the branch's closure later in 2006, Andy transferred to the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch. Despite his impressive-sounding title at the Stamford branch, Andy repeatedly proves himself to be a poor salesman, being one of the two worst salesmen in the Scranton office along with Pam Halpert.\\"Koi Pond\\" After Pam becomes office administrator, Andy is left the worst salesman, outsold even by the warehouse workers.\\"The Seminar\\" Andy is shown to enjoy inventing nicknames for his colleagues. He nicknamed Jim Halpert \\"Big Tuna\\", because Jim ate a tuna sandwich on his first day at the Stamford branch, and once called Ryan Howard \\"Big Turkey,\\" presumably for a similar reason. Prior to his anger management training, Andy had severe anger problems. Upon finding his calculator embedded in Jell-O, a trademark prank of Jim's, he screams and kicks a trash can across the office. After punching a hole in the wall of the office, in frustration over his hidden cellphone, Andy is sent to anger management training, which he claims is still \\"Management Training.\\" Andy regularly dresses in a distinctive, over-the-top Ivy style, usually consisting of bright colored pants (some embroidered with animals and tennis racquets), d-ring belts, tattersall shirts, sweater vests, striped ties, a tie clip, or sometimes even a bowtie. In various episodes, Andy wears clothes of the style found at the stores Brooks Brothers, Vineyard Vines, and J. Crew. In various episodes, Andy is seen wearing a blue, thick woven bracelet on his right wrist, despite that it will, at times, clash with his overall appearance. During the summer of 2011, Andy is promoted to Regional Manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch. However, when he returns to Scranton after a trip to Florida and discovers that Nellie Bertram has replaced him, he goes into a fit of rage. After the incident, he refuses to be demoted, which ultimately leads to Robert California firing him. However, after persuading David Wallace to re-purchase the company, Andy is reinstated as manager. Andy then tells David Wallace that he is going to quit his job, only having second thoughts almost immediately, gets temporarily re hired as a salesman. Then, he quits again to pursue his dream of being an entertainer. After embarrassing himself at a singing competition show audition (which becomes an internet meme) Andy is offered a job in the admissions office at Cornell University, and decides to return to his alma mater. In the series finale table read, Andy announces he has a fianc√©e and invites everyone in the office to his wedding. However, this was not included in the actual episode. It was revealed in a photo album on NBC that Andy went on to get married, continue working at Cornell and audition for a new iteration of the band Here Comes Treble. Relationships Despite being considered irritating by some of his co-workers, Andy is well-intentioned, and typically shows a rapport with his colleagues, as well as a desire to confirm that they are enjoying themselves. =Erin Hannon= In season 6, Andy takes an interest in receptionist Erin Hannon, who has mutual affections, but due to miscommunication, there was a long period where the two waited for the other to make a move. However, Andy eventually asks Erin out on a date, and she graciously accepts. A few months later, after Erin discovers, through Michael Scott, of Andy's former engagement to accountant Angela Martin, she throws cake in Andy's face, and decides that they need to take a break from one another. Over a year later, Erin, after breaking up with Gabe Lewis, asks Andy out on a date, but he dismisses her advances, because of his lingering issues with her leaving him for Gabe. When Andy introduces his girlfriend Jessica to the Office at a Christmas party, Erin initially appears friendly to her, but she becomes drunk, and confesses to Andy that she wishes Jessica were dead. Greatly offended, Andy informs Erin that she needs to get over their break-up, and briskly leaves. Upon learning that Erin wishes to live in Tallahassee, Florida, Andy drives to Tallahassee to get back together with Erin. At first he is unsuccessful, but ultimately gets her back, and they make up and kiss in the middle of the street. When Andy discovers his job is stolen by Nellie when he and Erin return to the office, he is demoted to salesman again and holds back his anger. The day seems to get worse when their sex life becomes the subject of a staff meeting, embarrassing them. When Nellie makes another quip, Erin snaps and in turn, encourages Andy to finally let his anger loose on Nellie, which later helps Andy get his confidence back and improves their sex life. However, during season 9, their relationship starts to show cracks as Andy comes back from a training seminar that has made him more confident, but seemingly more selfish to Erin. When Andy takes his parents boat to Bermuda for three weeks, he leaves Erin behind, who looks on disappointed. Erin later goes out with Pete, a new co-worker for drinks. Three weeks later becomes three months, which makes Erin increasingly unhappy after Andy neglects her by being unsociable. Erin later tries to dump Andy in \\"Couples Discount\\", until he convinces her that they can fake love each other like his parents did. Erin initially agrees to this until she talks to Pete, who only wants her to be happy. This prompts Erin to finally break up with Andy by citing both his neglect for her and that he was irresponsible for being gone for three months from work. During \\"Moving On\\", Andy's distraught behavior affects his professional relationship with Erin and the staff, and has him confiding some of the staff, including Pete, whom Erin is dating in secrecy from Andy. When Andy learns of their relationship, he acts irrationally to where Erin and Pete lecture him that he needs to move on. Vengeful, Andy hires both Gabe and Alice (Collette Wolfe), who is Pete's ex-girlfriend and a marketing professional, with the intent of making Erin and Pete uncomfortable. The ploy works to the point where arguments break out between the parties in the conference room, as Erin and Pete's issues with their past relationships surface. Andy smugly says to the camera that making the new couple unhappy, has made him feel better. In the episode Livin' the Dream, Andy and Erin are seen speaking pleasantly to each other and Erin even admits her concern for his well being saying she's worried he'll \\"be homeless or even starve.\\" Later on during Andy's goodbye song Erin can be seen watching Andy with a serious look of affection, making it unclear whether or not the two still have romantic feelings for each other. In the Finale Andy, Erin, and even Pete are all shown to be getting along well and spending time together during the after party in the warehouse, indicating the tensions from earlier have vanished (though it is unclear if Erin and Pete are still a couple at that point, as the episode doesn't provide any evidence in either direction). =Angela Martin= In the fourth season, Andy begins a relationship with accountant Angela Martin, who half-heartedly began dating him on the rebound, after she had broken up with Dwight Schrute (whose relationship with her had been unknown to the majority of the staff). After dating for about seven months, Andy proposes to Angela, during Toby Flenderson's farewell party, and she solemnly accepts. However, during their engagement, she resumes her affair with Dwight. Andy endures tremendous effort in order to prepare Angela's dream wedding. Upon learning about the affair, both he and Dwight break up with her, and Andy is initially crushed. When Andy is leaving the office for good after he quits to seek fame, Angela tries to talk him out of it; Andy wrongly assumes she regrets ending their relationship, and says he does think about her often, but Angela is able to choke back her disgust and she and Andy part ways with a hug. =Michael Scott= In season 3, Andy transferred to the Scranton branch after Stamford closed. Andy had a strategy to become the number two of the branch by name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. Michael immediately liked him. In the A Benihana Christmas, Andy took Michael to Benihana for lunch to help him get over Carol. Andy convinced Michael to ask out their waitress, Cindy. In the Traveling Salesman, Andy picked Michael as his traveling salesman partner. In the car ride, Michael told Andy about Dwight going behind his back and talked to Jan. When they went to do their joint sale pitch, Andy completely ruined the sale pitch. Michael was not happy with him. Andy found the toll booth receipt that showed Dwight went to New York and suggested that he wanted to talk to Jan again. This resulted in Michael confronting Dwight about going to corporate behind his back and lying to him. As a result, Dwight quit Dunder Muffin. In The Return, Michael started to realize he is crazy. When Michael was talking to Jim about Andy, he told Michael that he is a yes man and he did the same thing with Josh Porter at the Stamford branch. After Angela told Michael why Dwight went to New York, Michael decided to leave the office to get Dwight back. Andy tried to come with him and he also began telling Michael about his weekend plans for the two of them. Finally, Michael told him to stop. He realized he made a mistake trying to replace Dwight with Andy who ‚Äúlove this place so much that he punched a hole in it.‚Äù Andy left at the end of the episode to begin angry management. After Andy came back, Michael made him a team captain for the Beach Games competition and considered him as a potential replacement. =Dwight Schrute= Since his arrival, Andy and Dwight had a competitive professional relationship; he and Dwight argued over which title, Assistant Regional Manager (Dwight) or Regional Director in Charge of Sales (Andy), was higher in command. Eventually the two duel over Angela when it is found she is cheating on Andy with Dwight. After the fight, both relationships end and Angela is left heartbroken and alone. A few months later, the two soon begin competing for the attention of Erin, but Dwight ultimately decides to cease pursuing her in order to maintain a good relationship with Andy. However, after Andy is hired as Regional Manager, Andy makes Dwight his \\"Enforcer\\", in order to stay on good terms, but Dwight later states, in a talking-head interview, that he will simply \\"wait for Andy's inevitable demise\\". During \\"Couples Discount\\", Dwight is unable to get Andy's sign off on prices with a major sale that Dwight landed, although when Andy suddenly reappears, he chastises Dwight over not having his approval on the prices. When Dwight informs him that Andy was on a boat and unreachable, Andy tries again to maintain his authority. But that backfires when Andy decides to renege on the prices with Dwight's client, thus voiding a major sale for the company and wrecking Dwight's sales record. Dwight later tells false stories to Andy when the manager is in need of being caught up on his branch, in hopes of sabotaging Andy. When Dwight learns he's in line to become the permanent branch manager and Andy asks if his plan to quit and seek stardom is a good idea, Dwight kindly but firmly tells Andy that he should not quit, even if this denies Dwight his dream job. Andy later returns to Scranton to attend Dwight's wedding to Angela. =Jim and Pam Halpert= Andy has been the subject of many pranks by Jim and Pam, some of which have caused for his anger issues to unfold. Andy also had a romantic interest in Pam, but due to intentionally misleading advice given to him by Jim, it did not develop into a relationship. Although the two will, at times, act considerably mean to Andy, Jim and Pam are often pleasant to him, and even give him advice when he needs it. When Andy goes through a rough breakup, he gives Jim wildly bad advice when he suspects Pam of controlling him. However Jim uses it as an opportunity to prank Andy throughout the day before he sees through the ruse, prompting Jim to comfort him about finding someone else. Jim is also supportive of both Andy and Darryl when they interview for the position of Regional Manager. After Jim is sent to Tallahassee along with Dwight, Cathy Simms, Erin, Stanley Hudson, and Ryan Howard, Pam and Andy are primarily seen hanging out with each other, with him defending her from a group of young girls leading him to a blackened eye and persistent mocking from the rest of the office. =Darryl Philbin= Initially, Darryl and Andy were foes. Darryl states that Andy once used him as a scapegoat, nearly getting him terminated from his job, for a mistake that Andy had made. Andy also attempts to order Darryl around when Sabre's \\"Sales is King\\" policy greatly affects the sales staff's egos. However, over time, the two develop a strong friendship. When Darryl confides in Andy that he wished he had remained a member of the warehouse staff, Andy convinces him to make the most of his position and continue rising in the company. When Darryl is depressed over not winning a lottery that the warehouse staff won and shared, he demands that Andy either terminate him or give him the Manager position. Andy is blunt, but kind, as he informs Darryl the truth about his shortcomings, and Darryl subsequently rededicates himself to his job. When he meets Andy's family, Darryl overhears Andy's father berate him over his status in life, and finally understands why Andy needs to please others, and later participates in cheering Andy up, along with the rest of the staff. Darryl is also one of the few people in the office, along with Jim, Pam and Erin, who did not accept Nellie Bertram's attempt at usurping Andy's job. Darryl is not impressed with Andy's acting ability, to the point of bluntly saying Andy needs to have a job that will tolerate his inevitable and chronic mistakes (Andy cluelessly thinks Darryl is expressing strong covert support for Andy's dreams) and later avoiding him during the Finale's reunion and other events, but he is visibly impressed with Andy's speech at Cornell and gives him a hug. =Gabe Lewis= While initially having a neutral relationship with Corporate liaison Gabe Lewis, after he began dating Erin in the summer of 2010, Andy has since developed a dislike for him. In the episode, Nepotism, Andy imagines Gabe being eaten by a whale. Gabe becomes irritated with Andy, because Andy holds a work meeting that is a thinly veiled attempt to learn whether Gabe and Erin are having sex or not. He bluntly tells Andy that he asked for his permission before pursuing Erin, and says that Andy needs to accept the situation and move on. After Erin breaks up with Gabe, a heartbroken and jealous Gabe begins to heavily resent Andy, and threatens him not to make any advances on Erin. When Andy interviews for the Regional Manager position, Gabe displays a negative, biased opinion of him. Later, he unsuccessfully attempts to convince the CEO of Sabre, Jo Bennett, not to hire Andy as Manager. For the next year (until Gabe is written out of the series), Andy and Gabe are generally rivals, often making snide remarks to one another. After Erin broke up with Andy, he hired Gabe to make Erin feel uncomfortable. =Phyllis Lapin-Vance= In earlier interactions, Andy and Phyllis Lapin- Vance were shown to have a hostile relationship. After Jim hides Andy's cellphone from him, Andy attempts to search for it in Phyllis's desk drawer. She harshly closes it, and Andy loudly exclaims \\"I don't trust you, Phyllis!\\". When Andy finds himself attracted to potential client Julia, he questions Phyllis on who she is. Phyllis immediately answers that Julia is \\"Out of [Andy's] league\\". An offended Andy attempts to rebuff her opinion, stating that he has been with numerous beautiful women, leading Phyllis to knowingly ask \\"Sexually?\\", to which Andy abruptly ends the conversation. When Gabe and Jo are interviewing the staff to find the potential employee that leaked to the press that Sabre's printers catch on fire, Phyllis quietly tells Andy \\"Put your hand up, Norma Rae\\". Andy then tells her that if she says anything incriminating about him, he will \\"Break off the temples of [her] glasses and stick them in [her] eye sockets\\". Later, when Nick, the IT guy, reveals that Andy was, indeed, the whistleblower, Phyllis hides Andy's carry-on bag in the ceiling, coldly telling him \\"You deserve it\\". Throughout the seventh season, however, Andy and Phyllis grow closer, and it is shown that Phyllis truly cares for Andy, wanting the best for him. When Andy is upset about Gabe and Erin's possible sex life, Phyllis agrees to ask Erin leading questions to learn the truth, although this was not achieved due to Phyllis's intoxication, which led her to tell Erin an explicit account of how she has sex with her husband Bob Vance, which made Erin uncomfortable. =Robert California= After becoming the new CEO of Sabre, Robert California appointed Andy as Regional Manager of the Scranton branch. Since then, Andy has developed an awkward relationship with Robert, who he is eager to impress, and highly intimidated by. Robert states that the reason he chose Andy for the Manager position, is because he is \\"All surface... Uncomplicated, what you see is what you get\\". Andy and Robert's contentious relationship climaxes when Robert allows Nellie Bertram to usurp Andy's Regional Manager position, and Andy is fired for refusing to accept Nellie as manager, only able to reclaim his managerial role by convincing David Wallace to purchase Dunder Mifflin away from Sabre and Robert. Character history =Season 3= Andy is introduced in the season 3 premiere as the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Stamford branch, where Jim has transferred to. Early season episodes reveal his anger issues, displayed when he finds his calculator encased in Jell-O and when he performs poorly due to Jim's inexperience at Call of Duty. After the closure of Stamford and merger with Scranton, Andy attempts to gain favor with manager Michael Scott through his quoted tactics of \\"name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake\\". There is rivalry with Dwight Schrute over whether his title is higher than that of Dwight's Assistant Regional Manager, fueling an intense power struggle. However, Michael becomes agitated at Andy's sycophantic attitude and poor salesmanship, as does the office at his obnoxious singing. Jim hides Andy's mobile phone that rings with Andy's rendition of \\"Rockin' Robin\\" in the ceiling, enraging him into punching a hole in the office wall. A producer's cut of the episode explains Andy's departure from subsequent episodes as due to being sent to anger management training. Andy returns a few months later to a short-lived \\"three-year\\" shunning courtesy of Dwight. He accompanies Jim to meet with clients from a local high school following an obscene watermark being vandalized onto Dunder Mifflin paper. This unexpected trip leads Andy to the discovery that his girlfriend is a high school student. At the Beach Games, Andy captains a team alongside Jim, Dwight and Stanley Hudson in a competition for Michael's selection of the next Regional Manager of the Scranton branch, as Michael believes he is a shoo-in for a position at corporate. However, he falls plight to the sabotage of Angela Martin, who favors Dwight, and ends up in a sumo wrestler costume drifting away into Lake Scranton. However, when Dwight is pre-emptively named Regional Manager by Michael (who is confident that he will receive a promotion), Andy is named Assistant Regional Manager, although never actually becomes ARM as Michael does not receive the corporate promotion. =Season 4= With the departure of Karen after Jim dumping her off-screen, Andy becomes the only salesman from Stamford aside from Jim to stay on at the Scranton branch. A preview clip for the fourth season features Andy taking up inner-tubing. The fourth-season premiere, \\"Fun Run\\", has Andy competitively participating in Michael's superfluously named run for rabies prevention through strategically drafting Kevin, although he falls prey to \\"nipple chafing.\\" Andy develops a friendship with Dwight in the third episode \\"Launch Party\\", in which he supports Dwight in beating the online sales of the company website Dunder Mifflin Infinity using a bear horn, much to the irritation of the office. He also develops a relationship with Angela, not being aware of Dwight and Angela's previous romantic interludes. He steals an elaborate ice sculpture for Angela's launch party, and serenades her later in the same episode with a rendition of the ABBA song \\"Take a Chance on Me\\", receiving a rare, yet quickly suppressed smile in return. He moonwalks in \\"Money\\" by her desk to impress her, although it takes the gift of the cat Garbage (from the previous episode) and a sentimental note to finally win her. Angela and Andy continue to date into \\"Local Ad\\", in which Andy consults Dwight on how to pursue more intimacy with Angela. Andy discusses the exclamation of \\"Oh, D!\\" Angela exclaims during intimate moments, unaware that Angela may be referring to a nickname for Dwight and not him. Andy and Kevin successfully team up in the season to recover lost parking spaces taken by renovators of another company in the business park in a meeting of the building tenants, called \\"The Five Families\\". He is rebuffed from clubbing in \\"Night Out\\" with Michael and Dwight in New York with the newly promoted Ryan by Dwight, who has a rekindled dislike for Andy considering his relationship with Angela. This is evidenced later in \\"Did I Stutter?\\" when Dwight uses pressuring negotiation tactics in order to buy Andy's Nissan Xterra at a reduced price, only to flip it for profit on eBay much to Andy's protest. In \\"Job Fair\\", Andy is invited to accompany Jim on a major sales call. However, in a deleted scene, Jim reveals Andy was invited in order to benefit Jim, as Andy's pride for Cornell would push the client- a graduate of Dartmouth- toward him. The scheme plays out as intended when the client invites Kevin to play golf with him again but denies Andy's request to join them. In \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", Andy proposes to Angela (unbeknownst to him, at the same moment Jim had been preparing to propose to Pam) with a ring that he has carried in his wallet for six years, because \\"You never know when you'll meet the right girl\\". Angela accepts his proposal with a somewhat irritated \\"Okay\\"; shortly thereafter, though, she rekindled her intimate relationship with her former lover, Dwight, which is witnessed by Phyllis and the camera crew, who walk in on them making love by her desk. =Season 5= Between season four and five, Andy plans his wedding with Angela, although his ideas are often rejected by her. Unbeknownst to him is the continual affairs between his fianc√©e and Dwight. It takes until \\"Customer Survey\\" to convince her on a wedding concept, although Angela has manipulated Andy into having the only option to satisfy her demands being Dwight's farm. However, Andy has already placed many non-refundable deposits on other wedding ideas and lost them to Angela's indecisiveness. The NBC/Office website contains a feature where Andy reveals all the details of his and Angela's wedding. In \\"Business Trip\\", Andy and Oscar bond over Andy's failed attempt to set Oscar up, drunkenly calling Angela and asking why they haven't consummated their relationship. Andy does admit Angela makes him a \\"better man\\" during his talks with Oscar, although he fails to hear Dwight in the background of the call. In the morning, Angela pushes him back to first base, although Andy feels better from the closer relationship he's gained with Oscar. Angela and Andy later go on a tour of Schrute Farms in \\"The Surplus\\", unfortunately for Andy, who continually steps in manure on the grounds of the farm. During a tour of the wedding chapel, Andy portrays Angela's father and Dwight as Andy in a wedding rehearsal that Andy is oblivious to be a real wedding whose marriage license Angela later voids. This forward act by Dwight pushes Angela toward committing to Andy in the long run. In \\"Moroccan Christmas\\", Andy takes up playing the sitar, and brings it to the office Christmas party. While he is in another room, Phyllis reveals that Dwight is having an affair with Angela. Andy then returns, unaware of what the rest of the staff know and decide not to reveal, and goes home with Angela. In \\"The Duel\\", Michael informs him of Angela and Dwight's affair, and Andy responds to this by confronting Dwight and challenging him to a duel. They meet out in the parking lot, where Dwight realizes that Angela has had sex with Andy as well, despite telling Dwight that she had only been sleeping with him. Realizing that they have both been lied to, Andy cancels his wedding cake, and Dwight throws out the bobble head in his likeness, implying the men's relationships with Angela are now over. Andy refers to Angela on his registry as \\"The maid of DIS-honor\\". In the beginning of \\"Stress Relief\\", the staff is trapped in the office while under the impression that it is on fire. Everyone panics, and Andy attempts to escape out one of the doors, but burns his hand, as Dwight had previously heated it with a propane torch. When Dwight sets off firecrackers, Andy believes that \\"The fire's shooting at [them]!\\". He then teams up with Jim, and they attempt to use the copier as a battering ram, against one of the locked doors. Later, at Michael's Roast, Andy writes a song about how unintelligent Michael is, aptly called \\"What I Hate About You\\". In a deleted scene from \\"Lecture Circuit\\", Andy is shown to have a McCain-Palin bumper sticker on his car, which he scrapes off because he is romantically interested in Julia, an African-American, potential client, who he presumably assumes voted for Barack Obama (although, it is also possible that he only had the sticker to appease Angela, who is a Conservative). He later attempts to kiss Julia, and she politely, but firmly rebuffs him. Later, he miserably notes that Dunder Mifflin also lost the account. In \\"Blood Drive\\", when Michael holds a meeting for the Lonely Hearts Club party, he inquires as to Andy's whereabouts, since he is nowhere to be seen. Oscar informs the other staff that Andy is attending one of his honeymoons, which puzzles Michael. Oscar then explains that when Andy was making plans for the wedding, he put down non-refundable deposits at multiple destinations, and ended up going to all of them, to fulfill the deposit. Andy is later called \\"that new jackass\\" by Bob Vance, when he and Phyllis are having lunch with Jim and Pam. In \\"Golden Ticket\\", Andy gives Kevin romantic advice that appears to reflect his own experiences with Angela: he tells him to never give his date compliments, push for physical contact, or be assertive to the point of rudeness. In a deleted scene, Andy refers to Angela as \\"Satan\\". In \\"New Boss\\", he is one of the observers of Michael's immature antics when he starts repeating everything that the new boss, Charles Miner, says. With the rest of the staff, Andy insists that Michael stop before he makes things worse for himself and for everyone else. In \\"Two Weeks\\", Andy gives Michael a bottle of wine as a farewell gift, and Michael indirectly insults him. Later, in the Break Room, when Michael decides to start his own paper company, he offers him a job, to which a visibly uncomfortable Andy is about to reject Michael, when Dwight enters the room, and Andy refers Michael to Dwight, before leaving. In \\"Heavy Competition\\", Andy offers bargain deals on wedding plans to Pam and Jim. However, he mistakes Pam's rejection of Jim's ideas as Pam controlling him. Andy assumes the role as Jim's emotional rock, which Jim goes along with, as a prank. When Andy makes an announcement to the office for them to respect Jim's emotional needs, Phyllis informs him that Jim is just messing with him. When he goes to confront Jim over the matter, Jim tells Andy that he is very happy with Pam, and assures Andy that, while his breakup with Angela was \\"A bummer\\", he will find someone else. In the episode \\"Cafe Disco\\", Andy and Kelly compete in a dance-off, and he proves himself to be as enthusiastic about dancing as he is about music. In the last scene of the episode, Kelly and Andy are seen in the men's bathroom, where she is about to give him an ear piercing, something that he fears the pain of, as well as worrying that he will be pierced on the \\"Gay ear\\". =Season 6= Andy continues to develop a friendship and an attraction to Erin, which began late in the fifth season. However, the pair are both too timid to reveal their feelings for one another. In \\"Murder\\", Andy asks Erin out on a date while playing a game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets, but is confused whether she was just playing along with the game. When she implies that she said yes as Naughty Nellie, he says that he also asked her out in character, leaving both disappointed.\\"Murder\\" It is also revealed in \\"Koi Pond\\", that Andy is currently the second-worst Salesman of the branch, along with Pam, and they are forced to make fruitless efforts at \\"cold call\\" selling. In \\"Gossip\\", Michael spreads the rumour that Andy is actually homosexual, which causes Andy to question his own sexuality throughout the episode.\\"Gossip\\" In \\"Secret Santa\\", Andy requests to be Erin's secret Santa. He then proceeds to give Erin the Twelve Days of Christmas. Subsequently, Erin becomes injured by the geese, terrorized by the other gifts of birds, and angered at whomever is her secret Santa. Michael, disgruntled by the fact that Phyllis was made office Santa that year instead of him, reveals to the entire office that Andy is Erin's secret Santa. Unfazed, Andy hires 12 professional drummers to perform for Erin and the rest of the staff at the end of the episode, which Erin enjoys.\\"Secret Santa\\" In \\"Niagara\\", the night before Jim and Pam's wedding, Andy rips his scrotum on his car keys while in the midst of a dance-off competition with his co-workers. Andy confesses that he had never done the splits before, but he is motivated to perform this dance move to impress Erin. Pam takes Andy to the hospital the night before her wedding as everyone else is too drunk to drive. In \\"Sabre,\\" he believes that after hiring professional drummers for Erin, she should ask him out. However, she believes that he will ask her out and she can't wait to see how he \\"tops [the drummers].\\" In \\"The Delivery,\\" after Michael arranges a date between Erin and Kevin, this incites Andy to finally and successfully ask Erin out, although initially his ploy to ask her out backfires. In \\"New Leads,\\" after Michael distributes the sales leads to rest of the staff, Erin hides Andy's leads. The Hot & Cold game she plays with him in the reception area turns into an uncomfortable situation where Andy almost fondles Erin's chest. At the end of episode, a \\"hot-blooded\\" Erin offers a cold Andy her jacket in a landfill where they share their first kiss. Earlier in the episode, Andy lets the new sales leads get to his head and greatly offends Darryl. He, along with the rest of the sales staff, is convinced by Jim that their poor attitudes have alienated everyone else, and agrees to Jim's proposal to smooth things over with the staff. During \\"Happy Hour,\\" Andy and Erin's attempts to keep their relationship under wraps, backfires constantly when they're too overzealous about hiding it. Finally sick of hiding the truth, Andy declares their relationship during the company's happy hour gathering. In \\"Secretary's Day\\", Andy pulls out all stops in making sure that Erin has a memorable Secretary's Day, even asking Michael to treat Erin out to lunch, which the boss reluctantly agrees to do. However, when Michael reveals that Andy was engaged to Angela, Erin reacts badly. She even throws cake in Andy's face when he tries to serenade her with one of his songs, and wants to take a break from their relationship. Michael does smooth things over a bit with Erin, but Erin does not change her mind about breaking up with him, and Andy remains distraught. During \\"The Cover-Up\\", one of his clients informs him that their Sabre printer catches fire, which worries Andy. When he decides to investigate the matter, he enlists Darryl to assist him. However, Darryl wants to get revenge on Andy for almost getting him fired a while back over mistaken shipments, and goes along with the ploy by playing up his fears. But when Andy video tapes the printer that catches on fire, it confirms his suspicions. This prompts Darryl to call off his prank, when he realizes it could get himself in trouble. When Michael is revealed to be dating a married woman in \\"The Chump\\", Andy is furious because of his own cuckolding at Angela's hands, and is driven to make Michael realize the error of his ways. Andy drives Michael to a high school baseball game that the woman's husband is coaching and makes the two meet, making it uncomfortable for Michael and eventually leading to him ending the affair. In \\"Whistleblower\\", the press gets word of Sabre's printers catching fire, the company's CEO Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) goes out of her way to find the culprit. Andy initially denies it, even though he is accused of this. But he eventually comes clean with the truth by admitting to submitting a letter to a news editor and the video he recorded of a printer catching fire. Andy admits this as he doesn't want to see the printer fire cause a catastrophe to a school or hospital, but finds himself harassed throughout the day by the sales staff when they all suspect he did it. However, as he leaves at the end of the day, Andy is commended by Erin for his bravery, and he leaves smiling. =Season 7= In \\"Andy's Play\\", he plays the part of Anthony in Scranton's production of Sweeney Todd. He invites the entire office to come and is particularly hopeful to impress Erin with his performance‚Äîbut when Erin agrees to babysit for Pam and Jim's daughter Cece so that they can attend, Andy nearly blows the performance checking his phone for word from her on stage. Erin ultimately is revealed to have been watching from the back, Cece in tow, to Andy's delight and to Jim and Pam's chagrin. Andy is sad once again when Erin leaves quickly to attend to a cold-suffering Gabe, but he then sings for the delighted office crew and finishes his evening on a happy note. In \\"Costume Contest\\", he mentions in a conversation with Darryl that he wrote daily op-ed columns for his college newspaper, The Cornell Daily Sun. After realizing that he did not want to become editor of the paper, he walked right out of Walter Bernard Hall, which is the name of his father. In \\"Sex Ed\\", he holds a sex education seminar for the office because people are insulting Meredith, but is really only doing so to find out if Erin and Gabe are sleeping together (the answer is \\"Yes\\"). When the employees make fun of him, he gets angry and throws a pizza box at the wall. Later Gabe bluntly tells Andy to never behave like that again, especially after Andy gave Gabe permission to ask Erin out over the previous summer, but Darryl cheers him up. In \\"The Sting\\", Andy gets jealous over hearing of a former Here Comes Treble member's musical success, and forms an underwhelming but enjoyable office band with Darryl and Kevin. In \\"Christening\\", Andy joins Michael Scott's plan to travel with the church group to Mexico, as both men are deeply unhappy with their personal lives in Scranton, but they quickly realize their mistake and return to their regular lives. In \\"Viewing Party\\", Andy isn't happy to be attending a \\"Glee\\" viewing party at Gabe's apartment, and takes so much of the obscure Asian potency items Gabe had collected that he becomes visibly ill. In \\"Ultimatum\\", Andy reveals that his New Year's resolution is to \\"learn how to cook for one\\", since his regular cooking leaves him with twice as much food as he needs. He flatly tells Pam that he's not going to meet anyone, and that \\"some people are destined to be alone\\". He later goes with Darryl and Dwight on a trip to a bookstore, and they later have fun at a local roller skating rink. In \\"The Seminar\\", Andy holds a small business seminar in the office with some special guests because he needs to overcome his pathetic sales figures. At the end of the seminar, Andy is able to sell three packages, thanks to the advice of Michael. In \\"PDA\\", Erin asks Andy to tag along on a romantic treasure hunt Gabe has made for her, despite the fact that Andy is now dating a friend of Darryl's named Rachel. Andy is at first reluctant but relents at Erin's friendly urging. The hunt starts with a puzzle picture, which leads to Gabe's stereo in Darryl's office, which leads to glow in the dark stars in Ryan's closet, leading to sparkling cider with Hank the security guard, and finally to a Valentine's cookie in the break room. When the cookie tells her to enjoy her Valentine's kiss, Erin thinks she's supposed to kiss Andy. Andy points out Gabe blowing a kiss through the window and leaves awkwardly. When the staff gathers in the Conference Room to see the screening of Michael's movie \\"Threat Level Midnight\\" in the episode of the same name, Andy is shown playing a character with a New Jersey accent named Billy the Bartender. Jim starts laughing uncontrollably at a particular scene, causing everyone else to laugh with him. Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away, to which everyone protests, including Andy, who says that some people are doing a superb job in the movie. In \\"Todd Packer\\", when office administrator Pam gets a new computer for the receptionist's desk to replace the current, ancient one, Andy wants a new computer too. Pam states that if she were to get a new computer for one sales rep (Andy), she would have to get one for every sales rep, which leads the entire office into believing that new computers are being freely handed out. Since Pam refuses to give him a new computer, Andy switches his computer with Erin, a trade Erin seems to be fine with. Pam is angry with him, saying that the computer was not meant for Erin personally but for the receptionist's desk in general, and therefore it was not hers to switch. Pam tells Andy that the only way he can get a new computer is if his breaks, which leads to him accepting all cookies, intentionally opening pop-up ads, and placing food in the disc drive. Pam then buys Andy a new computer, which they scratch up so it figures into Pam's fake cover story (finding a spare model in the warehouse), and Pam later doles out some vacation days to Darryl to keep the whole lie nicely bottled up. In \\"Garage Sale\\", Andy, Darryl, and Kevin play and bet on the Dallas board game. As the instruction booklet is not with the game, Andy and Darryl make up the rules as they go along, much to Kevin's objection. Eventually, Kevin notices the money they had bet on the game with is missing, and storms out. As Darryl and Andy look at each other in confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras that he has the money, stating, \\"And that... is Dallas\\", mocking Andy and Darryl's previous statement. In \\"Training Day\\", new branch manager Deangelo Vickers designates Andy as the office \\"funny guy\\". Deangelo loves the antics of Andy, who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat, getting to the point where he pours hot coffee on his pants and, at Deangelo's urging, eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that \\"this is my life now\\". In \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", after winning the \\"Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year\\" Dundie Award (since he tried Marijuana in College), Andy leads the employees in serenading the soon-to- depart Michael with an a cappella version of \\"Seasons of Love\\" with altered lyrics. In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Andy is given Michael's client list as a going away present, and after losing one, requests the help of Deangelo to retain them. Deangelo nearly screws up a relationship with a client, but Andy gains enough confidence to salvage the sale. Meanwhile, Erin confides to Michael over dealing with breaking up with Gabe, that she might be in love with Andy again, while Gabe becomes venomously angry towards Andy because he (wrongly) believes Andy triggered Erin's brutal public breakup with him. In \\"The Inner Circle\\", Andy is shown to want in on Deangelo's \\"inner circle\\" of office workers, but changes his mind about Deangelo when the women say he's sexist. However, when Jim brings the rumor of Deangelo being sexist to his boss's attention, he replaces Jim with Andy, who eagerly accepts. While Andy says he's going to infiltrate and change from within the circle, as soon as he steps into Deangelo's office, he calls the meeting place \\"man cave\\" and barks like a dog before closing the door. In \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\" Gabe makes Andy promise not to date Erin (while crying) to which Andy agrees in order to get Gabe out of the room. When Dwight becomes the interim manager, Andy suffers temporary hearing loss when Dwight accidentally fires a gun near him. Erin runs to his side out of concern. Later, when Andy and Erin are talking, Gabe tells Erin what Andy said about them not dating, but Andy shuts Gabe up by pointing out Gabe's pathetic crying fit, and tells both of them that he's keeping his final view on whether he wants to date Erin or not \\"between me and my diary\\". In \\"Search Committee\\" Andy interviews to replace Michael/Deangelo as the regional manager, which Gabe tries to sabotage. Also, Erin asks Andy out on a date and he eventually refuses, claiming that he has gotten over her. However, Andy later tells the camera that he does think Erin is great. Andy also remains a managerial candidate once Gabe's behavior gets him transferred out of Scranton, and tells the office he won't make any changes at all, but his status like everyone else's is left unclear as the episode ends. =Season 8= Robert California, selected by the search committee, declines to become Branch Manager and convinces Jo Bennett to give him her position as CEO, thus giving Robert the authority to appoint Andy as the new manager between the events of \\"Search Committee\\" and \\"The List\\". Upon discovering a list that divides the office into winners and losers and being moved into the loser division after questioning Robert about it, he retaliates by hosting a pizza party for the losers and publicly confronts Robert with the positive attributes of the losers. This act earns the respect of Robert and the office, in addition to an extended Columbus Day weekend. In \\"The Incentive\\", Robert California urges the doubling of sales growth, which Andy attempts to fulfill with an incentive program. This program spirals out of control when Andy has one of the prizes of the program to be a tattoo on his posterior, worth 5,000 points. In comedic fashion, the office pools their points and succeeds in winning this prize, to which Andy bravely owns up to, only for the office to change the originally more-raunchy tattoo design to one that honors Andy's nickname of \\"The Nard Dog.\\" Robert, in an aside in the episode, reveals that Andy's selection as the Regional Manager was done because he's a simple underdog whom people will rally behind. In \\"Lotto\\", after six warehouse workers win $950,000 in a lottery pool, and quit in a celebratory fashion of running through the office, Andy has a hard time finding any office workers who will step in for the day and make sure that the day's important orders shipped out. Darryl, depressed from the fact that he didn't win the lottery because he works in the office now, assembles a conference room meeting with several potential new hires, but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits, leaving Andy alone to take charge of the process. Andy doesn't know what he's doing and all of the workers simply leave. Darryl blames himself for the failure and asks Andy to fire him, but Andy refuses, thinking/hoping Darryl is speaking in code. Later, Andy finally manages to hire three warehouse workers. Andy steps up when Darryl tells him to give him the manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip, and bluntly tells Darryl he not only isn't going to do that, but Darryl was not the runner-up to Andy in the selection process; as he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glen, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board. During \\"Garden Party\\", Andy throws a garden party to impress Robert with his parents Walter (Stephen Collins), Ellen (Dee Wallace) and younger brother Walter, Jr. (Josh Groban) in attendance. However, it's evident that Andy is also trying to prove himself to his parents, who were under the impression that he was CEO of the company until later. He goes to great lengths to try and impress them, even with a toast that gets progressively worse when Andy resents his father and brother performing a duet that Andy tried performing with his father. This indicates that Walter, Jr., who was given his father's name when the Bernards decided that it was better suited to him than soon-to-be-Andy, remains the clear favorite son. When Walter, Sr. later goes to speak with Andy, he insults his job and says Andy needs to stop seeking his approval like a little kid would. This conversation is overheard by Jim, Pam, Darryl, Oscar and Erin via Jim and Pam's baby monitor, prompting everyone to understand why Andy feels the need to get everyone to like him. After his family leaves, Andy feels dejected and plans to head home himself, but Darryl and Oscar cheer him up with food from their impromptu barbecue, and Andy finishes his day smiling as he enjoys good food and company. In \\"Spooked\\", Andy dresses up as a construction worker. He assigns Erin to set up the Halloween party, as he wants to live up to the expectations set by Robert. When Robert arrives, he notices that the party is more tailored to kids than adults. Andy asks Angela and Phyllis to help take over and re-tailor the party and asks to speak with Erin at the end of the day. Andy and Robert later talk with Erin in his office regarding Erin accidentally ruining the Halloween party by putting on a disturbing movie of Gabe's creation. Erin says she got nervous when Andy asked to have a talk with her and that she thought he was about to fire her over the party. However, Andy tells her he's dating someone, and she is shocked to hear they've been out on 31 dates so far. Erin doesn't speak up and leaves dejectedly, however, at the end of the episode, Erin talks to Andy about her feelings. In the cold open of \\"Doomsday\\", Andy, to commemorate and \\"bring closure\\" to the end of each work day, plays \\"Closing Time\\", much to the dismay of his visibly annoyed co-workers. Andy, frustrated that no one but him and Erin enjoy the tradition, starts to scold the workers until Stanley comes in happily singing the song alongside him. After it is discovered that an accounting error lead to a client getting a free order, Robert tells Andy to clamp down on the mistakes. In turn, Andy enlists Dwight to implement a system, nicknamed \\"The Doomsday Device\\", which can record five errors and generate an automatic email report to Robert, putting fear into the office. Realizing this could jeopardize his staff, Andy along with Erin, Pam and Kevin try to talk Dwight out of sending the email to Robert. In \\"Pam's Replacement\\", Andy, Darryl and Kevin have another jam session in the warehouse where Robert joins them. But they're eventually phased out when Robert's more talented bandmates step in. The three end up having their own jam session outside. Andy takes much of the staff to \\"Gettysburg\\" as part of a motivational speech, but his attempt to galvanize the staff in relation to the historic war, does little. Fed up, Andy storms off and later argues with Jim, who tells Andy that the staff simply like him as a manager, and that he doesn't have to prove himself to them, putting Andy at comfort. Andy meets \\"Mrs. California\\" and at Robert's hasty instruction, is not supposed to hire his wife Susan, for a job in the office. Although in front of his spouse, Robert contradicts his instruction quite well, leaving Andy and later Jim in a hard place when Andy is trying to not hire her. When Susan is hired and then later quits her job, Andy goes to speak with her and she asks him out on a date, leaving him in shock. In \\"Christmas Wishes\\", Andy dresses up as Santa for the office's annual Christmas party as an effort to makes everyone's holiday wish comes true. He also introduces Jessica, his new girlfriend to the office, much to the confusement and later drunken chagrin of Erin, who resents her. Erin drunkenly tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die, offending and angering Andy. He tells Erin to get over the fact that he turned her down for a date and storms off. Although when he suspects Erin is getting unusually close to Robert when he drives her home, he tails them to her apartment as Meredith's designated driver. But to his relief, he sees Robert hug Erin goodbye with comforting words and instructs her to take care of her hangover. Desperate to meet the company's sales quota to impress Robert, Andy tries numerous methods to reach the number such as buying up paper stock himself and asking Oscar to \\"fix\\" the sales quota number. However, Oscar informs him of a \\"Trivia\\" night he's attending in Philadelphia with a $2,000 cash prize. Andy gets the idea to bring the staff with him in an effort to win the prize, only to be surprised that they end up in a gay bar. To Oscar and his trivia team's chagrin, the staff splits off into teams and to Oscar and Andy's surprise, the underdog team of Kevin (whom Andy passive-aggressively rejected for his team), Erin, Kelly and Meredith win the cash prize for the office to meet their quota. Seemingly despondent over his impending divorce, Robert hosts an impromptu \\"Pool Party\\" at his soon-to- be-sold mansion. The staff attends with Andy and his girlfriend, much to Erin's consternation. Andy carries around the engagement ring his parents had, which he claims that his parents fell head over heels in love with Jessica. Desperate for Andy's attention, Erin enlists Dwight and they engage in a series of competitive pool games with Andy and Jessica. Later on, Dwight asks Andy about his love life as he's trying to find out how Andy feels about Erin, which Andy deflects with weak answers, prompting Dwight to tell Andy \\"you're an idiot\\" before walking away in disgust. At one point during the night, Andy accidentally loses the ring and goes frantically searching for it but to no avail. However, Erin recovers the ring in the pool and gives it to Andy, knowing the history behind the ring. Andy confides to Erin that he's confused about his relationship with Jessica, which gives Erin hope. In \\"Last Day in Florida\\", Andy learns that Erin isn't coming back to Scranton, and he realizes he still loves her. He decides to go to Florida to win her back and does so during \\"Get the Girl\\", later respectively breaking up with Jessica, saying he was gay to do so, but later returning and admitting to his lie, soon after returning with Erin. However, while he is in Florida, Nellie claims the manager position at Scranton and Andy is demoted to salesman. After one of his anger outbursts (\\"Angry Andy\\") he is fired from Dunder Mifllin. In \\"Fundraiser\\", Andy sees David Wallace at the fundraiser and learns that the U.S. military bought the patent for his failed children's toy clean up device \\"Suck It\\" for 20 million dollars. In \\"Turf War\\", Andy manages to win a major client and uses it as leverage to get David Wallace to purchase Dunder Mifflin. He also calls Robert and threatens to get him fired if David buys the company. In \\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\", Andy returns to the office and pretends to be hopeless and jobless and begs Nellie for a job. Andy reveals he's faking this to the documentary crew and that David Wallace is going to buy back Dunder Mifflin, fire Nellie and Robert, and reinstate Andy as manager. While Andy is reinstated, Robert swindles his way into getting a million dollars from David and Andy hires Nellie out of guilt and sorrow. =Season 9= In \\"New Guys\\", it is revealed that Andy was sent to Outward Bound manager training by David Wallace, which caused him to revert to his cockier and meaner persona from season 3. He wants revenge on Nellie for what happened during the second half of season 8. In the episode, Andy aggressively pushes Nellie off of a slack-line that he set up in the parking lot. In \\"Andy's Ancestry\\", Nellie pranks Andy into believing that he is related to Michelle Obama, which concerns the office and makes them wonder if his family owned slaves. Andy then phones his mother asking whether this is true. He then tells the office that his family did not own slaves, but they did transport them. In \\"Work Bus\\", Andy continues to torment Nellie, especially when she needs an employer's signature to verify her employment to an adoption agency. He refuses in front of the entire office, which upsets her and Erin. Andy later finds Erin crying after this, which prompts him to sign the papers and add in a few kind words in the paper saying how good a mother Nellie could potentially be. In \\"Here Comes Treble\\" and \\"The Boat\\", Andy discovers his father has abandoned their family, leaving them nearly penniless. He consults with Oscar and Darryl to sell enough family assets for his mother to live. He resists their urging that he sell off their family boat, which Andy had always wanted to drive, but finally relents to sell it to a dealer in the Bahamas. During this, Erin attempts to cheer him up, though Andy doesn't appear receptive until she suggests they drive up to Connecticut to see off the boat themselves. Once there, Andy discovers his brother Walter Jr., disheveled and hung over, in one of the cabins. Andy decides to sail the boat to the Bahamas himself, along with Walter Jr., leaving Erin behind. Though grateful to Erin for cheering him up, he doesn't notice how hurt she is at being left behind. In \\"The Whale\\", Andy, still sailing to the Bahamas, communicates with Erin and several of his co-workers. After three days, he appears badly sunburned, dehydrated, and somewhat affected by the isolation. Their conversation is cut short when Andy's computer falls off the boat into the ocean. Andy was not seen during the subsequent eight episodes, as Ed Helms was busy filming The Hangover Part III. In \\"Dwight Christmas\\", Andy sends Erin a text message (off- screen) saying he and Walter Jr. have arrived in the Bahamas. Andy decides to stay there for several more weeks to find himself, something that upsets Erin greatly, and causes her to become closer to her friend and co-worker Pete Miller. Andy returns in \\"Couples Discount\\" in a rapidly different appearance as a result of being away from three months in the Bahamas. He surprises the staff by returning a day early and immediately alienates everyone with stupid, tone-deaf behavior: ignorantly expecting the staff to take him seriously as if he never left, voiding a major sale that Dwight had with Jan Levinson, shamelessly collecting his paychecks plus the \\"merit bonus\\" he acquired for the staff excelling their sales quota. He holds a meeting with the staff in order to catch up on what he missed, so to meet with David Wallace, who has been under the impression that Andy has been at the office the entire time via phone calls and e-mails. The staff in turn, tell him false stories that he manages to spin when meeting with David and he manages to get through the meeting without repercussions. However Erin, after feeling 3 months of neglect from Andy, plans to break up with him until he convinces him that they can fake love each other like his parents. Although Erin later decides against this, and dumps Andy for mistreating her and for being irresponsible by skipping work, a conversation heard by David Wallace on speakerphone, who asks Andy \\"What was that about three months?\\" Distraught over their breakup in \\"Moving On\\", Andy's professional relationship with Erin and the rest of the staff is bad. David Wallace chastises Andy in a closed door meeting but allows him to keep his job, thanking Andy for getting him the company, but warns him that he's on very thin ice for his antics. When he tries imposing his authority over Pam, Dwight and Angela when they leave mid-day, he finds himself subject to insults related to his three months away. Throughout the day, Andy avoids work-related matters such as client messages if they come from Erin. He confides in Clark and Pete, the latter whom is secretly dating Erin and Erin confides that keeping their relationship secret from Andy, has kept the relationship \\"hot\\". Andy is suspicious of Erin dating someone else, as he goes through her cell phone, and is later able to figure out that Pete is her new beau. Andy impulsively fires Pete, who turns to Toby, who tells Andy that he can't fire Pete over a personal grudge, even when Andy tries to crush up the relationship agreement form that Erin and Pete signed. Erin and Pete start lecturing Andy that he needs to move on, turning Andy vengeful. He decides to hire their exes such as Alice (Collette Wolfe), a marketing consultant and Gabe to the branch in a bid to make Erin and Pete uncomfortable. The ploy works to the point where arguments break out in the conference room between the parties, as Erin and Pete's past relationship issues surface. Andy smugly says to the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has made him feel better. During \\"The Farm\\", Andy along with the rest of the staff falls victim to Todd Packer's revenge prank by eating drug-laden cupcakes that Todd gave to the staff. The documentary features footage of both Andy and Kevin engaging in strange antics as a result of hallucinating from drugs. In '\\"Stairmageddon\\", as promos circulate for the documentary series about the branch, Andy comes to realize that he's disillusioned about his job. Inspired to follow his acting dreams, Andy makes a series of calls to talent agencies with no success. However, he ends up meeting real estate/talent agent Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr), who takes Andy on as a client. Andy pays her $5,000 to sign with her agency without headshots included. Andy books his first job in an industrial film about a chemical lab in \\"Paper Airplane\\", where he plays a lab employee. Throughout the shoot, Andy ends up annoying the production crew with frequent suggestions. However, Andy gets cold feet when he has to perform a stunt by pouring cold water in his eyes as to re-enact a chemical burn scenario. Carla sternly warns Andy to get his act together or he won't book any more work. With Darryl's encouragement, Andy does the stunt and at his insistence, does it twice. Carla exclaims \\"The kid can act!\\" Inspired to finally go for his dreams, Andy musters up the courage to quit his job in \\"Livin' the Dream\\". Although he was initially going to be fired by David Wallace as Andy's pursuit of his career came at the expense of his job such as auditioning during the work day for student films, buying an expensive photo printer with company money for his head shots and asking David to pay for facial cheek implants during a teleconference. However, Andy hands in his resignation before David can fire him, leaving David relieved. Although when Andy makes the announcement to the office, they all dismiss his dreams as being a giant mistake, which everyone repeatedly tells him throughout the day. Without life savings to support himself, Andy accepts Wallace's offer to stay on as a salesman under the new manager, Dwight. However, after Andy witnesses Dwight proudly proclaim himself as the new manager, he decides to quit again and pursue his dreams. Intending to burn his bridges with Dunder Mifflin, Andy takes drastic measures to get fired. After Toby refuses to enter falsified information into his record, Andy attempts to grope Toby, reveals to David that he out of spite to Dwight did lose a major client in the past and initiates an ugly argument with David Wallace. Initially irritated at his actions, David becomes enraged and fires Andy, who then defecates on his car. After packing up, Andy comes back to the office to say goodbye, by performing a moving rendition of Sarah McLachlan's song \\"I Will Remember You\\" with his acoustic guitar. Surprised by Andy's performance, everyone stands up and claps as they all embrace him and say goodbye. The staff is later convinced that Andy may just have some talent after all. Andy's journey on the show ends in a wildly uneven manner. In \\"A.A.R.M.\\", he heads off to an audition for a reality TV show called \\"America's Next Great A Capella Star\\". The line to get into the show is so heavy that Andy is told when he's next to audition that they're sending him and everyone else home. Andy bursts into the audition room, demands that the hosts give him a chance, and proceeds to burst into a terrible off-key rendition that has them telling him he's simply not good. Andy then has a full-on crying breakdown that becomes fully evident in the series finale, where he glumly notes that the viral video of him losing it became a heavily viewed YouTube clip (with Andy as \\"Baby Wawa\\") that inspired successful parodies and even mocking on \\"Saturday Night Live\\". Darryl avoids him at the Scranton airport and his former co-workers awkwardly try to avoid embarrassing him. But Andy tells the guys at Dwight's bachelor party that after he was invited to give a commencement address at Cornell University as a joke, he did so well that he got hired to work in Cornell's Admissions Office. Andy's confidence and ease around everyone increases when he stunningly realizes that most of the crowd at the documentary reunion panel are not only there to see him but are genuine fans of his portrayal on the show. After the wedding when everyone has returned to the office, they watch Andy's Cornell speech and are unanimously impressed by it; Darryl gives his old friend a hug, and Andy nearly breaks into tears as he tells the camera, \\"I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them\\".

The album has however surfaced as bootlegs, and nowadays circulates on file sharing networks. This album is one of the 20 written about in The Greatest Music Never Sold by Dan Leroy, a book that revealed information on the lost recordings of many famous musicians. The album featured a collaboration between the Ant/Marco Pirroni partnership and Bernard Edwards, longtime bass player with the disco group Chic. Edwards' Chic bandmate Tony Thompson played drums on most of the album, except for the title track plus \\"Headgear\\" and \\"Survival of the Fetish\\", which all featured drummer Dave Ruffy, who had previous worked with Pirroni under Sin√©ad O'Connor. Also featured on the album were Cameo guitarist Larry Blackmon (on the track \\"Little Devil\\") and former Adam and the Ants bassist Leigh Gorman. Despite the US Top 20 success of the single \\"Room At The Top\\" from previous MCA album Manners & Physique, the label rejected the album and, dropped Ant as the album had failed to achieve gold status in the US.Stand And Deliver, Adam Ant, Sedgewick & Jackson 2006 Following the rejection of the album by MCA, Ant together with a new band including Pirroni and Ruffy, embarked on the 1993 Persuasion Tour to attract a new label for the album, including a three night stand at Los Angeles' Henry Fonda Theatre. Although Ant was able to sign to new label Capitol Records in the US and EMI in the UK, MCA proved unwilling to let go of the Persuasion master tapes. A new album Wonderful, was recorded instead with the band from the tour. Seventeen years later, onstage at the Scala on 30 April 2010, Ant recalled the events of the non-release of the album and announced his intention to release it soon with artwork by Jamie Hewlett. A concert at the Electric Ballroom, tentatively scheduled for 12 August 2010 but which never materialised, was due to have featured songs from the album.

It was built on the site of the 218 ft (66.4 m) Transit Telescope. Construction was completed in 1964. The telescope's design was used as the basis of the Goonhilly 1 dish,Lovell, Jodrell Bank Telescopes, p. 224 and the Mark III telescope is also based on a similar design.Lovell, Jodrell Bank Telescopes, p. 12 The original dish surface of the telescope was more accurate than the Lovell Telescope's at the time it was made, meaning that it was better suited for observations at higher frequencies. As well as operating as a solo instrument, it has been used as an interferometer with the Lovell Telescope, which provides a baseline. It is commonly used as part of the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN), and for Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations.  Design and construction  The telescope was designed by Charles Husband at the instigation of Bernard Lovell, with design work starting around September 1960. Funding for the construction of the telescope was requested on the 19 December 1960,Lovell, Jodrell Bank Telescopes, p. 13 and the telescope was operational by the summer of 1964. The telescope was originally intended as a prototype for a larger, \\"Mark IV\\" telescope, which was never constructed. As a result, an elliptical dish was used, with a major axis of 125 ft (38.1 m) and a minor axis of 83 ft 4 in (25.4 m). The focal length is 40 ft (12.2 m). Although an elliptical dish is not the optimal surface shape for astronomical observations, it would have been necessary on a much larger telescope to reduce the telescope's height above the ground. The base of the telescope is made of prestressed concrete. The telescope has an alt-azimuth mount sitting on 54 steel rollers in a 42 ft (12.8 m) diameter roller track on top of a foundation block.Lovell (1964) It was the first telescope in the world to be steered by a digital computer. This computer, the Ferranti Argus 104, had 12 kilobytes of memory; it was upgraded to an Argus 400 in 1971, with the 104 being put to use controlling the upgraded Lovell Telescope. A proposal to upgrade the Mark II to a Mark IIA was put forward in 1974. The upgrade would have been to a 100 ft circular aperture which could have been used on wavelengths down to 6mm, which would have enabled it to be used as part of the high-frequency component of the original MERLIN array. It was also planned that the telescope would be used for spectral line work at millimeter wavelengths. However, the upgrade was never approved.Lovell, Jodrell Bank Telescopes, pp. 192-195 The original surface had an accuracy of ¬±1/8 inch, which meant that the telescope could observe at higher frequencies than the Lovell Telescope. The surface was upgraded in 1987 to one with an accuracy of 1/3 mm, which was accurately set using a holographic technique, meaning that the telescope can observe at the 22 GHz MERLIN frequency. The new surface is circular and was laid on top of the old, such that the telescope now has ear- like extensions where the old surface still shows. In the late 1990s, a new, more compact carousel for the receivers was installed at the prime focus of the telescope.  Scientific use  During the 1970s, the telescope was used in conjunction with the Mark III to develop phase stable long baseline interferometers, leading to the development of MERLIN. The telescope was used as an interferometer with the Lovell Telescope to provide more accurate positions for radio sources found from a survey done in 1972 and 1973; the position of one radio source was found to coincide with a pair of faint blue stars, and after optical observations were made it was found to be the first gravitational lens. The majority of the current observational time of the Mark II is spent either on MERLIN or VLBI observations. Appraisal On 10 July 2017 the telescope was designated as a Grade I listed building. Grade I is the highest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to buildings that are of \\"exceptional interest\\".

He was twice governor of Cartagena de Indias, after which he was promoted to viceroy of New Granada. Background He was a brigadier in the royal army and a knight of the Order of Carlos III. In 1779 he was promoted to field marshal. He was governor of the province of Cartagena two times. The first time was from May 12, 1774 to September 14, 1780, and the second time was from May 1, 1781 to April 21, 1782. During his government, Lieutenant Antonio de Latorre founded 43 pueblos, in which 41,000 persons were settled. One of these was Monter√≠a. As viceroy of New Granada He took possession of his new office on April 1, 1782, still in Cartagena. Before leaving that city, he announced a generous amnesty for those charged in the Revolt of the Comuneros. On April 21 he left Cartagena to take up his new position in Santaf√© de Bogot√°, the capital of the viceroyalty. He was already old and infirm, although he had recently married a 17-year-old Cartagena native, Mar√≠a de Salas. His predecessor, Manuel Antonio Fl√≥rez, a popular viceroy who had served more than 11 years in the office, had apparently been forced to resign by Jos√© de G√°lvez, Minister of the Indies in Spain, and Antonio Caballero y G√≥ngora, Archbishop of Bogot√°. Torrezal D√≠az was received along the way at Honda by Archbishop Caballero y G√≥ngora. A great banquet was held in his honor. It was said that the archbishop, who was present at the banquet, did not eat. Torrezal D√≠az did, however. He arrived at the capital one week later (June 7). He was very sick and died in agony four days after his arrival. Some believed that he had been poisoned by the archbishop. The official report of his death said he died of infection.

It is used on the international plane in the same way that \\"His Majesty\\" or \\"Her Majesty\\" is used to refer to the king or queen domestically, the addition of \\"Britannic\\" serving to identify the state (United Kingdom) in question. It is particularly used in treaties and other formal instruments sent and received between nations. Many other monarchies in Europe used similar conventional terms as treaty titles to identify their respective monarchs. Initially, His/Her Britannic Majesty referred to monarch of the Kingdom of Great Britain. After the Acts of Union 1800, it referred to the monarch of the United Kingdom. With the expansion of the British Empire, the term came to refer to the British monarch as the sovereign of the entire British Empire. With changes in the constitutional relations between different Commonwealth realms, today it is only appropriate to use the term to refer to the Crown in right of the United Kingdom and not, for example, the Crown in right of Australia, Canada or New Zealand. It is not, however, invoked in agreements signed between the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, because the monarch cannot contract with herself. Unlike treaties with other countries, agreements amongst Commonwealth realms are concluded between the respective governments, not the respective sovereigns. Examples include: *The Convention for the Mutual Abandonment of Nootka of 1794 between Spain and Great Britain referred to the Spanish monarch as His Catholic Majesty and the British monarch as His Britannic Majesty. *The Treaty of Chaumont of 1814 between Austria and the United Kingdom referred to the Austrian monarch as His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty and the British monarch as His Britannic Majesty. *In the Mandate for Palestine of the League of Nations, that instrument designated His Britannic Majesty as the Mandatory for Palestine. *British passports bear a request which invokes Her Britannic Majesty: > Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State Requests and requires in the Name > of Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass > freely without let or hindrance, and to afford the bearer such assistance > and protection as may be necessary.

His poetry exemplifies rejection of bourgeois values and fascination with the Orient, particularly with China. He spent most of his life in Berlin, but also travelled widely across Europe, Africa, and the Far East. In 1930, he travelled to Palestine, and published his impressions in a series of articles. Shortly before the Nazi take-over, Ehrenstein moved to Switzerland, and in 1941 to New York City, where he died. Early life Ehrenstein was born to Jewish-Hungarian parents in Ottakring, Vienna. His father was a cashier at a brewery and the family was poor. His younger brother was the poet Carl Ehrenstein (1892-1971). His mother was able to enroll him in high school, where he was harassed with anti-semitic bullying. From 1905 to 1910 he studied history and philosophy in Vienna and graduated in 1910 with a doctorate (with a thesis on Hungary in 1790). He had already decided on a career of literature, which he described as: \\"Hardly university studies; but by five years of alleged studies, I secured liberty: Time to do poetic work. Through tolerant overhearing directed to me by mail and offended about to light I put on even a doctorate.\\" Poetry and writing In 1910 he wrote the poem \\"Wanderers song\\" published by Karl Kraus in the Overnight Torch. The poem is attributed to the early expressionism and was published in 1911 with illustrations by his friend Oskar Kokoschka. Through Kokoschka he came into contact with Herwarth Walden and got it published in Der Sturm, and later in Franz Pfemfert's magazine Die Aktion. Ehrenstein quickly became one of the most important voices of expressionism and came into close contact with Else Lasker-Sch√ºler, Gottfried Benn and Franz Werfel. It was widely circulated Anton Kuh Spottvers wrote about it: \\"its a high honor of a work, only its verses disturb you.\\"Neuauflage der 12 s/w Bilder in Armin Wallas: A. E.: Mythenzerst√∂rer und Mythensch√∂pfer, Boer, Grafrath 1994, mit ausf√ºhrl. Interpretation Wallas' At the beginning of the First World War, Ehrenstein, who was deemed not fit for military service, was ordered to work in the Vienna War Archives. While many other artists were initially carried away by enthusiasm for the war, Ehrenstein from the beginning was a staunch opponent of the war, which he articulated clearly in a series of articles and poems (The man screams). During the war he came in contact with Walter Hasenclever and Martin Buber. From 1916-17 he belonged to the circle of the first Dadaist magazine The New Youth, in which he published work alongside Franz Jung, George Grosz and Johannes R. Becher. The magazine took a clearly anti-Wilhelm position and was quickly banned. Becher and Ehrenstein worked at the same time as editors in publishing Kurt Wolff. After 1918 he supported the revolution in Germany and signed, along with several others including Franz Pfemfert and Zuckmayer, the manifesto of the Antinational Socialist Party.Johannes R. Becher: Tagebuchnotiz vom 2. Mai 1950. In: Adolf Endler, Tarzan am Prenzlauer Berg. Sudelbl√§tter 1981‚Äì1993. Leipzig: Leipzig, 1994. S. 178 f. During the war Ehrenstein met the actress Elisabeth Bergner and helped with her career breakthrough. He fell hopelessly in love with her and dedicated many of his poems to her. In the 1920s he traveled with Kokoschka through Europe, Africa, the Middle East and China, where he remained for a time. He turned to Chinese literature and wrote numerous adaptations from Chinese works and the quite successful novel Murderer from Justice (1931). By the end of 1932 Ehrenstein went to Switzerland to Brissago. Fugitive on the run Along with many other authors he was placed on a black list by the Nazi party. In the book burning of 10 May 1933 his books were thrown on the pyre. In the next few years, he published in exile in several journals of literature. In 1934 he travelled to the Soviet Union, and in 1935 went to Paris to attend the \\"Congress for the Defense of Culture\\". In Switzerland he was threatened as a foreigner with deportation to Germany. Hermann Hesse tried to help him to get permanent asylum for Ehrenstein but only managed to get him temporary Residence Papers. He prevented extradition by getting Czechoslovak citizenship. He went to England to his brother Carl, then to France, until he was finally able to leave the country for Spain and then to the United States in 1941. Later life and death In New York he met with other exiles, including Thomas Mann, Richard Huelsenbeck, and George Grosz, and was granted a residence permit. Ehrenstein learned English, but found no work and lived on the income of articles he wrote for the newspaper, and by loans from George Grosz. In 1949, he returned to Switzerland, then returned to Germany, but was never published and finally returned, disappointed, to New York. After two years he was placed in a pauper's hospice on Welfare, where he died on 8 April 1950. After his death, friends gathered money so his urn could be shipped to England, where his brother Carl was still living. An honorary urn was finally buried in the Bromley Hill Cemetery in London. Legacy Ehrenstein's legacy was documented years later at the National Library of Israel, where he was also later re-interred. In his life he influenced many 20th century authors and had personal relationships with many.W√ºrdigung Albert Ehrensteins zu seinem 125.

In 1994 the reborn Hinckley Triumph became one of the first production motorcycles to embrace the new streetfighter style, which was essentially a modern sport bike or race replica motorcycle but without the aerodynamic plastic fairing. The style began when bikers who, having crashed their race replicas, put the bikes back on the road sans fairing, mainly for reasons of economy. Origins =Early bikes= The new bike was first released to the public in 1994, and in a nod to the 1938 Speed Twin, was dubbed the \\"Speed Triple\\". The original Speed Twin was powered by a 498 cc vertical twin cylinder engine, and was considered a high performance machine in its day. The new Speed Triple was based on the new Triumph Triple series of modular engines, which also powered the standard Trident, Daytona sport bike, and the Thunderbird retro bike. This engine came in two displacements as a triple: 750 cc for some European markets, and 885 cc for all other markets. The Speed Triple originally was equipped only with the 885 cc engine, but just before significant changes to the bike were made in 1997 a very few 750 machines were produced using leftover Euro specification engines. Early Speed Triples were all carbureted, and were designated T300 series bikes (technically, T309). 1994/1995 models came with the standard 885 cc water- cooled engine and a rugged five-speed transmission. Subsequent Speed Triples all had the same engine with six speed transmissions, except for the brief run of 750 cc bikes. As with all the modular Triumphs, the T309 series Speed Triple had a very large single steel tube backbone frame, and used the engine as a stressed member. Forks were 43mm multi-adjustable Kayaba units and the same Japanese firm's shock could be set for preload and rebound damping. Kayaba (now known as KYB) had had a special relationship with Hinckley Triumph from its earliest days. At the rear was a single monoshock with a progressive linkage, and at the front were standard hydraulic forks fitted with dual disk brakes. =Racing= In 1994 Triumph Motorcycles sponsored a racing series with the intention of spotlighting its new image. Dubbed \\"The Speed Triple Challenge\\", it was similar to IROC in that all the competitors rode identical Speed Triple motorcycles. This made up for the fact that in factory trim the Speed Triple wasn't a competitive machine in normal racing circles. On the other hand, a few privateers had some success on highly modified bikes based on the Triumph Triple engine, often using Spondon chassis. Some modified Speed Triples also were observed racing in B.E.A.R.S. (British European American Racing Series, now part of AHMRA). =Legacy= The final T309 Speed Triple was built in 1996. The newly introduced T595 Daytona was supplied with fuel injection, and the 955 cc engine. The 1997 T509 received the frame, brakes and design of the new Daytona 595, but came with an 885 cc injected engine for '97 and '98. The remainder of the range including the Tbird, Legend, the Adventurer, the Thunderbird Sport, the Tiger, the Sprint and Sprint Sport and the 900 trophy retained the carbureted 885 cc engine. Generations =T509= Following the end of the T309 run of Speed Triples, Triumph released the first of its new generation of fuel injected sportbikes, the T509 Speed Triple. The new bike was a total redesign. While the all new engine still displaced 885 cc, it now produced a claimed and was fitted with an engine management system by SAGEM, a French company that built systems for automobiles. The T509 had new aluminium perimeter chassis, a single-sided swingarm very similar to those found on Honda's VFR, and upgraded suspension components. The bike featured a Showa 3 way adjustable rear shock, and 45mm 3 way adjustable Showa forks similar to those on the CBR900RR. Nissin 4 pot calipers were standard up front, and a single piston rear. The restyling by designers John Mockett and Rod Scivyer saw the introduction of the twin \\"bug eye\\" headlamps which are a Triumph trademark to this day. When introduced in 1997 the T509 had a polished frame. It also had low mount clip-ons. To improve rider comfort and low speed handling, a regular handlebar was fitted from 1998. When the 1997 T509 Speed Triple received the 885 cc fuel injected engine, the Daytona received an upgraded 955 cc engine producing at the crank. For 1999 the new Speed Triple was officially upgraded to 955cc status, also receiving the bigger engine. The engine was very similar to the unit found in the Sprint ST. It did not feature Nikasil lined cylinders, the pistons and rods were a different part number, and it was fitted with different camshafts than the Daytona. Claimed power for the 99 was up to 110 hp. It did not make as much power as its fully faired contemporary, but it did have a substantially broader torque curve than its T509 predecessor. Cosmetically, the T509 and the 1999 Speed Triples were nearly identical, and they shared many of the same components including the dual headlamps and single sided swing arm. Minor differences include the removal of the \\"T509\\" decal on the rear quarter panel and the addition of a header cross-over pipe. Small fairings referred to as \\"Bikini Fairings\\" were popular on these bikes, as well as other aftermarket accessories that wouldn't normally be of use to a fully faired sport bike. =955i= Triumph 955 Speed Triple For the years 2000 and 2001 the Speed Triple changed little other than cosmetically. The engine control unit was updated to the Sagem MC2000. The 97-99 bikes had a ground block known to fail, and so the 2000 and 2001 bikes received an improved wiring harness. Both the Speed Triple and the Daytona came to be referred to as 955i bikes (the Daytona adopting the 955i designation in 1999), which ended some confusion from the earlier T500 series designations. Other notable differences were silver wheels instead of black wheels, and the Speed Triple logo on the rear quarter panel was in print rather than cursive. In 2002, Gareth Davies redesigned the plastics. The was reduced by a change to the engine casings of the 955i engine that decreased weight by roughly 17 pounds. The power was slightly increased thanks to a new cylinder head design. The MC2000 control unit remained, but was adapted for an O2 sensor. In late 2004, a small number of Special Edition Speed Triples (Speed Triple SE) were produced, with only cosmetic differences. For all years of 1997-2004, the Nissin brakes could be problematic. Though initially praised as one of the best stopping bikes, over time many owners complain of brake sponginess. The caliper pistons were not adequately coated, and caused dirt, debris, and corrosion. The pistons would catch on the caliper seals and be pulled back into the caliper bore. This caused an excess amount of piston travel required to apply braking force giving a spongy feel. Daytona 675 calipers with a teflon coating may be used to fix this. Fitting a larger master cylinder can also overcome the excess travel. =1050 and beyond= 2009 Triumph Speed Triple 1050 2011 Triumph Speed Triple 1050 In 2005, Triumph released its fourth generation Speed Triple. While this was not a redesign of the scale of the T509, there were many changes to the bike. The engine was still the venerable and reliable fuel-injected engine used since 1997, but it had been increased in capacity to 1,050 cc. This was accomplished by lengthening the stroke. Also fitted was an all new fuel injection and engine management system made by the Japanese company Keihin. Other engine modifications resulted in a claimed and a broader, flatter torque curve. The design of this new Speed Triple was by the Italian Frascoli Rodolfo. Other improvements included inverted forks, radial disc brake calipers and a redesigned electronic gauge cluster which included a trip computer. Handling was once again improved. Late in 2007, a few changes appeared in the Speed Triple, consisting of an updated engine management system and a revised exhaust containing a catalytic converter in a different location. The revised Electronic Control Unit (ECU) had more memory and provided a solution for some starting and low speed fueling issues. A revised metal tank also replaced the plastic unit that had been fitted. For the 2008 model year several changes were made to the bodywork and Italian made Brembo front brakes were supplied as standard. The new Speed Triple shared its engine with the new Sprint ST and later the 2007 Triumph Tiger 1050, but 2006 was to be the last year of the 955i Daytona. In its place was a new bike, the Daytona 675 . The new Daytona 675 had an all new smaller displacement engine and a completely new modern chassis. It garnered excellent reviews. In November 2007 the same platform was used for the new \\"Street Triple,\\" which has received excellent reviews such as TWO magazine's choice as Bike of the Year. The two bikes share many of the same styling cues as well as the three cylinder engine configuration and fuel injection. Performance numbers are not too dissimilar, with the Street Triple only falling short in the shape and height of its torque curve. Triumph celebrated the 15th Anniversary of the Speed Triple in 2010 with a limited edition model that features black paint with red trim and a number of optional accessories that were added as standard equipment. The bike also is the first production Triumph to feature the signature of company owner John Bloor, who rescued Triumph from bankruptcy in 1983. According to Triumph, more than 35,000 Speed Triples have been sold since the model was introduced in 1993. =2011 model= In October 2010, Motor Cycle News published details and a test-ride of a new Speed Triple for 2011. The engine is a tweaked 1050 motor, now yielding and of torque. The frame is a new alloy tubular design, and the trademark \\"bug-eyed\\" headlamps have been reshaped. Kerb weight is . With a slightly lower seat and less bulk than before, the agile new bike is said to feel \\"faster, classier, more refined, more comfortable, more modern and ... far easier to use\\" ((MCN)). =2016 model= For 2016, Triumph updated several aspects of the bike, including 104 changes to the engine. Ride-by-wire has been added for the first time with 5 ride modes with traction control and ABS that can be turned on or off. The new engine is narrower as well as the smaller more efficient radiator are just some of the new updates. The new Speed Triple has a wet weight of and a claimed dry weight of . Power for the new Speed Triple is a claimed @ 9,500 rpm and @ 7,850 rpm. = Expected 2021 model = Spy photos of the new generation showed up on the WWW on 07 July 2020. The new Speed Triple is likely to land in 2021, with a possible winter 2020 press launch, it also gets the new angry-eyed facelift and a heavily revised and likely to be 1160cc engine.

Constructed in 1966, it was remotely controlled from Jodrell Bank Observatory, and was mainly used as part of the MERLIN radio telescope network. It was designed by Charles Husband at the instigation of Bernard Lovell.Lovell, Jodrell Bank Telescopes, p. 12  Technical specifications  Funding for the telescope was obtained in 1963 from the DSIR. The telescope was designed by Husband and Co. consulting engineers, and was constructed by Fairey Engineering. It started observations in July 1967. The telescope could be controlled either locally, or by remote control over UHF and microwave links from Jodrell Bank Observatory (normally the latter).Palmer and Rowson (1968) Similar to the Mark II, it had an elliptical dish with a major axis of 125 ft/38.1m and a minor axis of 83 ft 4 in/25.4m. Unlike the Mark II, however, the dish is constructed of a wire mesh, with the wires apart set to an accuracy of . When pointed to the horizon, the telescope was 81% efficient at wavelengths of 21 cm (the hydrogen line), dropping to 45% at 11 cm. When the bowl was pointed to the horizon, the structure deformed slightly under gravity, meaning that the telescope becomes 14% efficient at 11 cm. The focus cabin was an ~8 foot cube, also similar to the Mark II, supported by four steel girders. It could be accessed via a ladder up one of the girders, which could be climbed when the bowl of the telescope was directed towards the horizon. The telescope was steered in azimuth and elevation by hydraulic drive systems. Two of the six bogies on which the telescope sat were driven, and motion in elevation was done using two long hydraulic pistons. Both were driven by a 5 horse power electric motor, at up to 5 degrees per minute. The drive system was protected using over-pressure alarms, cut-outs and relief valves, as well as two alarms (one at the telescope, one at Jodrell). The main aim for the telescope when constructed was to use it in conjunction with the Lovell Telescope as a fully steerable interferometer to determine the sizes of radio sources. It was not known what size the radio sources would be, and so the optimal telescope separation was not known (the separation is inversely proportional to the resolution of the interferometer). As a result, the telescope was built such that it could be completely disassembled and reassembled on a new site within 6 months. The baseline between the telescope and the Lovell Telescope was 24 km, giving a resolution ranging between 0.2 and 17 arcseconds depending on the frequency that was being observed at. In 1996, it was decommissioned due to its age and lack of sensitivity compared with modern telescopes. It was subsequently dismantled and sold for scrap.

It was his first major literary success, with immediate material rewards, prompting Mostowicz to write and publish roughly two books per year (in total, he wrote 17 novels). The book, very popular already in the interwar period, was made into a 1956 Polish film with Adolf Dymsza in the title role, then into a 1980 television miniseries starring Roman Wilhelmi, and into a 2002 comedy film starring Cezary Pazura. Plot Hotel Europejski, Warsaw, where protagonist's career begins Nicodemus Dyzma is a small-town man who comes to the Polish capital from the Eastern provinces (known as \\"Kresy\\") in search of work. While walking the streets of Warsaw, he finds a lost invitation to a party reception. Hoping for a free meal, he decides to use it because he owns a tuxedo. At the reception, he befriends a member of parliament and wins the hearts of guests with his attitude. He is introduced to a wealthy landowner by the name of Kunicki, a former con artist, who is so impressed by Dyzma that he offers him a job as superintendent of his country estate. At the estate, Dyzma meets Kunicki's wife, Nina, who quickly falls in love with him, but earns the distaste of Kunicki's daughter, Kasia, a lesbian who had been carrying on an affair with Nina. Soon Dyzma takes control of all affairs of the estate and starts to climb the social and political ladder. He is offered a series of prestigious appointments; however, he is forced to hide his past from the prying eyes of his adversaries and the general public. His lack of knowledge about things that are expected of him are taken either as his humour or eccentricities, or by his underlings as attempts to test them. Dyzma's rise in status is not good for his morals, as eventually he commissions the murder of his former boss from the provinces who might have revealed the truth of Dyzma's background. Ultimately he marries Nina and decides to refuse a commendation to become prime minister for fear that his pretenses will be revealed. Background Do≈Çƒôga-Mostowicz was a journalist critical of Sanation and J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. He was abducted by a group of soldiers in civilian clothes, beaten up, and dumped outside Warsaw. He wrote the novel as a critique of the political class then in power. Legacy Nicodemus Dyzma has become proverbial in Poland as an archetype of the crude opportunist who makes his upwardly-mobile way by dint of fortuitous connections, ruthlessness and the acquiescence of an oblivious society. He is forced by the spirit of his times and the society around him to become something they need him to become. Ignorant and malleable, Dyzma turns into a puppet in the hands of the elite class. Whatever happens to him during his climb of the social ladder falls outside of his mental, financial and legal competence. Janusz Korwin- Mikke compared the eponymous Nikodem Dyzma favourably to the former President of Poland Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa. In his opinion, there were three major differences between their characters: that Dyzma eventually declined becoming prime mininister while Wa≈Çƒôsa did go on to become president; that despite circumstances helping him, it was Dyzma who tricked others, whereas Wa≈Çƒôsa had had everything arranged for him by the security services, an exaggeration on the topic of allegations of Wa≈Çƒôsa's collaboration with the SB; third, that Dyzma could play the balalaika and Wa≈Çƒôsa could not. This was incorrect, as in fact Dyzma played the mandolin. The title of the novel lent itself to the title of a song by Jacek Kaczmarski, from the POV of Dyzma's eventual brother- in-law, ≈ªor≈º Ponimirski, who eventually reveals the truth about Dyzma's past but is not believed. Controversy An American novel, Being There (1970), by fellow Polish native Jerzy Kosi≈Ñski, has been said to bear a strong resemblance to the exploits of Nicodemus Dyzma. In June 1982, a Village Voice article by Geoffrey Stokes and Eliot Fremont-Smith accused Kosi≈Ñski of plagiarizing Do≈Çƒôga-Mostowicz, whose best-selling novel was largely unknown to English-readers at the time of Kosi≈Ñski's 1970 publication.James Park Sloan.

Education has been seen as a key to economic mobility, and this advertisement appealed to Americans' belief in the possibility of self- betterment, as well as threatening the consequences of downward mobility in the great income inequality existing during the Industrial Revolution. Economic mobility is the ability of an individual, family or some other group to improve (or lower) their economic status‚Äîusually measured in income. Economic mobility is often measured by movement between income quintiles. Economic mobility may be considered a type of social mobility, which is often measured in change in income. Types of mobility There are many different ideas in the literature as to what constitutes a good mathematical measure of mobility, each with their own advantages and drawbacks. Mobility may be between generations (\\"inter-generational\\") or within a person's or group's lifetime (\\"intra-generational\\"). It may be \\"absolute\\" or \\"relative\\". Inter- generational mobility compares a person's (or group's) income to that of her/his/their parents. Intra-generational mobility, in contrast, refers to movement up or down over the course of a working career. Absolute mobility involves widespread economic growth and answers the question ‚ÄúTo what extent do families improve their incomes over a generation?‚Äù Relative mobility is specific to individuals or groups and occurs without relation to the economy as a whole. It answers the question, \\"how closely are the economic fortunes of children tied to that of their parents?\\" Relative mobility is a zero-sum game, absolute is not. * Exchange mobility is the mobility that results from a \\"reshuffling\\" of incomes among the economic agents, with no change in the income amounts. For example, in the case of two agents, a change in income distribution might be {1,2}->{2,1}. This is a case of pure exchange mobility, since they have simply exchanged incomes. More generally, for a set of incomes xi, any permutation of the xi will yield a pure exchange mobility. Measures of inequality (e.g. the Gini coefficient) will not change under pure exchange mobility. * Structural mobility is mobility that results from a change in the income distribution function without regard to the identity of the agents. For two agents, a change in income distribution might be {1,3}->{2,2}. This case may involve some exchange mobility, depending on one's definition, but there is certainly some structural mobility since it does not involve a simple reshuffling of incomes. * Growth mobility is mobility that results from an increase in total income. For two agents, a change in income distribution might be {1,2}->{2,4} or perhaps {1,2}->{3,5}. Growth mobility is certainly positive in these cases, since the sum of the incomes increases. United States =Intergenerational mobility= According to the 2007 \\"American Dream Report\\" study, \\"by some measurements\\"‚Äîrelative mobility between generations‚Äî\\"we are actually a less mobile society than many other nations, including Canada, France, Germany and most Scandinavian countries. This challenges the notion of America as the land of opportunity.\\" Other research places the U.S. among the least economically mobile countries.Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Revised Estimates of Intergenerational Income Mobility in the United States, November 2003 Another 2007 study (\\"Economic Mobility Project: Across Generations\\") found significant upward \\"absolute\\" mobility from the late 1960s to 2007, with two-thirds of those who were children in 1968 reporting more household income than their parents (although most of this growth in total family income can be attributed to the increasing number of women who work since male earnings have stayed relatively stable throughout this time). However, in terms of relative mobility it stated: \\"contrary to American beliefs about equality of opportunity, a child's economic position is heavily influenced by that of his or her parents.\\" 42% of children born to parents in the bottom fifth of the income distribution (\\"quintile\\") remain in the bottom, while 39% born to parents in the top fifth remain at the top. Only half of the generation studied exceeded their parents economic standing by moving up one or more quintiles. Moving between quintiles is more frequent in the middle quintiles (2‚Äì4) than in the lowest and highest quintiles. Of those in one of the quintiles 2‚Äì4 in 1996, approximately 35% stayed in the same quintile; and approximately 22% went up one quintile or down one quintile (moves of more than one quintile are rarer). 39% of those who were born into the top quintile as children in 1968 are likely to stay there, and 23% end up in the fourth quintile. Children previously from lower-income families had only a 1% chance of having an income that ranks in the top 5%. On the other hand, the children of wealthy families have a 22% chance of reaching the top 5%. =Intragenerational mobility= According to a 2007 study by the US Treasury Department, Americans concerned over the recent growth in inequality (after-tax income of the top 1% earners has grown by 176% percent from 1979 to 2007 while it grew only 9% for the lowest 20%) can be reassured by the healthy income mobility in America: \\"There was considerable income mobility of individuals [within a single generation] in the U.S. economy during the 1996 through 2005 period as over half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile over this period\\". Other studies were less impressed with the rate of individual mobility in the United States. A 2007 inequality and mobility study (by Kopczuk, Saez and Song) and 2011 CBO study on \\"Trends in the Distribution of Household Income, found the pattern of annual and long-term earnings inequality \\"very close\\",Uncovering the American Dream: Inequality and Mobility in Social Security Earnings Data since 1937 Wojciech Kopczuk, Emmanuel Saez, Jae Song, 15 September 2007, Figure 4B or \\"only modestly\\" different.Congressional Budget Office: Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007. October 2011. Another source described it as the mobility of \\"the guy who works in the college bookstore and has a real job by his early thirties,\\" rather than poor people rising to middle class or middle income rising to wealth.Krugman, Paul. \\"The Rich, the Right, and the Facts: Deconstructing the Income Distribution Debate\\"prospect.org, 19 December 2001 =Relative vs. absolute= There are two different ways to measure economic mobility: absolute and relative. Absolute mobility measures how likely a person is to exceed their parents' family income at the same age. Research by the Pew Economic Mobility Project shows that the majority of Americans, 84 percent, exceed their parents' income. However, the size of absolute income gains is not always enough to move them to the next rung of the economic ladder. A focus on how Americans' rank on the income ladder compares to their parents, their peers, or even themselves over time is a measure of relative mobility. The Pew Economic Mobility Project's research shows that forty percent of children in the lowest income quintile remain there as adults, and 70 percent remain below the middle quintile, meaning 30% moved up two quintiles or more in one generation. Worldwide 400px In recent years several large studies have found that vertical inter-generational mobility is lower in the United States than in most developed countries.Harder for Americans to Rise From Lower Rungs  By JASON DePARLE  4 January 2012 ] A 1996 paper by Daniel P. McMurrer, Isabel V. Sawhill found \\"mobility rates seem to be quite similar across countries.\\"Economic Mobility in the United States Urban Institute 1 October 1996 Daniel P. McMurrer, Isabel V. Sawhill However a more recent paper (2007) found a person's parents is a great deal more predictive of their own income in the United States than other countries. The United States had about 1/3 the ratio of mobility of Denmark and less than half that of Canada, Finland and Norway. France, Germany, Sweden, also had higher mobility, with only the United Kingdom being less mobile. Economic mobility in developing nations (such as those in Africa) is thought to be limited by both historical and global economic factors. Economic mobility is everywhere correlated with income and wealth inequality.Jonathan Chait, ‚ÄúNo Such Thing as Equal Opportunity,‚Äù New York, 7 November 2011, pp. 14‚Äì 16.Stiglitz, Joseph E. (4 June 2012). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (p. 17). Norton. Kindle Edition. Men and women Women in their 30s have substantially higher incomes today than their counterparts did in their parents' generation. Between 1974 and 2004, average income for women in their 30s has increased almost fourfold. This is a stark contrast to the growth in income of their male counterparts. The average income of men in their 30s has increased from 31,000 in 1964 to 35,000 in 2004, an increase of only 4,000. However, much of this can be attributed to employment rates. The employment rate of women in their 30s has increased from 39% in 1964 to 70% in 2004; whereas, the rate of employment for men in this same age group has decreased from 91% in 1964 to 86% in 2004. This sharp increase in income for working women, in addition to stable male salaries, is the reason upward economic mobility is attributed to women. See: De- industrialization crisis Black and white families Average income for both White and Black families has increased since the 1970s. However, average income for White families in their 30s has increased from $50,000 to $60,000 from 1975 to 2005, compared to an increase from $32,000 to $35,000 for Black families of the same age over the same period. So in addition to receiving a lower average income, its growth is also less for Black families (10% growth) than their White counterparts (19% growth). One way this can be explained is that even though marriage rates have declined for both races, Blacks are 25% less likely to be in a married couple. However, Blacks also have less economic mobility and are less likely to surpass their parents' income or economic standing than Whites. Two of three White children born into families in the middle quintile have achieved a higher family income than their parents. Conversely, only one of three Black children born into families in the middle quintile has achieved a higher family income than their parents. On average, Black children whose parents were in the bottom or second quintile do exceed their parents' income, but those whose parents were in the middle or fourth quintile actually have a lower income than their parents. This is a very large difference compared to Whites, who experience intergenerational income growth in every quintile except the highest. This shows that in addition to lower wages with less growth over time, it is less likely for Black families to experience upward economic mobility than it is for Whites. Education It is a widespread belief that there is a strong correlation between obtaining an education and increasing one's economic mobility. In the United States, the education system has always been considered the most effective and equal process for all individuals to improve one's economic standing.McMurrer, D. Sawhill, I. Getting Ahead: Economic and Social Mobility in America. The Urban Institute Press. Washington, D.C. 1998. Despite the increasing availability to education for all, family background continues to play a huge role in determining economic success. To individuals who do not have or cannot obtain an education, the greater overall levels of education can act as a barrier, increasing their chance of being left behind at the bottom of the economic or income ladder. In this regard, education policy that allocates high ability students from lower social economic background to quality schools can have a large impact on economic mobility. Studies have shown that education and family background has a great effect on economic mobility across generations. Family background or one's socioeconomic status affects the likelihood that students will graduate from high school or college, what type of college or institution they will attend, and how likely they are to graduate and complete a degree. According to studies, when split into income quintiles including the bottom, second, middle, fourth and top, adult children without a college degree and with parents in the bottom quintile remained in the bottom quintile. But if the adult children did have a college degree, there was only a 16% chance that they would remain at the bottom of the quintile. Therefore, it was proven that education provided an increase in economic status and mobility for poorer families. Not only does obtaining a college degree make it much more likely for individuals to make it to the top two quintiles, education helps those who were born in the top quintiles to remain in the top quintiles. Therefore, hard work and increasing education from those who are born into the lower quintiles can boost economic status and help them move ahead, but children born into wealthier families do seem to have the advantage. Even when the likelihood of attending college is ignored, studies have shown that out of all the students that enroll in college, socioeconomic status or family background still has an effect on graduation rates with 53% of those from the top quintile receiving bachelor's degrees along with 39% from the middle and 22% from the bottom quintile. According to the 2002 US Census, students can expect to earn on average about $2.1 million with a bachelor's degree over the course of their working career. That is almost $1 million more than what individual's without a college degree can expect to earn.Waldron, K. Access to College Means Access to Economic Mobility for America's Underserved. Diverse Issues in Higher Education V. 24. No. 2. 8 March 2007. p. 33. Considering that inflation rates have not kept up with increasing tuition rates, disadvantaged families have a much harder time affording college. Especially considering the increased competition for college admittances at public schools, students from lower economic quintiles are at an even greater disadvantage. Tuition rates over the past ten years has risen 47% at public universities and 42% at private universities. While having to take out more loans and work jobs while taking classes, students from lower income quintiles are considering college to be ‚Äúa test of their endurance rather than their intelligence‚Äù. By obtaining an education, individuals with low economic status can increase the income potential and therefore earn more than their parents and possibly surpass those in the upper income quintiles. Overall, each additional level of education an individual achieves whether it be a high school, college, graduate, or professional degree can add greatly to income levels. On the other hand, there are reports that disagree with the idea that individuals can work hard, obtain an education and succeed because there is the notion that America is actually getting poorer and actually more likely to stay poor as compared to any other western country. Some claim that the idea of the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù is starting to fade since the middle-class family income has remained constant since 1973. But upward mobility clearly still exists. One study claims that economic mobility is 3 times stronger in Denmark, 2.5 times higher in Canada, and 1.5 times higher in Germany as compared to the United States. Immigration According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of legal immigrants has been rising steadily since the 1960s. The number has increased from about 320,000 to almost a million per year. About 500,000 illegal immigrants also remain in the United States each year. People immigrate to the United States in hopes of greater economic opportunities and most first generation immigrants experience a boost in their income from the American economy. But since most do not have an education, their wages quickly begin to fall relative to non-immigrants. According to studies, there is a great upward jump in economic mobility from the first to the second immigrant generation because of education. These second generation immigrants exceed the income levels of the first generation immigrants as well as some non-immigrants. Through intergenerational mobility research, the mobility of immigrants and their children from different nations can be measured. Considering relative wages from male workers from certain nations in 1970 to second generation male workers in 2000, conclusions can be drawn about economic mobility. In 1970, if immigrants had come from an industrialized nation, then their average wages tended to be more than the average wages of non-immigrant workers during that time. In 2000, the second generation workers had experienced a downfall in relative mobility because their average wages were much closer to the average wages of a non-immigrant worker. In 1970, for the immigrant workers migrating from less industrialized countries, their average wages were less than the average wages of non-immigrant workers. In 2000, the second generation workers from less industrialized nations have experienced an increase in relative mobility because their average wages have moved closer to those of non-immigrants. By computing the intergenerational correlation between relative wages of first and second generation workers from the same country a conclusion was made regarding whether or not first generation immigrants influence the wages of the second generation immigrants. This computation was also reported for native-born first and second generation American families. The study found that both immigrants and natives pass along almost exactly the same level of economic advantages or disadvantages to their offspring. These conclusions predict diminishing correlations in wages from the first and second generations if change in the level of education for each immigrant is considered. Since the majority of immigrants have low levels of education, it may be increasingly difficult for future second generation immigrants to ever surpass the average wages of non-immigrants.

It is sometimes known as the steinbuck or steinbok.  Description  Steenbok phylogenetic relationships (simplified) Steenbok resemble small Oribi, standing 45‚Äì60 cm (16\\"‚Äì24\\") at the shoulder. Their pelage (coat) is any shade from fawn to rufous, typically rather orange. The underside, including chin and throat, is white, as is the ring around the eye. Ears are large with \\"finger-marks\\" on the inside. Males have straight, smooth, parallel horns 7‚Äì19 cm long (see image left). There is a black crescent-shape between the ears, a long black bridge to the glossy black nose, and a black circular scent-gland in front of the eye. The tail is not usually visible, being only 4‚Äì6 cm long.  Distribution  There are two distinct clusters in steenbok distribution. In East Africa, it occurs in central and southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. It was formerly widespread in Uganda, but is now almost certainly extinct there. In Southern Africa, it occurs in Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe and probably Lesotho.  Habitat  Steenbok live in a variety of habitats from semi- desert, such as the edge of the Kalahari Desert and Etosha National Park, to open woodland and thickets, including open plains, stony savannah, and Acacia‚Äìgrassland mosaics. They are said to favour unstable or transitional habitats.Kingdon, Jonathan. 1997. The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals. Academic Press, San Diego & London. Pp. 387‚Äì388. () At least in the central part of Kruger National Park, South Africa, Steenbok show a distinct preference for Acacia tortilis savannah throughout the year, with no tendency to migrate to moister areas during the dry season (unlike many larger African savannah ungulates, including species sympatric with Steenbok in the wet season). Population density is typically 0.3‚Äì1.0 individuals per square kilometre, reaching 4 per km2 in optimal habitats.Kleiman, David G. et al., Eds. 2003. Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia, 2nd edn. Vol. 16: Mammals V. Gale Cengage Learning. Pp. 59‚Äì72.  Diet  Steenbok typically browse on low- level vegetation (they cannot reach above 0.9 m), but are also adept at scraping up roots and tubers. In central Kruger National Park, Steenbok show a distinct preference for forbs, and then woody plants (especially Flueggea virosa) when few forbs are available. They will also take fruits and only very rarely graze on grass. They are almost entirely independent of drinking water, gaining the moisture they need from their food.  Behaviour  Steenbok are active during the day and the night; however, during hotter periods, they rest under shade during the heat of the day. The time spent feeding at night increases in the dry season. While resting, they may be busy grooming, ruminating or taking brief spells of sleep. = Anti-predator = Steenbok typically lie low in vegetation cover at the first sign of threat At the first sign of trouble, steenbok typically lie low in the vegetation. If a predator or perceived threat comes closer, a steenbok will leap away and follow a zigzag route to try to shake off the pursuer. Escaping steenbok frequently stop to look back, and flight is alternated with prostration during extended pursuit. They are known to take refuge in the burrows of Aardvarks. Known predators include Southern African wildcat, caracal, jackals, leopard, martial eagle and pythons. = Breeding = Steenbok are typically solitary, except for when a pair come together to mate. However, it has been suggested that pairs occupy consistent territories while living independently, staying in contact through scent markings, so that they know where their mate is most of the time. Scent marking is primarily through dung middens. Territories range from 4 hectares to one square kilometre. The male is aggressive during the female's oestrus, engaging in \\"bluff-and-bluster\\" type displays with rival males‚Äîprolonged contests invariably involve well-matched individuals, usually in their prime.Cohen, Michael. 1976. The Steenbok: A neglected species. Custos (April 1976): 23‚Äì26. Breeding occurs throughout the year, although more fawns are born November to December in the southern spring‚Äìsummer; some females may breed twice a year. Gestation period is about 170 days, and usually a single precocious fawn is produced. The fawn is kept hidden in vegetation for 2 weeks, but they suckle for 3 months. Females become sexually mature at 6‚Äì8 months and males at 9 months. Steenbok are known to live for 7 years or more.  Taxonomy  Two subspecies are recognized: R. c. campestris in Southern Africa and R. c. naumanni of East Africa; although MSW3 also recognizes capricornis and kelleni. Up to 24 subspecies have been described from Southern Africa, distinguished on such features as coat colour.

The road is one of six roads that enter and depart Allentown, Pennsylvania, the third largest city in the state. Lehigh Street is one of several major Allentown-area exits off Interstate 78, which runs from Interstate 81 in Lebanon County in the west to the Holland Tunnel and New York City in the east. Lehigh Street also serves as a major commercial center for the Lehigh Valley. It is particularly well known for its \\"auto mile\\", which includes approximately a dozen new and used automobile dealerships. As the road enters Allentown from the west, it also runs by Queen City Airport, an Allentown airport used mostly by small, privately owned aircraft. The South Mall, in Salisbury Township, is located on Lehigh Street. The Emmaus side of Lehigh Street is the location of Shangy's, a beer distributor with the largest selection of domestic and global beers in the nation (over 3,000 in all). Rodale Press, a leading global publisher of health-related books and magazines, also is located off Lehigh Street, on the Emmaus side of the road. Route description Lehigh Street southbound at 29th Street in Allentown Lehigh Street is a continuation of State Avenue near South Mall, in the northern sections of Emmaus. Upon crossing the Allentown- Emmaus boundary, it widens to a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane. From there, Lehigh runs northward traversing one of the busiest commercial districts in the city. North of 29th Street SW, Lehigh Street interchanges the Interstate 78/Pennsylvania Route 309 overlap. North of the underpass, Lehigh is designated east of Queen City Airport. The street runs away of the airport, while progressing northward. At the intersection with Jefferson Street, Lehigh Street narrows to two-lanes and turns slightly to run on a northeast course. North of 12th Street, the street does not have the center left-turn lane. A couple of blocks from South 12th Street, Lehigh Street intersects several Allentown-area roads and passes south of the abandoned Bicentennial Park. At Wyoming Street, Lehigh turns east and widens to three-lanes (two southbound and one northbound). Briefly west of S. 8th Street, Lehigh Street eastbound continues as Saint John Street up to S. 6th Street (PA 145 south). Lehigh Street westbound splits at the intersection with PA 145 (South 6th Street/Auburn Street), four blocks from downtown Allentown. The one-way roadway merges with Saint John Street which becomes Lehigh Street eastbound. North of this, PA 145 follows two-way Lehigh Street north, intersecting Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive. Lehigh Street ends at the intersection with Union Street in downtown Allentown, where PA 145 splits into a one-way pair along that street. History In 1941, from Cedar Crest Boulevard in Emmaus to S. 6th Street and Auburn Street (today PA 145) in Allentown, Lehigh Street was designated as Pennsylvania Route 29. By 1960, the designation was removed.

He adopted the middle name \\"Buonarotti\\" in around 1815. As well as being active in the UK, he designed a monument in Belgium and designed buildings intended for Germany and the USA. Life Papworth was born in Marylebone, London, in 1775 to John Papworth and his wife Charlotte (n√©e Searle). He was one of twelve children and the second of six sons. His father described himself as an \\"architect, plasterer and builder\\". His background was in decorative plasterwork, and he dominated the trade in London, employing more than 500 men. At the recommendation of Sir William Chambers he spent two years as a pupil of the architect John Plaw and was then apprenticed to the builder Thomas Wapshott, whose daughter Jane he then married.Her portrait miniature by Mary Green is in the Royal Institute of British Architects Drawings and Archives Collections St Mary of the Visitation church in Killybegs, designed by Papworth in an early pointed Gothic Revival style between 1834 and 1839 John Summerson described Papworth as \\"one of the most versatile architects and decorative artists of the period\\". In London he designed shop fronts (one, for a tea merchant in Ludgate Hill, was in a \\"Chinese\\" style) and warehouses, and built or remodelled many villas for middle-class clients in the countryside. At Cheltenham he laid out the Montpellier Estate, and extended the Montpellier Pump Room (1825‚Äì26), with a domed rotunda inspired by the Pantheon. In 1827 William Bullock commissioned Papworth to plan the layout and design various classes of building for a new city to be called \\"Hygeia\\" in the United States, on land he had bought stretching about two-and-a-half miles along the Ohio River, opposite Cincinnati. Bullock published the plans, hoping to attract purchasers for the plots, but the scheme came to nothing. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1816 and 1841. His address is given as Bath Place, New Road, London, until 1816, and 10 Caroline Street, Bedford Square, from 1823. In the latter year he is described as \\"Architect to the King of Wirtemberg\\", and exhibited a design for a \\"Palace at Canstadt for the King of Wirtemberg\\". In 1838 he became director of the newly established Government School of Design. He had two sons, John Woody Papworth, and Wyatt Papworth. His brother George Papworth acted as his clerk of works until 1804 and then practised as an architect in Ireland. Publications He contributed designs to Ackermann's Repository of the Arts for almost 20 years, and published some of his designs for houses as Designs for Rural Residences in 1818. Archive His archive of drawings is in Drawings and Archives Collections of the Royal Institute of British Architects, which has put a number of images on line including illustrations from \\"Rural Residences\\".

NEBH is an international leader in the treatment of all forms of musculoskeletal disorders and disease. \\"The Baptist\\" (as the hospital is called for short) is located atop Parker Hill in the Mission Hill neighborhood within walking distance of the Longwood Medical and Academic Area. The hospital is a teaching affiliate of both the University of Massachusetts Medical School and Tufts University School of Medicine. It also conducts teaching programs in collaboration with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard School of Medicine. CareGroup, Inc. is the parent non-profit holding company for New England Baptist, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Milton, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham, and Mount Auburn Hospital.  History  \\"The Baptist\\" was the site of one of the first artificial hip replacements in the United States. As indicated by its name, New England Baptist Hospital was established in 1893 by Northern Baptists, a denomination with a long history in New England and an identity distinct from the better-known Southern Baptists. When the hospital was created in 1893, Parker Hill was a streetcar suburb considered far enough away from downtown Boston to provide fresh air and an escape from the noise and congestion of the city for patients who might benefit from long term rest and relaxation. Parker Hill offers panoramic views of the city, Boston Harbor, and the Blue Hills. Even today it is a remarkably peaceful site considering its location near the center of one of the largest metropolitan areas in North America. In April 2017, New England Baptist Hospital agreed to join with Lahey Health and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.  Bone & Joint Institute  Through the associated New England Baptist Bone & Joint Institute, the hospital offers a full range of services in orthopedics and rheumatology, occupational medicine and sports medicine, foot and ankle care, joint replacement, spine care, and hand surgery. The institute offers a range of preventive, education, diagnostic, treatment and rehabilitation services.  Sports medicine  NEBH has a long association with sports medicine and has provided services to U.S. Olympic teams and countless professional athletes. Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams came to the Baptist for treatment of a cervical disk disorder in the 1950s. In 1999, esteemed PGA Tour player Jack Nicklaus came to the Baptist for a new hip. NEBH is the official hospital of the seventeen-time world champion Boston Celtics and has a long association with the Boston Athletic Association which hosts the Boston Marathon. The Baptist continues to provide services to a variety of professional and amateur athletes from around the world.  Notable mentions  * The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) named NEBH as one of the top 10 United States hospitals for knee and hip orthopedics. * U.S. News & World Report selected the Baptist as one of the top orthopedic hospitals in the country. * Becker's Hospital Review listed NEBH under 60 Hospitals With Great Orthopedic Programs.

In anesthesia, the Mallampati score or Mallampati classification, named after the Indian-born American anaesthesiologist Seshagiri Mallampati, is used to predict the ease of endotracheal intubation. The test comprises a visual assessment of the distance from the tongue base to the roof of the mouth, and therefore the amount of space in which there is to work. It is an indirect way of assessing how difficult an intubation will be; this is more definitively scored using the Cormack-Lehane classification system, which describes what is actually seen using direct laryngoscopy during the intubation process itself. A high Mallampati score (class 3 or 4) is associated with more difficult intubation as well as a higher incidence of sleep apnea. Technique The score is assessed by asking the patient, in a sitting posture, to open his or her mouth and to protrude the tongue as much as possible. The anatomy of the oral cavity is visualized; specifically, the assessor notes whether the base of the uvula, faucial pillars (the arches in front of and behind the tonsils) and soft palate are visible. Scoring is generally done without phonation. Depending on whether the tongue is maximally protruded and/or the patient asked to phonate, the scoring may vary. Modified Mallampati Scoring: * Class I: Soft palate, uvula, fauces, pillars visible. * Class II: Soft palate, major part of uvula, fauces visible. * Class III: Soft palate, base of uvula visible. * Class IV: Only hard palate visible. Original Mallampati Scoring: * Class 1: Faucial pillars, soft palate and uvula could be visualized. * Class 2: Faucial pillars and soft palate could be visualized, but uvula was masked by the base of the tongue. * Class 3: Only soft palate visualized. Further research may be needed to determine the most effective consistent and predictive approach on which to standardize Mallampati Scoring. Clinical significance While Mallampati classes I and II are associated with relatively easy intubation, classes III and IV are associated with increased difficulty. A systematic review of 42 studies, with 34,513 participants, found that the modified Mallampati score is a good predictor of difficult direct laryngoscopy and intubation, but poor at predicting difficult bag mask ventilation. Therefore, the study concluded that while useful in combination with other tests to predict the difficulty of an airway, it is not sufficiently accurate alone.

Pampuri worked as a field doctor on the battlefield during the Great War and was discharged in 1920 when he was able to resume his studies and soon begin his own practice as a doctor where he tended to the poor without charge. He became a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis as \\"Antonio\\" while founding the Band of Pius X which he dedicated to the medical care of poor people. But Pampuri later became a professed religious for the call was too great for him to ignore; he managed a free dental clinic in Brescia for his order. Pampuri's canonization cause opened in Milan in 1970 and he became titled as a Servant of God while Pope Paul VI titled him as Venerable on 12 June 1978 after confirming that he had lived a model life of heroic virtue. Pope John Paul II beatified Pampuri on 4 October 1981 and later canonized him at the end of that decade on 1 November 1989. Life =Childhood and education= Erminio Filippo Pampuri was born on 2 August 1897 in Trivolzio as the tenth of the eleven children to Innocenzo Pampuri and Angela Campari (1856-1900) and he was baptized on 3 August. His mother died in 1900 and he was then taken into the home of Giovanni and Maria Campari who were his maternal uncle and aunt at Torrino which was a village close to his. Later in 1907 his father died in Milan in a traffic accident and he remained in the care of his maternal aunt and maternal grandparents. His sister Maria became a nun (with the new name of \\"Longina\\") and she died in Cairo in 1977. In his childhood he wanted nothing more than to become a priest in the missions but was dissuaded from this on account of his delicate health. But his doctor uncle Carlo inspired him to learn medicine and he soon became resolved to become a doctor. He attended two schools as a child at villages near his and then went to Milan where he attended a junior high school. He completed his high school studies as a boarder at Augustine's College in Pavia where - after graduation - he enrolled in the medical department of the Pavia college. Whilst he studied there he was an active member of the college's Severino Boezio Club for Catholic Action. He also belonged to the Societ√† San Vincenzo de' Paoli and the Third Order of Saint Francis which he joined as a secular on 20 March 1921 in the name of \\"Antonio\\" at the Franciscan convent of Canepanova in Pavia. Between 1 April 1917 and 1920 he was in the fighting zone in World War I where he worked in the field hospitals. He first served as a sergeant and later went into training as an officer in the medical corps. He resumed his studies in 1920 after being discharged that April. On 6 July 1921 he graduated at the top of his class in surgical and medical studies. From 1921 to 1924 he spent time in doing practical experience with his doctor uncle and after this for a short time served for a brief period as an assistant in the medical practice at Vernate before being appointed to the practice of Morimondo in Milan. In 1922 he passed his internship with high honours at the Milano Instituto di Ostetricia e Ginecologia. In 1923 he was registered at the college in Pavia as a general practitioner in medicine. He later arrived in Morimondo to practice medicine where he gave valuable assistance to the parish priest and helped him to set up a musical band and a Catholic Action Youth Club of which he was the first president. He was also the secretary of the Parish Missionary Aid Society and he founded the Band of Pius X which he dedicated to the medical care of the poor whom he treated for free. Pampuri would soon leave his practice to become a religious after seeing that his call to the religious life was far too great to ignore. =Religious life= Pampuri joined the Hospitallers of Saint John of God in Milan on 22 June 1927 so as to follow evangelical holiness in a closer manner and at the same time to be able to continue his medical profession so as to alleviate the suffering of his fellow neighbours. He had hoped to become a Jesuit but rethought it and decided against it. He entered the novitiate at Brescia and at that time was given the religious habit of the order and the religious name of \\"Riccardo\\". Once he had completed probation period of training he made his profession of religious vows on 24 October 1928. He was then appointed as the director of the free dental clinic attached to the order's hospital at Brescia. =Illness and death= Pampuri suffered a fresh outbreak of pleurisy which he had first contracted during his war service and this soon degenerated into specific bronco-pneumonia coupled with tuberculosis which worsened in January 1930 to the point where he had to cut back on his work; these difficulties first were of a respiratory kind since 1929. On 18 April 1930 he was taken from Brescia to Milan where he died on 1 May; he had met his nephew Alessandro on 30 April to bid him farewell. His remains are in his old parish church in his village of Trivolzio after being exhumed and relocated on 16 May 1951. Sainthood The canonization process opened in the Milan archdiocese under Cardinal Blessed Ildefonso Schuster on 1 April 1949 in an informative process that collected documentation until the process closed in 1951. His writings were all investigated and found to be in line with official doctrine thus received theological approval on 4 May 1954 while the formal introduction to the cause came on 10 July 1970 in which he was named as a Servant of God. Cardinal Giovanni Colombo oversaw an apostolic process in 1971 after which stage all documentation collected was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome who validated both processes on 3 December 1971. The members of the C.C.S. and their official consultants voiced their approval to the cause on 29 November 1977 while the C.C.S. members alone met and approved the cause on 21 February 1978 after reviewing all the documentation. On 12 June 1978 he was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope Paul VI confirmed that Pampuri had led a model life of heroic virtue. One miracle that science could not explain - a healing - had to be investigated and approved for Pampuri to be beatified. The approval of one such healing allowed for Pope John Paul II to preside over Pampuri's beatification on 4 October 1981. The second miracle required for full sainthood was investigated in Spain in Alcadozo and concerned the 5 January 1982 cure of the child Manuel Cifuentes Rodenas (b. 1971) who would have been blinded in his right eye due to coming into contact with branches from an almond tree hut did not after his father appealed to the late Pampuri for a healing. This was investigated on a diocesan level and the C.C.S. validated the process on 6 February 1987 with a medical panel approving it on 19 October 1988. Theologians also approved this miracle on 17 January 1989 as did the C.C.S. on 11 February 1989.

The film is about an American film producer who returns to her homeland, Russia, to discover the truth about her family history. It is an international co- production between Bulgaria, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Plot A Russian peasant family is eating dinner when a truck stops in the front yard. The father opens the door of the truck to find a dead woman and two crying infants in the seat next to her. Marie Jones, an American woman, is seen in a Russian hotel room making a call to her daughter; she then goes to meet a local notary, who tells her that she has inherited some property, and that she should visit it. Having been taken to the wooded island, she finds that the house is dilapidated and inhabited by zombie-like creatures, one of whom looks like her. Having attempted to escape, she meets Nikolai, who tells her that they are twins, adopted separately following the murder of their mother. The house seems to change at random between a state of dilapidation and a state of domestication. Threatened by the zombie-like creatures, Nikolai shoots one of them in the leg, only to find that the wound appears on his own body. He deduces that they are his and Marie's doppelg√§ngers, and that 'what happens to them happens to us'. When Nikolai falls into a hole in the floor while the house is dilapidated, Marie is unable to rescue him as the hole suddenly heals over when the house changes to a domesticated state. Marie attempts to escape by rowing across the river. After a lengthy walk on the opposite bank, she happens upon a house, only to find that it is the house she has escaped from, with Nikolai inside. He explains that their father intended to kill them along with their mother when they were babies, and that they cannot leave until he has managed to reunite the family in death. The house reverts to its state on the night of the murder, and they see their father returning home. Nikolai tells Marie that they can escape in the truck along with their mother and their younger selves. While searching for the truck, Marie finds her father's now desiccated body in the barn, and is then pushed into a pseudo-past where she realizes her father and the notary are the same person. She flees his office in the present and runs into her past self as she comes up the steps, and continues fleeing into the sunlight until she finds herself back in the house, this time between the past and the present, where the apparition of her father explains that he has always loved his children and his wife, and could not let them leave him. She runs from him and finds Nikolai's body being eaten by boars. When her doppelg√§nger comes after her, Marie flees to the truck parked outside and drives away. Marie's father's voice comes over the radio, telling her to return and join the family he has created. The bridge that brought her there has been destroyed, and she plunges into the river, drowning. The film ends with Marie's daughter, Emily, explaining that she knew her mother would never return. It has been a long time since her mother left for Russia and Emily has never had the desire to know what happened to Marie or her parents, breaking the cycle and leaving her abandoned.

Nacho Cerd√†, a friend of Hussain's who had been impressed by the screenplay, later suggested the film as a project for Filmax. As Hussain was involved in another film at the time, Cerd√† took over directing duties. Richard Stanley was brought in to polish the script. For casting, Cerd√† insisted on an unknown actor to star, despite the studio pushing for Nastassja Kinski or Holly Hunter. The film was originally known as Los Abandonados, under which it played at Sitges Film Festival. Cerd√† disliked that name, but Stanley preferred that, as it sounded like a Spaghetti western. Cerd√† is a fan of slow-paced, atmospheric horror films and wanted to make something that wasn't a Saw or Hostel clone. Major themes include the past, emotional dependency and forging your own identity.  Release  The Abandoned was first released in the US as part of the After Dark Horrorfest in November 2006. The film received a stand-alone release in cinemas in February 2007. The total domestic gross was $1,331,137, and the total worldwide gross was $4,153,578. The DVD was released on 19 June 2007 and includes a short \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurette.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that the film received positive reviews from 38% of 34 surveyed critics, and the average rating was 4.7/10; the consensus is: \\"The Abandoned spends so much time setting up the creepy atmosphere, that it forgets to inhabit it with genuine spooks or scares.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety called The Abandoned a \\"minimally plotted but beautifully atmospheric nightmare\\" and predicted that it would be popular among cult film fans who favor \\"arty, surreal Euro-horror\\". Bloody Disgusting rated the film 4.5/5 stars and wrote that it is \\"the most genuinely scary and intelligent horror film since Session 9\\" with a \\"rare perfect mix of substance and style.\\" Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated it 4.5/5 stars and called it \\"creepy, genuinely scary, and above all else, original.\\" Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club rated the film B and said that it \\"is a rare horror film that moves from the real world into a kind of psychic space, and slowly suffocates its characters inside their own heads.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it D- and said it \\"sinks so deep into deathly atmosphere that there's no life to it.\\" Jim Ridley of The Village Voice described it as \\"a punishing dose of zombie Chekhov for lifetime Fangoria subscribers\\" and \\"style in search of a movie\\". Erin Meister of the Boston Globe called it \\"more of an exercise in audience torture than titillation\\" that makes no sense.

On July 22, 2005, Marcinkowski joined two other former CIA agents, Vincent Cannistraro and Larry Johnson, in discussing the consequences of the Plame affair. Congressional campaign On June 28, 2006, an article in Congressional Quarterly's CQPolitics.com announced that Marcinkowski's early campaign efforts had spurred it to change its rating of the race to \\"Republican Favored\\" from \\"Safe Republican\\". The article noted that Marcinkowski presented two logistical challenges that Republican Mike Rogers had not faced in either of his previous re-election bids: location and resources. Marcinkowski hailed from the portion of Oakland County outside of Detroit at the eastern end of the 8th District. According to Congressional Quarterly, that gave Rogers, from Livingston County in the middle of the 8th, his first direct competition for votes in the portion annexed to the district in the most recent remap. Campaign resources were also giving Marcinkowski an advantage over past candidates; he had enough money to launch a radio ad campaign in early June, putting him ahead of Rogers' past two underfinanced opponents. A May 4, 2006 article in Roll Call noted that Marcinkowski raised more than $138,000 from January 1-March 31, 2006 -- about $11,000 more than Rogers took in during that same period. Marcinkowski received 79 percent of his money from individual contributions, which, according to his comments in the article, translated into support on the ground in the district. According to Roll Call, Rogers received 63 percent of his first-quarter money from political action committees, while only 37 percent came from individual contributions. Marcinkowski told Roll Call, \\"It is way harder to raise money from working people than from the K Street Project. I think it shows that we're connecting to people in the district.\\" Founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity Marcinkowski is a founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity. In September 2015, Marcinkowski and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to President Obama, challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee on the Central Intelligence Agency's use of torture.

Subscription This bronze statue was the first publicly funded statue in Birmingham, and the first statue of Horatio Nelson in Britain. It was made in 1809 by public subscription of ¬£2,500 by the people of Birmingham following Nelson's visit to the town on 31 August 1802, the year before he sailed against the fleets of Napoleon. The statue was unveiled on 25 October 1809, that being the day decreed as the official golden jubilee of George III. Description The statue in 1898. the lamp posts, made from naval cannons, were part of the original design. Nelson stands in uniform, with his one arm resting on an anchor with the prow of a miniature ship: HMS Victory. Upon the ship is the Flag Staff Truck (part of the mast) of the French ship Orient (1791), flagship of the French fleet, sunk at the Battle of the Nile. It originally stood on a cylindrical marble plinth carved with the people of Birmingham, surrounded by iron railings with lanterns standing on up-ended cannon at each corner. The statue was originally erected on the site of the Old Cross, a two storey building (a meeting hall over an open space), built in 1703 and demolished in August 1784. Since 25 April 1952 it has had Grade II* listed status. A related statue was constructed in Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1813. Like the Birmingham statue, it was also sculpted by Westmacott, and based on the same design. The statue was moved in 1961 during the first redevelopment of the Bull Ring and the carved plinth, cannon and lanterns lost. After the recent redevelopment has returned close to its original location north of the church. It stands on the high balcony between the Bullring shopping centre and the new Selfridges store. Nelson now looks again over the church of St Martin in the Bull Ring. He now stands on a plain plinth, surrounded by iron railings linked by iron rope. These railings were the original railings, but were delayed from being installed by objections on the grounds of Health & Safety from the Bullring. However, the railings were restored in September 2005, just in time for the Trafalgar Bicentenary celebrations which centred on the statue. The statue forms the centrepiece of Birmingham's annual Trafalgar Day commemoration. In 2009, to mark the 200th anniversary of the statue's unveiling, a medal was struck by St Paul's Mint of Birmingham.  Criticism  Following the Rhodes Must Fall campaign in South Africa and the removal of confederate monuments in the United States, statues of Nelson faced criticism. British broadcaster Afua Hirsch drew attention to Nelson's ardent support for colonialism and slavery. In November 2017, the statue of Nelson in Barbados, which is based on the Birmingham design, was defaced and a sign attached describing Nelson as a \\"racist white supremacist.\\" At present, the Birmingham statue includes a short biography of Nelson, but does not mention the issues of slavery or colonialism.

P. Lovecraft, based on his friend Samuel Loveman (1887‚Äì1976). Lovecraft had a dream about Loveman, which inspired him to write the short story \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" in 1919. In the story, Warren is a mysterious occultist and friend of Carter (Lovecraft's alter ego), who suffers a gruesome but undefined fate while exploring a crypt in Big Cypress Swamp. Lovecraft mentions Warren in two other short stories. In \\"The Silver Key\\", which he wrote in 1926, he describes Harley Warren as \\"a man in the south, who was shunned and feared for the things he read in prehistoric books and clay tablets smuggled from India and Arabia\\". The story's sequel, \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\", presents Warren as an expert linguist who has mastered the primal Naacal language of the Himalayas. Lovecraft cowrote this latter work with E. Hoffmann Price; they collaborated on the piece from October 1932 to April 1933. What singles out Warren from Lovecraft's many other doomed characters is his self-sacrificial, gentle nature (he pleads with Carter to put back the crypt's slab and flee while he still has a chance to get away), combined with a sinister element that is more in keeping with Lovecraft's other ambiguous anti-heroes such as Richard Upton Pickman and Herbert West (Carter describes Warren's expression as \\"disquieting\\" when he talks about his occult theories). In a letter to Clark Ashton Smith, Lovecraft proposes that Warren may have been destroyed by a \\"begetting entity\\" in Smith's tale \\"The Nameless Offspring\\". A character who bears a resemblance to Warren is Clark Ashton Smith's antehuman sorcerer Haon- Dor (from \\"The Seven Geases\\"), another seeker after forbidden lore. Warren is also mentioned in Brian Lumley's Titus Crow series as a member of a Bostonian group of psychics. Interpretation In Lovecraft: Disturbing the Universe, Donald R. Burleson says, \\"The surname Warren suggests, directly, the noun warren, an overcrowded dwelling place, from the Indo-European root wer-, \\"to cover,\\" whence also comes warrant. Harley Warren is a semantically crowded repository of textuality, dwelling as he does in absence, and warranting, thereby, the existence of the text ‚Äî not to mention accounting for the fact that a warrant seems to have gone out at some point to have Carter brought in for questioning. Warren's name also suggests warring, and one thinks of critic Barbara Johnson's celebrated and felicitous definition of deconstruction (in The Critical Difference) as \\"the careful teasing out of warring forces of signification within the text itself.\\" Harley Warren, then, comes to represent ‚Äî rather, he stays away to represent ‚Äî the text's own self-differing inclination, the unstoppable \\"warring\\" of its significations, the competing of its various possible configurations of privilege. Warren, the deposition tells us, has learned to read a wide variety of languages, and thus he is a fitting figure to represent linguistic and textual complexities.\\" In other media Several actors in cinematic renditions of The Statement of Randolph Carter have portrayed Harley Warren, including John Rhys-Davies in the 1992 film The Unnamable II: The Statement of Randolph Carter.

He was known for taking a scientific approach in his investigations of classical Greek and Roman art, being credited with introducing the method of determining the date and source of sculptural fragments by way of thorough analysis of the account of anatomic detail.A Biographical Dictionary of Historic Scholars, Museum Professionals and Academic Historians of Art (biography of Brunn).  Biography  Brunn studied archaeology and philology at the University of Bonn, where he was influenced by the teachings of Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker (1784-1868) and Friedrich Ritschl (1806-1876). In 1843 he received his doctorate degree with the work Artificum liberae Graeciae tempora, afterwards moving to Rome, where for several years he was associated with the German Archaeological Institute (DAI). In 1853, he received an appointment at Bonn, but within a few years, returned to Rome as second secretary of the DAI, serving under Wilhelm Henzen (1816-1887). In 1865 he was chosen inaugural professor for archaeology at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Among his pupils were Gustav K√∂rte, Adolf Furtw√§ngler, Heinrich W√∂lfflin, Julius Langbehn, Paul Arndt, Walther Amelung, Arthur Milchh√∂fer and Heinrich Bulle. From 1865 up until his death in 1894, he was director of the Glyptothek in Munich, publishing in 1868, a guide to the museum, called Beschreibung der Glyptothek K√∂nig Ludwig's I. zu M√ºnchen. For a number of years, he collected artwork for the Glyptothek, being instrumental in making the museum an important center for the study of classical sculpture. Brunn's impressive collection of casts at the Glyptothek was destroyed during World War II (1944). He was co-founder of Denkm√§ler griechischer und r√∂mischer Skulptur in historischer Anordung (1888), and was author of Geischichte der griechischen K√ºnstler, a publication that helped establish a chronology of ancient Greek art history.

His pulp-fiction writings on cavalry and Indians were published in paperbacks or serialized in the Saturday Evening Post. Bellah was the author of 19 novels, including The Valiant Virginian (the inspiration for the 1961 NBC television series 'The Americans), and Blood River. Some of his short stories were turned into films by John Ford, including Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and Rio Grande. With Willis Goldbeck he wrote the screenplay for The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. War years In World War I, Bellah enlisted in the Canadian Army, and served as a pilot in the 117th Squadron of Great Britain's Royal Flying Corps. These experiences formed the basis of his 1928 novel Gods of Yesterday. In the 1930s he worked as a journalist for the New York Post. During World War II, Bellah served in the United States Army, starting as a lieutenant in the 16th Infantry, was detailed to the General Staff Corps before Pearl Harbor, and was later assigned to Headquarters 1st Infantry Division, later with the 80th Infantry Division. Later he served on the staff of Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten in Southeast Asia. He was attached to General Wingate's Chindits in combat in Burma, and to General Stillwell and to Colonel Cochran's 1st Air Commando Group. He left the service with the rank of Colonel. He was a member of the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of California beginning in 1952. His short story \\"Spanish Man's Grave\\" is considered by some to be one of the finest American Western stories ever written. His last script was A Thunder of Drums. Bellah's depiction of the Apache is protested by some and lauded as realistic by others. In the early stages of his career, Elmore Leonard modelled his style closely after Bellah's writing.My love affair with movies\\", The Guardian, republished in The Canberra Times, 3 May 1997, p.

Launched in April 1990 as a national organisation, the WOSA was opposed to racism, tribalism and sexism and supports socialism, accountability, democracy and the leadership of the black working class. The group was formed by a need for an organization that could raise workers issues without being aligned to any political party and has dealt with working conditions, wages, unemployment, housing, education, health and transport. It also claimed that the African National Congress was raising hopes which were unrealisable under capitalism. Instead, for the 1994 South African general election, it formed the Workers List Party in alliance with the International Socialist Movement (South Africa) (ISM), which shared much of the politics of (but was not affiliated to) the International Socialist Tendency.

The unit currently flies the new Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. Nicknamed the Screaming Eagles, it is one of the most decorated airlift units in the U.S. Air Force. Origins On 18 February 1942, the squadron was activated as the 40th Transport Squadron at Duncan Field, Texas and was assigned to the 317th Transport Group three days later. Beginning with only a second lieutenant Fred H.Schomburg, squadron commander and eight enlisted men, the squadron slowly took shape, and in about four months was full-sized. At this time it transferred to Bowman Field, Kentucky where it began flying the Douglas C-47 Skytrain. The pace of developments in World War II drove a rapid training and deployment schedule, and on 6 December 1942, the 40th moved to Laurinburg-Maxton Army Air Base, North Carolina to begin staging for its move to the Pacific. A few days later, the squadron left North Carolina for the Mobile Air Depot, Alabama where it received thirteen new C-47s. After they checked out the airplanes, the squadron flew to California. World War II Operations On 5 January 1943, the squadron left California for the Southwest Pacific Theater. Two days later it landed at Brisbane, Australia where it came under the command of the Fifth Air Force. After a short time in Brisbane, the squadron moved to Garbutt Field, Townsville, Australia, the squadron's first permanent oversees home. =Buna= In the Buna campaign, the 40th ferried food, ammunition, equipment, and reinforcements to Allied troops, then evacuated the wounded to hospitals on its return flights. As the battle of Buna neared its end, the fight for Wau was just beginning. =Wau= At Wau, Papua New Guinea, the squadron supported Australian commandos known as the Kanga Force who were harassing the Japanese. Squadron pilots soon became accustomed to landing on the 3,000-foot dirt strip at Wau with its 12 per cent grade heading directly at Kainde Mountain. The crews flew in reinforcements, ammunition, artillery pieces, food and other supplies. Wau saw the 40th's first combat casualties when a crew crashed while attempting to land on 18 January. On 29 January, the Japanese began a full- scale assault on the airstrip. They managed to reach one end of the runway, which they placed under constant mortar fire. At times, planes circled as the Australians fought the Japanese far enough back into the jungle to allow the aircraft to land. Many of the reinforcements flown into the strip jumped from the planes straight into the battle with their guns firing. By the end of 30 January, most of the Japanese attacks had been repulsed, and the airstrip remained in Allied hands for the remainder of the war. The 40th Troop Carrier Squadron received its first Distinguished Unit Citation for its efforts at Wau. =Consolidation= After these two battles, the 40th established and operated air routes across Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. The pace of operations did not slacken and the squadron engaged in a wide variety of tactical airlift actions. Primarily, these included airlifting troops, reinforcements, supplies, and equipment into combat, and evacuating the wounded. It dropped paratroopers during airborne assault operations, and delivered equipment and supplies by airdrop. Other secondary missions included carrying captured Japanese troops to rear areas, providing quick transportation for commanders to and from combat areas, and conducting training with airborne troops. =Assault on Lae= The 40th's next major battle occurred on 5 September, when Allied Forces assaulted the island of Lae. The squadron joined the rest of the 317th Troop Carrier Group in an air assault on the Nadzab plain. General Kenney, Fifth Air Force commander, later said, \\"I truly don‚Äôt believe that another air force in the world today could have put this over as perfectly as the Fifth Air Force did. Three hundred and two airplanes in all, taking off from eight different fields in the Moresby and Dobodura areas made a rendezvous right on the nose over Marilinan, flying through clouds, passes in the mountains, and over the top. Not a single squadron did any circling or stalling around but all slid into place like clockwork and proceeded on the final flight down the Watut Valley, turned to the right down the Markham River and went directly to the target.\\" =Move across New Guinea= As Allied troops pressed westward across New Guinea, the squadron moved to Ward Airdrome at Port Moresby. This move, accomplished on 6 October 1943, placed the squadron closer to combat, and eliminated many of the long flights back to Australia. The 317th Group soon became known as the \\"Jungle Skippers\\". Heavily loaded and unarmed, the C-47s were often flown unconventionally by their hard-pressed crews. Counting on stealth and surprise to help even the odds, the pilots slipped their transports down river valleys and through mountain gaps skipping and skimming across the jungle and rain forests. Throughout the rest of 1943, and into 1944, the 40th continued its support of the Allied advance. On 21 April 1944, the squadron moved to Finschhafen, New Guinea, and again in May to Cyclops Field, Hollandia. =Invasion of the Philippines= During Operation Table Tennis, the 40th airdropped troops on the island of Noemfoor during July 1944. In November, the squadron airdropped supplies to American troops on the island of Leyte in the Philippines. In January 1945, the squadron transferred to Leyte. From there it made covert airdrops to Filipino guerrillas and commandos operating throughout the island chain. The squadron's last major action of World War II came on 16 February with the invasion of Luzon. The 317th Group was tasked with dropping the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment troopers onto Corregidorc The only suitable drop zones were an old American parade ground and a golf course. At precisely 0830, fifty-one C-47s began wheeling over the two small drop zones in counter-rotating orbits dropping eight men per pass. With Colonel Jack Lackey, the 317th Group commander in the lead aircraft, the 39th and 40th Squadrons dropped on the former golf course while the 41st and 46th Squadrons racetracked to drop on the parade ground. While most of the aircraft were hit by intense ground fire, none were lost. For its efforts in this assault, the squadron won its second Distinguished Unit Citation. The squadron also participated in the airdrop of the 11th Airborne Division on Mindoro Island, and the airdrop of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment on Los Banos, on the Batangas Peninsula of Luzon. In February 1945, the squadron carried the \\"most valuable cargo ever moved in the Southwest Pacific Theater.\\" It brought 120 doctors and nurses to Mabalacat to care for American prisoners liberated from Japanese prisoner of war camps after three years of imprisonment. In March, the squadron moved to Clark Field, Philippines. While at Clark, the squadron dealt with raids by fanatical Japanese who penetrated the security around Clark to make hit and run attacks against the barracks and flight line. On 15 April, the squadron launched a short career as a strategic bombing squadron. Japanese troops holed up on Carabao Island, Cavite were threatening Allied shipping. Conventional bombing failed to make an impact, so the 40th's C-47s were loaded with 55 gallon drums filled with napalm. These were rolled out of the cargo doors and were credited with killing 2700 Japanese. =Move to Okinawa= In August, the squadron moved, this time to Naha Airfield, Okinawa. On 6 August, the first nuclear weapon was dropped on Hiroshima. Three days later, the United States dropped another on Nagasaki. On 14 August, the Japanese agreed to surrender. On 29 August, four 40th C-47s flew from Naha to Tokyo carrying an advance party for the surrender ceremony. These were the first US aircraft to land on the Japanese homeland at the end of hostilities. However, the occasion was marred when the lead aircraft misinterpreted the direction of the wind while coming in to land. This caused the entire formation to land downwind much to the consternation of the Japanese commander who had assembled his staff at the 'correct' end of the runway to greet the arriving victors. =Occupation of Japan= After the surrender of the Japanese, the 40th took part in the occupation of Japan. In 1947, the squadron received new Douglas C-54 Skymasters. The squadron became the 40th Troop Carrier Squadron, Heavy in May 1948, and was assigned to Far East Air Forces. European operations =Berlin Airlift= In June 1948, the Soviet Union attempted to force its wartime Allies, now cold war enemies, France, Great Britain, and the United States from the city of Berlin. The Allied powers immediately began an airlift into the city, but it soon became apparent that they needed more aircraft. In September, the 39th and 41st Squadrons from the 317th Troop Carrier Group were transferred to Germany. In November, the 40th followed. Soon after arriving in Germany, the 40th began flying into Berlin from Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany, before transferring to RAF Celle, Germany in December. From the time the 40th began operating at Wiesbaden until shortly after the Berlin blockade was lifted the following summer, the squadron flew approximately 10,550 round trips to Berlin transporting a grand total of 100,000 tons of supplies into the besieged city. When the Berlin Airlift ended, the entire 317th Group, including the 40th Squadron, was inactivated at RAF Celle on 14 September 1949. =Supporting NATO= The squadron was reactivated on 14 July 1952 as the 40th Troop Carrier Squadron, Medium at Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany. After its reactivation, the 40th joined its reactivated sister squadrons, the 39th and 41st, under control of the 317th Troop Carrier Wing supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization while flying the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar. In May 1953, the 40th transferred from Rhein-Main Air Base to Neubiberg Air Base, Germany. In October, the squadron began operations as part of the Air Logistics Service, a regularly scheduled series of airlift flights throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East which later became known as channel missions. In addition to its regular airlift schedule, the 40th airdropped 45,000 sandbags near the town of Regensburg, Germany, for emergency flood relief, transported supplies into India and Pakistan following floods, and stood alert during the 1956 Arab- Israeli War. During this crisis, the 40th staged to advanced fields with a United Nations Emergency Force. =C-130 and move to France= In October 1957, the squadron received its first Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Two months later, the squadron transferred from Neubiberg Air Base to √âvreux-Fauville Air Base, France. The 40th completed its transition into the C-130 in June 1958, just in time for the new plane to gain its first taste of action. =Lebanese Civil War= When Lebanon exploded into civil war in July 1958, the 40th both airlifted personnel, equipment, and supplies of the 24th Infantry Division into Beirut, and deployed aircraft to Incirlik Combined Defense Installation, Turkey. The squadron continued to fly into Lebanon until October 1959 when the civil war ended and the troops moved out. =Congo Crisis= On 1 July 1960, Belgium granted the Congo its independence. Within a week, the country had descended into anarchy. The locals began slaughtering Europeans, and looting and burning all European built buildings, businesses and facilities. When Belgium sent in its Dragon Rouge Paratroopers, they responded with similar ferocity against the local population. The United Nations quickly moved to stop the carnage and restore order to the area. On 8 July, the 40th, as part of the 322d Air Division, went on alert for action in Operation New Tape, the Congo airlift. From July, and well into the next year, the squadron flew across most of Africa carrying troops and hundreds of tons of cargo into the Congo. From the very beginning, all 40th aircrews were involved in the airlift. The first UN aircraft to land in the Congo was a 40th C-130 carrying Lt Col Francis E. Merritt, commander of the 40th. He was tasked as the combat Airlift Support Unit commander. Most of the airport facilities had been destroyed and the one forklift which Lt Col Merritt's crew brought with them soon broke. Despite the many problems and continuing unrest, including heavy gun battles around the airport, the ground crews under Lt Col Merritt continued to unload each arriving C-130, frequently by hand,. As the airlift developed, missions spread to include landings at dirt strips and runways throughout the region. Crews from the 40th found themselves eating C-rations cooked at tiny jungle airstrips. They carried thousands of refugees and troops from nations as far away as Algeria, South Africa, Morocco, and Somalia. The massive operation in support of the United Nations continued until the summer of 1961. =Iranian earthquake= The 40th continued its humanitarian efforts in 1962, when a hit Iran. Within hours of the disaster, 40th aircraft were in the air loaded with supplies for the people of Iran. The 40th flew nearly a third of all missions flown into Iran, carrying rations, tents, blankets, a 100-bed hospital, and several helicopters. =Sino-Indian War= In 1962, the 40th took part in another little publicized, but highly critical mission, airlift operations in the Sino-Indian War. On 21 November 1962, twelve C-130s departed France on a mass deployment to New Delhi, India. The deployed to support the Indian government in its defense against an invasion by Communist China. All of the aircraft arrived in New Delhi on 23 November, twenty-four hours ahead of schedule. When China invaded India, the Indian Air Force's Russian-built transports proved incapable of carrying troops and equipment into the high altitude Himalayan airfields. The 40th's C-130As easily handled the altitude, and quickly carried all of the Indian reinforcements and equipment into the area. During the first eleven days, the twelve crews carried over five hundred tons of supplies and over 5000 troops for a total of 203 sorties without an aborted launch. The mission was originally to last only a few months, but as usual, stretched out for over a year. The Indian government later stated that the efforts of the American C-130s prevented the Chinese from gaining any advantage after their initial invasion. =Skopje earthquake= As the Indian airlift wound down in 1963, the squadron was again called upon for humanitarian assistance, this time to Belgrade, Yugoslavia. An earthquake had devastated the town of Skopje, killing and injuring thousands of people. Three crews from the 40th flew in the initial group of C-130s carrying relief supplies into the area. United States =Move to Ohio= In November 1963, the 317th Troop Carrier Group began planning its move from √âvreux-Fauville Air Base, France to its new home, Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio. In June 1964, the 40th returned to the United States for the first time since January 1943. During its many years away from the United States, the squadron had flown combat operations stretching from the Far East to the Middle East, and humanitarian missions throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It was now time for the squadron to relax. Or so it thought. =Invasion of the Dominican Republic= In April 1965, the Dominican Republic elected a socialist president. The United States encouraged the Dominican military to stage a coup which degenerated into a civil war between the army and supporters of the democratic system. President Lyndon Johnson used this situation as an excuse for American intervention. The initial plan called for a massive airdrop invasion of the island by over one hundred C-130s. Orders went out, and the 40th deployed all of its planes to Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, where it joined the invasion force. After the formation became airborne, the president changed the invasion from an airdrop to an air land assault. The 40th diverted into Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico to allow the crews to rerig the loads, then flew into the Dominican Republic to combat offload the cargo. For the remainder of the operation, the 40th flew from both Pope and Ramey. When the fighting ended in June, the 40th returned to Lockbourne. =Beginning deployments= In 1964, the 40th began Operation Cross Switch rotations to Europe. During these rotations, the entire squadron deployed for two to four months each year from Ohio to Europe to augment the theater airlift forces. At first, the rotational base was located at √âvreux- Fauville, France, but after the French left NATO in 1966, the rotation was split between RAF Mildenhall, England, and Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany. At the same time that the squadron began its regular rotation to Europe, it also began a regular rotation of crews and planes to Panama. The rotation to Panama continued into the 1980s when the Air National Guard assumed responsibility for it. In October 1965, a C-130 Replacement Training Unit was established at Lockbourne. The 40th devoted a portion of its training to the unit. =The Sixties and Seventies= The late 1960s and early 1970s were a time of intense social unrest in the United States. On several occasions, the 40th carried troops into cities ravaged by riots or massive anti-Vietnam War demonstrations. The airlift of riot control troops, known as Operation Garden Plot took the 40th from Detroit to Washington, DC, to New Haven, Connecticut. As the nation began to heal in the seventies these operations slowly dwindled, then faded away. The social changes that swept through American culture in the sixties impacted the squadron in the seventies. In July 1970, Lockbourne Air Force Base received its first women. The base integrated the women into existing squadrons because it lacked a female-only squadron, which many other bases had. At first the commander were unsure of the roles of these new recruits, but soon found positions for them in squadron administration. In 1973, the All-Volunteer Force came into effect, and with higher pay, better living conditions, and improved facilities as the Air Force faced the fact that, if it did not improve the life style of its troops, they would leave. The seventies also saw an attempt to form \\"hard crews,\\" a dismal failure; the flight system, a management nightmare; and the removal of maintenance from the squadron, then its return, then its removal again. The seventies also brought the move of all C-130s into Military Airlift Command, a reversal of the consolidation into Tactical Air Command which occurred in the sixties. =Humanitarian operations= Through all of the changes, the mission of the 40th remained the same. Hurricane Camille, the worst hurricane in the history of the United States, hit the east coast in August 1969. In the first of a series of hurricane relief efforts, the 40th launched aircraft full of supplies for the stricken area. Hurricanes continued to decimate the east coast of the United States, and the 40th continued to respond. Hurricanes David and Frederick in 1979, Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 all brought out the 40th on missions of mercy. From 1969 on, the 40th flew humanitarian mission for a litany of disasters. Mud slides in Bogot√°, Colombia in September 1970, an earthquake on the border between Peru and Ecuador a month later, floods in Bolivia, and a volcanic eruption in Nicaragua in 1971, floods in Virginia and Pennsylvania in July 1972, and an earthquake in Nicaragua six months later, in 1973 Operation Authentic Assistance, a massive drought and famine relief operation in Mali, an earthquake in Turkey in 1976, blizzards in New York in 1977, and again in Massachusetts in 1979 all proved the squadron's worth as an instrument of humanitarian relief as well as war. This is only a small handful of the many humanitarian relief operations throughout the history of the 40th. To name them all would take far too much space, but this short list illustrates the immeasurable service the squadron has given representing the United States to the world. Pope Air Force Base In June 1971, the 40th began preparations for the 317th Tactical Airlift Wing's move-this time to Pope Air Force Base where it replaced the 778th Tactical Airlift Squadron, which inactivated and transferred its personnel and aircraftto the 40th. The move to Pope brought some mission changes as well. The squadron lost its obligation as a Replacement Training Unit, but gained the Adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System (AWADS) mission. Previously, C-130 squadrons at several bases had AWADS, but it was gradually consolidated into the three squadrons at Pope. The 40th also gained a rotational commitment to Southeast Asia in addition to its regular rotations to Europe and Panama. It soon became common for crews to spend ninety days in Germany, come home for a few weeks, deploy to Panama for six weeks, come home again for a short rest, then depart for the Pacific. =Vietnam deployments= The 40th crews were first based at Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan, and came under the control of the 61st Tactical Airlift Squadron. In 1974, they moved to U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand. From both bases, they flew high altitude AWADS drops in South Vietnam, as well as standard airlift missions. As many as eight 40th crews could be in the region at one time taking part in combat actions including the sieges of An L·ªôc and Phnom Penh, and Operations Easter Bunny and Constant Guard. The squadron received no official recognition for its involvement in the Vietnam War because many of its action in the war came after the United States officially ended its participation. At the end of 1974, the 40th pulled its crews out of Southeast Asia, and turned over its responsibility for the adverse weather airdrop mission to the Thai Air Force and Bird Air-a regional civilian contract service flying C-130s. =Iranian Revolution= In 1979, while the squadron was on rotation in Europe, radical Muslims overthrew the Shah of Iran. The 40th flew into Iran rescuing American citizens working in the country. The squadron flew from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey and Tehran, Iran into small dirt strips carrying in supplies and evacuating both civilian and military personnel. =Invasion of Grenada= The squadron gained its first combat experience in nearly a decade in 1983. Fighting among various factions among the island of Grenada's communist government led to fear that American medical students on the island could be taken hostage. President Ronald Reagan responded with Operation Urgent Fury, an invasion of the island. The 40th provided two of the five crews for the initial airborne assault on Point Salines Airport. After the initial assault, the numerous Squadron crews flew follow on missions into the island carrying troops, supplies, food, and ammunition. On the return trips the crews carried out Cuban soldiers who had been working on several large military construction projects, and the American medical students who has been caught on the island by the unrest. Despite outrage on the part of Liberals Americans, the people of Grenada profusely thanked the United States from rescuing them from a government they did not want. =Invasion of Panama= Relations between the United States and Panama, a former ally of the U.S., deteriorated in the late 1980s. By 1989, the two countries were in nearing a state of undeclared war. That winter, president George H. W. Bush launched a massive invasion-Operation JUST CAUSE-to remove Noriega. On 19 December 1989, the 40th joined the other two Pope squadrons, and the 50th Tactical Airlift Squadron from Little Rock Air Force Base, for a fifteen aircraft airborne assault on Rio Hato Airport, Panama. The aircraft launched for a late night assault of Army Rangers. After flying down the western Caribbean, across Panama, and out over the Pacific, the formation turned and began its run for Rio Hato. The first few aircraft flew unscathed across the drop zone, but Panamanian soldiers quickly found their range and poured a withering ground fire into the formation. After the drop, the formation flew to Howard Air Force Base, Panama where the aircraft received hasty repairs and fuel before launching back to the United States. Many of the planes managed to make it to the coast before landing at commercial airports because of severe battle damage. The squadron continued to support Just Cause into 1990. As the last of the fighting wound down in Panama, the 40th deployed to England for its 60-day rotation to RAF Mildenhall. The squadron returned to Pope in June. =Desert Shield/Desert Storm= On 2 August 1990, the 40th placed its crews on alert. Iraq had just invaded Kuwait, one of the United States' strongest allies in the Middle East. Six days later, the squadron launched all sixteen airplanes, and every member of the squadron to the Middle East. On 9 August, the squadron landed at Masirah Air Base, Oman. Seventeen hours later the squadron launched its first mission in support of the American build up. For the first few weeks the squadron flew up to twenty-hour days carrying cargo throughout the Arabian Peninsula, living out of tents on the barren island of Masirah, known to the squadron as Moon Island. While the living conditions were miserable, and the missions long and tiring, the squadron never gave up. Everyone pulled together and achieved one great milestone after another making the C-130 the backbone of the war effort. Without it, the war could never have happened. While cargo poured into the theater by way of strategic air and sealift, it took the C-130 to distribute it to the troops. In January, the 40th took part in one of the great deceptions in military history. While the fighters and bombers distracted the Iraqis, the squadron's C-130s carried the 82nd Airborne Division from northeast Saudi Arabia across the Iraqi front line to land the soldiers in the northwest corner of Saudi Arabia. All of these mission were flown under strict radio silence, with no navigational aids. Aircraft flew along corridors, often with little or no visibility at the same altitude as other aircraft flying the return route. When the ground war began in February, the Iraqis found a division on their western flank they thought was in front of them. If not for the 40th, and the other C-130 squadrons, it could not have been done. =Humanitarian operations= When the squadron arrived home in March 1991, it was to rest. The rest lasted only a few months before it was again back into action, this time to Turkey, where Operation Provide Comfort, a massive humanitarian relief effort to the Kurds in northern Iraq, was taking place. Hard on the heels of that operation came Operation Authentic Assistance, aid to the Baltic Republics of Latvia and Lithuania, Operation Provide Transition, Angolan disarmament and election, then finally, Operation Provide Promise, the United Nations' relief operation to the former nation of Yugoslavia. The squadron flew into the former Yugoslavia from the summer of 1992 until its inactivation in July 1993. At first, the effort consisted of airland missions into Zagreb and the ravaged city of Sarajevo. After Serbian forces blocked relief convoys from entering U.N. safe areas, the squadron resorted to airdrops. The intense fighting forced the crews to reintroduce high-altitude AWADS airdrops, a procedure not used since Vietnam, and one which the Air Force had allowed to lapse because it was considered an irrelevant capability. Dyess AFB On 16 July 1993, the 40th was inactivated. With the United States' victory in the Cold War, the military began to demobilize. As part of this process, the squadron and its parent organization, the 317th Airlift Wing, were inactivated. At first it appeared that the 40th would be inactive for an indeterminate time, but the Air Force's senior leadership decided to move the squadron's designation to Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.

As is evident from this plot, the most densely instrumented portion of the globe is in the United States, while Antarctica is the most sparsely instrumented land area. Parts of the Pacific and other oceans are more isolated from fixed temperature stations, but this is supplemented by volunteer observing ships that record temperature information during their normal travels.

He was a member of the K√∂nigsberg Poetic Society (K√∂nigsberger Dichterkreis). As a song composer, he was strongly influenced by Heinrich Sch√ºtz. Biography Albert was born in Lobenstein, Principality of Reuss in Thuringia. He attended grammar school in Gera from 1619 to 1621 and studied music in 1622 with his cousin Heinrich Sch√ºtz in Dresden. Sch√ºtz introduced him to the basics of composition. Complying with his parents wishes, Albert enrolled in law at the University of Leipzig in 1623. There, he also continued his studies in music, probably with Johann Hermann Schein, a friend of Sch√ºtz, who worked as in Leipzig. In 1626, Albert tried to dodge the Thirty Years' War, going to K√∂nigsberg. In the following year, he traveled from K√∂nigsberg to Warsaw as a member of a Dutch parley delegation, but was taken captive by Swedish troops. He was released in 1628 and returned to K√∂nigsberg where he took up studies in defensive fortification. By 1630 he had returned to being a musician in K√∂nigsberg, and was appointed organist of the cathedral, where he served from 1 April 1631, until his premature death at the age of 47. His funeral was organized by the university, and the Latin obituary has so far been the principal source of information about his biography. Albert was a member of the K√∂nigsberg Poetic Society together with Simon Dach, Robert Roberthin, Georg Mylius, Martin Opitz, et al. The poets would convene at the K√ºrbish√ºtte, an arbor in Albert's garden, where the Linde dyke flows into the river Pregel. The council of Kneiphof had given the garden as a present to the organist in 1630. In his garden, Albert grew pumpkins and gourds, and the friends would carve their bucolic noms de plume into the gourds. It was here that Martin Opitz visited his friend Simon Dach in 1638.Herbert Meinhard M√ºhlpfordt: K√∂nigsberg von A bis Z ‚Äì ein Stadtlexikon. Leer 1972 The garden and the arbor, however, fell prey to then urban management that provided for housing on the Weidendamm area. A memorial stone to Albert has been erected in a copse in Bad Lobenstein. Works Anke van Tharaw, with music by Heinrich Albert In K√∂nigsberg, Albert composed for both the civic and academic communities. He furnished quite a few academic occasions with music, e.g., the centenary of the University of K√∂nigsberg in 1644. Numerous occasional compositions have survived that he penned for weddings and funerals, as well as homages to distinguished persons, and songs about nature, wine, and love. His most famous song probably is √Ñnnchen von Tharau with lyrics by Dach. Today the song is usually sung, though, to a melody by Friedrich Silcher. Some of his sacred songs are still part of German Protestant hymnals, e.g., Gott des Himmels und der Erden and Ich bin ja, Herr, in deiner Macht. K√∂nigsberg Cathedral In 1643 Albert renewed contact with Sch√ºtz.Baron He also studied with Johann Stob√§us (died 1646), Kapellmeister of cathedral and court. Stob√§us was a representative of the K√∂nigsberg school of composers, which includes composers from Johannes Eccard to Johann Sebastiani (ca. 1590‚Äì1690). Polyphonic five- part-writing was the rule that Albert obeyed as well. Quite a few of Albert's five-part songs, though, actually are expanded versions of solo songs. It was by means of these thorough-bass solo songs that he became popular. Albert set his own poetry and that of his friends to music and published them as scores in eight volumes, mainly, as from 1638, labelled Arien oder Melodeyen, totaling 170 songs. He provided these volumes with prefaces, offering detailed instructions for performance (he demanded e.g., that one should not play continuo \\"like hacking a cabbage\\". Beside these eight volumes, he published numerous occasional prints, which have so far not been completely registered in terms of bibliography. Endowed with a strong sense of his copyright, he tried to protect his compositions against pirated prints by means of privileges which he gained from the duke of Prussia and from the Polish king. The edition of Poetisch-musikalische Lustw√§ldlein of 1648 is one such pirated print of parts 1 to 6 of his Arien, although in a different order and with many errors. His tunes show French influence, subtly taking account of stresses and lengths of syllables and words, as well as Italian influence, expressing affects in terms of music, e.g., passion by means of melisma and coloratura. Albert also absorbed many typical Italian, German, and especially Polish dance rhythms. A number of his songs go beyond simple forms: some are structured like cantatas, with instrumental introduction, lyrics, through- composed for solo voice, and with a short coda for choir or instruments.

Post war she returned to civilian service as the US transatlantic liner SS Mount Clay. German civilian service The ship was a North German Lloyd (NDL) mail ship and ocean liner built by AG Vulcan, Stettin, Germany, and launched 18 June 1904 as . NDL had ordered her for the German Mail route between Germany and the Far East, for which she began her maiden voyage on 13 October. German auxiliary cruiser When the First World War broke out on 1 August 1914 she was in Shanghai, China and was ordered to Tsingtao in the then German Kiaochow Bay concession. There she was quickly converted to an auxiliary cruiser for the Imperial German Navy by transferring the guns and crews of the German gunboats and to Prinz Eitel Friedrich. For the next seven months she operated on the high seas with Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee's squadron off South American and then as a detached commerce raider. She sank or captured eleven ships in the Pacific and the South Atlantic. Among these was the schooner William P. Frye, captured on 27 January 1915 and scuttled the next day, the first U.S. flagged vessel sunk in World War I. On 11 March 1915 Prinz Eitel Friedrich, now low on supplies and burdened by over 300 prisoners, arrived at Newport News, Virginia. Allied warships were lying outside US waters and to avoid them she exceeded the time limit under international law for a combatant ship to remain in a neutral port. As a result, the US authorities interned her. Later she was moved, still under the German flag, to Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 11 April another NDL liner that had been operating as an auxiliary cruiser, , was interned alongside her. US troop ship When the United States entered the First World War in April 1917, US Customs officials seized her and she was transferred to the US Navy. She was reconditioned and refitted as a troop transport and renamed USS DeKalb after General Baron Johann de Kalb. She was commissioned 12 May 1917 with Commander W. R. Gherardi in command. DeKalb was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force, Atlantic Fleet, and on 14 June 1917 sailed in the convoy carrying the first troops of the American Expeditionary Forces to France. Unlike the other transports with Army troops embarked, DeKalb transported United States Marine Corps, 5th Regiment of Marines. In the next 18 months DeKalb made 11 such voyages, carrying 11,334 soldiers safely. Among these was the First Marine Aviation Force who flew the day wing bombers of the Northern Bombing Group. With the end of the war, DeKalb continued her transport duty returning 20,332 troops from Europe in eight voyages. On 6 September 1919 she was turned over to the Commandant, 3rd Naval District. United American Lines DeKalb was decommissioned 22 September 1919 and returned to the United States Shipping Board for disposal the following day. She returned to civilian control, initially as DeKalb and, after 1920, as Mount Clay. The ship was acquired by W. Averell Harriman and included with ten previous ships acquired from the Kerr Navigation Company in a name change so that all were prefixed with an American mountain and thus renamed Mount Clay. The ship was specially modified by Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company to be a third class only (described as \\"first class steerage\\") immigrant ship for the United American Line of New York. The ship was gutted by fire, which began early 15 December 1919, while on the Hudson River at Spuyten Duyvil. Lt. Cmdr. William A. Willetts and his crew were rescued by a tug, and it took fire boats several hours to quell the blaze.United Press, ‚ÄúTransport Is Gutted By Fire At Pier,‚Äù Riverside Daily Press, Riverside, California, Saturday evening 15 December 1919, Volume XXXIV, Number 297, page 1. During the rebuilding extensive tearing out of damaged decking, plating, and dismantling and rebuilding of deck structures was undertaken. The intent of the conversion was to carry the maximum passenger load while offering passengers better conditions than usually found on immigrant ships and \\"steerage\\" class. The passenger spaces were to be well ventilated with forced draft air flow, more deck space allocated to passengers and larger and more attractive public rooms provided. Passenger accommodation was in two to six person cabins that included luxuries not usually found in such ships that included washstands, mattresses and linens. A kosher abattoir and galley was furnished for the ship's Jewish passengers. Due to a capacity of 1,452 passengers and crew of 211, special attention had to be focused on life boats. Fourteen sets of Welin davits were fitted to each side with a variety of lifeboats and some rafts with a capacity for 1,663 persons, 1,613 in boats. In February 1921 Mount Clay inaugurated a new first class mail delivery system for mail to Germany in which mail planes would meet the ship at Cuxhaven for transfer of special bags for air delivery within Germany. On 9 February 1921 Mount Clay stood by and rescued the crew and ship's cat from the sinking freighter Bombardier about four hundred miles southeast of Halifax. The sinking ship's radio operator, Edward Herno, had worked hours to make repairs and get the SOS out as the wireless had been severely damaged in the storm and wreck. All but two of Bombardier's lifeboats had been destroyed so one of the Mount Clay boats launched to assist. Mount Clay made the initial voyage as an immigrant ship on Christmas Day 1920 (Marine Review) or 26 December (DANFS). The ship's last westbound voyage was from Hamburg via Queenstown, Ireland to New York on 15 October 1925. She was then laid up until 1934 when she was scrapped.

He also developed the use of meat science as a career, including the charter of the American Meat Science Association, both at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and at Oregon State University. Education and career A native of Wisconsin, Briskey earned his BS degree from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1952 in meat and animal science, then earned his MS in animal science from the Ohio State University in 1955. Briskey finally earned his Ph.D. from Wisconsin in biochemistry and meat and animal science in 1958. After earning his Ph.D, Briskey then joined the faculty of meat and animal science department at Wisconsin where he would work his way up to professor rank and became director of the Institute of Muscle Biology. In 1970, Briskey left Wisconsin to become Vice President, Technical and Administration at Campbell Soup in Camden, New Jersey, a position he would hold until he became Dean of Agricultural Science at Oregon State University from 1979 to 1987. Briskey would step down as Dean in 1987, but would remain as a professor in the animal science department until his 1998 retirement. While as a dean at Oregon State, Briskey worked with the United States Department of State in both Thailand (1984‚Äì86) and Kuwait (1986‚Äì88) as a science advisor. Following retirement, Briskey would retire back to Waunakee, Wisconsin.  Research involvement  Briskey would be involved in studies of meat processing involving muscle biology, which is what changes are involved in slaughterhouse operations that change the meat into what consumers want. Two terms were developed by Briskey that are used in the meat industry about problems that would occur during slaughter and they are shown below: * DFD (Dark, film, and dry): This results from meat that has a pH higher than normal. A dead carcass of meat is a dark cutter and is caused by animal stresses prior to slaughter.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica's definition of DFD meat. - Accessed November 18, 2006. * PSE (Pale, soft, and exudative): This results from meat that has a pH lower than normal. If meat comes out at high temperature and low pH, it will be soft and mushy from their inability to retain water, and results in light reflecting off the meat's surface.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica's definition of PSE meat. - Accessed November 18, 2006.  Professional involvement  Briskey's research and involvement would be important in establishing the American Meat Science Association, where he would earn their research award in 1966 and their service award in 1978. He was also an active member of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) where he won the Samuel Cate Prescott Award in 1965, the Nicholas Appert Award in 1975, and a Fellow in 1977. Briskey also served as scientific editor of the Journal of Food Science in 1970-71 and as IFT President in 1975-76.

John Fogerty explained how the song lyrics were derived. ‚Äú[I] was kind of inspired by seeing an advertisement in the paper one day,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was an ad from Disney that said in great big letters ‚ÄòWinnie the Pooh‚Äô. Something in my brain said ‚ÄòWinnie the Pooh and the Pooh Boys‚Äô. Obviously that was close to ‚ÄòWilly and the Poor Boys‚Äô. As I began to develop this idea it turned into music in that weird mystical, almost uncontrollable way, music comes to songwriters. Winnie the Pooh is still my favorite character who I‚Äôve shared with my daughter Kelsy since the day she was born, though she‚Äôs growing out of it. But I‚Äôm not.‚Äù The song makes reference to a washboard, a kazoo, a Kalamazoo guitar, and a gut bass. In a 1969 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, the band performed the song as Willy and the Poor Boys.

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler. Life and career Taylor was present at Yorkshire County Cricket Club for eight seasons, and, although his first-team playing time was limited, he saw plenty of action in the Second XI. Taylor broke through into the first team and made his debut in the County Championship winning season of 2001. His opportunities were limited, although he impressed in the first XI, most notably in 2004, but soon found himself back in the Second XI after he was replaced by Joe Sayers and Andrew Gale. In November 2006, Taylor signed for Derbyshire on a two-year contract, and, within a month of the start of the season, Taylor had hit two centuries, one against Glamorgan and the other against his old club, Yorkshire, in a match winning innings at Headingley. Taylor became the first Derbyshire cricketer in their history to score a century on his first-class and one day debuts for the club. At the end of his first season at Derbyshire, Taylor had made five first-class centuries, was named one day player of the year, and finished second in the National One Day averages second to Darren Lehmann. Despite an improved further two-year contract, Taylor asked to be released from Derbyshire at the end of the 2007 season, leaving the club with immediate effect. Tom Sears, the county's chief executive, called his decision \\"very disappointing\\". On 17 September 2007, he was re-signed by Yorkshire on a three-year contract. Taylor was hampered with a hamstring injury for most of his first season, but on his first appearance of the season he struck a six off the last ball to win the Twenty20 match against Leicestershire. Despite consistent performances in Yorkshire's Second XI, Taylor found no opportunity in the first team. At the end of the 2009 season, Taylor decided to call time on his career in a mutual decision with Yorkshire. He finished his career with five first-class centuries to his name, a County Championship winners medal, and scoring twenty five Second XI hundreds. Taylor with his business partner, Andrew Gale, ran the Pro Coach Cricket Academy across the UK, providing expert cricket coaching for young cricketers by current and former professional cricketers. However in 2014 Taylor sold his stake in the company to focus on other business ventures. Taylor currently plays for Lightcliffe C.C.Lightcliffecricketclub.co.uk In the 2010 season, he finished top of the batting averages for the Bradford Cricket League for the fourth time. He also became the quickest player to a 1,000 league runs in the history of the Bradford League taking only fourteen innings. He finished the season with 1,436 runs at an average of 95.70, to become the highest scorer in the history of Lightcliffe C.C. surpassing the Indian Test player, Mohammed Kaif. In 2011, Taylor, set up the All Rounder Cricket Store, opposite the Headingley ground. All Rounder has rapidly grown to become one of the leading cricket and hockey equipment retailers in the UK. In 2015 All Rounder Cricket opened its second store based in Sheffield.

The organization is a member of the League of American Orchestras. History Standing ovation for San Antonio Symphony and violin virtuoso Midori Goto, Sep 28, 2007. Orchestral music in San Antonio traces its beginnings to a series of four concerts by a 49-piece orchestra directed by German immigrant Carl Beck at the state S√§ngerfest in 1887. A performance of the Symphony No. 4 by Felix Mendelssohn in these concerts was the first of a complete symphony in the state of Texas. Beck again conducted a symphony orchestra when the S√§ngerfest returned to San Antonio in 1896. Beck was engaged as the director of the Beethoven M√§nnerchor in San Antonio, then succeeded in that role by Carl Hahn in about 1904. Hahn worked with Anna Goodman Hertzberg, a leading local musician and arts patron, to create the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra, which gave its first concert on May 18, 1905. The orchestra performed sporadically for the next several years but was revived in 1914 (as the \\"San Antonio Philharmonic\\") by a new conductor, Arthur Claassen. By 1916, the ensemble was again called the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra. By 1918 it was under the musical direction of Julien Paul Blitz. Concerts continued into the 1920s, but this organization appears ultimately to have foundered. The present San Antonio Symphony, an organization independent of the aforementioned predecessors, was created in 1939 by Max Reiter, a German-Italian immigrant, who became its first Music Director. The group's early ambition is evidenced by the fact that the legendary violinist Jascha Heifetz was a guest artist during the first season. By 1943, the orchestra employed 75 professional musicians, and in the 1944-1945 season the organization's budget topped $100,000, making it one of only 19 \\"major\\" orchestras in the country at that time, and the only one in Texas. Unlike many orchestras, the San Antonio Symphony was able to continue operations through World War II--largely because the city's strong military presence helped bolster the local economy. Before his death in 1950, Reiter had started an Opera Festival, created an Opera Chorus, and brought nationwide attention to the orchestra, with world premieres by several important composers, guest appearances by world-class artists, and overall high musical quality. Reiter was succeeded by Victor Alessandro, a native Texan. The Symphony continued to grow in scope, including the addition of Young People's Concerts. In 1969 the orchestra took up residence in the Theater for the Performing Arts (which would later be renamed the Lila Cockrell Theatre after a San Antonio mayor). In 1967 the orchestra made its first major-label recordings, for Mercury Records. Alessandro died in 1976. A complete chronological list of San Antonio Symphony Music Directors is shown below. Financial difficulties forced the cancellation of much of the 1987-1988 season. During this time, the musicians formed and presented a concert series with their own organization, Orchestra San Antonio. Later, the 2003-2004 season would likewise be cancelled due to bankruptcy. The 1990s were highlighted by recognition and acclaim for the San Antonio Symphony's creative and culturally diverse programming, culminating in awards by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), American Symphony Orchestra League (ASOL), the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), and the Knight Foundation. Due to decisions made in the wake of recent financial difficulties, the San Antonio Symphony currently performs a shorter season and with a slightly smaller musician complement than in some previous years, but it continues to be highly regarded artistically. In the early part of the 2006‚Äì2007 season, CEO David Green and the executive board chose not to renew Music Director Larry Rachleff's contract beyond the 2007‚Äì2008 season. This decision was opposed by a majority of the musicians and by many San Antonio Symphony supporters. In January 2008, Christopher Seaman was appointed Artistic Adviser, a \\"position . . . similar to that of an interim music director\\" for the 2008-2009 season.\\"S.A.

History The first military prisons were established in 1844. The term Glasshouse originated from the Aldershot military prison, Aldershot, which had a glazed roof. Over time, the word glasshouse came to be applied to all military prisons. Aldershot military prison, which was also called the Detention Barracks, had begun as several barracks in 1856, before being replaced by a single, large building, modelled on the then civilian prison system in 1870. This building was destroyed by fire in a riot of 1946 when the prisoners (labeled as 'mutineers' in the press) were protesting about their rations and conditions given that the Second World War was over. Glasshouses gained a reputation for brutality, as depicted in Allan Campbell McLean's novel The Glass House and the Sean Connery film The Hill. Today, the British Army has only one remaining correction facility, the Military Corrective Training Centre (MCTC) at Colchester. Whilst the MCTC is not a prison, it is inspected by the Justice Inspectorate and any serviceperson convicted of a crime that warrants a prison sentence, will be sent to the MCTC for processing, before being sent to a civilian prison. The MCTC at Colchester was featured in a Channel 4 documentary in 1994 (The Glasshouse) which prompted an early day motion in the House of Commons over the inmates having access to ammunition and weapons (as part of normal military drill.) This was because the government at the time, were seeking to use the MCTC as a model for youth custody in civilian prisons.

History BBC West launched a regional television service from Bristol in September 1957. Initially broadcast from the Wenvoe transmitter on the outskirts of Cardiff, the geographical nature of the Wenvoe signal meant the first regional news bulletins were broadcast to both Wales and the West of England, sharing a ten- minute timeslot with News from Wales. Until December 1960, news bulletins from Bristol also served the south coast of England, which latterly received its own regional programme. The weekday timeslot for regional news extended to 25 minutes in September 1962 ‚Äì around this time, the West of England bulletin became known as Points West while the Welsh bulletins received a more comprehensive relaunch as BBC Wales Today. The opening of a second signal from Wenvoe in February 1964 finally allowed the split of BBC television in Wales and the West. A separate BBC Wales channel was launched while BBC West became a full regional opt-out service to the extent seen in other English regions, with Points West becoming a full-length programme. Points West continued until 1991, when the service was renamed BBC News West. The Points West brand was revived on Monday 22 May 2000 with the launch of the BBC's generic regional news graphics and presentation. Studios BBC West's Bristol headquarters BBC West's regional broadcasting centre is located on Whiteladies Road in the Clifton area of Bristol with local radio studios and television bureaux also in Bath, Gloucester, Swindon and Taunton. The Bristol studios are the main base for Points West, BBC Radio Bristol and various regional and, previously, network programmes. Network output is now made at other specially built facilities or does not use a studio. The site originally had two studios, A and B, which catered for all output - network programming was produced from Studio A and Points West and other regional output from Studio B. Studio A was closed in 1991 as a cost-saving measure, and in 1996 the site was altered so that new gallery facilities were inserted into part of Studio A.

A frequent trait of larger environmental sculptures is that one can actually enter or pass through the sculpture and be partially or completely surrounded by it. Also, in the same spirit, it may be designed to generate shadows or reflections, or to color the light in the surrounding area.Britannica Online: \\"20th-century art form intended to involve or encompass the spectators rather than merely to face them; the form developed as part of a larger artistic current that sought to break down the historical dichotomy between life and art.\\"  Sculpture as environment  Eberhard Bosslet construction drawing La Restinga II, El Hierro, 1983 Julia M. Bush emphasizes the nonfigurative aspect of such works: \\"Environmental sculpture is never made to work at exactly human scale, but is sufficiently larger or smaller than scale to avoid confusion with the human image in the eyes of the viewer.\\"(Busch, p. 27).\\"A Decade of Sculpture: the New Media in the 1960s\\" (1974) Ukrainian-born American sculptor Louise Nevelson is a pioneer of environmental sculpture in this sense. Busch (p. 27) also places the sculptures of Jane Frank, as well as some works by Tony Smith and David Smith, in this category. Some environmental sculpture so encompasses the observer that it verges on architecture. George Segal, Duane Hanson, Edward Kienholz, Robert Smithson, Christo, and Michael Heizer are well known practitioners of the genre, although Segal and Hanson's work is figural. Many figurative works of George Segal, for example, do qualify as environmental, in that‚Äîinstead of being displayed on a pedestal as presentations to be gazed upon‚Äîthey occupy and perturb the setting in which they are placed. A well known instance of this is the pair of Segal figures that sit on and stand next to one of the public benches in New York City's Sheridan Square; anyone can sit amongst them. A less known but more appropriate example is Athena Tacha's park Connections in downtown Philadelphia (between 18th St. and 19th St. two blocks north of Vine St.), created as a landscape art environment after her winning a competition in 1980 (where Segal was actually one of the finalists). It was the first park designed entirely by an artist \\"sculpting the land\\" with planted terraces, rock clusters and paths (completed in 1992). Sculpture created for an environment Lumen Poem, by Jean-Max Albert, 1985 A second sense of the term \\"environmental sculpture\\", with a somewhat different emphasis, is sculpture created for a particular set of surroundings. Thus, contemporary sculptor Beth Galston writes: \\"An environmental sculptor plans a piece from the very beginning in relationship to its surroundings. The site is a catalyst, becoming part of the creative process.\\"http://www.bethgalston.com/environmental-art This is quite different from a Nevelson sculpture, which can usually be moved from place to place, like a conventional sculpture, without losing its meaning and effectiveness. By Galston's definition, an environmental sculpture is not merely site- specific art as many conventional, figurative, marble monuments were created for specific sites. Galston stresses that environmental sculpture entails the idea that the piece also functions to alter or permeate the existing environment or even to create a new environment in which the viewer is invited to participate: \\"The finished sculpture and site become one integrated unit, working together to create a unified mood or atmosphere,\\" she writes. Many of the large, site-specific, minimalist sculptures of Richard Serra also qualify as environmental sculpture, in both senses described here. Much of what is called \\"land art\\" or \\"earth art\\" could also be termed environmental sculpture under this definition. Andrew Rogers and Alan Sonfist (which see) are among notable current practitioners of land art. Since the mid-seventies, French artist Jean-Max Albert worked with trellis structures, deconstructing and re- arranging the elements of surrounding architecture or including the site into the sculptureBruno Suner,Les sculptures de vis√©es du Parc de La Villette, Urbanisme no 215, 1986 with Sculptures Bachelard. Since 1983 German artist Eberhard Bosslet makes interventions on ruins, so-called \\"Re/formations and side effects\\"; he refers to the conditions of industrial and residential buildings by white painted lines or black painted color fields. In 1999 the artist Elena Paroucheva created her concept for pylons, integrating energy networks with sculptures.http://www.art-elena.com/ Site-specific art and environmental art Spiral Jetty by Robert Smithson from atop Rozel Point, in mid-April 2005 The term \\"site-specific art\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"environmental art\\". Louise Nevelson, for instance is a pioneer American environmental artist with sources disagreeing on classifying her work as \\"environmental sculpture\\". The terms \\"environment sculpture\\", \\"site-specific art\\", and \\"environmental art\\" have not yet completely stabilized in their meanings. A reason for blurred definitions is that much of site-specific and environmental art was created from 1970 on for public spaces all over the United States, sponsored by federal (GSA and NEA) or state and city Percent for Art competitions, and many of the artists were women trying to succeed outside the established art-gallery world. Younger art historians will have to sort out the development of this marginalized \\"movement\\" and the importance of artists such as Olga Kisseleva, Patricia Johanson, Athena Tacha, Mary Miss, Alice Adams, Elyn Zimmerman, Merle Temkin and others who, from the early 1970s on, won and executed large outdoor public art commissions with new formal, kinesthetic and social underpinnings. Many of these artists were also ecologically conscious and created works that could offer a further definition of \\"environmental sculpture\\": art that is environmentally friendly and cares for the natural environment.

Wyndham Meredith Manning (1890‚Äì1967) was a South Carolina politician. Manning served in the South Carolina House of Representatives and was appointed Superintendent of the state's prison system by then Governor Strom Thurmond in 1947, serving in that position until his retirement in 1962. Manning's father, Richard Irvine Manning III and his great-grandfather, Richard Irvine Manning I had previously served as Governors of South Carolina, but Wyndham Meredith Manning lost three gubernatorial elections and never achieved his dream of following in their footsteps. Early Life and Military Career Manning was born in 1890 on a farm near Wedgefield in Sumter County, South Carolina. He was one of thirteen children of Richard Irvine Manning III and Leila B. Meredith. Manning entered the United States Military Academy (also known as West Point) in 1907. He graduated in 1913 and was subsequently commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. One year later, Manning resigned from the Army and became a teacher in Berkeley County. Manning's teaching career was interrupted by the U.S.-Mexican War, and he left for Texas in June, 1916 as commander of the Charleston Light Dragoon, a National Guard unit. Following his return from Texas, Manning served briefly as Commandant of Cadets at the Porter Military Academy (now the Porter-Gaud School), before leaving to serve as an artillery officer in World War I. Manning served with the 316th Field Artillery in France and was promoted all the way to Lieutenant Colonel before returning to South Carolina in 1919. He worked as a farmer and businessman until beginning his political career in 1930. Political career Manning was elected to fill a vacant seat in the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1930 and reelected in 1932 and 1934. During his tenure in the State House, Manning served on the powerful Ways and Means Committee and sponsored a variety of bills. In the 1934 gubernatorial election, Manning placed third in the Democratic primary, losing to Olin D. Johnston and Coleman Livingston Blease. Since Democrats dominated politics in the South during that time period, victory in the primary meant certain victory in the general election. Manning did not return to the legislature after his first defeat, but instead returned to farming and made a second attempt at the governorship in the 1938 election. This time, he fared better, defeating Blease and placing second to Burnet Rhett Maybank with a strong enough result to qualify for the runoff, which he lost by less than 15,000 votes. Again, Manning again returned to farming, but decided to run a third time in 1942 election, facing off against his old opponent, Olin Johnston. Manning lost by less than 4%. Although Manning would never again run for political office, he continued his career as a public servant for another 20 years. During World War II, Manning was placed in charge of the 8,000 prisoners-of-war held in camps at Fort Jackson. In 1947, Manning was appointed head of the South Carolina prison system, and he served in that position until his retirement in 1962. Wyndham Meredith Manning died in 1967 at the age of 77.

Description The M21 is based on the AK-47 Kalashnikov principle, chambered in the 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge. The current models use a 1.5mm thick stamped receiver, while a future model will feature an improved receiver of 0.9mm thickness to achieve a considerably lighter weight. Like many modern assault rifles, the M21 can incorporate picatinny rails for mounting accessories like optics, vertical grips, bipods, etc. The Zastava M21 is gas operated with a rotating bolt locking system. It features a hard chromium-plated, cold forged standard rifled or an optional polygonal rifled barrel, integrated 22mm flash hider grenade launcher, and, much like the AK-74M, heavy-duty synthetic furniture with rigid polymer folding stock and side optics rail as standard (optional adapter base for cover mounted picatinny rail also available). The rifle can also mount a 40mm under-barrel grenade launcher. It has a magazine capacity of 30 rounds. The cyclic rate of fire is 680 rounds per minute, and the sustained rate of fire is 120 rounds/min. The Zastava M21 uses a conventional barrel, while the Zastava M21B uses a polygonal barrel. The regular barrel has six grooves with a right-hand twist. An octagonal polygonal version is also available and has four grooves with a right-hand twist (M21B). Barrels are also hard chrome plated to provide a longer service life. The rifle has conventional iron sights that consist of a front post and a flip-up rear sight with 300m and 500m apertures. However, much like the RK 62 and IMI Galil, the front and rear sight have been relocated to the gas block and top cover respectably. It also borrowed the Galil's thumb safety. The top cover is hinged like the AKS-74U. A set of picatinny rails on the hand guard can mount various optoelectronic devices. The M21 is a modular weapon, with configuration dependent on the task and mission. Choices of optical sights include \\"TELEOPTIK\\" (ON M04) and \\"ZRAK\\" (ON M04A). Optoelectronic devices include a reflex sight (\\"MARS\\" M04), two bookmark target lasers (\\"AIM2000\\" M04A and \\"INFIZ\\" M04), two passive monoculars (M04 MINI N/SEAS and \\"MARS\\" M04+MINI N/SEAS), passive sight (\\"SOVA\\" PN 3x50).

Originally she retained her previous name of Scindia, and was renamed for the mythical Ajax in 1901. In 1921, she became a receiving ship and was redesignated AC-14. She was reclassified as a seaplane tender and given the hull designator AG-15 in 1924. The screw steamer Scindia was a steel-hulled freighter built in 1890 by D & W Henderson Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland. Purchased on 12 May 1898‚Äîthree weeks after the opening of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War‚Äîby the U.S. Navy at New York. She was fitted out at the New York Navy Yard for service as a collier, and was placed in commission there on 21 May 1898, Commander Eugene W. Watson in command. Service history =Scindia, 1898‚Äì1901= Following a round-trip voyage carrying coal from New York to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba from 2 June ‚Äì 1 July 1898, the ship departed New York on 12 October with a cargo of coal for the Hawaiian Islands. She made a number of goodwill calls en route‚Äîboth before and after rounding Cape Horn‚Äîand delivered her cargo at Honolulu. Scindia then headed east for the California coast and, after reaching San Francisco Bay early in the spring of 1899, was surveyed at the Mare Island Navy Yard and decommissioned there on 27 May for repairs to her boilers and machinery. Recommissioned on 23 December 1899, the collier got underway on 18 January 1900 and headed westward across the Pacific and proceeded via Guam to the newly acquired Philippine Islands laden with coal for the ships of the Asiatic Fleet. After unloading at Manila, she transited the Strait of Malacca, crossed the Indian Ocean, and continued on via the Suez Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar to Cardiff, Wales, where she filled her bunkers with coal before crossing the Atlantic to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 1 March 1901. During her first circumnavigation of Earth, the steamer was renamed Ajax on 1 January 1901. She was decommissioned on 16 March. =Ajax, 1901‚Äì1909= Reactivated on 16 October 1901, the ship made two more round-the-world voyages carrying coal to the Asiatic Station and then returned to the Philippines in September 1903 for operations with the Asiatic Fleet through the end of 1904. She then returned to the east coast of the United States along which she operated until placed out of service at Norfolk on 4 November 1905. Reactivated on 20 January 1907, Ajax again served along the east coast until departing Hampton Roads in December of that year to support the cruise of the Great White Fleet around the world to demonstrate the good will of the United States and to make known to any potential enemy the power of the U.S. Navy. She returned to Norfolk on Washington's Birthday in 1909 and, after serving the Atlantic Fleet through the spring, was placed out of service at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in June. =1910‚Äì1920= Laid up until 30 April 1910, he put in over two more years supporting the Atlantic Fleet along the coast and in the Caribbean Sea before she was ordered to the Orient for the last time. In December 1912, she took on a cargo of coal at Hampton Roads and loaded the submarines and on her decks before sailing via the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the Suez Canal, and the Indian Ocean to the Philippine Islands. She arrived in Manila Bay on 30 April 1913, and‚Äîafter launching her two submarines‚Äîbegan shuttling coal to American warships at ports in such placed as Guam, the Philippines, China, Japan, and even Burma. Soon after the United States entered the World War I, she towed the formerly interned German ship Elsass from Samoa to Honolulu, Hawaii. During the American intervention in Siberia at the end of World War I, she made deliveries to Vladivostok. =1921‚Äì1925= The ship was laid up at the Cavite Navy Yard from 20 April-17 October 1921 and then became the receiving ship there for the 16th Naval District and was redesignated AC-14. During this period, she served briefly in 1923 as tender to the submarines of Submarine Division 18 (SubDiv 18), Asiatic Fleet, and was based at Chefoo, China. After resuming her role as receiving ship at Cavite in September 1923, Ajax became the tender for the seaplanes of the Asiatic Fleet aircraft squadrons in February 1924. On 24 June, naval aviator Commander Albert C. Read assumed command of both Ajax and the aircraft squadrons. On 1 July, she was reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary and redesignated AG-15. Relieved of all duty in June 1925 after the arrival of in the Philippines, she was decommissioned on 8 July 1925 and her name was simultaneously stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. The former Ajax was sold at the Cavite Navy Yard to S. R. Paterno on 14 August. S.R. Paterno was apparently a broker or agent for Madrigal as the ship was sold to Madrigal & Co, Manila, one of the larger Philippine shipowners, and renamed \\"Consuelo\\" and used in the interisland trade. In 1930 the ship was sold to Fernando Go Chioco of Amoy and renamed \\"Hua Tong\\". In 1932 the ship was sold (or transferred) to the newly established Singapore company Hua Khiow Steamship Co (1932) Ltd and in November 1933 the ship was scrapped in China.Lloyds Register, various years References * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive: Collier Scindia / AC-14 / AG-15 Ajax Category:Colliers of the United States Navy Category:World War I auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1890 ships ","title":"USS Ajax (AG-15)"},{"id":"8021251","text":"{ +RMS Viceroy of India } RMS Viceroy of India was an ocean liner of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O;).

She was sunk in the Mediterranean in November 1942 by . Building Viceroy of Indias indoor swimming pool P&O; ordered the ship from Alexander Stephen and Sons of Glasgow in 1927. She was originally to be called Taj Mahal, after the 17th- century mausoleum of Mumtaz Mahal in Agra. She was laid down in April 1927, launched in September 1928 and completed in March 1929. She cost ¬£1,090,987 She had six water-tube boilers with a combined heating surface of that supplied steam at 400 lbf/in2 to two turbo generators. These supplied current to electric motors with a combined rating of 3,565 NHP that drove twin screw propellers. British Thomson-Houston (BT-H) of Rugby, Warwickshire built the turbo-generators and motors. Each turbo-generator ran at 2,690‚Äì3,110 RPM, producing three-phase current at 2,720 volts and rated at 900 kW. Each propeller shaft was driven by two three-phase 3,150 volt electric motors running at 109 RPM and giving per shaft. At reduced power of up to only one turbo-generator was needed to supply current to both motors, thus maximising fuel economy. Variation of propeller speed in either direction was achieved by changing the turbine speed. The accommodation aboard was considered luxurious by the standards of the era. The first class staterooms were especially so, but standards were high in all classes on this ship. All cabins were single berth with interconnecting doors, with extra rooms for servants who often travelled with colonial families. Her onboard amenities also included the then unusual luxury of an indoor swimming pool. Much of the interior decoration was designed by the Honourable Elsie Mackay, youngest daughter of James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape, who was the chairman of P&O; from 1914 until his death in 1932. Viceroy of India carried cargo as well as passengers, and her holds were refrigerated for carrying perishables. Launch and commissioning The ship was launched as Viceroy of India on 15 September 1928 by Dorothy, Countess of Halifax, the wife of the Viceroy of India, E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax. The name had been changed to avoid offending Indians, particularly Muslims, for whom the Taj Mahal mausoleum is sacred. Fitting out at Shieldhall Wharf, Glasgow, began on 8 January 1929. Viceroy of India was finished in P&O;'s traditional colours: her hull black with a white band, her boot topping red, her upper works and lifeboats buff, her large vents black, her small vents buff and her two funnels black. During fitting out she was damaged amidships by Donaldson South American Line's cargo ship , which was trying to dock in poor visibility. However, by 17 February Viceroy of India was ready for sea trials, on which she averaged . She was completed in March 1929. P&O; turbo-electric ships Viceroy of India was Britain's first large turbo-electric passenger ship. At about the same time as she was built, P&O; also had s performance increased by the addition of BT-H turbo generators and propulsion motors to supplement her quadruple-expansion engines. P&Os; first experiences of turbo-electric propulsion led the company to specify the same form of transmission for a pair of liners that it ordered in 1930: (completed in 1931) and (completed in 1932). Each \\"Strath\\" was only about bigger than Viceroy of India but they produced about 77% more power, which made them about faster than Viceroy of India.

Viceroy of India, during civilian service (1935) Viceroy of India was handed over to P&O; on 7 March 1929 and made her maiden voyage on the Indian mail route. Viceroy of India was also suited for leisure cruises, which she made every year until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. On 9 August 1929, she collided with the tug at Venice, Italy; Olanda was beached after the collision. On 23 November 1929 Viceroy of India rescued 25 crew members from the Italian cargo steamer which sank in the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Egypt. In February 1930 Viceroy of India was berthed in Bombay when the British India Line ship collided with her. The collision pushed the liner against a dockside crane, which she demolished. Viceroy of India herself escaped serious damage. Later in 1930 Viceroy of India twice assisted the Greek cargo steamer in the Bay of Biscay. In September she stood by when Theodoros Bulgaris cargo of grain shifted in storms and the Greek merchantman's crew were transferred to another vessel. On 31 December 1930 Theodoros Bulgararis sank and Viceroy of India rescued all of the crew. In September 1932, Viceroy of India set a new record time between London and Bombay of 17 days, 1 hour, 42 minutes. On 5 September 1935 the Cunard White Star liner and the Chargeurs R√©unis cargo ship collided off Cape Finisterre. Doric stayed afloat but her 736 passengers were transferred to other ships as a precaution; 241 of them were transferred to Viceroy of India. In February 1939, Viceroy of India cruised to the South Atlantic, where she became the first P&O; liner to visit the island of Tristan da Cunha. On 11 August 1940 the Shaw, Savill & Albion liner and Bank Line cargo liner collided in the South Atlantic off Walvis Bay. Both ships stayed afloat but Ceramic‚Ä≤s 279 passengers were transferred to Viceroy of India as a precaution. War service and sinking After torpedoed Viceroy of India towed the troopship, and when Viceroy sank the destroyer rescued 450 people On 12 November 1940 the Ministry of War Transport requisitioned Viceroy of India to be a troopship. She returned to the River Clyde for the conversion. In 1942 Viceroy of India sailed in Convoy KMF-1A carrying Allied troops from Britain to invade French North Africa in Operation Torch. Early on 11 November 1942 she was returning empty from Algiers bound for Gibraltar. At 0524 hrs she was about northwest of Oran when fired a spread of four torpedoes at her. Two hit the ship, killing four crew members. At 0531 hrs U-407 fired a stern-tube torpedo at her but missed.

Throughout most of the series, Creed has the most seniority and is the oldest at the Scranton branch. =Origins= Although not much is known of Creed's origins as a child, he claimed to have been born in the United States and having a Swiss passport in the episode Lotto and recalls being born on November 1st numerous times. In The Injury, Creed mentioned being in an Iron Lung as a child. In Finale, manager Dwight Schrute mentions how Creed was in the band the Grass Roots in the 60s, as well as how he sold drugs, trafficked endangered species meat, and stole weapons grade LSD from the military. =Dunder Mifflin= Creed was never actually hired, but walked in one day, and acted like he worked there and has been going in every day since then. He now serves as the quality assurance manager. Creed can be counted on to shirk nearly all responsibility, ranging from informal office duties such as spring cleaningEpisode \\"The Secret\\". to his primary job responsibilities.Episode \\"Product Recall\\". =Personal life= Creed teeters on the edge of homelessness and has professed his willingness to do whatever it takes to avoid becoming homeless again. He lives in Toronto, spending three nights a week there in order to milk the welfare state, and surreptitiously sleeps under his desk the remainder of the week.Episode \\"The Coup,\\" deleted scene. In another episode, he reveals to Jim that he lives in Scranton near \\"the quarry\\" and invites Jim to \\"throw things down there\\" with him, to which Jim answers, in a somewhat sarcastic way, \\"Definitely we should\\". Creed was additionally briefly romantically involved with Meredith Palmer.Episode \\"The Manager and the Salesman.\\" =Lack of morals= Creed appears not to be bound by moral guidelines, exhibited most notably by his kleptomania. The episode \\"Casino Night\\" provides the first glimpse into this side of Creed's personality. He steals gambling chips in order to win the evening's prize and admits in a talking head interview, \\"I love stealing things\\" and \\"Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago.\\" Once revealed, his kleptomania returns in subsequent episodes, either explicitly or implicitly. For example, he takes a toy from a toy drive drop boxEpisode \\"A Benihana Christmas\\". and returns $40 to Michael; when Michael says that he didn't give Creed the money, Creed tells him, \\"In a way, you did,\\" implying that he stole it from Michael.Episode \\"The Negotiation\\". He has been caught stealing at least twice by Jim. In the episode titled \\"Local Ad,\\" Jim buys breakfast for Pam because she slept at her desk all night. When she wakes, Jim explains that Creed snatched her hash browns while she was asleep on her keyboard. Creed's lack of shame or morals extends beyond mere kleptomania. He places his wedding card on another guest's gift,Episode \\"Phyllis' Wedding\\". and blatantly stares at Pam's chest when she wears a low-cut sweater. When she asks him to stop, he serenely says, \\"In a minute.\\"Episode \\"The Coup\\". In a deleted scene, Creed says that he has a friend named Jorge who will hook Toby up with anything he wants, including \\"this amazing coffee that you snort\\". Creed also was seen searching through Pam's desk in Season 4, episode 2. When it appears that the branch will be closing in \\"The Merger,\\" Creed lists all of the office equipment on Craigslist and can be seen throughout the episode selling printers and computers illegally. Upon learning that the branch will not be closing, he uses the money to buy the staff drinks. In \\"Product Recall,\\" he not only engineers the firing of a blameless employee to cover for his mistake, but he sends around a sympathy card for her and then pockets all of the cash in it, throwing the card in the trash. Creed believes that his blog URL is www.creedthoughts.gov.www\\\\creedthoughts, but his \\"blog\\" is actually a Word document with the title expressly chosen to look like a URL, set up by Ryan Howard, wanting to \\"protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain\\". Describing the content of the blog, Ryan says, \\"Even for the Internet, it's pretty shocking.\\" NBC provided the character with an actual blog. =Seasons 1‚Äì2= Creed can be seen in the background and in group scenes in the first season, but no storylines developed around him. In ‚ÄúHealthcare‚Äù the actor Creed Bratton is the man Michael talks to on the phone while looking into planning an office trip to the coal mine, although the character Creed is not referenced in the scene.Season 1 In \\"Halloween,\\" Michael Scott is ordered to fire someone and he considers Creed (who is dressed as a vampire), but Creed fights back and suggests Devon instead, and Devon is fired. Later in the season, it is revealed that Creed has four toes on his feet and enjoys arcade- style shooting games. In \\"The Injury\\" he reveals to Michael that he spent some time in an iron lung when he was a teenager. In a deleted scene from \\"Christmas Party,\\" Creed reveals to Oscar Martinez that he was \\"Wacky Weed Creed,\\" a radio DJ, during the 1970s. Oscar declares in a talking head interview \\"that Creed is a very interesting guy to talk to.\\" In a deleted scene from \\"Booze Cruise,\\" he takes an electric guitar from a failing Michael and performs a blues hit to an enthusiastic reception. He then reveals that he was once a member of The Grass Roots and, as a result of drug abuse, cannot concentrate for longer than 90 seconds. He speaks simple Mandarin and has friends in China, possibly Huadu. He can identify strains of cannabis in high- resolution photographs. He snacks on nutritious mung bean sprouts, which he keeps stashed in his desk on a damp paper towel, though he admits that \\"they smell like death\\". In \\"Casino Night,\\" Creed steals poker chips to win the evening's prize, a mini-fridge from Vance Refrigeration. He states that he has never owned a refrigerator before. In a talking head interview, Creed gleefully says \\"I love stealing.\\"In the episode \\"Performance Review\\" Michael tells him he stinks by implying \\"what I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs.\\" =Seasons 3‚Äì4= In \\"Gay Witch Hunt,\\" Creed explains that he has no problem with homosexuality because he made love to many women during the 1960s, \\"often outdoors, in the mud and rain\\" and that \\"it's possible a man slipped in; there would be no way of knowing.\\" In ‚ÄúThe Convention,‚Äù after Meredith claims Philadelphia smells like cheesesteaks, prompting Angela to storm out with a snarky remark, Creed sits down with Meredith and says, ‚ÄúAndrea's the, uh, office bitch, you'll get used to her‚Äù and proceeds to extend his hand and state his name in a cheerful tone as if they had never met, despite them both being on the show since season one. In \\"The Coup,\\" when Pam, at Kelly's insistence, wears a slightly more revealing shirt than is usual, Creed comes to her desk and stares at her for an awkwardly long time. When she asks him what he wants, he says that he is \\"just looking.\\" When she asks him to go away, he says \\"in a minute.\\" In \\"Diwali,\\" he immediately recognizes a sexual position in the Kama Sutra by name (\\"The Union of the Monkey\\"). In \\"The Convict\\", Karen Filippelli is seen playing with Hannah Smoterich-Barr's baby. Creed approaches her and dangles a chain of paper clips in front of the infant. When Karen tells Creed that paper clips should not be given to babies due to swallowing, Creed replies with \\"it's okay, I've got tons of them.\\" In \\"The Merger,\\" he expands on his love of stealing by selling $1,200 worth of office equipment when he thinks his branch is closing. When Hannah Smoterich-Barr exposes her breast to put milk in a baby bottle, he takes a picture of it and puts it on the computer. When confronted about the picture, he states he was \\"at the right place at the right time.\\" In a deleted scene in \\"The Convict,\\" he tells of a wine that he made while in prison in the toilets and then says, \\"God, I miss that stuff\\". In \\"A Benihana Christmas,\\" he joins Karen and Pam's party and performs a real song of his, \\"Spinnin' N Reelin'\\". In \\"The Return,\\" Creed's memory problems are revealed when he confuses the death of Ed Truck with the departure of Dwight Schrute from Dunder Mifflin. (This confusion also suggests Creed could have misinformed Michael about the circumstances of Ed Truck's death in the earlier episode \\"Grief Counseling.\\") He does seem to remember some facts, such as the funeral for the bird in the parking lot. In \\"Business School\\", he attempts to exterminate a bat that has entered the office using a can of pesticide. When Kelly tells him not to, out of sympathy for the bat, Creed informs her that \\"animals can't feel pain\\" (once Kelly actually encounters the bat, she shrieks \\"Kill it! Kill it!\\"). Creed also readily enters into \\"an alliance\\" with Dwight to, if necessary, take violent action against Jim‚ÄîDwight fears Jim was bitten by the bat and may turn into a vampire, or perhaps merely carries the \\"vampiric germ\\". Without hesitation, Creed fashions a stake, using tools he has readily available in his desk.https://www.nbc.com/the- office/video/business-school/3842647 In \\"Cocktails,\\" Creed is greeted warmly by a group of teenagers entering Poor Richard's Pub. He reveals to the camera that he runs a fake ID business out of the trunk of his car with a laminator that he stole from the sheriff's department. In \\"The Negotiation\\", Creed creates an extreme tale of Roy's attack of Jim, falsely claiming that \\"Halpert\\" had stolen Roy's car. He also said that Roy came in \\"very late at night\\" with a sock filled with nickels and that \\"Cheroot\\" defended himself with a can of hairspray and a lighter. When he tells this version of events, Angela denounces him as \\"useless\\", and Creed immediately returns to his crossword puzzle. In \\"Product Recall\\", his negligence leads to the paper being sent out with an obscene watermark. Every week he is supposed to do a four- hour quality spot check at the paper mill, and he is indignant that the watermark problem happened during the one year that he skipped out on those duties. He then does everything he can to keep his job and survive, like \\"I did when I was a homeless man\\". Creed engineers the transfer of blame from himself to a paper mill manager, for whom he procures a card and farewell money collected from all the workers; on his way out, he pockets the money and tosses the card. In a deleted scene, after a newspaper reporter recognizes him and claims to have written his obituary‚Äîand he thanks the man for such a complimentary portrait‚Äîit was revealed that Creed faked his own death 10 years ago \\"for tax reasons\\", and admits that he draws benefits as his own widow. In \\"Women's Appreciation\\", Creed is shown using the women's bathroom. He says that he is a \\"pretty normal guy\\", who does one weird thing. \\"I go to the woman's bathroom to do number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.\\" In the same episode, Phyllis recounts her run-in with a flasher to which Creed responds with \\"The guy was just hanging brain; what's all the fuss?\\" He later tells the camera, \\"If that's flashing, then lock me up.\\" In \\"Beach Games\\", Creed is seen catching a fish with his bare hands, and then shows up later to a hot dog eating contest holding a fish skeleton and says, \\"Nobody told me we were having hot dogs!\\" In \\"The Job\\", Creed blogs about Pam's speech at the beach in his \\"blog,\\" which is actually a Word document that Ryan, unwilling to expose an unprepared human race to the innermost workings of Creed's brain, opens up on his computer. Ryan describes the things Creed writes about as shocking, \\"even for the Internet.\\" In a deleted scene, Creed is seen counterfeiting Dwight's motivational \\"Schrute Bucks\\" and takes several 50-pound boxes of them to Dwight demanding payment. After Dwight uses an invisible ink marker to determine that they are fakes Creed tells him \\"Listen, Schrutey\\" and threatens to flood the market with the fake Schrute bucks to render them worthless.Season 3 In a preview for Season 4, Creed states that \\"it turns out\\" he has grandchildren and children, presumably from his many relationships in the 1960s (\\"The Office Summer Vacation\\" NBC promotional video). In another video on NBC.com, he states that \\"some kid he sold weed to got a job in Corporate\\" (implying Ryan). In \\"Fun Run\\", Creed states that he has been a member of many religious cults, both as a leader and follower. He prefers to be a follower but gets paid more for being a leader. He also displays an extensive knowledge of painkillers when he questions Meredith on what kinds of medication she has been administered for her pelvic fracture. In a deleted scene, he swallows all of Meredith's painkillers and leaves none for an incredulous Meredith to take. In \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\", Creed dyes his hair black with printer ink, drinks Red Bull, try to use slang terms (such as \\"cool beans\\" which has turned into a very popular T-shirt slogan), and refers to himself as being just under 30 to escape Ryan's supposedly imminent weeding out of older workers. In \\"Chair Model\\", he is anxious for Michael to get a new chair, as Pam gets Michael's old chair and he gets Pam's. Then, Creed will have two chairs and will have \\"only one to go.\\" He stated that he transfers his debt to another identity named \\"William Charles Schneider\\", which is the actor's birth name. It is furthermore suggested that \\"Creed Bratton\\" is not his real name, either.Creed Thoughts #35 In \\"Job Fair\\", Creed referred to Angela as \\"pumpkin\\", indicating that he had forgotten her name completely, as opposed to botching it by calling her \\"Andrea\\". In \\"Did I Stutter?\\", as Dwight is showing Michael a flow chart of workers in the office, the name \\"Creed Bratton\\" is seen in quotation marks, indicating that the office does not think that his real name is Creed Bratton. In \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", it is revealed that Creed does not remember his position at the company: when asked by Holly Flax about his occupation, Creed is struck clueless by her inquiry, and abruptly excuses himself to avoid answering the question. In the following interview, he attempts to recall the name of his occupation, coming to the words, \\"quabitty assuance\\". While he acknowledges that this is not the name, he believes that he is \\"getting close\\" (Creed works as a Quality Assurance Rep. for Dunder Mifflin). In a deleted scene, Creed says fondly that he gave the departing Toby the number of his friend Jorge in Costa Rica, who will hook Toby up with various items including \\"this amazing coffee that you snort\\".Season 4 =Seasons 5‚Äì6= In \\"Weight Loss\\", Kelly says that Creed sold her a \\"tapeworm\\" which would eat all her food and help her lose more weight. Creed then replied, \\"that wasn't a tapeworm.\\" In \\"Crime Aid\\", Creed strongly implies that he at some point assumed the identity of \\"Creed Bratton\\" from a man who \\"disappeared\\" after stealing from him. In the cold opening of \\"Employee Transfer\\", Creed dresses as The Joker from The Dark Knight, along with quoting the performance by Heath Ledger. Creed's costume choice upsets Kevin, who wears the same costume. It is soon revealed that Dwight is also wearing the same costume. In \\"Frame Toby\\", Creed shows concern when two policemen show up at the office looking for narcotics. Michael and Dwight had actually called the cops in an attempt to frame Toby Flenderson for the possession of these narcotics. Creed is then shown in a talking head interview telling the camera crew to pretend that they are talking until the cops leave. In \\"Moroccan Christmas\\", Creed is shown enjoying a hookah. He also states that he could get a permit for ventilation in less than an hour, implying that he has connections with many people for various illegal activities. In \\"Lecture Circuit\\", Creed mentions to Andy he had a relationship with \\"Squeaky\\" Fromme. During the same exchange he mistakenly refers to Andy as \\"Jim\\". Also, when Jim approaches Creed for a $3 donation for Kelly's birthday party, Creed hands Jim a $3 bill with George W. Bush's face on it. In \\"Blood Drive\\", while Michael complains of the low number of people, he says \\"and Creed signed up twice\\". Creed later says that it is to receive the blood. Later in the episode, Creed steals blood packets from the Blood Drive Truck. In \\"Golden Ticket\\", he and Jim openly praise Dwight for the success of the golden ticket idea, which was actually Michael's. Like the rest of the staff, Creed is aware that it was Michael's idea and jokingly gives Dwight the credit by saying \\"Good job kid\\" in which Dwight responds \\"Thanks old man\\". In \\"Casual Friday\\", Creed spends the day playing board games with Jim. While playing chess, Creed offers to set Jim up with his daughter. Jim replies that he is engaged to Pam. Surprised, Creed states that he thought Jim was gay. When Jim asks why Creed would try to set him up with his daughter if he were gay, Creed looks confused and mutters that he doesn't know why.Season 5 In \\"Gossip\\", Michael starts rumors about everyone in the office and says Creed has asthma. Creed becomes upset over this because it would prevent him from scuba diving. In \\"The Promotion\\", a very brief conversation between Creed and Meredith implies that they had sex once, but Creed didn't remember.Season 6 In a deleted scene in \\"Niagara\\", Creed tells Meredith that the restaurant where they are dining used to be the base of operations for his cigarette smuggling operation. Later, he goes to a booth and pulls the cushion out. From under the cushion, he digs out an old, dusty cigarette carton. In The Lover, when Jim plays the opera \\"Martha\\" at high volume while talking to Andy to keep Dwight from hearing due to the walkie-talkie he planted in Jim's office, while the rest of the office is confused, Creed can be seen becoming emotional. In \\"Double Date\\", when Pam tries to avoid the lunch with Michael and his Mom by faking to have lost a load of paper, Creed appears worried. When Jim announces that everything is fine, Creed says that \\"Something is up\\" and \\"That load was never supposed to arrive\\" In \\"Murder\\", Creed shows up late to work and steps in during the middle of the office's murder mystery game. When Michael tells him that they have discovered a murder and he is a suspect, Creed steps out under the guise of settling at his desk but is caught by the camera running back to his car and fleeing the parking lot (this is possibly an allusion to the disappearance of the \\"other\\" Creed Bratton as mentioned in \\"Crime Aid\\"). In \\"Scott's Tots\\", Creed joins the rest of the office in voicing his displeasure at the fact that Jim unknowingly named himself an employee of the month and then followed up by naming Pam, his wife, as an employee of the month, as she was next on the list. After this, Creed suggests to the rest of the office that he believes Pam isn't even pregnant. In \\"Sabre\\" after Michael opens up the box of items intended for the representative from Sabre, Creed is given a power cord to a printer which he happily accepts. When Michael and Dwight are informed of their mistake by Erin, the staff tries to fit everything back into the box. When Pam and Oscar are discussing the different angles to place the items in, Creed asks them \\"Have you tried making everything smaller?\\". In a deleted scene from \\"Happy Hour\\", Creed goes up to Oscar and an unknown woman and asks them to buy him a drink which they both declined. In a deleted scene from \\"New Leads\\", Creed asks Andy for $10,000, but Andy declines, and offers something else. Creed asks for Andy's hairpiece and $500, which Andy also declines. In \\"The Cover-Up\\", while Andy believes there is a conspiracy relating to faulty printers going on at Sabre, Creed mysteriously walks by him and slices his hand across his throat. Creed later explains that Darryl, who he calls \\"Darnell\\", paid him three dollars to walk by Andy and make that motion (Darryl had been attempting to scare Andy into thinking there was a conspiracy). Creed calls \\"Darnell\\" a \\"Chump\\", claiming he would have done it for anything of value, and that he has done \\"a lot more for a lot less\\". In \\"The Chump\\", Creed says his favorite James McAvoy movie is \\"Wanted\\". In \\"Whistleblower\\", when Gabe is interviewing everyone to try and conclude who leaked to the press that Sabre's printers catch on fire, Creed exits his interview with him, remarking that he's \\"very relieved\\" to \\"learn\\" it wasn't Gabe. Later, when the staff is arguing about the identity of the whistleblower, Creed states that he thinks they can all agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. He flips a coin, and then says it's Angela, before commanding \\"Get her, boys\\". =Seasons 7‚Äì8= In the season premiere \\"Nepotism\\", Creed participates with his co-workers by playing a Fender when they perform a lip dub to \\"Nobody but Me\\", with the intention of placing the video on the Internet. When the staff finds out that the terrible new office assistant Luke is Michael's nephew, Creed says in a talking-head interview \\"I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front-row seat\\". Creed also indicates he follows Luke on the social-networking website Twitter specifically because Luke does not write about the actress Betty White, who was particularly popular at the time. In \\"Counseling\\", when Creed hears that Dwight has decided to boycott the Steamtown Mall because a shop owner refused to serve him, Creed gets riled up and suggests that they \\"start their own mall\\", to which Erin eagerly agrees. In a deleted scene, when Dwight dresses up fancily to Pretty Woman the Mall, Creed gives him a pipe and tells him to take good care of it, since it belonged to a museum. Creed attends a local production of Sweeney Todd (which Andy is performing in), in \\"Andy's Play\\". During intermission, he is seen talking on his cellphone, saying \\"Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.\\" After the play, when Michael is confronted by the actor who played Sweeney Todd (whom Michael previously booed), Creed whispers to Michael \\"be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people\\", and then tells the actor he was good before walking off. In \\"Sex Ed\\", when Andy makes a Pros and Cons list of Sex, Creed suggests \\"the feeling of pure risk\\", implying he has had some affairs, or that he doesn't use condoms during sex, the risk being potential STIs with no protection with multiple partners, or pregnancy. In \\"The Sting\\", when Andy starts a band, he writes an anti-war song from the perspective of a little girl (Andy sings in falsetto). Andy tries to defend his song from the rest of the office when it is poorly received, but only when Creed says that he likes it does Andy know it is truly terrible. In \\"Costume Contest\\", Creed dresses up as a mummy but loses the contest to Oscar, who he believed was dressed as Edward James Olmos (though he actually wore no costume and said he was actually dressed as a \\"rational consumer\\", causing a plurality of people to vote for him thinking he could never win). In \\"Christening\\", Creed attends the christening of Jim and Pam's baby, Cece, and he and Darryl fall asleep next to each other. In \\"Viewing Party\\", Creed attends Gabe's \\"Glee\\" viewing party. When Andy becomes intoxicated with a Chinese virility supplement, he brings the bottle to Creed and asks if he can read Chinese. Creed responds that he can read it better than English, but when he reads it out aloud he speaks only in Chinese (without providing the English translation). In \\"WUPHF.com\\", Creed tells Jim that he hears he's \\"looking for work\\" (Jim maxed out his commission cap and thus has no motivation to sell). Creed then asks him how far he can stretch his \\"lovely long arms\\". When Jim demonstrates how far he can reach out, Creed decides it isn't far enough, but then asks him how long he can hold his \\"pretty little breath\\". Creed decides he can hold it long enough, but Gabe interferes. At the end of the episode, Michael says \\"the world sends people your way\\", then explains where Andy and Ryan came from and says he has no idea where Creed came from. In \\"China\\", Creed understands the word \\"Parley\\" as Pirate Code but laments that he only understands it and can't speak it. In \\"Classy Christmas\\", Creed refers to Holly Flax as \\"one sassy black lady\\", giving us yet another example of how he tends to misidentify people. Angela also gives him a pack of deodorant as his present, which he is grateful for. Later, when Darryl's daughter Jada is handing out bags of chips she purchased from the vending machines out to the staff, Creed takes a different bag from her than the one she tried to give to him. In \\"Ultimatum\\" Creed's New Year's resolution is he wants to be able to do a 'perfect' cartwheel. He swears at a confused Erin when she does his resolution. In the end of the episode, Michael is trying to help Creed learn how to do a cartwheel, which he performs (poorly). Michael congratulates an elated Creed (who states that the cartwheel was \\"all I had to do all year\\"), though Creed obliviously ignores Michael's handshake. In \\"The Seminar\\", Creed is a speaker at Andy's seminar on starting a small business. Creed however, goes into a speech about the Loch Ness Monster. In \\"The Search\\", Creed's picture is seen twice on the wall of a Chinese restaurant with others who have dined there without paying, once with his normal hair color and once with his hair dyed like it was in \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\". In \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", Creed's contribution to the office workers' version of Seasons of Love is \\"I watch you (referring to Michael) when you sleep.\\" In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Creed is seen once again using the women's restroom and is angry at Gabe for barging in (when he is trying to make his case to Erin). Creed says \\"not cool, man\\" after seeing Gabe barge in. Erin does not seem bothered seeing Creed in the woman's room and even says Hi to him, implying that at least she has gotten used to Creed's use of the bathroom. At the end of the episode, when Michael is taking his last look at the Dunder Mifflin staff, Creed lifts up Michael's \\"World's Best Boss\\" coffee mug (which Michael had thrown out earlier in the episode) and says \\"See ya tomorrow, boss,\\" making him the last person to talk to him in the actual office (Pam says goodbye to Michael at the airport, shortly before he takes off.) In \\"The Inner Circle\\", Creed watches Deangelo's mime juggling act in amazement. In a deleted scene of \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\", Creed confirms to the camera that there is a real possibility he will murder Oscar. In the end of the episode, he's promoted to acting manager of the office after Jo requests that the position be filled by the employee that has worked there the longest. In \\"Search Committee\\", Creed's antics as an acting manager are revealed. He has a team-building meeting despite not calling for one (with dismal attendance from the office), makes an acronym chart up as he goes along, and starts calling a number of Dunder- Mifflin's clients (actually Pam disguising her voice), informing clients of various derogatory things about the company. When Creed actually does get through to a client, to distract him Pam quickly gives him two identical pictures and informs him that corporate has asked that he find at least seven differences between them (to which Creed immediately replies \\"I can see three already.\\") In \\"The List\\", he is on the \\"Losers\\" side of new CEO Robert California's list (on which he is listed as \\"old man\\"). Creed is also seen \\"planking\\" in the episode. In \\"Lotto\\", Creed says that by being born in the United States, he has already \\"won the lottery\\". But, he says as a backup he has a Swiss passport. It is revealed in the season 8 episode, \\"Spooked\\", that one of Creed's biggest fears is snakes. In \\"Mrs. California\\", it is implied that Creed may have been a member of a suicide cult. This is perhaps a reference to the Creedish Death Cult, a fictional religious organization in Chuck Palahniuk's novel \\"Survivor\\". He is also found by Jim on the roof of the Dunder Mifflin office building calmly flying a remote control helicopter, as though doing so in the middle of the workday was a perfectly normal, ordinary event. He also asks Jim about his \\"friend,\\" even though there's no one else but Jim present. =Season 9= In the Halloween episode \\"Here Comes Treble\\", Creed has bloodstains all over his face and shirt. However, when Pete, not in costume, states he did not know everyone \\"dresses up every year\\" in Scranton, Creed says \\"me neither\\". In an interview, Creed states \\"It's Halloween! That is really, really good timing\\". In \\"Work Bus\\", Creed boards the bus not knowing that inside are his coworkers, to his apparent horror. In \\"Finale\\", Dwight reveals in a talking head that after the airing of the documentary, Creed attempted to disappear by faking his own death after the police learned of his past as a member of The Grass Roots and sought him in connection with dealing drugs, trafficking endangered animal meats, and stealing LSD from the military in his time with the band. He is discovered by the other members of Dunder Mifflin living in Ryan's old closet in the office after the warehouse party, at which point he plays one last song to his co-workers before being led away by the police.

Plot The film explores the tension between two Spokane men who grew up together on the Spokane Reservation in eastern Washington state: Seymour Polatkin (Evan Adams) and Aristotle (Gene Tagaban). Seymour's internal conflict between his Indian heritage and his life as an urban gay man with a white boyfriend plays out in multiple cultures and relationships over his college and early adult years. His literary success as a famed American Indian poet, resulting in accolades from non-Indians, contrasts with a lack of approval from those he grew up with back on the reservation. The protagonist struggles with discomfort and alienation in both worlds. Seymour returns to the reservation for the funeral of his friend Mouse (Swil Kanim), a violinist, and Seymour's internal conflict becomes external as his childhood friends and relatives on the reservation question his motivation for writing Indian-themed poems and selling them to the mainstream public. The film examines several issues that contemporary American Indians face, including cultural assimilation (both on the reservation and in urban areas), difficult stereotypes, and substance abuse. Cast * Evan Adams as Seymour Polatkin * Michelle St. John as Agnes Roth * Gene Tagaban as Aristotle Joseph * Swil Kanim as Mouse * Rebecca Carroll as The Interviewer * Cynthia Geary as Teresa * Leo Rossi as Mr. Williams * Kevin Phillip as Steven * Elaine Miles as Kim * Arthur Tulee as Junior One * Jim Boyd as Junior Two * Jennifer Elizabeth Kreisberg (billed as Jennifer Kreisberg) as Salmon Girl * Ron Otis as White Motorist * William Joseph Elk III as Tavern Father Notes There is also a book with the title The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems (1992) which was well received, selling over 10,000 copies. In the DVD commentary, Alexie refers to Michelle St. John's character, 'Agnes Roth', a mixed-race (Spokane/Jewish) woman who moves to the reservation to teach in the school, as \\"the moral center of the film\\". Agnes is also an ex-lover of Polatkin's, with the two of them still maintaining a deep friendship. The film's incidental music was composed by Mohican composer Brent Michael Davids. The violin solos were composed and performed by Swil Kanim, and a number of the actors sing. The film also features Alexie's poetry, and the author's mother served as a language consultant. The film was made in an experimental and largely non- hierarchical manner, with a predominantly female crew; many scenes were improvised, with biographical details from the lives of the actors as well as the writer/director. This is discussed in detail on the DVD commentary and the behind the scenes documentary included in the DVD release, where Alexie comments that he wanted to make a film that not only discussed his politics, but put them into practice in the making of the film.

He earned his PhD in geology at McGill University in Montreal in 1926. He completed his earliest publication, \\"Galena Hill, Mayo District, Yukon\\", in 1925 as a graduate student. In 1927, Stockwell's paper on \\"The X-ray Study of the Garnet Group\\", earned him recognition, as it was an important step in the understanding of the crystal structure of these minerals. In 1933, he received acclaim for his work on \\"The Genesis of Pegmatites of Southwest Manitoba\\". Some of his other noteworthy papers include; \\"The Chromite Deposits of the Eastern Townships, Quebec,\\" \\"The Gold Deposits of Herb Lake Area\\", and \\"The Rice Lake-Gold Lake Area\\", in Manitoba. Dr. Stockwell was also an explorer. In July/August 1932, he canoed through the unexplored region north of Great Slave Lake. This work delineated the basic features and problems of the geology of this large part of the Precambrian Shield, and laid the foundation for the many studies that followed. He devoted much of his time working for the Geological Survey of Canada. In the 1950s he concentrated on Structural Geology- the structural controls of mineral deposits. During World War 1, he trained to be a pilot with the Royal Flying Corps but by the time he qualified as a pilot, hostilities were over. He was married to A. Elizabeth Johnston (1909‚Äì1964), a talented amateur oilpainter. He is buried with his wife in Pinecrest Cemetery, Ottawa.

He was a shepherd, in common with his four brothers. However, his humble occupation did not work against him: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David had also been shepherds. Athronges led the rebellion against Archelaus and the Romans.Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 17.278-284 After a protracted struggle Athronges and his brothers were defeated.(JA 17.10.7)  History  Josephus wrote of him: > \\"Athronges, a person neither eminent by the dignity of his progenitors, nor > for any great wealth he possessed.

In French la manche means \\"the sleeve\\". The area is named for the shape of the harbour, which is long and narrow with high sides. This harbour was probably first used by the French because of its seclusion which offered cover between raids on Ferryland and St. John's.La Manche Provincial Park, Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador La Manche History The community was first settled in the 1840s, apparently by a George Melvin. There was a small Roman Catholic church and a school located in the community, as well as a suspension bridge which crossed the inlet. At the time of Confederation in 1949, La Manche had a population of 54; by 1961, following the closure of the school, this had fallen to 25. La Manche was abandoned after a winter storm on 28 January 1966 which demolished the community's network of wharves and stages and collapsed the suspension bridge. La Manche Provincial Park The remains of the community are now incorporated within the boundaries of La Manche Provincial Park. In 1999, the East Coast Trail Association rebuilt the suspension bridge across La Manche inlet, connecting the park trail system to the East Coast Trail.

Each local Citizen Corps Council partners with organizations, volunteers and businesses to organize responders, volunteers and professional first responders for an efficient response so efforts are not wasted by being duplicated. By training in Incident Command, volunteers know whom to report to and how the incident is organized. This prevents sites from being inundated by untrained and unprepared personell preventing operation. Citizen Corps also works in conjunction with the Corporation for National and Community Service in promoting national service opportunities for promoting homeland security needs. In January 2002, President George W. Bush launched the USA Freedom Corps to promote volunteer service opportunities within the United States and abroad. Created within months of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the program sought in part to encourage volunteer participation in homeland security. The Citizen Corps, a component of USA Freedom Corps, was developed to help coordinate such volunteer activities and to increase the capacity of American communities to respond to any emergency. The program's goal is to provide opportunities for people to participate in a range of measures to make their families, their homes, and their communities safer from the threats of crime, terrorism, and other disasters. Citizen Corps encourages citizens to engage in a number of activities to help prepare themselves and their communities: *Personal Preparedness: Developing a household preparedness plan and disaster supplies kits, observing home health and safety practices, implementing disaster mitigation measures, and participating in crime prevention and reporting. *Training: Taking classes in emergency preparedness, response capabilities, first aid, CPR, fire suppression, and search and rescue procedures. *Volunteer Service: Engaging individuals in volunteer activities that support first responders, disaster relief groups, and community safety organizations. The program is coordinated nationally by the Department of Homeland Security. In this capacity, the Department of Homeland Security works closely with other federal entities, state and local governments, first responders and emergency managers, the volunteer community, and the White House Office of the USA Freedom Corps. In many counties and cities, the local emergency sheltering programs along with pet co-sheltering (Animal Response Teams) are trained and organized by Citizen Corps. Some emergency sheltering programs work with local Red Cross districts, along with various NGOs (Non- Governmental Organizations, such as community centers and Faith-based groups such as Churches). By coordinating emergency sheltering programs at local Emergency Management Offices or EOCs (Emergency Operations Centers), efforts are efficient and save everyone money and time.  Citizen Corps Councils  The Department of Homeland Security coordinates the overall effort of helping communities establish local Citizen Corps Councils and programs. The memberships of these councils may include emergency managers and first responders; volunteer community service, and faith- and community-based organizations; schools, hospitals, private businesses, neighborhoods, and individual citizens. Citizen Corps Councils exist at the national, state, territorial, local, and tribal levels of government. Citizen Corps Councils build on the successful efforts that are in place in many communities around the country to prevent crime and respond to emergencies. Programs that started through local innovation are the foundation for Citizen Corps and this national approach to citizen participation in community safety. The responsibilities of the Citizen Corps Councils are as follows: *Educate the public on safety, help citizens take an active role in protecting themselves from harm, and teach citizens what to do in the event of a crisis. *Spearhead efforts to offer citizens new and existing volunteer opportunities, educational information, and training courses to address crime, terrorism, and natural disaster risks. *Promote all Citizen Corps programs and activities across the community. *Capture innovative practices and report accomplishments that can be replicated in other communities nationwide. *Survey the community to assess increased awareness and Citizen Corps participation.

The faded \\"Gulistan\\" name can be seen in the center. A. & M. Karagheusian, Inc. was a rug manufacturer headquartered at 295 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Manufacturing was located in Freehold Borough, New Jersey and operated for 60 years before closing in 1964. It employed 1,700 people at its peak operation in the 1930s. Bruce Springsteen wrote about the Karagheusian Rug Mill‚Äôs closing in his 1984 song \\"My Hometown\\". History Arshag Karagheusian (1872-1963) and Miran Karagheusian (1874-1948), were Armenians and fled Turkey in 1896 to go to England and then to the United States. The family had been in the rug trade in Turkey since 1818, and they began in the United States in 1897 as rug importers, and then expanded into manufacturing in 1903. By 1927 they had 15 broadlooms, weighing 15 tons each, and 196 single looms. They developed, and were the only manufacturers of \\"Gulistan Rug\\" carpets. They made the carpet for Radio City Music Hall in 1932 and for the United States Supreme Court building in 1933. They stopped manufacturing oriental carpets in 1953. Miran Karagheusian Miran Karagheusian (1874‚Äì1948) married Zabelle and had: Howard Karagheusian who died young, and a scholarship was set up in his name; and a daughter, Leila Karagheusian (c1910-1999). Miran Karagheusian died on October 7, 1948, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, he lived in Oyster Bay, New York and he had attended Robert College in Turkey. Arshag Karagheusian Arshag Karagheusian (1872‚Äì1963) had the following children: Jean Karagheusian Hallaure (1898‚Äì2000) aka Alice Hallaure; Charles Karagheusian (1903‚Äì1977) who married Artemis Tavshanjian (1904‚Äì1990) on April 30, 1927, and Marguerite Karagheusian Agathon (husband Oshin Agathon) (1904‚Äì1986). Arshag served as the head of the Armenian General Benevolent Union from 1943 to 1952. Arshag died on September 24, 1963, in Larchmont, New York.

Seven Dials is a district surrounding a major road junction of the same name in Brighton, in the city of Brighton and Hove. It is located on high ground just northwest of Brighton railway station, south of the Prestonville area, and approximately ¬æ mile north of the seafront. The name refers to the seven roads which radiate outwards from the roundabout-controlled junction, and is derived from a seven-way junction in London featuring a monument with six sundials. The roundabout itself, constructed in 1925 is notable as an early example of this type of road junction in the UK, and preceded the installation of semaphore signals in Brighton in 1927. Location In central Brighton, where seven roads meet; clockwise from the north, these are: *Prestonville Road *Chatham Place, (B2122) leading to New England Road and Preston Circus - another major road junction *Buckingham Place, (A2010) leading to the railway station by way of a sharply curving downhill slope *Dyke Road,(A2121) one of the city's main roads - leading to the city centre *Vernon Terrace,(B2122) leading to Montpelier Road and the seafront *Goldsmid Road,(sic) (B2020) leading into Davigdor Road and Cromwell Road into Hove *The northward continuation of Dyke Road, (A2010) leading eventually to the Devil's Dyke beauty spot on the South Downs Development The area began to be developed with a mixture of terraced houses and more substantial Victorian villas shortly after the London and Brighton Railway opened sections of its lines in the area. The route westwards to Shoreham-by-Sea (opened in 1840) ran through the area, while the Brighton Main Line (1841) and the throat of Brighton station lie on the eastern edge. A 2013 revamp of the junction is intended to improve its appearance, make it safer for cyclists, and easier for pedestrians. There was some disagreement during the public consultation phase beforehand. A campaign to prevent the removal of an elm tree from the top of Vernon Terrace ‚Äì with protesters camping in the tree ‚Äî was successful, with works being changed to keep it.

Born in Meg√®ve, he was a dominant racer in the late 1930s and is considered to have been the first great French alpine skier. Allais won the bronze medal in the combined (downhill and slalom), the only alpine medal event at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch, Germany. These Olympics were the first to award medals in alpine skiing. The previous year, he had won the silver medal in the downhill and combined at the 1935 world championships. In 1937 he was a triple world champion at Chamonix, France, winning all three events (downhill, slalom, and combined). The following year at Engelberg, Switzerland, he won the combined, and took silver in the downhill and slalom. He created the √âcole Fran√ßaise de Ski which taught innovative methods of Anton Seelos (who was his trainer and instructor), characterised by parallel turns, controlling the speed by sideslipping, and turning by ruade (French: kick, back kick), i.e. kicking the backs of the skis up and pivoting on the tips while rotating the body in the direction of the turn. It is now the biggest Ski school in the world in terms of numbers of ski teachers, and is present in every single French ski resort, and even abroad. After a spell in North and South America (Squaw Valley, California and Portillo, Chile) Allais held the post of technical director at Courchevel from 1954 to 1964, where he introduced many ideas from the U.S. regarding slope preparation and piste security. He later worked as a technical consultant for other resorts, notably La Plagne and Flaine. One of the Saulire couloirs at Courchevel is named after Allais. As a consultant to Skis Rossignol, Allais helped to design the laminated-wood Olympic 41 ski (1941), and the first aluminum skis to win major ski races, the M√©tallais (1959) and Allais 60 (1960). The Olympic 41 later served as the basis of Rossignol's very successful Strato (1964). In December 2005, 93-year-old Allais made the trip to the French Senate in Paris where he was honoured, along with a number of other ski instructors. His life has been all about skiing; he learned his skiing early, raced all over Europe, then coached the French Olympic ski team for seven years. Allais fought in World War II on skis, and even courted his wife at a ski meet.Full biography of √âmile Allais, in English, in Skiing Heritage, Sept 2003\\"Allais, aged 94, skis on\\" from The Age, February 18, 2006 He turned 100 in February 2012.
